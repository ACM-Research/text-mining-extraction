## Data



## Methods

### Flesch Reading Ease
This script processes a directory of .txt files and uses the textstat library to calculate the Flesch Reading Ease score for each document. A separate script processes .csv files of the scores and generates a box plot. The other libraries and datasets used can be seen in the readme in the scripts subfolder.
### Topic Modelling
This script finds common and context relevant words and groups them into clusters to find topics within texts. A Latent Dirichlet Model (LDA) is used to map the words into the clusters. Output files include comparisons by gender, military affiliation, and impact of religion on text.
### N-Grams
This script finds recurring bi-grams (two word combinations) and tri-grams (three word combinations) within the text to find common ideas within the texts. The program keeps tally of the bi-grams and tri-grams then returns the most common and relevant ones.
### Sentiment Analysis
These scripts calculate the Polarity (Positive/Neutral/Negative attitude) and Subjectivity (Emotional-Factual content) within a text. The program calculates both scores and keeps track in a csv file. Graphs included are across demographics.
