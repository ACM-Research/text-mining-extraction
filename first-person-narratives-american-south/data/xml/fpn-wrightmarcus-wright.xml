Wright was born in Purdy, McNair county, Tenn., in 1831. He was the son of
Capt. Benjamin Wright of the 39 Regular Infantry who served in the War of 
1812 and the Mexican
War, and grandson of Capt. John Wright of the Georgia Line, 
Continental Army. He practiced law
and entered the Confederate Army in May, 1861, as lieutenant-colonel of the 154 
Senior Regiment of
Tennessee Infantry; Promoted brigadier-general Dec. 20th, 1862. 
He was present at many battles of
the Army of Tennessee and was wounded at Shiloh. He was a member of the Southern Historical
Assn. Southern Historical Society, Washington, D. C., Historical Society, 
and Alabama Historical
Society. He was author of <emph rend="bold">Life of General Winfield Scott</emph> 
in the Great Commander Series, <emph rend="bold">Life of
Governor William Blount</emph>; co-author with Gen. A. L. Long of <emph rend="bold">Life 
of Robert E. Lee</emph>. He wrote many
other works of an historical character and contributed extensively to various 
encyclopedias and
magazines. On July 1, 1878 be was appointed Agent for the Collection of Confederate 
Records for
the War Department and served in this capacity until the Civil War Records 
were published by the
Government. In the General Index volume of these records Secretary of War. 
Elihu Root, says:
<lb/>
“In view of the distrust with which the Southern people for a while naturally regarded
the movements made by the government with a view to the procurement of the records of the
Confederacy, it is not surprising that the efforts of the Department to complete its
Confederate files met at first with slight success or assistance. However, Marcus J. Wright.
formerly a brigadier-general in the Confederate army, was appointed July 1, 1878, Agent for
the Collection of Confederate Records and in this capacity he continued employed until the
completion of the work. Through his efforts and tact the attitude of the Southern people
towards the compilation became more cordial and as their confidence increased records were
brought out from their places of concealment and forwarded to the Department as gifts or
deposited as loans.” Mr. Root quotes Secretary of War Proctor: “Gen. 
Marcus J. Wright,
formerly of the Confederate army, has been continued as Agent for the Collection of
Confederate Records and his position in the work is next in importance to a position upon
the Board itself.” In <emph rend="bold">The American Civil War</emph>,
 James K. Hosmer, N. Y., 1913, II. 315, the
author says: “The collection (referring to Civil War records) thus 
preserved was greatly
increased by the efforts of Gen. Marcus J. Wright, C. S. A., who, now in the 
service of the
United States, spent years in an indefatigable search among the survivors of 
the “lost cause”
for papers that might be of value,”
<lb/>
Gen. Wright died in Washington, D. C., on Dec, 27, 1922.</p></note>

U. S. Congress. While suffering from the effect of his wound received at Belmont he was elected to
the Confederate Congress where he remained until the close of the war. An interesting incident
occurred at Belmont. As the regiment of Col. M. J. Wright advanced against the Federals it came in
sight of a Federal log hospital in front of which were two mounted Federal officers. At this moment
two other Federal officers ran from the hospital to a corn field, jumped the fence and disappeared in the woods. They were well within range of Wright's men, a number of whom cocked their muskets
and prepared to fire; but Col. Wright stopped them as at this early stage of the war individuals were
not as a rule fired upon by troops in formation. On the day after the battle Gen. Cheatham met Col.
Hatch of Gen. Grant's staff under a flag of truce and Col. Hatch said that the fleeing officers were
Gen. Grant and himself. A few days later Gen. Cheatham met Gen. Grant on a flag-of-truce boat and
Grant confirmed the statement made by Hatch; (A. L. Conger, <emph rend="bold">The Rise of U. S. Grant</emph>, N. Y., 1931,
109: cf. <emph rend="bold">Southern Historical Society Papers No. 16</emph>, 82). While the Federals were driven aboard
their gun-boats at Belmont, the Confederate attack was led by Lt. Col. Marcus J. Wright (cf. report of Col. Preston Smith in Civil War Records, Series 1. vol. III. 346).</p></note>

first Martha Spencer Elcan of Memphis, Tenn. His second wife was Pauline Womack, daughter of
Judge John W. Womack of Eutaw, Ala. Some interesting notes on the Wright-Harwell-Elcan-Crump
