        <head>PREFACE.</head>
        <div2 type="excerpt">
          <p>A celebrated author thus writes: “Posterity is under no
obligations to a man who is not a parent, who has never
planted a tree, built a house, nor written a book.” Having
fulfilled all these requisites to insure the remembrance of
posterity, it remains to be seen whether the author's name
shall escape oblivion.</p>
          <p>It may be that a few years will
obliterate the name affixed to this Preface from the
memory of man. This thought is the cause of no concern.
I shall have accomplished my purpose if I can in some
degree be humbly instrumental in serving my country and
my generation, by promoting the well-being of my
fellowmen, and advancing the declarative glory of
Almighty God.</p>
          <p>This work was written while suffering intensely from
maladies induced by the rigors of the Iron Furnace of
Secession, whose seven-fold heat is reserved for the
loyal citizens of the South. Let this fact be a palliation
for whatever imperfections the reader may meet in its
perusal.</p>
          <p>There are many loyal men in the southern states, who
to avoid martyrdom, conceal their opinions. They are to
be pitied—not severely censured. All
<pb id="aughey12" n="12"/>
those southern ministers and professors of religion who
were eminent for piety, opposed secession till the states
passed the secession ordinance. They then advocated
reconstruction as long as it comported with their safety.
They then, in the face of danger and death, became
scent—not acquiescent, by any means—and they now
“bide their time,” in prayerful trust that God will, in His
own good time, subvert rebellion, and overthrow
anarchy, by a restoration of the supremacy of
constitutional law. By these, and their name is legion, my
book will be warmly approved. My fellow-prisoners in the
dungeon at Tupelo, who may have survived its horrors,
and my fellow-sufferers in the Union cause throughout
the South, will read in my narrative a transcript of their
own sufferings. The loyal citizens of the whole country
will be interested in learning the views of one who has 
been conversant with the rise and progress of
secession, from its incipiency to its culmination in
rebellion and treason. It will also doubtless be of general
interest to learn something of the workings of the
“peculiar institution,” and the various phases which it
assumes different sections of the slave states.</p>
          <p>Compelled to leave Dixie in haste, I had no time to
collect materials for my work. I was therefore under the
necessity of writing without those aids which would
have secured greater accuracy. I have done the best
that I could have under the circumstances; and any errors
that may have crept into my statements
<pb id="aughey13" n="13"/>
of facts, or reports of addresses, will be cheerfully
rectified as soon as ascertained.</p>
          <p>That I might not compromise 
the safety of my
Union friends who rendered me assistance, and who
are still within the rebel lines, I was compelled to
omit their names, and for the same reason to describe
rather indefinitely some localities, especially the portions
of Ittawamba, Chickasaw, Pontotoc, Tippah, and
Tishomingo counties, through which I traveled while
escaping to the federal lines. This I hope to be able
to correct in future editions.</p>
          <p>Narratives require a liberal 
use of the first personal
pronoun, which I would have gladly avoided, had it been
possible without tedious circumlocution, as its frequent
repetition has the appearance of egotism.</p>
          <p>I return sincere 
thanks to my fellow-prisoners who
imperiled their own lives to save mine, and also to those
Mississippi Unionists who so generously aided a panting
fugitive on his way from chains and death to life and
liberty.</p>
          <p>May the Triune God bless our country, and preserve its
integrity!</p>

          <p>Above is the preface to The Iron Furnace. Since 
writing The Iron Furnace I have learned many 
things not known by me at the time that volume was written.
I was not in fit condition physically
<pb id="aughey14" n="14"/>
Or mentally at the time to write anything as it should be written.
It was uncertain whether I should survive the
maladies induced by the rigors of my imprisonment. Dr.
France, of Harlem Springs, O., whose patient I was, could
not give me assurance of ultimate recovery. This volume
is a fuller and more complete narrative of my own
personal sufferings as a southern Unionist, both prior to
and during my imprisonment and marvelous escapes
from arrest, till I reached the Federal lines, as well as an
account of the terrible cruelties to which my compatriots
in the dungeon at Tupelo
were subjected as a punishment of their
patriotism. Although imperfect, The Iron Furnace,
of which “Tupelo” is an enlarged and completed sequel,
has received many encomiums from distinguished men
whose approval is the source of laudable pride. Some of
them will be hereinafter recorded by the author.</p>

          <p>We 
commend The Iron Furnace to all. The author's
personal narrative is one of the most thrilling and
touching ever written. The arrest, the imprisonment, the
escape, the re-arrest, the ironing under the uplifted
sword, the re-incarceration, the filthy dungeon, the
loathsome food, the second escape, the pursuit by
cavalry and blood-hounds, the famishing from thirst
and hunger, and the final exodus from
<pb id="aughey15" n="15"/>
the iron furnace and reception under the good old flag
form such a story that we envy not the heart of him
who can read it without deep emotion. Mr. Aughey
resided eleven years in the South, and his views in
regard to the rise and progress of the secession movement
till it culminated in treason and rebellion cannot
fail to interest all.</p>

          <p>Mr. Aughey was arrested as a 
traitor to the treason
whereto he had never actively nor passively adhered and
which he therefore could not betray. He was heavily
manacled and thrust into a crowded, filthy prison,
whence his companions were taken out day by day to be
shot and their bodies thrown naked into a ditch, as
a punishment of their patriotism. Mr. Aughey as a more
influential Unionist was reserved for conspicuous
hanging, but escaped before the fulfillment of that
amiable intention. Traveling in the opposite direction
from that in which he would naturally be sought,
wearing on his ankles the heavy iron fetters which he had
not been enabled to remove, he was obliged to evade the
blood-hounds which are usually kept for the hunting of
slaves, but are now employed for the tracking of white
Unionists, taking care to leave none of his garments in
prison, as from them the scent might be taken, traveling
by night, and then very painfully because of the galling
circlet of his ankles, living mainly on green corn eaten
raw,
<pb id="aughey16" n="16"/>
since to raise a smoke would have been to advertise his
presence to bitter and unrelenting foes, he finally evaded
the rebel pickets and found refuge under the protecting
folds of the flag of freedom.</p>

          <p>I have read Mr. 
Aughey's book, The Iron Furnace,
with intense interest, and find in it only another proof
of how little the loud mouthed patriots of the North
know what true fidelity to the Government means.
It seems to me that somehow in the providence of
God this war in its progress or termination must give
the suffering Unionists of the South that lofty position
relatively which they so richly deserve.</p>

          <p>I have read 
Mr. Aughey's book, entitled, “The Iron
Furnace.” It shows what it costs to be a Unionist in the
South, and strongly illustrates the condition of southern
society. I hope it will receive, as it deserves, a wide
circulation.</p>

          <p>Mr. Aughey's book, “The 
Iron Furnace,” proves the
truth of the adage, that truth is stranger than fiction.
<pb id="aughey17" n="17"/>
His escape was one of the most remarkable on
record. Heavily ironed, closely guarded in the midst of
the great rebel army of more than one hundred thousand
men, the day set apart for his execution but three days'
distant, it required the almost miraculous interposition of
Divine Providence to give success to his plans for
escape, to guide him through a hostile country swarming
with foes eager in their search, stimulated by the
incentive of a large reward and aided by the keen-scented
blood-hound, till he had passed over a space of
more than two hundred miles by the route he was
compelled to travel, which intervened between his prison
in Tupelo and the Union outpost of Rienzi. We have seen
the manacles he wore; we have looked upon the scars caused by the
galling circlet of his ankles, the heavy iron fetters. We
have read his thrilling record on the site of its
occurrence—in the very building in which for years the
author presided over the destinies of the Rienzi Female College.
If you wish to read a true novel, a thrilling romance, a volume 
which will arouse and keep
in trembling suspense all the faculties of your soul, send

        <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
        <head>SECESSION.</head>
        <p>At the breaking out of the present rebellion, I was
engaged in the work of an Evangelist in the counties of
Choctaw and Attala in Central Mississippi. My
congregations were large, and my duties onerous. Being
constantly employed in ministerial labors, I had no time to
intermeddle with politics, leaving all such questions to
statesmen, giving the complex issues of the day only
sufficient attention to enable me to vote intelligently.
Thus was I engaged when the great political campaign of
1860 commenced—a campaign conducted with greater virulence
and asperity than any I have ever witnessed. During my casual
detention at a store, Colonel Drane arrived according to
appointment, to address the people of Choctaw. He was a
member of one of my congregations, and as he had long
been a leading statesman in Mississippi, having for many
years presided over the state senate, I expected to hear a
speech of marked ability, unfolding the true issues before
the people, with all the dignity, suavity, and earnestness
of a gentleman and patriot; but I found his whole speech
to be a tirade of abuse of the North, commingled with the
bold avowal of treasonable sentiments. The Colonel thus
addressed the people:</p>
        <pb id="aughey22" n="22"/>
        <p>“MY FELLOW-CITIZENS—I appear before you to
urge anew resistance against the encroachments and
aggressions of the Yankees. If the Black Republicans
carry their ticket, and Old Abe is elected, our
right to carry our slaves into the territories will be
denied us; and who dare say that he would be a base,
craven submissionist, when our God-given and constitutional
right to carry slavery into the common domain is wickedly taken from the South. The Yankees cheated us out of Kansas by their infernal
Emigrant Aid Societies. They cheated us out of
California, which our blood and treasure purchased,
for the South sent ten men to one that was sent by
the North to the Mexican war, and thus we have no
foothold on the Pacific coast; and even now we pay
five dollars for the support of the general Government
where the North pays one. We help to pay bounties
to the Yankee fishermen in New England; indeed <hi rend="italics">we</hi>
are always paying, paying, paying, and yet the North
is always crying, give, give, give. The South has
made the North rich, and what thanks do we receive?
Our rights are trampled on, our slaves are
spirited by thousands over their underground railroad
to Canada, our citizens are insulted while traveling
in the North, and their servants are tampered
with, and by false representations, and often by mob
violence, forced from them. Douglas, knowing the
power of Emigrant Aid Societies, proposes squatter
sovereignty, with the positive certainty that the scum
of Europe and the mudsills of Yankeedom can be
<pb id="aughey23" n="23"/>
shipped in, in numbers sufficient to control the destiny
of the embryo state. Since the admission of Texas
in 1845, there has not been a single foot of slave territory
secured to the South, while the North has added
to their list the extensive states of California, Minnesota,
and Oregon, and Kansas is as good as theirs;
while, if Lincoln is elected, the Wilmot proviso will
be extended over all the common territories, debarring
the South forever from her right to share the public
domain.</p>
        <p>“The hypocrites of the North tell us that slave-holding
is sinful. Well, suppose it is. Upon us and our children let
the guilt of this sin rest; we are willing to bear it, and it is
none of their business. We are a more moral people than
they are. Who originated Mormonism, Millerism, Spirit-rappings,
Abolitionism, Free-lovism, and all other
abominable <hi rend="italics">isms</hi> which curse the world. The reply is, the
North. Their puritanical fanaticism and hypocrisy is
patent to all. Talk to us of the sin of slavery, when the
only difference between us is that our slaves are black
and theirs white. They treat their white slaves, the Irish
and Dutch, in a cruel manner, giving them during health
just enough to purchase coarse clothing, and when they
become sick they are turned off to starve, as they do by
hundreds every year. A female servant in the North must
have a testimonial of good character before she will be
employed; those with whom she is laboring will not give
her this so long as they desire her services; she therefore
cannot leave
<pb id="aughey24" n="24"/>
them, whatever may be her treatment, so that she is as
much compelled to remain with her employer as the slave
with his master.</p>
        <p>“Their servants hate them; our's love us. My niggers would
fight for me and my family. They have
been treated well, and they know it. And I don't
treat my slaves any better than my neighbors. If
ever there comes a war between the North and the
South, let us do as Abraham did—arm our trained
servants and go forth with them to battle. They
hate the Yankees as intensely as we do, and nothing
could please our slaves better than to fight them. Ah,
the perfidious Yankees. I cordially hate a Yankee.
We have all suffered much at their hands; they will
not keep faith with us. Have they complied with
the provisions of the Fugitive Slave Law? The
thousands and ten of thousands of slaves aided in
their escape to Canada is a sufficient answer. We
<hi rend="italics">have</hi> lost millions and <hi rend="italics">are</hi> losing millions every
year, by the operation of the underground railroad.
How deep the perfidy of a people, thus to violate
every article of compromise we have made with
them! The Yankees are an inferior race, descended
from the old Puritan stock, who enacted the Blue
Laws. They are desirous of compelling us to submit
to laws more iniquitous than ever were the Blue
Laws. I have traveled in the North, and have seen
the depth of their depravity. Now, my fellow-citizens,
what shall we do to resist Northern aggression?
Why simply this: If Lincoln or Douglas is elected
<pb id="aughey25" n="25"/>
(as to the Bell-Everett ticket, it stands no sort of chance),
let us secede. This remedy will be effectual. I am in favor
of no more compromises. Let us have Breckenridge, or
immediate, complete, and eternal separation.”</p>
        <p>The speaker then retired amid the cheers of his
audience.</p>
        <p>Soon after this there came a day of rejoicing to many in
Mississippi. The booming of cannon, the joyous greeting,
the soul-stirring music, indicated that no ordinary
intelligence had been received. The lightnings had
brought the tidings that Abraham Lincoln was President-elect
of the United States, and the South was wild with
excitement. Those who had been long desirous of a
pretext for secession now boldly advocated their
sentiments, and joyfully hailed the election of Mr. Lincoln
as affording that pretext. The conservative men were filled
with gloom. They regarded the election of Mr. Lincoln by
the majority of the people of the United States in a
constitutional way as affording no cause for secession.
Secession they regarded as fraught with all the evils of
Pandora's box, and that war, famine, pestilence, and moral
and physical desolation would follow in its train. A call
was made by Governor Pettus for a convention to
assemble early in January, at Jackson, to determine what
course Mississippi should pursue, whether her policy
should be submission or secession.</p>
        <p>Candidates, Union and Secession, were nominated for
the convention in every county. The speeches of
<pb id="aughey26" n="26"/>
two whom I heard will serve as a specimen of the
arguments used <hi rend="italics">pro</hi> and <hi rend="italics">con</hi>. Captain Love, of Choctaw,
thus addressed the people:</p>
        <p>“MY FELLOW CITIZENS—I appear before you to advocate
the Union—the union of the states under whose favoring
auspices we have long prospered. No nation so great, so
prosperous, so happy, or so much respected by earth's
thousand kingdoms as the Great Republic, by which name
the United States is known from the rivers to the ends of
the earth. Our flag, the star-spangled banner, is respected
on every sea, and affords protection to the citizens of
every state, whether amid the pyramids of Egypt, the
jungles of Asia, or the mighty cities of Europe. Our
Republican Constitution, framed by the wisdom of our
Revolutionary fathers, is as free from imperfection as any
document drawn up by uninspired men. God presided
over the councils of that convention which framed our
glorious Constitution. They asked wisdom from on high,
and their prayers were answered. Free speech, a free
press, and freedom to worship God as our conscience
dictates, under our own vine and fig tree, none daring to
molest or make us afraid, are some of the blessings which
our Constitution guarantees; and these prerogatives
which we enjoy are features which bless and distinguish
us from the other nations of the earth. Freedom of speech
is unknown amongst them; among them a censorship of
the press and a national church are established.</p>
        <pb id="aughey27" n="27"/>
        <p>“Our country by its physical features seems fitted for
but one nation. What ceaseless troubles would be caused
by having the source of our rivers in one
country and the mouth in another. There are no natural boundaries
to divide us into separate nations. We are all descended from the same
common parentage, we all speak the same language, and we have really no
conflicting interests, the statements of our opponents to the contrary
notwithstanding. Our opponents advocate separate state secession.
Would not Mississippi cut a sorry figure among the nations of the earth?
With no harbor, she would be dependent on a foreign nation for an outlet.
Custom-house duties would be ruinous, and the republic of Mississippi
would find herself compelled to return to the Union. Mississippi,
you remember, repudiated a large foreign debt some years ago; if she
became an independent nation, her creditors would influence their
government to demand payment, which could not be refused by the weak,
defenseless, navyless, armyless, moneyless, repudiating republic of
Mississippi. To pay this debt, with the accumulated interest, would ruin
the new republic, and bankruptcy would stare us in the face.</p>
        <p>“It is true, Abraham Lincoln is elected President of the United States.
My plan is to wait till Mr. Lincoln does something unconstitutional. Then
let the South unanimously seek redress in a constitutional manner.
The conservatives of the North will join us. If no redress is
made, let us present our
<pb id="aughey28" n="28"/>
ultimatum. If this, too, is rejected, I for one will not
advocate submission; and by the co-operation of all the
slave states, we will, in the event of the perpetration of
wrong, and a refusal to redress our grievances, be much
abler to secure our rights, or to defend them at the
cannon's mouth and the point of the bayonet. The
Supreme Court favors the South. In the Dred Scott case
the Supreme Court decided that the negro was not a
citizen, and that the slave was a chattel as we regard him.
The majority of Congress on joint ballot is still with the
South. Although we have something to fear from the
views of the President elect and the Chicago platform, let
us wait till some overt act, trespassing upon our rights, is
committed and all redress denied; then, and not till then,
will I advocate extreme measures.</p>
        <p>“Let our opponents remember that secession and civil
war are synonymous. Who ever heard of a government
breaking to pieces without an arduous struggle for its
preservation? I admit the right of revolution when a
people's rights cannot otherwise be maintained, but deny
the right of secession. We are told that it is a reserved
right. The constitution declares that all rights not
specified in it are reserved to the people of the respective
states; but who ever heard of the right of total
destruction of the government being a reserved right in
any constitution? The fallacy is evident at a glance. Nine
millions of people can afford to wait for some overt act.
Let us not follow the precipitate course which the ultra
politicians
<pb id="aughey29" n="29"/>
indicate. Let W. L. Yancey urge his treasonable
policy of firing the Southern heart and precipitating a
revolution, but let us follow no such wicked advice. Let
us follow the things which make for peace.</p>
        <p>“We are often told that the North will not return
fugitive slaves. Will secession remedy this grievance?
Will secession give us any more slave territory? No
free government ever makes a treaty for the rendition
of fugitive slaves—thus recognizing the rights of the
citizens of a foreign nation to a species of property
which it denies to its own citizens. Even little
Mexico will not do it. Mexico and Canada return
no fugitives. In the event of secession the
United States would return no fugitives, and our peculiar
institution would, along our vast border, become very insecure;
we would hold our slaves by a
very slight tenure. Instead of extending the great
Southern institution it would be contracting daily.
Our slaves would be held to service at their own
option throughout the whole border, and our gulf
states would soon become border states; and the
great insecurity of this species of property would
work, before twenty years, the extinction of slavery,
and, in consequence, the ruin of the South. Are we
prepared for such a result? Are we prepared for
civil war? Are we prepared for all the evils attendant
upon a fratricidal contest—for bloodshed, famine,
and political and moral desolation? I reply, we are
not; therefore let us look before we leap, and avoiding
the heresy of secession—

        <p>A secession speaker was introduced, and thus
addressed the people:</p>
        <p>“LADIES AND GENTLEMEN—Fellow citizens, I am a
secessionist out and out; voted for Jeff Davis for
Governor in 1850, when the same issue was before the
people; and I have always felt a grudge against the <hi rend="italics">free
state</hi> of Tishomingo for giving H. S. Foote, the Union
candidate, a majority so great as to elect him, and thus
retain the state in this accursed Union ten years longer.
Who would be a craven-hearted, cowardly, villainous
submissionist? Lincoln, the abominable, white-livered
abolitionist, is President-elect of the United States; shall
he be permitted to take his seat on Southern soil? No,
never! I will volunteer as one of thirty thousand to
butcher the villain if ever he sets foot on slave territory.
Secession or submission! What patriot would hesitate for
a moment which to choose? No true son of Mississippi
would brook the idea of submission to the rule of the
baboon, Abe Lincoln—a fifth-rate lawyer, a broken-down
hack of a politician, a fanatic, an abolitionist. I, for one,
would prefer an hour of virtuous liberty to a whole
eternity of bondage under Northern, Yankee, wooden-nutmeg
rule. The halter is the only argument that should
be used against the submissionists, and I predict that it
will soon, very soon, be in force.</p>
        <p>“We have glorious news from Tallahatchie. Seven
<pb id="aughey31" n="31"/>
tory-submissionists were hanged there in one day, and
the so-called Union candidates, having the wholesome
dread of hemp before their eyes, are not canvassing the
county; therefore the heretical dogma of submission,
under any circumstances, disgraces not their county.
Compromise! let us have no such word in our vocabulary.
Compromise with the Yankees, after the election of
Lincoln, is treason against the South; and still its syren
voice is listened to by the demagogue submissionists.
We should never have made any compromise, for in every
case we surrendered rights for the sake of peace. No
concession of the scared Yankees will now prevent
secession. They now understand that the South is in
earnest, and in their alarm they are proposing to yield us
much; but the die is cast, the Rubicon is crossed, and our
determination shall ever be, no union with the flat-headed
nigger-stealing, fanatical Yankees.</p>
        <p>“We are now threatened with internecine war. The
Yankees are an inferior race; they are cowardly in the
extreme. They are descended from the Puritan stock, who
never bore rule in any nation. We, the descendants of the
Cavaliers, are the Patricians, they the Plebeians. The
Cavaliers have always been the rulers, the Puritans have
ruled. The dastardly Yankees will never fight us; but if
they, in their presumption and audacity, venture to attack
us, let the war come—I repeat it—let it come! The conflagration
of their burning cities, the desolation of their country,
and the slaughter of their inhabitants, will
<pb id="aughey32" n="32"/>
strike the nations of the earth dumb with astonishment,
and serve as a warning to future ages, that the
slaveholding Cavaliers of the sunny South are terrible in
their vengeance. I am in favor of immediate, independent,
and eternal separation from the vile Union which has so
long oppressed us. After separation, I am in favor of non-intercourse
with the United States so long as time endures. We will raise the
tariff, to the point of prohibition, on all Yankee manufactures, including
wooden-nutmegs, wooden clocks, quack nostrums, etc.
We will drive back to their own inhospitable clime every
Yankee who dares to pollute our shores with his cloven
feet. Go he must, and if necessary, with the blood-hounds
on his track. The scum of Europe and mudsills of 
Yankeedom shall never be permitted to advance a step
south of 36° 30'. South of that latitude is ours—westward
to the Pacific. With my heart of hearts I hate a Yankee,
and I will make my children swear eternal hatred to the
whole Yankee race. A mongrel breed—Irish, Dutch, Puritans,
Jews, free niggers, etc.—they scarce deserve the notice of
the descendants of the Huguenots, the old Castilians,
and the Cavaliers. Cursed be the day when the South
consented to this iniquitous league—the Federal Union—
which has long dimmed her nascent glory.</p>
        <p>“In battle, one southron is equivalent to ten northern
hirelings; but I regard it a waste of time to speak of
Yankees—they deserve not our attention. It matters not to
us what they think of secession, and
<pb id="aughey33" n="33"/>
we would not trespass upon your time and patience, were
it not for the tame, tory submissionists with which our
country is cursed. A fearful retribution is in waiting for
the whole crew, if the war which they predict, should
come. Were they then to advocate the same views, I
would not give a fourpence for their lives. We would
hang them quicker than old Heath would hang a tory. Our
Revolutionary fathers set us a good example in their
dealings with the tories. They sent them to the shades
infernal from the branches of the nearest tree. The North
has sent teachers and preachers amongst us, who have
insidiously infused the leaven of Abolitionism into the
minds of their students and parishioners; and this
submissionist policy is a lower development of the
doctrine of Wendell Phillips, Gerritt Smith, Horace
Greeley, and others of that ilk. We have a genial clime, a
soil of uncommon fertility. We have free institutions,
freedom for the white man, bondage for the black man, as
nature and nature's God designed. We have fair women
and brave men. The lines have truly fallen to us in
pleasant places. We have indeed a goodly heritage. The
only evil we can complain of is our bondage to the
Yankees through the Federal Union. Let us burst these
shackles from our limbs, and we will be free indeed.</p>
        <p>“Let all who desire complete and eternal emancipation
from Yankee thraldom, come to the polls on the — day of
December, prepared not to vote the cowardly
submissionist ticket, but to vote the secession
<pb id="aughey34" n="34"/>
ticket; and their children, and their children's children, will
owe them a debt of gratitude which they can never repay.
The day of our separation and vindication of states'
rights, will be the happiest day of our lives. Yankee
domination will have ceased forever, and the haughty
southron will spurn them from all association, both
governmental and social. So mote it be!”</p>
        <p>This address was received with great eclat.</p>
        <p>On the next Sabbath after this meeting, I preached
in the Poplar Creek Presbyterian church, in Choctaw,
now Montgomery county, from Romans xiii. 1:
“Let every soul be subject unto the higher powers.
For there is no power but of God: the powers that
be, are ordained of God.”</p>
        <p>Previous to the sermon a prayer was offered, of which
the following is the conclusion:</p>
        <p>“Almighty God—we would present our country,
the United States of America, before thee. When our
political horizon is overcast with clouds and darkness,
when the strong-hearted are becoming fearful for the
permanence of our free institutions, and the prosperity,
yea, the very existence of our great Republic, we pray
thee, O God, when flesh and heart fail, when no
human arm is able to save us from the fearful vortex
of disunion and revolution, that thou wouldst interpose
and save us. We confess our national sins, for we
have, as a nation, sinned grievously. We have been
highly favored, we have been greatly prospered, and
have taken our place amongst the leading powers of
<pb id="aughey35" n="35"/>
the earth. A gospel-enlightened nation, our sins are
therefore more heinous in thy sight. They are sins of
deep ingratitude and presumption. We confess that
drunkenness has abounded amongst all classes of our
citizens. Rulers and ruled have been alike guilty; and
because of its wide spreading prevalence, and because
our legislators have enacted no sufficient laws for its
suppression, it is a national sin. Profanity abounds
amongst us; Sabbath-breaking is rife; and we have
elevated unworthy men to high positions of honor and
trust. We are not, as a people, free from the crime of
tyranny and oppression. For these great and aggravated
offences, we pray thee to give us repentance and godly
sorrow, and then, O God, avert the threatened and
imminent judgments which impend over our beloved
country. Teach our senators wisdom. Grant them that
wisdom which is able to make them wise unto salvation;
and grant also that wisdom which is profitable to direct,
so that they may steer the ship of state safely through
the troubled waters which seem ready to engulf it on
every side. Lord, hear us, and answer in mercy, for the
sake of Jesus Christ our Lord. Amen and Amen!”</p>
        <p>The following is a synopsis of my sermon:</p>
        <p>Israel had been greatly favored as a nation. No
weapon formed against them prospered, so long as they
loved and served the Lord their God. They were blessed
in their basket and their store. They were set on high
above all the nations of the earth. * * * * When all Israel assembled,
<pb id="aughey36" n="36"/>
ostensibly to make Rehoboam king, they were ripe for
rebellion. Jeroboam and other wicked men had fomented
and cherished the spark of treason, till, on this occasion, it broke
out into the flame of open rebellion.
The severity of Solomon's rule was the pretext, but it
was only a pretext, for during his reign the nation
prospered, grew rich and powerful. Jeroboam wished a
disruption of the kingdom, that he might bear rule; and
although God permitted it as a punishment of Israel's
idolatry, yet he frowned upon the wicked men who were
instrumental in bringing this great evil upon his chosen people.</p>
        <p>“The loyal division took the name of Judah, though
composed of the two tribes, Judah and Benjamin. The
revolted ten tribes took the name of their leading tribe,
Ephraim. Ephraim continued to wax weaker and weaker.
Filled with envy against Judah, they often warred against
the loyal kingdom, until they themselves were greatly reduced.
At last, after various vicissitudes, the ten tribes were carried away,
and scattered and lost. We often hear of the lost ten
tribes. What became of them is a mystery. Their
secession ended in their being blotted out of existence
or lost amidst the heathen. God alone knows what
did become of them. They resisted the powers that be—the
ordinance of God—and received to themselves damnation and annihilation.</p>
        <p>“As God dealt with Israel, so will he deal with us. If we
are exalted by righteousness, we will prosper; if we, as the
ten tribes, resist the ordinance of God,
<figure id="ill2" entity="aughey36"><p>“NO, NEVER! I WILL VOLUNTEER AS ONE OF THIRTY THOUSAND TO BUTCHER<lb/>THE VILLIAN IF EVER HE SETS FOOT ON SLAVE TERRITORY.” Page 30</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey37" n="37"/>
we will perish. At this time many are advocating the
course of the ten tribes. Secession is a word of frequent
occurrence. It is openly advocated by many. Nullification and rebellion,
secession and treason, are
convertible terms, and no good citizen will mention
them with approval. Secession is resisting the powers that be, and therefore it
is a violation of God's command. Where do we obtain the right of secession? Clearly not from the word of God, which enjoins obedience to all
that are in authority, to whom
we must be subject, not only for wrath, but also for
conscience's sake.</p>
        <p>“There is no provision made in the Constitution of the
United States for secession. The wisest statesmen, who
made politics their study, regarded secession as a
political heresy, dangerous
in its tendencies,
and destructive of all government in its practical
application. Mississippi, purchased from France with
United States gold, fostered by the nurturing care, and
made prosperous by the wise administration of the
general government, proposes to secede. Her political
status would then be anomalous. Would her territory
revert to France? Does she propose to refund the
purchase money? Would she become a territory under
the jurisdiction of the United States Congress?</p>
        <p>“Henry Clay, the great statesman, Daniel Webster,
the expounder of the constitution, General Jackson,
George Washington, and a mighty host, whose names
would fill a volume, regarded secession as treason.
<pb id="aughey38" n="38"/>
One of our smallest states, which swarmed with tories in
the Revolution, whose descendants still live, invented the
doctrine of nullification, the first treasonable step, which
soon culminated in the advocacy of secession. Why
should we secede, and thus destroy the best, the freest,
and most prosperous government on the face of the
earth, the government which our patriot fathers fought
and bled to secure? What has Mississippi lost by the
Union? I have resided seven years in this state, and have
an extensive personal acquaintance, and yet I know not a
single individual who has lost a slave through northern
influence. I have, it is true, known of some ten slaves
who have run away, and have not been found. They may
have been aided in their escape to Canada by northern
and southern citizens, for there are many in the South
who have given aid and comfort to the fugitive; but the
probability is that they perished in the swamps, or were
destroyed by the blood-hounds.</p>
        <p>“The complaint is made that the North regards slavery
as a moral, social, and political evil, and that many of
them denounce, in no measured terms, both slavery and
slaveholders. To be thus denounced is regarded as a
great grievance. Secession would not remedy this evil. In
order to cure it effectually, we must seize and gag all who
thus denounce our peculiar institution. We must also
muzzle their press. As this is impracticable, it would be
well to come to this conclusion: If we are verily guilty of
the evils charged upon us, let us set about rectifying
those
<pb id="aughey39" n="39"/>
evils; if not, the denunciations of slanderers should
not affect us so deeply. If our northern brethren
are honest in their convictions of the sin of slavery,
as no doubt many of them are, let us listen to their
arguments without the dire hostility so frequently
manifested. They take the position that slavery is
opposed to the inalienable rights of the human race;
that it originated in piracy and robbery; that manifold
cruelties and barbarities are inflicted upon the
defenseless slaves; that they are debarred from intellectual
culture by state laws, which send to the penitentiary
those who are guilty of instructing them;
that they are put upon the block and sold, parent and
child, husband and wife being separated, so that they
never again see each other's face in the flesh; that
the law of chastity cannot be observed, as there are
no laws punishing rape on the person of a female
slave; that when they escape from the threatened
cat-o'nine-tails, or overseer's whip, they are hunted
down by blood-hounds and bloodier men; that often
they are half starved and half clad, and are furnished
with mere hovels to live in; that they are often murdered
by cruel overseers, who whip them to death, or
overtask them until disease is induced which results
in death; that masters practically ignore the marriage
relation among slaves, inasmuch as they frequently separate
husband and wife, by sale or removal; that they discourage the
formation of that relation, preferring that the offspring of their
female slaves should be illegitimate, from the mistaken notion
<pb id="aughey40" n="40"/>
that it would be more numerous. They charge, also, that
slavery induces in the masters, pride, arrogance,
tyranny, laziness, profligacy, and every form of vice.</p>
        <p>“The South takes the position that if slavery is sinful,
the North is not responsible for that sin; that it
is a state institution, and that to interfere with slavery
in the states in any way, even by censure, is a
violation of the rights of the states. The language of
our politicians is, upon us and our children rest the
evil! We are willing to take the responsibility, and
to risk the penalty! You will find evil and misery
enough in the North to excite your philanthropy and
employ your beneficence. You have purchased our
cotton; you have used our sugar; you have eaten
our rice; you have smoked and chewed our tobacco
—all of which are the products of slave labor. You
have grown rich by traffic in these articles; you have
monopolized the carrying trade and borne our slave-produced
products to your shores. Your northern
ships, manned by northern men, brought from Africa
the greater part of the slaves which came to our continent,
and they are still smuggling them in. When,
finding slavery unprofitable, the northern states
passed laws for gradual emancipation, but few obtained
their freedom, the majority of them being
shipped South and sold, so that but few, comparatively, were
manumitted. If the slave trade and
slavery are great sins, the North is <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">particeps criminis</hi></foreign>,
and has been from the beginning.</p>
        <p>“These bitter accusations are hurled back and forth
<pb id="aughey41" n="41"/>
through the newspapers, and in Congress crimination
and recrimination occur every day of the session.
Instead of endeavoring to calm the troubled waters,
politicians are striving to render them turbid and
boisterous. Sectional bitterness and animosity prevail
to a fearful extent, but secession is not the proper
remedy. To cure one evil by perpetrating a greater
renders a double cure necessary. In order to cure a
disease, the cause should be known, that we may treat
it intelligently and apply a proper remedy. Having
observed, during the last eleven years, that sectional
strife and bitterness were increasing with fearful rapidity,
I have endeavored to stem the torrent, so far
as it was possible for individual effort to do so. I
deem it the imperative duty of all patriots, of all
Christians, to throw oil upon the troubled waters,
and thus save the ship of-state from wreck among
the vertiginous billows.</p>
        <p>“Most of our politicians are demagogues. They care
not for the people, so that they accomplish their own
selfish and ambitious schemes. Give them power, give
them money, and they are satisfied. Deprive them of
these, and they are ready to sacrifice the best interests of
the nation to secure them. They excite sectional animosity
and party strife, and are willing to kindle the flames of
civil war to accomplish their unhallowed purposes. They
tell us that there is a conflict of interest between the free
and slave states, and endeavor to precipitate a revolution,
that they may be leaders and obtain positions of trust
<pb id="aughey42" n="42"/>
and profit in the new government which they hope to
establish. The people would be dupes indeed to abet
these wicked demagogues in their nefarious designs. Let
us not break God's command, by resisting the ordinance
of God—the powers that be. I am not discussing the right
of revolution, which I deem a sacred right. When human
rights are invaded, when life is endangered, when liberty
is taken away, when we are not left free to pursue our
own happiness in our own chosen way—so far as we do
not trespass upon the rights of others—we have a right,
and it becomes our imperative duty to resist to the bitter
end the tyranny which would deprive us and our children
of our inalienable rights. Our lives are secure; we have
freedom to worship God. Our liberty is sacred; we may
pursue happiness to our hearts' content. We do not even
charge upon the general Government that it has infringed
these rights. Whose life has been endangered, or who
has lost his liberty by the action of the Government? If
that man lives, in all this fair domain of ours, he has a
right to complain. But neither you nor I have ever heard
of or seen the individual who has thus suffered. We have
therefore clearly no right of revolution.</p>
        <p>“Treason is no light offence. God, who rules the
nations, and who has established governments, will
punish severely those who attempt to overthrow them.
Damnation is stated to be the punishment which those
who resist the powers that be, will suffer. Who
<pb id="aughey43" n="43"/>
wishes to endure it? I hope none of my charge will incur
this penalty by the perpetration of treason. You
yourselves can bear me witness that I have not
heretofore introduced political issues into the pulpit, but
at this time I could not acquit my conscience were I not to
warn you against the great sin some of you, I fear, are
ready to commit.</p>
        <p>“Were I to discuss the policy of a high or low tariff, or
descant upon the various merits attached to one or
another form of banking, I should be justly obnoxious to
censure. Politics and religion, however, are not always
separate. When the political issue is made, shall we, or
shall we not, grant license to sell intoxicating liquors as a
beverage? the minister's duty is plain; he must urge his
people to use their influence against granting any such
license. The minister must enforce every moral and
religious obligation, and point out the path of truth and
duty, even though the principles he advocates are by
statesmen introduced into the arena of political strife, and
made issues by the great parties of the day. I see
the sword coming, and would be derelict in duty not
to give you faithful warning. I must reveal the
whole counsel of God. I have a message from God
unto you, which I must deliver, whether you will
hear, or whether you will forbear. If the sword
come, and you perish, I shall then be guiltless of your
blood. As to the great question at issue, my honest
conviction is (and I think I have the Spirit of God,)
that you should with your whole heart, and soul, and
<pb id="aughey44" n="44"/>
mind, and strength, oppose secession. You should talk
against it, you should write against it, you should vote
against it, and, if need be, you should fight against it.</p>
        <p>“I have now declared what I believe to be your
high duty in this emergency. Do not destroy the
government which has so long protected you, and
which has never in a single instance oppressed you.
Pull not down the fair fabric which our patriot fathers
reared at vast expense of blood and treasure. Do not,
like the blind Samson, pull down the pillars of our
glorious edifice, and cause death, desolation, and ruin.
Perish the hand that would thus destroy the source
of all our political prosperity and happiness. Let
the parricide who attempts it receive the just retribution
which a loyal people demand, even his execution
on a gallows high as Haman's. Let us also set about
rectifying the causes which threaten the overthrow of
our government. As we are proud, let us pray for
the grace of humility. As a state, and as individuals,
we too lightly regard its most solemn obligations;
let us, therefore, pray for the grace of repentance and
godly sorrow, and hereafter in this respect sin no
more. As many transgressions have been committed
by us, let the time past of our lives suffice us to have
wrought the will of the flesh, and now let us break
off our sins by righteousness, and our transgressions
by turning unto the Lord, and he will avert his
threatened judgments, and save us from dissolution,
anarchy, and desolation.</p>
        <pb id="aughey45" n="45"/>
        <p>“If our souls are filled with hatred against the people
of any section of our common country, let us ask from
the Great Giver the grace of charity, which suffereth
long and is kind, which envieth not which vaunteth
not itself, is not puffed up, does not behave itself
unseemly, seeketh not her own, is not easily provoked,
thinketh no evil; rejoiceth not in iniquity, but rejoiceth
in the truth; beareth all things, believeth all
things, hopeth all things, endureth all things, and
which never faileth; then shall we be in a suitable
frame for an amicable adjustment of every difficulty;
oil will soon be thrown upon the troubled waters, and
peace, harmony, and prosperity would ever attend
us; and our children, and our children's children
will rejoice in the possession of a beneficent and stable
government, securing to them all the natural and
inalienable rights of man.”</p>

        <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
        <head>VIGILANCE COMMITTEE AND COURT-MARTIAL.</head>
        <p>Soon after this sermon was preached, the election
was held. Approaching the polls, I asked for a Union
ticket, and was informed that none had been printed,
and that it would be advisable to vote the secession
ticket. I thought otherwise, and going to a desk,
wrote out a Union ticket, and voted it amidst the
frowns, murmers, and threats of the judges and bystanders,
and, as the result proved, I had the honor
of depositing the only vote in favor of the Union
which was polled in that precinct. I knew of many
who were in favor of the Union, who were intimidated
by threats, and by the odium attending it, from
voting at all. A majority of the secession candidates
were elected. The convention assembled, and on the
9th of January, 1861, Mississippi had the unenviable
reputation of being the first to follow her twin sister,
South Carolina, into the maelstrom of secession and
treason. Being the only states in which the slaves were
more numerous than the whites, it became them to lead
the van in the slave-holders' rebellion. Before the 4th of
March, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas had
followed in the wake, and were engulfed in the whirlpool of
secession.</p>
        <p>It was now dangerous to utter a word in favor of
<pb id="aughey47" n="47"/>
the Union. Many suspected of Union sentiments were
lynched. An old gentleman in Winston county was
arrested for an act committed twenty years before,
which was construed as a proof of his abolition
proclivities. The old gentleman had several daughters,
and his mother-in-law had given him a negro girl. Observing
that his daughters were becoming lazy, and were imposing all
the labor upon the slave, he sent her back to the donor, with
a statement of the cause for returning her. This was now the ground
of his arrest, but escaping from their clutches, a precipitate flight
alone saved his life.</p>
        <p>Self-constituted vigilance committees sprang up all
over the country, and a reign of terror began; all who had
been Union men, and who had not given in their
adhesion to the new order of things by some public
proclamation, were supposed to be disaffected. The so-called
Confederate States, the new power, organized for
the avowed purpose of extending and perpetuating
African slavery, was now in full blast. These <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">soi-disant</hi></foreign>
vigilance committees professed to carry out the will of
Jeff. Davis. All who were considered disaffected were
regarded as being tinctured with abolitionism. My
opposition to the disruption of the Union being
notorious, I was summoned to appear before one of these
august tribunals to answer the charge of being an
abolitionist and a Unionist. My wife was very much
alarmed, knowing that were I found guilty of the charge,
there was no hope for mercy.</p>
        <pb id="aughey48" n="48"/>
        <p>On the evening before the session of the vigilance
committee, I walked out in the gloaming for meditation
and prayer. When a short distance from my residence, I
encountered an old colored man who belonged to a
planter named Major F. M. Henderson. The old man, who
was known as Uncle Simon Peter, embraced every
opportunity of hearing me preach. He approached me
with his hat under his arm, and in a very deferential
manner. Said he, “Master, I is in great trouble.”</p>
        <p>“What troubles you, Uncle Peter?”</p>
        <p>“Master, I brings a note to you, and I'se 'feared it
bodes no good to you. Master and Gus Mecklin and
some more folks what I didn't know fixed it up las' night,
and de way dey talked dey's ready to 'sassinate you.”</p>
        <p>“Give me the note, Uncle Peter.”</p>
        <p>“Here it am.”</p>
        <p>The paper was unique. A skull and cross-bones
illuminated one corner, a coffin and newly-made grave
were rudely drawn in another corner, a gallows was
conspicuous, a victim whose hands were bound behind
his back and a cap drawn over his face, stood upon the
trap ready for execution. In bold letters was written,
“Such be the doom of all traitors.” Within was the
following citation:</p>
        <q direct="unspecified">
          <text>
            <body>
              <div1 type="letter">

America. Your name heads the proscribed list. You are
ordered to appear on to-morrow afternoon at 2 o'clock
before our vigilance committee, in W. H. Simpson's

        <p>Flight was now impossible, and I deemed it the safest
plan to appear before the committee. I found it to consist
of twelve persons, five of whom I knew, viz., Rev. John
Locke, Armstrong, Cartledge, Simpson, and Wilbanks.
Parson Locke, the chief speaker, or rather the
inquisitor-general, was a Methodist minister, though he had fallen
into disrepute among his brethren, and was engaged in a
tedious strife with the church which he left in Holmes
county. The parson was a real Nimrod. He boasted that in
five months he had killed forty-eight raccoons, two
hundred squirrels, and ten deer; he had followed the
blood-hounds, and assisted in the capture of twelve
runaway negroes. W. H. Simpson was a ruling elder in my
church. Wilbanks was a clever sort of old gentleman, who
had little to say in the matter. Armstrong was a monocular
Hardshell-Baptist. Cartledge was an illiterate, conceited
individual. The rest were a motley crew, not one of whom,
I feel confident, knew a letter in the alphabet. The
committee assembled in an old carriage shop. Parson
Locke acted as chairman, and conducted the trial, as
follows:</p>
        <pb id="aughey50" n="50"/>
        <p>“Parson Aughey, you have been reported to us as
holding abolition sentiments, and as being disloyal to
the Confederate States.”</p>
        <p>“Who reported me, and where are your witnesses?”</p>
        <p>“Any one has a right to report, and it is optional
whether he confronts the accused or not. The
proceedings of vigilance committees are somewhat
informal.”</p>
        <p>“Proceed, then, with the trial, in your own way.”</p>
        <p>“We propose to ask you a few questions, and in your
answers you may defend yourself, or admit your guilt. In
the first place, did you ever say that you did not believe
that God ordained the institution of slavery?”</p>
        <p>“I believe that God did not ordain the institution of
slavery.”</p>
        <p>“Did not God command the Israelites to buy slaves
from the Canaanitish nations, and to hold them as their
property for ever?”</p>
        <p>“The Canaanites had filled their cup of iniquity to
overflowing, and God commanded the Israelites to
exterminate them; this, in violation of God's command,
they failed to do. God afterwards permitted the Hebrews
to reduce them to a state of servitude; but the
punishment visited upon those seven wicked nations by
the command of God, does not justify
war or the slave trade.”</p>
        <p>“Did you say that you were opposed to the slavery
which existed in the time of Christ?”</p>
        <pb id="aughey51" n="51"/>
        <p>“I did, because the system of slavery prevailing in
Christ's day was cruel in the extreme; it conferred the
power of life and death upon the master, and was
attended with innumerable evils. The slave had the same
complexion as his master; and by changing his servile
garb for the citizen dress, he could not be recognized as
a slave. You yourself profess to be opposed to white
slavery.”</p>
        <p>“Did you state that you believed Paul, when sent
Onesimus back to Philemon, had no idea that he would
be regarded as a slave, and treated as such after his
return?”</p>
        <p>“I did. My proof is in Philemon, verses 15 and 16,
where the apostle asks that Onesimus be received not
as a servant, but as a brother beloved?”</p>
        <p>“Did you tell Mr. Creath that you knew some
negroes who were better, in every respect, than some
white men?”</p>
        <p>“I said that I knew some negroes who were better
classical scholars than any white men I had as yet met in
Choctaw county, and that I had known some who were
pre-eminent for virtue and holiness. As to natural rights,
I made no comparison; nor did I say anything about
superiority or inferiority of race. I also stated my belief
in the unity of the races.”</p>
        <p>“Have you any abolition works in your library, and a
poem in your scrap-book, entitled ‘The Fugitive Slave,’
with this couplet as a refrain,
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>‘The hounds are baying on my track;</l><l>Christian, will you send me back?’ ”</l></lg></q></p>
        <pb id="aughey52" n="52"/>
        <p>“I have not Mrs. Stowe's nor Helper's work; they are
contraband in this region, and I could not get them if
I wished. I have many works in my library containing
sentiments adverse to the institution of slavery. All the
works in common use amongst us, on law, physic, and
divinity, all the text-books in our schools—in a word, all the
works on every subject read and studied by us, were,
almost without exception, written by men opposed to the
peculiar institution. I am not alone in this matter.”</p>
        <p>“Parson, I saw Cowper's works in your library, and
Cowper says:
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>‘I would not have a slave 
to fan me when I sleep,</l><l>And tremble when I wake, 
for all the wealth</l><l>That sinews bought and sold 
have ever earned.’ ”</l></lg></q></p>
        <p>“You have Wesley's writings, and Wesley says that 
‘Human slavery is the sum of all villainy.’ 
You have a
work which has this couplet:
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>‘Two deep, dark stains, 
mar all our country's bliss:</l><l>Foul slavery one, and one, loathed drunkenness.’</l></lg></q> 
You have the work of an English writer of high repute,
who says, ‘Forty years ago, some in England doubted
whether slavery were a sin, and regarded adultery as a
venial offence; but behold the progress of truth! Who
now doubts that he who enslaves his fellow-man is guilty
of a fearful crime, and that he who violates the seventh
commandment is a great sinner in the sight of God?’ ”</p>
        <p>“You are known to be an adept in phonography, and
you are reported to be correspondent of an abolition
phonographic journal.”</p>

        <pb id="aughey53" n="53"/>
        <p>“I understand the science of phonography, and I am
a correspondant of a phonographic journal, but
the journal eschews politics.”</p>
        <p>Another member of the committee then interrogated me.</p>
        <p>“Parson Aughey, what is funnyography?”</p>
        <p>“Phonography, sir, is a system of writing by means of a
philosophic alphabet, composed of the simplest geometrical
signs, in which one mark is used to represent one and invariably the
same sound.”</p>
        <p>“Kin you talk funnyography? and where does them folks live what talks it?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, sir, I converse fluently in phonography, and those who speak the language
live in Columbia.”</p>
        <p>“In the Deestrict?”</p>
        <p>“No, sir, in the poetical Columbia.”</p>
        <p>I was next interrogated by another member of the committee.</p>
        <p>“Parson Aughey, is phonography a abolition fixin'?”</p>
        <p>“No, sir; phonography, abstractly considered, has no political
complexion; it may be used to promote either side of any question, sacred
or profane, mental, moral, physical, or political.”</p>
        <p>“Well, you ought to write and talk plain English, what common folks
can understand, or we'll have to say of you, what Agrippa said of Paul,
 ‘Much learning hath made thee mad.’ Suppose you was to preach in
phonography, who'd understand it?—who'd know what was piped or harped?
I'll bet high some
<pb id="aughey54" n="54"/>
Yankee invented it to spread his abolition notions
underhandedly. I, for one, would be in favor of
makin' the parson promise to write and talk no more
in phonography. I'll bet phonography is agin slavery,
tho' I never hearn tell of it before. I'm agin
all secret societies. I'm agin the Odd-fellers, Free-masons,
Sons of Temperance, Good Templars, and
phonography. I want to know what's writ and
what's talked. You can't throw dust in my eyes.
Phonography, from what I've found out about it to-day,
is agin the Confederate States, and we ought to
be agin it.”</p>
        <p>Parson Locke then resumed:</p>
        <p>“I must stop this digression. Parson Aughey, are you
in favor of the South?”</p>
        <p>“I am in favor of the South, and have always
endeavored to promote the best interests of the South.
However, I never deemed it for the best interests of the
South to secede. I talked against secession, and voted
against secession, because I thought that the best
interests of the South would be put in jeopardy by the
secession of the Southern States. I was honest in my
convictions and acted accordingly. Could the sacrifice
of my life have stayed the swelling tide of secession, it
would gladly have been made.”</p>
        <p>“It is said that you have never prayed for the
Southern Confederacy.”</p>
        <p>“I have prayed for the whole world, though it is true
that I have never named the Confederate States in
prayer.”</p>
        <pb id="aughey55" n="55"/>
        <p>“Where and by whom were you educated?”</p>
        <p>“In my childhood I attended the free schools in
New York state and also in Steubenville, O. I was
a student of Grove Academy, in Steubenville, O.,
1844-5. Rev. J. W. Scott, D.D., was the principal.
I was a student of Richmond College, Richmond,
Jefferson Co., Ohio, three years. Rev. J. R. W.
Sloane, D.D., was the president. Prior to this I
studied classics two years with Rev. John Knox, of
Springfield, Jefferson Co., O. I am an alumnus of
Franklin College, New Athens, Harrison Co., O.,
was graduated during the presidency of Rev. A. D.
Clark, D.D.”</p>
        <p>“Did you ever attend Oberlin College, O.?” said the
presiding officer.</p>
        <p>“I never had that honor, sir.”</p>
        <p>“What were the views of your educators on the
slavery question?”</p>
        <p>“They all believed that human slavery was a moral,
social, and political evil—a cancer on the body politic, to be
eradicated as soon as possible by mild means, or by
heroic treatment as the exigencies of the case might
demand, in order to the preservation of the national life.
Since I came South I have taught in Winchester, Ky.,
Baton Rouge, La., Memphis, Tenn., Holly Springs and
Rienzi, Miss., and have been acting pastor of the
churches of Waterford and Spring Creek, in the
Presbytery of Chickasaw, near Holly Springs, Miss.; and
of Bethany Church in North Mississippi Presbytery.”</p>
        <pb id="aughey56" n="56"/>
        <p>“Are you a Mason or Odd Fellow?” said Parson
Locke.</p>
        <p>“I object to that question,” said Mr. Armstrong, who
belonged to a church that refused to fellowship any
members of secret societies.</p>
        <p>“I will not press the question,” said the parson. “You
may retire.”</p>
        <p>As I wended my way home I saw a large concourse in
front of the shop, in the garb or rather guise of hunters.
They had guns upon their shoulders and pistols in their
belts. I recognized the majority of them as Unionists who
had come, doubtless, to see that no harm befell me. There
were a few virulent secessionists in the post-office, who,
as I passed through it to the street, looked fiercely at me,
and with horrid blasphemy gave their views as to what
fate should befall traitors, tories, submissionists, and
unionists. These remarks were intended for my ears.</p>
        <p>After I had retired, Parson Locke said: “Mr. Cartledge,
what is your opinion? Is Parson Aughey guilty or not
guilty of the crimes charged against him in the
indictment?”</p>
        <p>“Guilty, sir, guilty. I node that afore I come here to-day.
I node it after I hearn him preach that sermon agin
secession, an' when I seed him rite out an' vote the Union
ticket I dident need no more evidence of his a being
guilty of all that is charged agin him, an' more too. Put
me down in favor of hangin'.”</p>
        <pb id="aughey57" n="57"/>
        <p>“Very well said, Mr. Cartledge. An honest, unequivocal,
straightforward expression of your convictions. General Bolivar,
let us hear from you.”</p>
        <p>Bolivar was a foundling. The gentleman at whose gate
the babe was abandoned gave him to the colored women
to raise. He was a great admirer of the South American
patriot and liberator, General Simon Bolivar, so he
named the waif, Simon Bolivar. The gentleman lived in
Boyle Co., Ky., on Rock Creek, near Danville. Bolivar,
when grown, married a poor white girl, and they lived in a
cave on the banks of that stream. He joined his fortunes
to a class of poverty-stricken people who were known as
rock angels, from their habitation amid the clefts of the
rocks. They procured a precarious livelihood by hunting
and fishing, often eking out their meagre supply of life's
necessaries by predatory excursions to the sheep-folds
and hen-roosts of the neighboring gentry. Bolivar came to
Mississippi in the employ of a man who brought a drove
of mules for sale, and liking the climate he returned and
brought his family.</p>
        <p>Bolivar, when addressed, started suddenly as from an
apparent revery, and ejecting a quantity of ambier from
his filthy mouth, replied: “I agrees with my neighbor
Cartledge. Better men nor him hez been hung in this
county lately, an' it has done good. I can't see no reason
why he shouldent hang, an' that's the way I votes.”</p>
        <p>“Major Wilbanks, how do you vote in regard to the
guilt or innocence of the prisoner?”</p>
        <pb id="aughey58" n="58"/>
        <p>“You wish my candid opinion?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, we do.”</p>
        <p>“Well, then, I will give it for what it is worth. I am in
favor of a free country, a free press, free speech—free men,
a free ballot and fair count.”</p>
        <p>“You might have added free niggers and completed
your free catalogue,” said Parson Locke.
“Bro. Simpson, please give us your opinion and advice.”</p>
        <p>“Parson, I am halting between two opinions. I do not
approve the views of my pastor, but he has never
committed any overt act of treason. We can afford to wait
for that. It may be possible should the sentiments of those
who have spoken prevail—that civil war would be
inaugurated in our midst. The assembled crowd in front
of this building is ominous of evil. I have looked out
upon them, and I know that many of the men out there
have been far more outspoken in the expression of
opinions adverse to the Southern Confederacy than him
whom we have had before us to-day, and they are armed
to the teeth.”</p>
        <p>Parson Locke turned pale, and said if Bro. Simpson
thought there was any immediate danger of exciting a
riot, he would adjourn the session till some time in the
near future, when, it was hoped, the excitement would
have subsided.</p>
        <p>Mr. John Mecklin arose and said, “I am but a
spectator, but I would advise you to adjourn at once.
Many of our best people think this to be an unwarranted
<pb id="aughey59" n="59"/>
and illegal proceeding. Civil law is still in force,
and even if it were superseded by military law that fact
would not justify the arbitrary course of this committee,
who have acted without any proper or competent
authority, civil or military. This man is not under your
jurisdiction, and you may have to answer for this day's
proceedings.”</p>
        <p>Parson Locke, who was an arrant coward, replied that
he could not fully agree with the last two speakers, but
in the interests of peace and harmony he would adjourn
this meeting to a time in the near future, when it would be
convened at the call of the president.</p>
        <p>The committee then hastily adjourned. Parson Locke
made his exit by a door in the rear of the building, and,
making a circuit through the woods, reached his home
without observation.</p>
        <p>The crowd was informed that an adjournment had
taken place, and that no formal verdict had been rendered.
In a short time the crowd had dispersed. Some of
the more violent secessionists were greatly exasperated
when they learned that the vigilance committee had not
rendered a verdict of guilty and ordered my execution.
They determined to take the matter into their own hands.
I was speedily advised of their threats. My friends
provided me with arms, and I resolved to defend myself to
the best of my ability. One evening I had gone over to a
neighbor's, Mr. Pickens Mecklin's. It was the dark of the
moon. As I returned, at a late hour, I heard the
<pb id="aughey60" n="60"/>
trampling of steeds. I concealed myself as they
approached me. When they had come quite near, the
men dismounted and tied their horses to trees. One said,
“Do you think he's at home?” Another, “Well, boys, the
tory parson's got to sup with Pluto to-night.” Another
said, “All I'm afeard of is that some of us will have to sup
with him in Pluto's dominions. He's got fight in him, an'
no mistake.”</p>
        <p>I had heard enough. I hastened home. My wife had
retired. I quickly armed myself, after barricading the
doors. After awhile there came a knock. No notice was
taken of it. Soon a voice said, “Halloo!” Within the
house all was silent as the grave.
I had cocked both barrels of a gun heavily loaded with
buckshot. I sat on a chair and aimed at the door, resolved
to shoot the first that entered, should they succeed in
breaking in the door. Soon there was a noisy
demonstration. At length two of the men volunteered to
go to the rear of the building, to the woodpile, and get a
log to use as a battering-ram to
break down the door. In their hot haste they ran
against a clothes-line. I had eked the line with a piece of
telegraph wire that some one in Vaiden had given me a
short time before. Both of these men, John Cook and a
Mr. Tower, were prostrated by the recoil, and quite
severely injured. Cook was rendered unconscious, and
Tower howled like a beaten hound. Several ran to their
assistance. At this juncture two volleys of firearms were
heard in quick succession. My would-be assassins ran
and cried and fled.</p>
        <pb id="aughey61" n="61"/>
        <p>A Mr. Denman had just finished digging a well for me.
The structure at the surface, to guard against the danger
of falling into the well, had not been completed. Some of
the fugitives fell into the well, descending with the
bucket. How they succeeded in getting out, I know not.
Dr. Le Grand told me of one man, who was his patient,
who died of the injuries
received on that eventful night. How I had been so
opportunely delivered was a mystery I could
not fathom. My little daughter said to her mother
in the lull of the storm, “Ma, may I pray those verses
you taught me?” Upon receiving permission, she arose in
bed, knelt upon the pillow, and folding her little hands,
said: “The angel of the Lord encampeth round about them
that fear him, and he delivereth them. The righteous cry,
and the Lord heareth them and delivereth them out of all
their troubles. They cry unto the Lord in their trouble,
and he bringeth them out of their distresses. Oh, that men
would praise the Lord for his goodness and for his
wonderful works to the children of men. Deliver us, O our
God, out of the hand of the wicked, out of the hand of the
unrighteous and cruel
men. Oh, God! be not far from us. Oh, God! make haste
for our help. For Christ our Redeemer's sake. Amen.”
Then she lay down, and was soon lost in innocent and
unconscious slumber.</p>
        <p>In an hour after the flight of these midnight marauders
I heard a knock, which I recognized as a preconcerted
signal of recognition among Unionists.
<pb id="aughey62" n="62"/>
I went to the back door, whence the knock sounded,
and signaled a reply. A low voice then uttered in a distinct
tone the sentence, “Liberty and union, now and forever, one
and inseparable.” I opened the door, half a dozen friends entered.
They and others, who remained on duty, had been guarding my house
unknown to me. They remained an hour, uttering words of comfort, and gave
me the assurance of all the assistance I should need, though at the peril
of their lives. After parting salutations, I opened the door, and my
friends disappeared in the darkness. We named this the battle of Wyandotte,
the name of my home. Probably the first blood of the war was shed in this <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">recontre</hi></foreign>.</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“War is dread when battle shock and fierce affray</l>
          <l>Perpetuate a tyrant's name;</l>
          <l>But guarding freedom's holy fane,</l>
          <l>Confided to her valiant keeping,</l>
          <l>The sword from scabbard leaping</l>
          <l>Flashes a heavenly light.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>In the afternoon of the next day Elder John Mecklin and his estimable
wife came to visit us, bringing their young son Reemer with them. Mr.
Mecklin advised us to say nothing about this attempt upon my life, as
reticence in war time was a virtue. The perpetrators of the dastardly attack
would conceal their participation in it, even though some of their
number should die of their wounds. Excitement must be allayed as much
as possible. He feared that this assault would be followed by others, till
they had accomplished their nefarious purpose. He said that
<pb id="aughey63" n="63"/>
my public position and avowed sentiments, and the fact
that I was of northern birth and education, had
concentrated upon me the malice of all those of secession
proclivities, but he assured me that my friends would defend me at the risk of
their lives. I advised him of my intentions of removing into Attala
county, near Nazareth church, which was also in my field of labor.
He approved this course, since the excitement here ran very high, but
affirmed that there was no place within the seceded states very safe
for one whose Unionism was of so pronounced a type.</p>
        <p>At this time there was a man named Dr. Smith who resided in Canton,
Mississippi. He frequently visited friends in Choctaw county. He was a
violent secessionist. Having learned of the failure of the attempt upon
my life, he resolved to take charge of the matter himself, and execute
summary vengeance upon one who had too long been suffered to live.</p>
        <p>I had the charge of three churches—Poplar Creek and French Camp, in
Choctaw county, and Nazareth, in Attala county. French Camp was twelve
miles from my home, and Nazareth twenty-eight miles distant. Dr. Smith
determined to come to French Camp on the Sabbath I preached in that church and
kill me there. He ordered his fast trotter, Bucephalus, to be attached
to the buggy, and preparing his pistols, he started in hot haste to effect his
murderous purpose. He reached French Camp about one o'clock P.M. He learned
that after the service I had gone to dine with Major Garrard. This was a
<pb id="aughey64" n="64"/>
mistake; I dined with Col. Hemphill. Dr. Smith dined with Dr.
John Hemphill. He made known to Dr. Hemphill the object
of his visit. The doctor tried in vain to dissuade him from
his purpose. He now determined to follow me to my home
and murder me there. He called at Col. Hemphill's and
learned that I had dined with the colonel, and had left
<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">en route</hi></foreign> for my home an hour before. I called at Esquire
Pilcher's to see his daughter, Miss Belle, who was quite
ill of malarial fever. After administering to her spiritual
need, I pursued my journey homeward. Dr. Smith had just
passed, driving Jehu-like (furiously). I followed rapidly, as
a storm seemed imminent. I heard the vehicle in advance
and tried to overtake it, as I desired company on this
lonely road, but my horse was no match for the doctor's
swift steed, so I providentially failed to overtake him.</p>
        <p>About three miles from my home Dr. Smith left the
main road for one that led to a Methodist chapel. He
drove up to the chapel, descended from his buggy and
ordered a colored boy to hold his horse. He approached
a group of men, and noticing one who was quite well
dressed and had a ministerial look and bearing,
addressed him thus:</p>
        <p>“Are you, sir, a messenger of the Lord of Hosts?”</p>
        <p>The gentleman smiled and made no reply. The doctor then
presented a pistol and fired. The ball passed through the
lungs of his victim. Reason had left her throne. The
doctor was a raving maniac.
<pb id="aughey65" n="65"/>
The congregation rushed out of the chapel, took the
doctor into custody, and resolved to administer summary
vengeance according to the code of Judge Lynch.
While they were waiting for a halter for which they had
sent, Dr. Smith's brother and other friends arrived. They
rescued him with difficulty from the infuriated crowd,
conveyed him to his home in Canton, an alienist
pronounced him hopelessly insane, and he soon after
became an inmate of the insane asylum at Jackson.
Deacon Ludlow (pro. kokely), the doctor's victim, lingered
for months on the border of the spirit land. The latest
information I had indicated a fatal termination. Thus in
the providence of God I was once more delivered from
the wrath of man.</p>
        <p>A rumor found its way into the papers that I had
been fatally shot by Dr. Smith, of Canton. A friend
residing in Carthage, Leake county, sent me a paper
containing this notice:</p>
        <p>“Rev. John H. Aughey, a Presbyterian minister,
who has been doing evangelistic work in Attala and
Choctaw counties, was fatally shot last week by Dr.
Smith, of Canton. The doctor was a monomaniac. He
believed himself to be commissioned by heaven to
exterminate all who were not friendly to the Confederate
States of America. He had been informed that Mr.
Aughey had expressed disloyal sentiments, and was a
leader of the disaffected. He left home with the avowed
intention of killing him on sight. The doctor's brother,
learning the nature of his mission,
<pb id="aughey66" n="66"/>
followed, but was unable to overtake him till he had
committed the fatal deed. The particulars we have not
learned. Mr. Aughey had the reputation of being an able
minister, and very faithful in the discharge of his
ministerial duties. That he was one of the disaffected is
true. The extent of his opposition we have not learned. In
times of great excitement rash acts are committed which
are not warranted or required for the public safety. We
regret Mr. Aughey's tragic end, and if justifiable we
regret the necessity that required it. He leaves a widow
and one child. <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">Requiescat in pace</hi></foreign>.”</p>
        <p>Commodore Spiva, a planter and leading member of
my church in Attala county, offered myself and family a
home as members of his family upon <sic corr="condition">condision</sic> that I
would superintend the studies of his son and daughter.
They had entered upon a course of private study
supplementary to the finished education they had
received at the college and seminary. We were now
domiciled in his spacious mansion on the banks of the
meandering Yockanookany. We enjoyed comparative
quiet for a time. My students were very much enamored
of belles-lettres, and we took delightful rambles in the
higher walks of literature. We enjoyed a continuous
feast of reason and flow of soul. In my absence my wife
became my vicegerent, and their rapid advance was not
retarded.</p>
        <p>The battle of Manassas had been fought and the
boastful spirit of the secessionists was almost
unendurable. The whole confederacy did nothing but
brag
<pb id="aughey67" n="67"/>
of what had been done and what would be done if the
Yankees persisted in their futile attempts to subjugate the
South. The South was arming for the war. Joyfully and
with alacrity the young chivalric sons of the slave-holding
aristocracy responded to the call for volunteers. The
young ladies presented company and regimental flags of
costly material, deftly embroidered by their own fair
fingers with rare and significant designs, to every
regiment as it left for the theater of war. Upon their
departure to the seat of war, they were given an ovation,
barbecues were held, grandiloquent orations were
pronounced, in which the superiority of the South over the
North in valor, military skill, and chivalric spirit was
announced in terms that admitted no contrary opinion.
They were assured that when they returned victorious—of
which result there was not the least shadow of doubt—and
had secured the independence of a glorious slave-holding
confederacy, they would be honored living, and when dead
their memory would be embalmed in the hearts of a
grateful posterity and remembered with veneration, even
until the last moment of recorded time. Sax-horn bands
discoursed delicious music. “The Bonnie Blue Flag that
Boasts a Single Star,” “Maryland, my Maryland,” and
pre-eminently, “Dixie,” were played and sung by band
and orchestra and choir. The South had donned her
holiday attire, and wine-cup, dance, and song ruled the
hour.</p>
        <p>“Oh! that the Yankees would come,” cried they,
<pb id="aughey68" n="68"/>
“we would welcome them with bloody hands to
hospitable graves. One of our companies is
equivalent to a regiment of Yankees, and a southern
regiment more than a match for ten thousand
northern mudsills.”</p>
        <p>One evening Commodore Spiva met me as I
walked museful in a grove. He joined me in a walk,
and shortly drew me to a seat beneath a fig tree and
thus began:</p>
        <p>“Are you aware that your life is in danger?”</p>
        <p>“Whence the danger?”</p>
        <p>“There are men in our neighborhood that would
have made the attempt to assassinate you ere this,
but they know you are under my protection.
I fear that as you travel about in the discharge of
your pastoral duty they may waylay and murder
you.”</p>
        <p>“I am prepared, if attacked, to defend myself.”</p>
        <p>“Your pistols would avail nothing at long range
against men armed with rifles.”</p>
        <p>“Well, what would you advise?”</p>
        <p>“Dr. Hughes will call upon you to-morrow and
inform you of the decision arrived at at an informal
meeting attended by the leading members and
supporters of Nazareth Church.”</p>
        <p>On the next day Dr. Hughes called to inform me
that if I wished to live long on the earth I must
declare my adhesion unequivocally to the
government of our nation, the sovereign state of
Mississippi, and also my good-will toward the
subordinate Confederate States of America, and my
approval of their constitutions.</p>
        <p>

        <pb id="aughey69" n="69"/>
        <p>“Declare my adhesion unequivocally to the
government of our nation, the sovereign state of
Mississippi, and also my good-will toward the
subordinate Confederate States of America, and my
approval of their constitutions? Doctor, is there any
virtue in such a political creed to promote long life?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, we all think so, and we believe the time has
come when we cannot longer tolerate any sentiments in
conflict with the views of the dominant class in our
country. We like you as a man and as a minister, but we
deprecate your treasonable opinions, and we cannot
much longer, if we would, save you from the vengeance
of the soldiers and the vigilantes. I will call to-morrow for
your decision.”</p>
        <p>On the morrow he called, and I told him that I
had decided to return to Tishomingo county. He
expressed his approval. I removed my household
goods to Goodman, a town on the Mississippi Central R. R.,
ordering their shipment to Iuka. I conveyed my wife and
child by private conveyance.
We spent one night in Macon, Noxubee Co. Rev.
James Pelan had been called to the pastorate of the
Presbyterian church of Macon. He was a Unionist.
A committee was appointed by the citizens to examine
his library. Many of his books were condemned by this
committee as containing abolition
sentiments. Rev. James Pelan was a man of excellent
spirit—a ripe scholar and a worthy christian
gentleman. His life was being embittered by his
political enemies. Every sermon was misconstrued
<pb id="aughey70" n="70"/>
and tortured into teaching something contrary to the
interests of the sovereign state of Mississippi and the
Confederate States of America. Threats of lynching were
freely made. The Unionists often conveyed secret
information of plots against the life of this good man.
Often his foes endeavored to impair his reputation by
slander and calumny, but these as often recoiled upon
their fabricators. Wearied of such a life of turmoil, he
resigned his charge and removed to the country, but the
malice of his enemies pursued him to his rural retreat. One
evening, when walking on the lawn near his home,
concealed assassins fired upon him, wounding him
severely. For a long time he lingered between life and
death, but a naturally strong constitution, together with
good nursing, triumphed, and he began to convalesce.
But his enemies were on the alert, and ascertaining that
he was likely to recover, three devils incarnate came
armed to his house. Mr. Pelan was sitting in a chair eating
some delicacy that his wife had prepared for him. These
demons in human form asked Mrs. Pelan if they could
have supper. She replied, “Certainly, I will order my
servants to prepare supper for you.<sic>’</sic> She left the room to
give the order<corr>.</corr> These men then arose and one of them
said, “All the supper we want is to kill you, you infernal
Unionist and abolitionist.” Instantly they all three fired
upon their wounded and defenseless victim. Mrs. Pelan,
hearing the report, rushed in and caught her husband in
her arms. In ten minutes he was a corpse. Before
<pb id="aughey71" n="71"/>
losing consciousness the dying martyr said,
“Father, forgive them, they know not what they do.” He
also said, “Farewell, dear wife, I die, but the government
still lives and will eventually subvert rebellion, for God is
just.” His last utterance was, “Lord Jesus, receive my
spirit.” Rev. James Pelan was of English birth and
parentage. His brother, Rev. Wm. Pelan, was pastor of
the Presbyterian church in Connorsville, Ind., for twenty
years, now of Wells, Faribault Co., Minn.</p>
        <p>Thus died one of my co-presbyters and dear friends.
When our presbytery—the presbytery of Tombeckbee—
convened at Aberdeen, we lodged and roomed together
at the female seminary, of which Rev. R. S. Gladney was
principal. Rev. R. S. Gladney was a violent secessionist.
He had just written a poetical defense of slavery, and was
woefully vexed that the blockade had prevented his
publishers, the Lippen of Philadelphia, from
sending him the books. A young licentiate named
Gallaudet was ordained at this session of presbytery to
the full work of the gospel ministry. Mr. Gladney rebuked
him quite severely in open presbytery because he had
given a negative answer to the question, “Will slavery
exist during the millennium?” Mr. Gladney affirmed that it
would exist during the millennium, and would also exist in
a modified form in heaven. The necessity of the marriage
relation would terminate with earth, but he thought the
southern people would require slaves in heaven in order
to promote their highest happiness.</p>
        <pb id="aughey72" n="72"/>
        <p>Rev. Gallaudet became pastor of the Presbyterian
church in Aberdeen. Being a Unionist, the secessionists
bitterly opposed him. At length to save his life he was
compelled to abandon his field of labor. He made good
his escape to the North. But poor Pelan was not so
fortunate. The villain most prominent in his murder was
killed in battle just three days after his diabolical crime.
The righteous retribution of Divine Providence was not
long delayed. Near this Judge Chisholm and his lovely
daughter were murdered by the Ku Klux Klan.</p>
        <p>We spent one night in Okolona, lodging at a hotel.
A friend whom I had long known lived here. His name
was Col. Carothers. He was a strong secessionist. He met
me just as I had given my horse and buggy into the care
of the proprietor of the hotel. He advised me to register
under an assumed name, as the vigilantes had my name
on their list of proscribed persons, and if recognized my
fate would be sealed. He said: “On the morrow a
regiment will leave for the seat of war in Virginia, and if
your presence should become known they will surely
take your life. Colin McIvor was hanged last Monday as
a Unionist, although I and several others exerted our
utmost influence to save his life. But it was without
avail. We pleaded, but in vain, for a respite of two hours
that he might make his will and bid his family farewell.”</p>
        <p>I demurred and declared that I was not ashamed of my
name, that I had not done anything to disgrace
<pb id="aughey73" n="73"/>
it. He assured me that I must take his advice or pay
the penalty of my temerity with my life. I walked up to the
register and made this record: “George Bushrod
Washington, wife, and daughter, Mt. Vernon, Va.” After
supper we entered the ladies parlor. Mrs. Des Lande, a
lady boarder at the hotel, called our child to her, took her into
her lap and said: “What is your name, my dear?”</p>
        <p>“Anna Kate Aughey,” she lisped.</p>
        <p>“Where do you live?”</p>
        <p>“Near Kosciusko, Attala Co., Mississippi.”</p>
        <p>“Where are you traveling?”</p>
        <p>“To grandpa's, Mr. Alexander Paden's, at Iuka. But I
think my pa is going to 'scape Norf from the bad
people that tried to kill him. I heard him tell ma so. I ask
God every day to take care of my dear pa, and ma does too. We
are good people and love God; what do they want to shoot
my poor pa for?”</p>
        <p>The ladies present gave each other significant glances.
Soon after Col. Carothers called me out. Said he: “You
should not have registered by a name so renowned. It
has attracted the attention of all the loungers at the hotel,
and your little daughter, Major Linden informs me, has
betrayed your secret.</p>
        <p>You should have registered your <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">nom de guerre</foreign></hi> as John
Smith, of Pontotoc, or some obscure town. Now do you
and family retire to your room at once. I will arrange for
your safety with Major Linden.
He will order an early breakfast, and you can start
<pb id="aughey74" n="74"/>
by daylight or a little before. Drive rapidly to avoid
pursuit, if it should be made, and it would be well to start
southward and make a circuit as a blind.”</p>
        <p>We took his advice, and left ere the shades of night
had lifted from the magnolia-embowered streets of
Okolona. We started in a southern direction, made a
circuit of several squares, and left the town <hi rend="italics">via</hi> the
northern suburbs. My good horse, Bellerophon, assumed
a gait that led us to fear no pursuers.</p>
        <p>“They will have swift steeds that follow with any
prospect of success,” said my wife.</p>
        <p>Our horse slackened not his speed for several hours,
and our babe slept sweetly and calmly. While the guests
were at breakfast that morning in Okolona the chief of
the vigilantes called to ascertain the antecedents and
business in their city of the traveler who
had registered as George Bushrod Washington. He
learned, to his surprise and regret, that he had left at an
early hour. The landlord disclaimed all knowledge of him
or of his destination. At a meeting of the vigilantes that
morning this matter was brought to their attention, but
no definite action was taken for lack of testimony,
except that this telegram was sent to Tupelo, “Look sharp
for a suspicious character traveling in a buggy with a
lady and child. He travels <hi rend="italics">incognito</hi>, or rather, under the
assumed name of George Bushrod Washington. If he
visits Tupelo, arrest him and send us word. He evaded
us by leaving in the night. All charges will be paid out
<pb id="aughey75" n="75"/>
of our secret service fund.” Similar messages were
sent southward to the vigilantes in Columbus, Lowndes county,
and Meridian, Lauderdale county.</p>
        <p>Upon reaching Marietta, Prentiss county, we met
Misses Bettie Greene and Josephine Young, my former
pupils at the Rienzi Female College. At their urgent
solicitation, we spent the night with their parents.
These families were Unionists. They informed us
that Messrs. Wroten and Nowlin, Unionists, had
been abducted by the vigilantes a month ago, and
had not been heard of since. They were either languishing in
prison, or had been murdered. Their families were in great
distress because of their ominous absence. We reached the residence 
of Mr. Alexander Paden, my wife's father, the
next afternoon, at four o'clock,
without further incident of interest, except that when we
reached Mackey's creek we met Major Stephen Davenport and Dr.
Orton Choate, two virulent seccessionists, who hurrahed for Jeff
Davis and the Southern Confederacy. They asked me how that suited
me. I replied, “I am in favor of the Union, the
Constitution, and the enforcement of the laws.” They
produced a flask of liquor and drank confusion and death
to all Yankees, tories, traitors, submissionists,
renegades and abolitionists, North
and South. Saying, “We will see you later,” they
rode off, brandishing their sword-canes and singing
“Dixie” in maudlin tones.</p>
        <p>Upon our arrival in Tishomingo county I found that
the great heart of the county still beat true to
<pb id="aughey76" n="76"/>
the music of the Union. At the last election they were
permitted to hold the Union delegates received 1,400
majority. Union sentiments could be expressed with entire
safety in many localities. Corinth, Iuka, and Rienzi had
been from the commencement of the war camps of
instruction for the training of Confederate soldiers. These
three towns in the county being thus occupied, Unionists
found it necessary, in their vicinity, to be more cautious,
as the cavalry made frequent raids throughout the county,
arresting and maltreating those suspected of disaffection.
Corinth is a very important strategical point, situated in a
semi-mountainous country, a branch of the Appalachian
range which diverges from the Allegheny mountains and
forms the mountains and gold-bearing regions of Georgia
and Alabama. Here, also, is the junction of the Memphis
and Charleston with the Mobile and Ohio railroads, which
form the means of communication between the Atlantic
and Gulf seaboards. After the reduction of Forts Henry
and Donelson, and the surrender of Nashville, the
Confederates made the Memphis and Charleston railroad
the base of their operations, their armies extending from
Memphis to Chattanooga. Soon, however, they were all
concentrated at Corinth, in Tishomingo county.</p>
        <p>Tishomingo and Iuka were two Indian chieftains. The
town of Iuka was named for one and Tishomingo Co. for
the other. After the battle of Shiloh, which was fought on
the 6th and 7th of April, 1862,
<pb id="aughey77" n="77"/>
the Federal army advanced to Farmington, four miles
north of Corinth, while the Confederates occupied
Corinth, their rear extending to Rienzi, twelve miles south on the
Mobile&amp; Ohio railroad. Thus there were two vast armies encamped
in Tishomingo Co. Being within the Confederate lines, I, in common
with many other loyalists, found it difficult to evade
the rigorously enforced conscript law. Believing that in a multitude
of counselors there is wisdom, we held secret meetings in order to
devise the best methods for evading the law. We met at
midnight's weird and solemn hour. Often our wives,
sisters, and daughters met with us. Our meeting place was
some ravine or secluded glen, or by some mountain
mere, as far as possible from the from the haunts of the
secessionists. All were armed; even the ladies carried
concealed revolvers which they knew well how to
use. We had countersigns so as to recognize friends and discern
enemies. <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">Taisez vous</hi></foreign> was the countersign known by
loyalists from the Ohio river to the
Gulf of Mexico. The recognition of it was <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">Oui, Oui</hi></foreign>
(pronounced we, we). It was never discovered by the
disloyal during the war. The nefarious crime of treason
we were resolved not to commit. Our counsels were
somewhat divided. We did not coincide in opinion upon
the question whether we should tend the militia musters.
Some advocating as matter of policy the propriety of
attending them; others, myself among the number,
opposing it for conscience's sake, and for the purpose of
avoiding
<pb id="aughey78" n="78"/>
every appearance of evil. Many who would not muster
nor be enrolled as conscripts resolved to escape to the
Federal lines, and making the attempt in squads, under
skillful guides who could course it from point to point
through the densest forests, with the
unerring instinct of the panther or catamount or
aborigines, at length reached the Union army, enlisted
under the old flag, and have since done good service as
patriot warriors.</p>
        <p>The vigilantes became very troublesome. They
arrested and murdered Unionists wherever they could
be found. Few loyalists dared sleep at home, but seeking
out some jungle or copse they improvised a rude arbor or
den in which they spent the night, and to which they
betook themselves when an alarm was given by their
families or friends. Late one evening I saw the beacon
fires burning. Mt. Sinai was all ablaze, the flames
ascending high. The moon was obscured by dark dismal
clouds. Mt. Nebo was lurid. The lambent flames from
Pisgah had enveloped a stately pine—long since dead—standing
on the lofty summit far above all other trees.
Hermon and Horeb were dark as Erebus. Unless these
two were illuminated it was but a call to an ordinary
meeting. We gave these peaks those names to designate
them so that by the fires kindled upon them they might
serve as danger signals or call together in solemn
assemblage the scattered Unionists. At 10 o'clock P.M.
Horeb and Hermon blazed out from their lofty summits.
The fierce and spiral flames
<pb id="aughey79" n="79"/>
recalled the pictures of Etna and Vesuvius in the
geographies of my school days, where the mighty waves
of glittering fire, through some internal convulsion, shot
from their craters far upward into the midnight sky.
These indicated a special call, either some impending
danger was to be guarded against or some Unionist had
been wounded or slain. I was just returning from a visit to
Josselyn, Amos, Petrie, Aaron, and Morrow, who were in
hiding and were awaiting the return of the guides who had
gone with a squad to the Federal lines. As soon as I
ascertained that Hermon and Horeb were blazing I
returned to the lair of these hidden ones, and when from
the summit of a hill they had seen the signal fires blazing,
they at once started to the place of rendezvous. I did the
same after I had secreted my horse in the stable of a
friend.</p>
        <div2 type="subchapter">
          <head>THE MIDNIGHT MEETING, AND BATTLE IN GOOD
SPRINGS GLEN.</head>
          <p>Dark hills frowned on every side; the waters of a
crystal spring bubbled up and in mournful cadence
murmured a sad refrain, then swiftly glided away adown
the glen; the midnight moon gazed wistfully down from
the zenith; fitful clouds and the overarching branches of
the lofty forest trees, stately monarchs of the woods,
obscured her light. I reached the place of rendezvous just
at the noon of night. Quietly approaching from all
possible points, human forms appeared, gliding
noiselessly into the
<pb id="aughey80" n="80"/>
narrow arena around the spring. The numbers
increasing, this place was
tacitly surrendered to the women,
the men retreating to the hillsides adjacent.
John Beck received in a whisper from each the countersign,
“The Union Forever.” He reported ninety-four present,
sixty-five men and twenty-nine ladies.
I was the presiding officer, supported by two vice
presidents, Henry Spence and Byron Hall.</p>
          <p>Washington Gortney arose and said: “Mr.
President—We are here assembled to determine what
is the best method of evading the conscript law and
keeping out of the rebel army. I favor enlisting in
the Federal army. We will then be far more efficient
in defending our government from subversion
by traitors—James Reece, who is seated by yonder
linden tree, and I have proved our faith by our
works. We are soldiers in the Federal army. We
fought at Shiloh and are with the army at Farmington
assisting in the siege of Corinth, and soon we
hope to capture that stronghold and bring deliverance
to the persecuted Unionists in North Mississippi. If
you stay here you will be forced into the rebel army,
or you will be shot or hung, as too many of our
loyal fellow citizens have been. There are already
three hundred from this county in the Federal army,
and four hundred from Franklin, the county contiguous
to this in North Alabama. Leave your families;
it will be only for a short time. Corinth will fall
and before the Fourth of July this county, and probably
the whole state, will be delivered from rebel
<pb id="aughey81" n="81"/>
domination. I will make this motion: Be it resolved, that
we believe it to be conducive to the best interests of
ourselves personally, and the Union cause, to which we
will ever adhere, for all of suitable military age to escape
to the Federal army now besieging Corinth and to enlist
in that army.”</p>
          <p>Carle Ritter arose and said: “With all my heart I
second this motion, and I hope that it may be adopted
with entire unanimity. Our numbers have been more than
decimated by rebel violence within the last month, and I
firmly believe that this resolution presents the best
method of securing our own safety and overthrowing
this ungodly rebellion against the best government that
ever existed on earth—a rebellion inaugurated by slave
holders in the interests of an institution we detest.”</p>
          <p>The president called for remarks. Several made brief
addresses in favor of its passage. It was then passed
with entire unanimity.</p>
          <p>At this juncture ominous sounds were heard. Dark
forms were seen on the hillside to the south. Soon a line
of battle was formed by our foes. We quietly formed in
line on the north hillside They dispatched a messenger
who crossed the ravine to inform us that they were
friends. John Beck hurried over and found that they had
a former countersign, but he saw Bill Robinson and
Major Ham at the head of the line. Then we knew that we
had been betrayed and must fight for our lives without hope
of quarter if defeated. We told them not to
<pb id="aughey82" n="82"/>
approach a step nearer as we knew their character.
Major Ham was in command of this force sent to destroy
us. He crossed the ravine and informed us that he
had been within twenty feet of the president
of the meeting, had heard the speeches and resolutions passed,
was cognizant of our traitorous designs against the Southern
Confederacy, and informed us that we must surrender unconditionally,
give up our arms, and be sent as prisoners to Corinth. He would
give us ten minutes for consultation. Should we refuse he would not hold
himself responsible for the consequences. He feared that we would
all be put to death. We replied that we would not surrender but
would stand for our lives and do the best we could, if attacked.
He retired, deprecating our course. They were startled
at our apparent
numbers. They were led to believe that there were but few of us, and that
our disparity of force compared with theirs would lead us to surrender
at once. Had we surrendered not one of us would have left that glen
alive. The gathering clouds indicated the near approach of a storm.
The lightening flashed, the thunder rolled, the rain commenced to
fall in torrents. In the midst of the storm, Ham's men advanced
and delivered a volley. James Brown fell dead at my side. Smith
Burgess was shot through the left hand. We returned the fire with
effect. The women crowded round the spring in terror, all except
Sadie Beck and Sallie Ritter, who from behind two trees kept up
an incessant fire with navy repeaters. This indecisive
<pb id="aughey83" n="83"/>
contest had continued for an hour. The
storm had passed and the moon shone brightly,
no cloud intervening. John Beck detached nineteen men,
passed down the glen, and making a circuit approached from the summit
of the hill in the rear of Ham's men. Our fire slacking somewhat, Ham
resolved on a charge across the ravine. As they crossed the ravine we
fired rapidly; one man approaching me I emptied all the chambers
of my revolver. He did the same with his. I was now without any means
of defense. He approached and raised his revolver to strike me with it.
I struck first and he fell unconscious at my feet. At that moment I
received a blow on my head and fell unconscious on
my prostrate foe. The last sounds I heard were the cheers of Beck
and his men coming down the hill in the rear of Ham. When
consciousness returned I was lying on a bed in a cabin surrounded
by forest trees. Two ladies were the only persons present in the cabin,
one of whom was seated at my bedside. On the green-sward in front
of the door lay a man bound with cords. Gortney and Reece were seated
on the ground near him. Gortney had recognized him as the guerilla
who had murdered his brother only a week before because of his Unionism,
and for this crime declared that he must die. At the moment of my fall Ham
and his force, finding themselves assaulted in front and rear, precipitately
retreated, leaving the Unionists masters of the field. Six were
killed outright, two Unionists and four rebels. The
<pb id="aughey84" n="84"/>
dead were buried in separate graves on the hillside. I
pleaded for the life of Bill Hodge, but Gortney was
inexorable. I told him that I forgave Hodge for the wound
he had inflicted upon me. Gortney and Reece went to
procure me some water. After considerable persuasion I
secured the consent of the ladies and after receiving a
solemn oath from Hodge that he would not reveal the
whereabouts of the cabin or anything to our injury I
severed the cords that bound him and let him loose. He
sprang away nimbly, and was ascending a knoll fifty
yards distant when the sharp report of a rifle rang out on
the morning, air and I saw Hodge fall. When Gortney
reached him he was dead. He and Reece buried him where
he fell.</p>
          <p>On the evening preceding this the vigilantes had tried
and immediately hung George Payson and Rhoderick
Murchison. They compelled them to dig their own
graves, and then hung them and buried them in the
graves they had dug. They had insisted upon being
buried. The vigilantes said, “Yes, we'll bury you, but you
shall dig your graves.”</p>
          <p>Payson said that he was a citizen of Bay Minette,
Baldwin Co., Ala., and Murchison claimed his residence
in Citronelle, Mobile Co., in the same state. He had
removed from Multona Springs, Miss., a few months
before. They said when arrested that they were 
<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">en route</hi></foreign>
to Enola, Butler Co., Ky., to visit friends. Upon searching
them a letter was found on the person of Payson which
read thus:</p>

<salute><hi rend="italics">Dear Geo.:</hi></salute></opener>
                  <p>The Confederate authorities are becoming very cruel.
They have incarcerated a number of our neighbors in a
filthy prison, and forced several into their army. They
say traitors to their Confederacy must die the death of
dogs. My brothers, Leonidas and Perceval, have not
slept at home for a month. More than fifty Unionists are
in hiding. Good guides are difficult to procure. Two are
expected from Selma soon, and we trust they will be
successful in conducting to the Federal lines a large
company. Gillam, Gilson, and Gillette, three Unionists of
Seguin, Guadalupe Co., Texas, arrived here yesterday.
They had many hairbreadth adventures in reaching this
place. They were pursued by hounds, but succeeded in
poisoning the dogs. They were compelled to leave Lee
Ayler, who started with them, sick at the house of that
staunch Unionist, Hornbrook Gradwohl. O, the troublous
times we have fallen upon. I hear while I write the
howling of the hounds in search of my brothers and other
Unionists, led by those terrible vigilantes. But I feel sure
that they will not be able to find them, thanks to the
swamp, Little Dismal, and their knowledge of all the
successful methods of destroying the scent and of
evading or killing the dogs. I must close. I have to prepare
food for the hidden ones. It will be taken to them to-night.
Dear cousin, the loyal people will
<pb id="aughey86" n="86"/>
never be satisfied till the cruel perpetrators of so
great outrages upon them are adequately punished.
They deserve a severe penalty for the crimes committed
to promote the interests of a usurpation organized to
destroy the best government this world has ever known,
and to perpetuate an institution subversive of the rights
of man.</p>

          <p>This letter led the vigilantes to infer that Payson and
Murchison were endeavoring to escape to the Federal
lines. They were convicted and hanged, and buried in the
grave they were compelled to dig.</p>
          <p>I received three citations to appear on a certain day to
be enrolled to attend muster as a conscript. I paid
no attention to the citations. At length I received this

          <p>When I received this summons I called a meeting of
the Unionists. Several had on the same day received
similar official notices to attend the court-martial. We
spent a whole night in consultation. We were one
hundred strong, and I advocated attending in a body,
properly armed, and, if necessary, to accept the
<pb id="aughey87" n="87"/>
gage of battle, but McElhinny and Scotland's wives had
learned that a large force of cavalry from Corinth would be
sent to assist the vigilantes. The majority refused to
credit this report till a note was read from Miss May Coe,
who was a spy in our interest. We could not doubt the
authenticity of her information, corroborative of
Mesdames McElhinny and Scotland's report. We then
resolved as a dernier resort to make the attempt to reach
Farmington, where the Federal army was encamped
besieging Corinth. When I reached Rienzi it was evident
that the Confederates were evacuating Corinth. On the 1st
day of June (the day appointed for the convening of the
court-martial) I had the pleasure of once more beholding
the star spangled banner, as it was borne in front of
General Gordon Granger's command, which led the van of
the pursuing army. Thus for the present I escaped death
at the hands of the rebels.</p>
          <p>General W. S. Rosecrans upon his arrival made his
head-quarters at the house of my brother, David H.
Aughey, where I had the pleasure of forming his
acquaintance, and that of Generals Ammen, Smith, Pope,
and others. Tishomingo county was now measurably in
possession of the Federal army. Col. Elliott, in his
successful raid upon Booneville, passed Jim Mock's, at
whose house the court-martial was to convene, scaring
him so greatly that he dared not sleep in his house for
several weeks. The Union cavalry scoured the country in
all directions, and we
<pb id="aughey88" n="88"/>
were rejoicing in the prospect of continuous safety and
freedom from outrage.</p>
          <p>The rebels in their retreat had burned all the cotton
which was accessible to their cavalry on their route. At
night the flames of the burning cotton lighted up the
horizon for miles around. These baleful pyres with their
lurid glare bore sad testimony to the horrors of war. In
this wanton destruction of the great southern staple,
many families lost their whole staff of bread, and
starvation stared them in the face. Many would have
perished had it not been for the liberal contributions of the
North, for learning of the sufferings of the poor of the
South, whose whole supply had been destroyed by
pretended friends, they sent provisions and money, and
thus many who were left in utter destitution were rescued
from perishing by this timely succor. I have often heard
the rejoicings and benedictions of the poor, who,
abandoned by their supposed friends, were saved with
their children from death by the beneficence of those
whom they had been taught to regard as enemies—the
most bitter, implacable, and unmerciful. Their prayer
might well be, “Save us from our friends, whose tender
mercies are cruel.” I have never known a man to burn his
own cotton, and I have heard bitter anathemas and fierce
invective hurled at those who thus robbed them, and their
denunciations were loud and deep against the
government which authorized such cruelty. It is true
those who lose their cotton, if secessionists, receive a
promise to pay, which all regard as not worth the
<pb id="aughey89" n="89"/>
paper upon which it is written. Ere pay day those who are
dependent upon their cotton for the necessaries of life
would have passed that bourne whence no traveler
returns.</p>
          <p>“Tis like the Confederate bonds—at first they were
made payable two years after date, and they were
printed upon paper so worthless that it would be entirely
worn out in six months, and the promise to pay
would have become illegible in half that time. The
succeeding issues were made payable six months
after the ratification of a treaty of peace between the
United States and the Confederate States. Though not a
prophet, nor a prophet's son, I venture the prediction that
those bonds will never become due. The war of
elements, the wreck of matter, and the crash of worlds
announcing the final consummation of all things will be
heard sooner.</p>
          <p>As the prospect was so favorable that this whole
region of country would soon be in the hands of the
Federal troops and occupied by them, I deemed it safe
to return to my father-in-law's, in the south-eastern
part of Tishomingo Co. I applied to Gen. Rosecrans
for a pass through the lines for myself, wife, and child.
Gen. Rosecrans went with me to see General Pope, and
after introducing me and vouching for my loyalty, asked
him for the pass I desired. Gen. Pope said that he had issued
orders to the effect that no passes through the lines should
be granted for a specified time. Gen. Rosecrans then proffered
to send Captain Gilbert, one of his staff officers, with
<pb id="aughey90" n="90"/>
us beyond the lines. This he said was done in
consideration of the kindness I had shown him and staff
upon his arrival in Rienzi. He told me that the rebels were
over there in the woods not more than a fourth of a mile
distant, and that they were about to move upon them. He
advised me to return to Rienzi till the rebels were driven
farther south. We were then near Mr. McClaren's, seven
miles from Rienzi, on the road to Booneville. I resolved to
run the risk, as Mrs. Aughey was anxious to return to her
father's. We started and had not gone far when the
screaming shells and bursting bombs came howling
through the valley. Then followed the rattle of musketry,
and presently the impinging of steel. The din of battle
sounded in our ears. Suddenly a shell, screeching like a
howling demon, passed over us. The pomp and
circumstance of glorious war were displayed to our
startled gaze. A retrograde was as dangerous as a forward
movement, and we persistently followed our leader,
Captain Gilbert, Our child, not realizing the danger,
laughed merrily at the grand panorama. Soon a charge was
sounded and the rebels fled pell-mell, pursued vigorously
by the victorious boys in blue. I had no fear for my own
personal safety because of the excitement, but feared
greatly that some of the missiles might injure wife or child.
But they seemed to bear a charmed life, for though the air
was full of messengers of death, and many whistled by in
close proximity, none did us the least injury. Several times
when a shell exploded near, our horse reared
<pb id="aughey91" n="91"/>
and plunged, to the imminent peril of the occupants of
the vehicle. Before the noise of the battle had wholly
ceased my wife pointed to a navy repeater lying on the
ground. I descended from the buggy and secured it.</p>
          <p>At this time all marketable commodities were
commanding fabulous prices. Flour sold at $30 per
barrel, bacon 40 cents per pound, coffee one dollar per
pound; salt was nominally one hundred dollars per
sack of one hundred pounds, but there was none to
be obtained even at that high price. All manufactured
goods were very costly. Upon the occupation of the
country by Federal troops goods could be obtained
at reasonable prices, but our money was all expended
except Confederate bonds, which were worthless.
Planters who lived beyond the lines of the retreating
rebel army had cotton, but they feared to sell it as the
rebels called it treason to trade with the invaders, and
threatened to inflict the penalty in every case. As there
was no penalty attached to the selling of cotton by one
Mississippian to another, my Unionist friends offered
to sell their cotton to me for whatever price I could afford
to pay. I was also solicited to act as their agent in the
purchase of commodities. I agreed to this risk because of
the urgent need of my friends, many of whose families
were destitute of the indispensable necessaries of life. I
thought it was better that one should take a great risk than that
many people should perish. By this arrangement
my Unionist friends would escape the punishment
<pb id="aughey92" n="92"/>
meted out to those who were found guilty of trading with
the Yankees; if discovered I alone would be amenable to
their unjust and, under the appalling environment,
extremely cruel and vindictive law, and my friends would
thus save their cotton liable to be destroyed at any moment
by a dash of rebel cavalry. I sold their cotton, procured
supplies for the famishing, and thus relieved the wants of
many. I did not charge one cent for commission fees, and
expended one hundred dollars of my own money to furnish
provisions for families utterly destitute, some of whom had
not tasted food for days. One day I rode into Iuka to the
head-quarters of Gen. Wm. Nelson. The Gen. told me that he
learned that Norman's bridge over Bear creek was held by a
force of rebels. He asked me if I could send one or two
Union men to that place to ascertain the number and
position of the troops holding that point. I replied that I
could. I secured the services of Wm. and John Thompson,
who were brothers and staunch Unionists, to accomplish
this hazardous undertaking. Only one of them succeeded. He
got through on the pretext that he was desirous of getting
medicine for his sick wife. He gave the diagnosis, procured
the medicine at a cost of three dollars, and returned. During
his brief stay he learned the probable number and
disposition of the troops stationed at the bridge, and
discovered the vulnerable point and recommended a plan of
attack. I conveyed his report to Gen. Nelson. The next night
the attack was made and not a rebel soldier
<pb id="aughey93" n="93"/>
escaped death or capture. Thus was Norman's
bridge captured and destroyed.</p>
          <p>One day I rode over to Mr. Holland Lindsay's on
business. I had learned that he was a rabid secessionist,
but supposed that no rebel cavalry had come
so far north as his house since the evacuation of Corinth.
Mr. Lindsay had gone to a neighbor's. His
wife was engaged in weaving. She was a coarse,
masculine woman, and withal possessed of a strong
prejudice against all whom she did not like, but an
especial hatred of the Yankees rankled in her bosom.
I sat down to await the return of her husband. Soon
Mrs. Lindsay broached the exciting topic of the day,
the war. She thus vented her spleen against the
Yankees:</p>
          <p>“There wur a Yankee critter company (cavalry) come
along here last week. They hearn a noise an' thought our
troops waz a comin' so they drawed up in two streaks of
fight right in front ov our house. Arter a while they axed
me ef I haddent seen no rebels scoutin' round here lately.
I jes' tole' em it warnt none ov their bizness. Them nasty,
no-account scamps callin' our men rebels. Them triflin',
nigger-stealin' scoundrels. They runs off our niggers an'
won't let us take 'em to Mexico an' the other territories.”</p>
          <p>I ventured to remark, “The Yankees are mean indeed,
not to let <hi rend="italics">us</hi> take <hi rend="italics">our</hi> negroes to the territories and not
help catch them for <hi rend="italics">us</hi> when they run off.”</p>
          <p>The emphatic us and our nettled her, as none of
<pb id="aughey94" n="94"/>
the Lindsays had ever owned a negro, being classed by
the white <sic corr="nabors">nabobs</sic> as poor white trash, nor did I ever own
a slave.</p>
          <p>She replied: “I've hearn that you is a tory.” She
became reticent, indeed quite morose. I concluded
to ride over to Mr. Spigener's, to whose house Mrs.
Lindsay had informed me her husband had gone.
On the way I met Hill's cavalry. One of them
halted me, inquired my name and business, which I
gave. He informed me that Mr. Lindsay had gone
across the fields home and that he was on his way to
Mr. Lindsay's. When we reached Mr. Lindsay's
house we saw him in the yard. I transacted my business
with him as quickly as possible. Some soldiers
had gone into the house. Mrs. Lindsay told them
that I was a double-dyed tory and advised my arrest.
The cavalrymen were all around me. Davis, Lindsay's
nephew, came out and ordered my arrest. He
sent my horse to the stable. After supper my horse
was brought and I was taken to camp. I was now
a prisoner in the hands of my own and my country's
enemies. Four men were detached to guard me during
the night. They ordered me to lie down on the
ground and sleep. The ground was wet and I had
no blanket, so I insisted upon going to Mr. Spigener's,
about one hundred yards distant, to secure a bed.
They would not consent, but I started without
permission. The guards followed me. Mr. Spigener gave
me a bed, the guards remaining in the room watched me
while I slept. The next morning I
<pb id="aughey95" n="95"/>
asked permission to see their captain, whose name was
Hill. I asked to be allowed to return home, informing him
that I had been arbitrarily arrested by some of his men. I
said that I was a civilian and not amenable to military law.
Capt. Hill replied:</p>
          <p>“Are you a Unionist?”</p>
          <p>“I voted the Union ticket, sir.”</p>
          <p>“That is not a fair answer. I voted the ticket myself.
Now I am warring against the Union.”</p>
          <p>“I have seen no valid reason for changing my
sentiments.”</p>
          <p>“You confess, then, that you are a Unionist?”</p>
          <p>“I do. I regard the union of these states as of
paramount importance to the people inhabiting them.”</p>
          <p>“You must go to head-quarters, where you will be
dealt with as we are accustomed to deal with all the
abettors of an abolition government.”</p>
          <p>A guard numbering fifteen were detached to take
charge of me. The apparent leader was a soldier
named Saccapee Vaudreuil, who claimed that he was
a descendant of Pocahontas in the 10th generation.
They then started to convey me to Fulton, the county
seat of Itawamba Co., Miss. When we reached a
cross-roads about 12 miles from the point of starting,
we found a company in charge of a Unionist prisoner
named Benjamin Clarke. We were then placed in
charge of two men, Dr. Crossland, of Burnsville, and
Ferdinand Woodruff. They were under the influence
of liquor and were very insulting in their denunciations
<pb id="aughey96" n="96"/>
of all traitors to the Southern Confederacy. They
detailed to each other a history of their licentious
amours. Dr. Crossland was the father of a very pretty
little girl whose mother was a poor white woman. We
halted for dinner. They asked me to pay for it, which I
did, they promising to refund the money when we
reached Fulton. This they forgot to do.</p>
          <p>On our arrival at Fulton we were taken to the head-quarters
of Col. Bradfute, the commander of the post. My
fellow-prisoner was examined first. Woodruff stated that
they had played off on Clarke. They had visited him as he
was plowing in his field, telling him that they were
Federal soldiers—they were disguised as such—Clarke
assured them that he was a Unionist, and that he hoped
soon to enlist in the Federal army. Bradfute became very
angry upon hearing this, swearing that Clarke ought to be
taken out and shot then, but he said a few days' respite
would make but little difference, as Gen. Beauregard
would not allow such a tory to live long. Said he,
addressing the guards, “Had you hung Clarke you would
have saved us some trouble and have done your country
good service.” The colonel, turning round, glared upon
me with eyes inflamed with passion and liquor, and thus
addressed me: “Are you a Unionist, too?”</p>
          <p>“I am, sir. I have never denied it.”</p>
          <p>“Where do you reside?”</p>
          <p>“My home is Rienzi, Tishomingo Co., Miss.”</p>
          <pb id="aughey97" n="97"/>
          <p>“What is your profession?”</p>
          <p>“I am a minister of the Gospel.”</p>
          <p>“I suppose, then, that you go to the Bible for your politics, and
that you are a sort of higher law man?”</p>
          <p>“My Bible teaches, let every soul be subject to the
higher powers, for there is no power but of God. The
powers that be are ordained of God. Whosoever,
therefore, resisteth the power, resisteth the ordinance of God,
and they that resist shall receive to themselves
damnation. I have seen no valid reason for resistance to
the government under which as a nation we have so
long prospered.”</p>
          <p>“I command you to hush; you shan't preach
treason to me, and if you were to get your deserts you
would be hanged immediately. Have you ever been
within the Federal lines?”</p>
          <p>“I have, sir.”</p>
          <p>“At what points?”</p>
          <p>“Rienzi and Iuka.”</p>
          <p>“When were you at Iuka?”</p>
          <p>“On last Saturday.”</p>
          <p>“Had the Federals a large force at that place, and
who was in command?”</p>
          <p>“They have a large force, and Generals Thomas and
Steedman were in command.”</p>
          <p>“That is contrary to the report of our scouts, who say
that there are but two regiments in the town. I fear you
are purposely trying to mislead us.”</p>
          <p>“Gen. Steedman has but two regiments in the town,
but Gen. Geo. H. Thomas is within striking distance with
a large force.”</p>
          <pb id="aughey98" n="98"/>
          <p>“What was your business at Iuka?”</p>
          <p>“I went there to pay a debt of fifty dollars which
a widow—Mrs. Nixon Paden—owed. She wished
to be paid in Confederate money before it became
worthless.”</p>
          <p>“Have you a Federal pass?”</p>
          <p>“I have none with me, but have one at home.”</p>
          <p>“How does it read?”</p>
          <p>“It was given by Gen. Wm. Nelson, and reads thus:
 ‘The bearer, Rev. John H. Aughey, has permission to
pass backward and forward through the lines of this
division at will.’ ”</p>
          <p>“Where were you born?”</p>
          <p>“In New Hartford, Oneida Co., New York.”</p>
          <p>“Yankee born,” said the colonel, with a sneer, “you
deserve death at the rope's end, and if I had the power I
would hang all Yankees who are among us, for they are
all tories, whatever their pretensions may be.”</p>
          <p>“My being born north of the nigger line, Col., if a
crime worthy of death, was certainly my misfortune, not
my fault, but the fault of my parents. They did not so
much as consult me as to any preference I might have
as to the place of my nativity.”</p>
          <p>Woodruff, one of the guards, now informed Col.
Bradfute that I was a spy, and while the Confederates
were at Corinth had, to his certain knowledge, visited
Nashville, Tenn., carrying information.</p>
          <p>I told Woodruff that his statement was false, and that
he knew that it was utterly without foundation
in fact.</p>
          <pb id="aughey99" n="99"/>
          <p>At the close of the examination, Col. Bradfute and
an officer, who the guards told us was Gen.
Chalmers, spent fifteen or twenty minutes in bitterly
cursing and denouncing all traitors, Yankees, and
tories, as they termed us.</p>
          <p>Gen. Chalmers wrote me from Washington City, while
he was a member of congress, that he was not the officer
who was present with Col. Bradfute. That on that day he
was eight miles east of Fulton, busily engaged in making
preparations for a battle with Gen. Philip Sheridan,
which was fought on the next day; and he asserted that
he would not have treated prisoners with so great
insolence and severity. He also denied any complicity in
the Fort Pillow massacre. This officer, at the <sic corr="insistence">instance</sic> of Col.
Bradfute, wrote to Gen. Pfeiffer. He absented
himself for a short time, and I, from my position behind
his chair, could read the letter. The
following sentences occurred in the document: “An avowed
Unionist. Has done our cause much harm. Advocates
reconstruction at this late day. A pestilent fellow. Has in
our presence uttered treasonable sentiments, and seems
to take pleasure in doing so, He has held treasonable
correspondence with the enemy, and has more than
once acted as a spy.
We can furnish testimony to establish all the above charges.”
We were then placed under guard and
sent to the head-quarters of Gen. Pfeiffer, in Saltillo.
We were brought into the august presence of this
redoubtable general. When he read the letter handed
<pb id="aughey100" n="100"/>
him by the guards, he soundly berated us, and then sent
us out a mile and a half from town, where we were placed
under guard for the night in a small plat of ground
surrounded by a chain. Quite a number of prisoners were
there under guard; it was a sort of guard house, except
that there was no house. No supper was furnished us,
and the bare, cold ground was our bed and the blue
canopy of heaven our covering.</p>
          <p>The next morning we were brought into the presence of
Gen. Pfeiffer. I asked for breakfast. This was refused. I
offered to pay a dollar for a meal, as I was very hungry.
To this he deigned no reply. I then offered three dollars
for a lunch for myself and Clarke. This offer was
arrogantly refused. He said he had no supplies for traitors
at any price.</p>
          <p>Said he, “I learn that you were born in New Hartford,
New York, brought up in Steubenville, Ohio. How long
have you lived in the South?”</p>
          <p>“I have lived in the South eleven years.”</p>
          <p>“Where have you lived?”</p>
          <p>“In Winchester, Clark county, Ky., Baton Rouge, La.,
Memphis, Tennessee, Holly Springs, Miss. My home at
present is Rienzi, Miss.”</p>
          <p>“Are you a slave-holder?”</p>
          <p>“I am not.”</p>
          <p>“Will you take the oath of allegiance to the
Confederate States of America?”</p>
          <p>“I will not.”</p>
          <p>“Have you recently taken the oath of allegiance to
the United States of America?”</p>
          <p>
            <figure id="ill7" entity="aughey101">

          <p>“Where and when?”</p>
          <p>“Gen. Wm. Nelson administered to me the oath June
8th, 1862, at his head-quarters in Iuka, Miss.”</p>
          <p>“Do you regard that oath of any binding force?”</p>
          <p>“I do, most assuredly.”</p>
          <p>“Did you take it voluntarily?”</p>
          <p>“I certainly did.”</p>
          <p>“Do you know that in taking that oath you became
guilty of treason against the Confederate States of
America, and the Republic of Mississippi?”</p>
          <p>“I could not be a traitor to a cause I never espoused,
nor betray the interests of a government which I have
always denounced as a usurpation. I profess to be a
loyal citizen of the state of Mississippi and of the United
States of America, and I hope to see this state, whose
true interests I have ever endeavored to promote, return
to her allegiance to the Federal Union which she has for
the present endeavored to repudiate. I hope the sober
second thought will lead her to see and repent her folly.
Had the secession ordinance been submitted to the
people and a free ballot and a fair count allowed, then
we would have voted it down by a majority of more
than two to one.”</p>
          <p>“Are you a higher law man?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I believe in the command, ‘Let every soul be
subject unto the higher power,’ the powers that be.”</p>
          <p>“Well, the Confederate authorities are the higher
<pb id="aughey102" n="102"/>
powers, and the powers that be. The Confederate
government is the government <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de facto</hi></foreign>, and by the Bible
rule you ought to submit to it as a good citizen.”</p>
          <p>“Any insurrectionary faction usurping temporarily
the reins of government, may have a <foreign lang="lat">de facto</foreign> power to
compel obedience to its behests by those who are
willing to acquiesce rather than endure the penalty for
resistance of its illegal and tyrannical exactions. Mobs in
cities are often the powers that be, and a horde of
bandits have often been the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de facto</hi></foreign> rulers, terrorizing the
people of a wide district, and for a time defying the civil
authorities. I regard the Federal government engaged in
quelling rebellion as the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de jure</hi></foreign> government to which I
owe allegiance. Those who are engaged in rebellion
against this government are traitors to their God,
recreant to their own best interests, and are guilty of
treason against the best government the world has ever
known.”</p>
          <p>“Do you know, sir, that all you have uttered has been
recorded, and that you have spoken these words against
your own life?”</p>
          <p>We were then delivered to the guards, fourteen in
number, and conducted to a hamlet near Verona, where
were the head-quarters of Gen. Sterling Price. We were
brought into the presence of Gen. Thomas Jordan, Gen.
Beauregard's chief of staff. When he read the letter from
Gen. Pfeiffer, handed him by one of the guards, he said,
looking at me sternly:</p>
          <p>“You, sir, are charged with sedition.”</p>
          <pb id="aughey103" n="103"/>
          <p>“What does sedition mean?”</p>
          <p>“It means enough to hang you, you villainous
tory. Where were you born.”</p>
          <p>“In New Hartford, near Utica, Oneida county,
New York.”</p>
          <p>“Born in an abolition state, you doubly deserve to die,
and no mercy or pity should be shown you.”</p>
          <p>“As to the guilt attached to my first seeing the
light in the Empire state, if sin, it is not mine, but the sin
of my parents. But you talk as a veritable son of folly,
and in so doing you reproach God. Parents, native place,
and clime. All appointed were by Him. But I glory in my
native state. New York has never done anything to stain her fair
escutcheon. She has never repudiated her just debts. She
has never nullified Federal laws. She has never attempted
to secede from the Union. Permit me, General, to ask you
where you were born and educated?”</p>
          <p>“I was born in Georgia, and graduated from the
military academy at West Point, in your native
state.”</p>
          <p>“New York may have, in some degree, tarnished
her fair fame by nourishing in her bosom and allowing to
be educated within her borders, a few traitors
to the Federal government, but it is some palliation that it
was not wittingly done.”</p>
          <p>“Do you call me a traitor to my face?”</p>
          <p>“I make no personal application, but allow each one
for himself to draw the inference his own conduct
justifies.”</p>
          <pb id="aughey104" n="104"/>
          <p>“If you were so enamored of New York, why did you
not stay there or return when Mississippi seceded, or
when an act was passed by the congress of the Confederate
States of America, entitled ‘An act respecting alien enemies,’
warning and requiring every male citizen of the United
States, fourteen years old and upward, to depart from the
Confederate States of America within forty days from the
date of the president's proclamation, which was issued
August 14, 1861, this proclamation excepting from its operation
Delaware, Maryland, Kentucky, Missouri, District of Columbia, and
the territories of New Mexico, Arizona, and Indian Territory.”</p>
          <p>“I regard Mississippi as still a member of the Federal Union, and the
act of secession illegal and unconstitutional, and therefore void. I
am a citizen of the United States of America. If the proclamation issued
August 14, 1861, was aimed at and included the Unionists, we
were recognized as citizens of the United States at that date, many
months after the passage of the secession ordinance, and as we have
as often as it has been offered, firmly refused to take the oath of allegiance
to the Confederate States of America, and thereby become citizens of
the Southern Confederacy, we are still, as you must acknowledge,
citizens of the United States of America. If we are citizens of the
Confederate States of America, why so persistently offer us the oath of
allegiance. Many citizens of Germany, Great Britain and Ireland, and other
foreign countries, have long
<pb id="aughey105" n="105"/>
resided in our country and have never taken the oath of
allegiance, or become naturalized. Why not allow
us to remain as residents within, but not as citizens
of, the Confederate States of America?”</p>
          <p>“By your own statement you are an alien enemy of
our Confederacy, and have no rights that we are bound
to respect. You clearly come within the scope of the law
and proclamation. My plan would have been to suffer all
alien enemies to depart in peace who were willing to accept
the offer, and hang those who desired to stay and do us all the
harm they could.”</p>
          <p>“The Unionists are a mighty host. In forty days they could not
dispose of their property.”</p>
          <p>“No, they would not be allowed to take with them any
of their property. Our congress passed a law
to the effect that the property of all in the South who have a
domicile in the North shall escheat to the Confederate States,
and that any of our citizens who are indebted to citizens
of the United States shall, upon payment of three-fourths of
their indebtedness to the treasury of the Confederate States of
America, be liberated from any claim upon them by their alien creditors.”</p>
          <p>“Perfidy personified! Now, sir, suppose the cause of the Union
should triumph, what will become of those like you who have taken
a solemn oath to support the government at whose expense you have
been educated, and then in violation of that oath, and forgetful
of her fostering care, as base ingrates have rebelled and with malice
and prepense are endeavoring to
<pb id="aughey106" n="106"/>
subvert the best government on earth, a government
which has never in person or property inflicted upon
you a single injury, but has bestowed many favors, and
superabundant blessings?”</p>
          <p>“I will never ask clemency from a government I
detest. There is no danger of abolitionism and Puritanism
triumphing. Should they do so I would make my home in
Brazil or Cuba. I will hear no more of your detestable
palaver. Jefferson Davis, in clemency and mercy to the
misguided, issued his proclamation; those who have not
availed themselves of it must bear the terrible and just
consequences.”</p>
          <p>“My friends who expressed their willingness to
accept Jeff Davis' permission to leave, are either dead or
languishing in gloomy prisons. It was only a piece of
treachery on the part of your <hi rend="italics">honorable</hi> president and
his <hi rend="italics">most honorable</hi> congress. But just give me a pass to
go north and I will go instanter.”</p>
          <p>“The first pass you will get will be a free ticket to hell,
where you would have been long ago if the devil had his
due, or the Confederate officers had done their duty.”</p>
          <p>“Thanks, for your kind offer to give me a free ticket to
the infernal regions. I was not aware before that you were
the devil's ticket agent. You have me in your power and
may take my life, but you cannot destroy the
government. It will live long after you and I are dead. But
what right, may I ask, have you, who believe in state
sovereignty, you, a citizen of what you term the republic
of
<pb id="aughey107" n="107"/>
Georgia, to leave your own nation, and crossing the
foreign republic of Alabama, enter the republic of
Mississippi, and interfere with me, one of its humble
citizens, who has never breathed the air of your august
republic to do you or any of the citizens of
your foreign government any harm. This is an
unwarranted and unlawful act, and evinces a high
degree of presumption upon the part of an alien—a
foreigner who has not, I opine, been naturalized
since his advent into our nation, the independent,
sovereign republic of Mississippi.”</p>
          <p>“Did you oppose the secession of Mississippi?”</p>
          <p>“I did, but I now favor it. I trust that she will soon
become convinced of her folly and secede from this
confederation and resume her allegiance to the
Federal union.”</p>
          <p>“That tongue of yours will not long give utterance
to such vile and treasonable sentiments, you ought
upon your capture to have been sent to hell from the
lowest lateral limb of the nearest tree. Corporal of the
guard, take charge of the prisoners.”</p>
          <p>We were soon under way to Tupelo. When we
reached this town we were conducted to the office of
the provost marshal. We underwent an examination
here in presence of officers of high rank, Gen. Braxton Bragg,
Gen. Hardee, and Gen. Sterling Price being among the number.
Their insignia of high rank, their dignified bearing, their resolute
demeanor, their searching and subtle questions, wisely put to
elicit the desired information to secure our condemnation,
<pb id="aughey108" n="108"/>
awed me into reticence. I perceived that my life
hung in a balance, and realized as never before the
necessity of exercising great discretion in giving
answers so as not to provoke these officers (who had
the authority to order my immediate execution), and thus
avoid the doom which a single incautious word would
doubtless precipitate.</p>
          <p>I told General Bragg, in reply to one of his leading
questions, evidently designed to force from my lips a
confession of my guilt, that it was an admitted principle
in law, that no one is required to criminate himself.</p>
          <p>General Sterling Price, who had just completed a
dispatch which he handed to a courier, ordering him to
convey it as speedily as possible to some subaltern in
Verona, with a sharp look and an air of triumph said,
“Your answer, by implication, admits your guilt. You
would, it seems, shelter yourself behind a provision of
the common law, which is suspended in its operation by
martial law, which supersedes civil law during the
continuance of the war. Will you take the oath of
allegiance?”</p>
          <p>“I will not make any admission nor confession, nor
will I take the oath of allegiance.”</p>
          <p>“Well,” said General Bragg, “we will await the
testimony. From the tenor of this paper which I hold in
my hands, there seems to be an abundance of it. We
have too long been lenient with this dangerous class in
our midst. I am inclined to punish them hereafter to the
extent of my authority and the demerit of their
treasonable conduct.”</p>
          <pb id="aughey109" n="109"/>
          <p>Clarke trembled like an aspen, and utterly refused
to make any statement. I felt greatly depressed. I
was hungry, thirsty, greatly fatigued, and mentally
disquieted, knowing that my wife would be much
distressed because of my ominous absence, the cause
of which she could only conjecture.</p>
          <p>We were then taken into the presence of the
commander of the post. The provost marshal's name
was Paden—the name of the commander was Clare.
Gen. Thomas Jordan was now present, as well as the former
named officers of distinguished rank. General Jordan made
a statement. I feared from the interjected utterances of Gen. Bragg
that we would be shot or hung at once. He was very angry, and several
times declared that we deserved immediate execution. At length,
in apparently great excitement and
indignation he called the officer of the guard, and
I feared the worst, but he only ordered him to take us to
the dungeon. We were speedily committed to prison.
When we entered, two men, Capt. Bruce and Lieut. Richard Malone,
men who had been elected to these positions by their fellow prisoners,
received us with a cordial greeting. We told them that we were perishing
from hunger and thirst. Bruce and Malone set two of the prisoners at
work to prepare something for us to eat. Bruce, addressing us, said,
“Our bill of fare is not very extensive nor inviting. We have no coffee,
nor molasses, nor sugar, nor salt, nor beef, nor vegetables. In these
war times we must not be epicures nor expect the luxuries
<pb id="aughey110" n="110"/>
of life, but be content with what we can get,—just what is
indispensable in prolonging existence. We are allowed to
do our own cooking, but that, in the kindness of heart of
the Confederate authorities, is accorded as a favor, an
indispensable sanitary <sic corr="regulation">regulatian</sic>. We have but little
exercise, they say, and exercise being conducive to
health, cooking promotes that object. We will soon have
ready for you some corn-bread and a little meat. The meat
makes up in strength and odor what it lacks in quantity,
and the parasites will impart a freshness to it so that you
will think of fresh meat while chewing it.” The
prison was filthy in the extreme, and full of vermin, even our
food was infested. No brooms were furnished us, and we
could not sweep the floor. No beds or bedding were
provided, and we were compelled to sleep upon the floor
without covering and nothing but the hard planks
underneath us. When night came a space on the floor was
assigned to Clarke and myself. We lay down on our hard
bed and tried to sleep, but our slumbers were sadly
disquieted by the cold and filth and hardness of the floor,
and the graybacks, with which our clothing was already
infested. The building had been an old grocery. Now it
was metamorphosed into a prison. Where we lay the floor
was saturated with molasses. When I tried to rise in the
morning I could not. My coat was apparently hermetically
fastened to the floor. Clarke was in the same condition.
He, through the aid of a fellow prisoner, succeeded in
freeing himself from
<pb id="aughey111" n="111"/>
the adhesive floor. He then assisted in extricating me,
but a part of my coat remained attached to my wooden
couch.</p>
          <p>The crimes charged upon the prisoners were desertion,
trading with the Yankees, adhesion to the Federal
Government or Unionism, enacting the spy, refusing
Confederate bonds and money, piloting the Yankees, the
utterance of treasonable language, etc. The crime of the
negroes, mulattoes, quadroons, and octoroons was
endeavoring to escape from Dixie-land and the Iron
Furnace of slavery, via the underground railroad. These
remained till their masters, learning of their arrest, came for
and released them. On the evening succeeding our
incarceration two prisoners had been led out and shot. I
soon learned that this was not an unusual occurrence.
Nearly every day one or more suffered death as the punishment
of their patriotism. Many of the prisoners
wore heavy fetters. Some were handcuffed, had fetters
on their ankles, and were chained to bolts in the
floor. Often, without previous warning, the guards
came, accompanied by an officer or two, usually two
officers, and marched the poor prisoners to the fatal
spot and shot them to death or ended their existence
by suspension from the gallows. The two prisoners
who were shot a few hours after we entered the prison
were named Jerome B. Poole and Calvin Harbaugh.
Being Unionists, they refused to take the arms offered
them, when they were arrested and brought in as
conscripts. Poole was from Brazella, and Harbaugh
<pb id="aughey112" n="112"/>
from Shuqualak, Noxubee Co., Miss. They were then
suspended by the thumbs till they begged the officers to
order them to be shot, as they preferred death to such
excruciating torture. After the endurance of every
refinement of cruel torture, they were at length brought to
Tupelo, tried, and condemned to be shot to death. They
inferred by a remark made by one of the officers who
brought us into prison that I was a minister. Poole came
to me and told me that they would be shot at sunset, and
wished me to explain to Harbaugh more fully the way of
salvation. He had tried to do so in a feeble way, but
feared that he had not made it sufficiently plain to the
mind of his friend. Harbaugh then asked me what he must
do to be saved. I replied, “Believe on the Lord Jesus
Christ and thou shalt be saved. You must exercise faith in
Jesus Christ. Come to Jesus just as you are, not waiting
to cleanse your soul from one dark blot. Do not tarry till
you are better. Away from Christ you will only become
more guilty. Come with all your guilt and fear oppressed,
and say God be merciful to me a sinner. Ask him to receive
you and forgive you, and adopt you into his family
and make you one of his dear children by adopting
love and grace for Christ's sake.”</p>
          <p>Harbaugh asked, “What is faith in Jesus Christ?”</p>
          <p>“Faith in Jesus Christ is a saving grace whereby
we receive and rest upon him alone for salvation as
he is offered to us in the gospel.”</p>
          <p>“But Poole says I must be born again—that I
must have a change of heart.”</p>
          <pb id="aughey113" n="113"/>
          <p>“The bible tells us that whosoever believeth that Jesus
is the Christ, is born of God. Ye are all the children of God
by faith in Jesus Christ. Therefore if a man be in Christ he
is a new creature. He is born again. And as Moses lifted
up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of
Man be lifted up, that whosoever believeth in Him should
not perish but have eternal life. Whosoever believeth then
has eternal life, and whosoever has eternal life surely sees
and enters the kingdom of God, so that whosoever
believeth is born again. For God so loved the world that
he gave his only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth
in Him should not perish but have everlasting life. God
loved and gave, we believe and have, and this is all of it to
attain life and experience the new birth.”</p>
          <p>“I do believe on Jesus Christ and accept him as my
Savior. I have never been baptized. Will you baptize
me?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I will, gladly.”</p>
          <p>Capt. Bruce asked one of the guards to call an officer.
When the officer came he sent a prisoner under guard for
water. Harbaugh now told me that his father was a
Baptist minister, and that be had taught him that the true
scriptural mode of baptism was by immersion. An officer
was called to whom the request was preferred that I
should be allowed to immerse the prisoner in Old Town
creek near by. Old Town creek is a tributary of the
Tombigbee river. The officer returned stating that the
military
<pb id="aughey114" n="114"/>
authorities absolutely refused to grant this request,
believing it a ruse to secure an opportunity to effect
an escape. Harbaugh said that he would submit to baptism
by pouring or sprinkling, though he did not believe
it to be the scriptural mode. He trusted that the good Lord
would look upon the sincerity of his intentions to obey
his command, which he was doing to the extent of his ability
and opportunity. He did not think the Lord would require an
impossibility.</p>
          <p>In the presence of the prisoners and in the most
solemn manner possible (the circumstances enhanced the
solemnity), the ordinance was administered. Just at its close food
prepared by the prisoners was brought and offered these men. They
took it in their hands, but ere it was tasted the sun began to
dip his disk beneath the western horizon, the dreaded
squad appeared before the door. These men, putting away
the food untasted, said “We go to eat bread in the kingdom of
God. Pray for us that we may have grace to deport ourselves
with becoming dignity and propriety in our last moments. Farewell
till we meet before the great white throne. You will probably come
soon, for our foes are cruel as the grave.”</p>
          <p>The officers unlocked their gyves, led them out, and we saw
them no more. A half dozen captured slaves seated in a corner
of the prison, led by a young octoroon, sang some hymns. They called
them spiritual songs. The following, to the tune,
<pb id="aughey115" n="115"/>

        <p>Our privations were so great from a lack of good,
wholesome food and pure water—for the scanty supply of
water allowed us was tepid and foul—and from a want of
beds, cots, couches, or something better than a filthy
floor whereon to sleep, that I resolved upon an attempt
to escape at the risk of my life. I felt sure that I could not
long survive the horrors of this prison-pen. As soon as
my arrest became known to the 32d Mississippi regiment,

regiment had been educated at this college during my
connection with it. Owing me a debt of gratitude as they
professed, could I expect less than the manifestation of
deep sympathy with me in my sad condition—confined in
a gloomy dungeon, deprived of the comforts, yea, even
the necessaries, of life, and menaced and insulted by
the officers in whose power I was? Some of these
officers had publicly expressed themselves under great
obligations to me for the thorough moral, mental, and
physical training their daughters had received while
under my care. In proof of this I have their own
statements published in the public journals of the day.
Whatever may have been my hopes, they were doomed
to disappointment. These summer friends, so
obsequious in my prosperity, conversed for a time upon
indifferent topics, never alluding to my condition, and I
did not obtrude it upon their attention, except that Capt.
Lowrey, looking around upon the prisoners clanking
their chains as they moved uneasily, trying to secure a
less painful posture, said this is war—grim-visaged war
with all its attendant horrors. When they left they said,
“We will call soon again.” I replied, “Do so, gentlemen,
you will always find me at home,” yet I was hoping they
would not—my mind was bent upon and occupied with
the high resolve of escaping or dying in the attempt,
and even then I was maturing a plan to compass that
end.</p>
        <pb id="aughey118" n="118"/>
        <p>A young gentleman and his sister, by virtue of a pass,
entered our prison. They conversed with the prisoners
freely. An officer escorted the young lady to the part of
the prison which I occupied. She enquired naively:
“What is the charge against this prisoner?” The officer
replied that I was an avowed Unionist. She said to me,
“Are you a merchant?” I replied that I was a minister.</p>
        <p>“Of what church?”</p>
        <p>“Of the Presbyterian church.”</p>
        <p>“We are Presbyterians,” said she.</p>
        <p>She then made inquiries about Reverends Wm. A.
Gray, of Ripley, Jno. H. Miller, of Pontotoc, Jas. Stafford,
of Danville, Dr. E. T. Baird, of Crawfordsville, J. N.
Carothers, of Okolona, R. Henderson, of Danville, and
others. While she conversed with me the officer visited
another part of the prison. She then said <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">taisez vous</hi></foreign>, and
slipped into my hand a note. She gave me her name as
Miss Daisy Carson.</p>
        <p>The note was written with a pencil, and read:</p>

        <p>A prisoner came to me and said, “Chaplain, I have
been informed that I will be shot to-morrow, and I am
not prepared to die.”</p>
        <p>“What was your offense?”</p>
        <p>“I was a Unionist—was forced into the army.
I deserted, they followed me with blood-hounds. When
<pb id="aughey120" n="120"/>
the hounds came near I got my back against a tree, and
with a knotty club of pecan wood I killed six hounds. The
cavalry came up and fired upon me. I fell, wounded in the
head and left arm. The wounds were not very severe.
They brought me to Tupelo, and I had my trial yesterday
by court-martial. My captain, who just now left, informed
me that on tomorrow I would be shot as a deserter.”</p>
        <p>“What is your name?”</p>
        <p>“My name is John R. Witherspoon. I was born in
Sumter, South Carolina, but have lived in Bolivar,
Tennessee, for ten years. I have a wife and seven
children, six are girls. The baby, John R. Witherspoon,
Jr., is my only boy. My oldest daughter, Gertrude Maud,
named for her mother, is fifteen years old. She is a good
scholar, has a talent for music and painting. All my
children are devotedly attached to their parents. What
will become of them God only knows.
I own one hundred acres of land in McNairy Co.,
Tennessee. My wife's mother gave her a colored girl. I am
a poor man and will leave my family dependent. I am a
member of the Presbyterian church, but have been living
in the neglect of duty for some time, and now I must die
unprepared.”</p>
        <p>“What caused your neglect?”</p>
        <p>“I became a candidate for office, and as it was
customary to treat a great deal when canvassing the
district, I did so. I formed convivial habits that were
disastrous to devotional duties. I became negligent
<pb id="aughey121" n="121"/>
and absented myself from the church. My wife and
family are faithful, and many prayers are sent up to
heaven in my behalf. O, if I were rescued from this
impending doom I would, by the grace of God, no longer
neglect duty.”</p>
        <p>I pointed him as well as I could to the Lamb of
God that taketh away the sin of the world.
We went up into a corner of the prison and knelt down. I
prayed God to heal his back-sliding and restore to him the
joy of His salvation, then asked him to offer up a prayer in
his own behalf. He did so in language and with an unction
that surprised me. At the close he earnestly implored God
to spare his life for the sake of his dear family. He asked
to be longer spared that he might atone in some degree
for his past remissness in duty by devoting all the days of
his allotted time to faithful service in his heavenly
father's vineyard. I asked him if he entertained any
hope. He replied that he did, and wished he could
live to test its genuineness, but he had some fear.</p>
        <p>And now came still evening on. Mr. Witherspoon
volunteered to go for water. He took two buckets,
one in each hand. Two guards accompanied him,
one on each side. He drew the water and started
back. It was now dark; when he reached a clump
of bushes he dropped one bucket and raising
the other he dashed it in the faces of the guards, and sprang
for the bushes. The guards speedily brought their
muskets to bear, fired in the direction of the fugitive,
and instead of pursuing at once, ran to the tents of
<pb id="aughey122" n="122"/>
some officers and gave the alarm. The whole camp was
soon intensely excited and hundreds joined in the
pursuit. A cry would be heard, “Here he goes.” A few
minutes later in an opposite direction the same cry would
be taken up. Unionists impressed into the service did this
to contribute to the escape of the prisoner. He made good
his escape, and succeeded after some time in getting his
family conveyed to the North, through the kindness of
Major General Hatch. An account of his escape has been
published. He encountered much difficulty in avoiding
the bloodhounds. At one time he heard their howling in
his rear, and not more than a mile distant. He came to a
field in which cattle were grazing. He sprang upon the
back of an ox, and using a goad he compelled the ox to
carry him across the field in a direction that broke the trail
and baffled pursuit.</p>
        <p>His final adventure, his last peril before his safety was
insured, may be worth narrating. One day as he lay
concealed in a ditch he heard in the remote distance in
the direction whence he came the faint howling of
hounds. The sound became more and more distinct, till
he became convinced that they were pursuing him and
had found his track. He arose from his moist bed, and
hastened onward with all the speed his enfeebled
condition would permit. He had not gone far till he
descried another fugitive a short distance in advance. He
called upon him to halt. The man obeyed. He gave his
name as John Denver. The vigilantes of the vendetta, as
they called themselves,
<pb id="aughey123" n="123"/>
had attacked his house last night. He had defended
himself. They fired through a window, wounded
him and killed his little daughter Nellie. He rushed
out, slew the murderer of his child, and wounded two
others. They beat a hasty retreat. He had lost an
ear, and had a flesh wound in the left thigh which
made travel difficult. He was on his way to Corinth
to get assistance from the Federal commander, so that
he and his family might go North. The howling of
the hounds indicated to him that the vigilantes had
been reinforced and were in pursuit of him. As rapidly
as possible these panting fugitives made their
way toward Corinth. The hounds gained upon them.
Mr. Denver had two revolvers. He gave his companion one
of them, and they both resolved to sell their lives as dearly
as possible. The hounds were
but a mile distant, when, to their joy, they suddenly met
a regiment of Federal cavalry on a scouting expedition.
They as quickly as possible explained the situation of
affairs. The colonel ordered the regiment
to fall back out of sight. He ordered a company to
dismount and conceal themselves in the chaparral, he
sending their horses back. He requested Witherspoon
and Denver to climb two small trees and await their
pursuers. He then joined the company in ambush.
When the pursuers came up they ordered the fugitives
to come down from the trees. There were twenty of the
vigilantes. They asked Witherspoon who he was. He
replied, “A prisoner from Tupelo, escaping to the
Federal lines.” After a few moments'
<pb id="aughey124" n="124"/>
consultation, they told these men that they had but five
minutes to live; and if they wished to say their prayers
they might spend the time in that way. They had but one
rope, which they had brought to use in hanging Denver,
but one of their number furnished a halter, taking it from
his horse's neck. Two men approached, threw the nooses
over the heads of their victims and adjusted them. They
then selected two lateral limbs protecting from a tree near
by, threw the ends of the ropes over them and were
awaiting the order of Jack Clinkskales, their leader, to
consummate their murderous purpose, when a volley
from the ambushed Federal troopers made sixteen of
them bite the dust. The four survivors rushed to their
horses, but a second volley caused them to fall bereft of
life. The bodies were scrutinized closely to be sure that
life was extinct. They were then piled up in the chaparral,
and the hounds killed. Upon the return of the regiment a
few hours after a drove of wild hogs were found feeding
upon them. Thus perished a hand of desperadoes not fit
to live, less fit to die. Mr. Denver's family were brought
into Corinth in an ambulance, and soon after came North
to Evansville, Indiana. Mr. Denver enlisted in the Federal
army, and did effective service in his country's cause.
Mr. Witherspoon also enlisted in the Federal service. He
died on the field of honor. He was instantly killed on the
1st day of the battle of Gettysburg. Mrs. Witherspoon
thus wrote me:</p>

hoped to meet you again, but Providence otherwise
ordered it. His death is a sad bereavement to me
and the dear children. But God makes no mistakes, and I

to be the husband of the widow and the father
of the fatherless. I trust implicitly in the promises
of a covenant-keeping God. The tone of my dear
husband's piety was very different after his imprisonment
in Tupelo. He seemed to think that he could not do too
much to show his gratitude to the God who in his providence
delivered him from the execution of the death sentence already
pronounced by the court-martial, and which only lacked a few
hours of fulfillment at the time of his escape. Pray for me

          <head>OLD PILGARLIC.</head>
          <p>An elderly gentleman was ushered into prison on
the morning of the 2d of July, 1862. He seemed
anxious to convince the officer who accompanied the
guard that he was mistaken in regard to some
abstruse question. As soon as the officer left, I approached
the prisoner, and after gaining his confidence, drew from him
his sad history. His true name was Prof. Lorimer Vickroy Yarbrough,
a native of Fincastle, Va. He had resided in Austin,
Texas, and New Orleans, La. He loved the old
flag, and resolved to reach the North, in company
with his son Oscar. By some means suspicion was
aroused, and they were taken from the steamboat at
Vicksburg, Miss., and thrown into prison, where
they languished for months. At length, through the
aid of Unionist friends they escaped from prison, and
in due time from the city of Vicksburg.</p>
          <p>Prof. Yarbrough had a friend named Leroy
Paden, living in Hazelhurst, Miss., upon whom he
could depend for aid. He also held a note overdue for
two thousand dollars, upon a gentleman who resided
in Brookhaven, in Lincoln county, Miss. Could he
collect the money due on this note it would assist him
materially in making his way to the North. On
the border of Copiah county, they were arrested by a
committee of vigilantes, and thrown into an extemporized
prison. Here they were immured six weeks
and fed on corn bread and water. At length, Oscar
<pb id="aughey127" n="127"/>
enlisted in a company bound for the seat of war in
Virginia, with the intention of deserting upon the
first favorable opportunity. His father was still held
a prisoner. Now malarial fever of a malignant type supervened.
During its progress reason left her throne, but a naturally vigorous
constitution triumphed, and the prisoner began to convalesce.
Hearing the attendants say he had known nothing for three weeks,
Prof. Yarbrough resolved upon a ruse which he hoped would give
him an opportunity to escape. He would, by the use of incoherent
expressions and singular conduct, feign madness. In
the course of time, health returned, and the military
authorities sent him to Gen. Beauregard at Tupelo.
Gen. Beauregard believed him to be a malingerer, and
sent for two alienists to decide upon his sanity. On the 12th
of June, 1862, the commission to determine the sanity of the prisoner
convened. A number of officers of high rank were present.</p>
          <p>I will give the account of the examination in Yarbrough's language:</p>
          <p>“I was brought in under guard, a seat furnished me, and the farce
commenced.</p>
          <p>“Gen. Beauregard enquired, ‘What is your name?’</p>
          <p>“ ‘My name, Capting, air old Pilgarlic.’</p>
          <p>“Gen. B.—‘What does that mean?’</p>
          <p>“ ‘It means old Baldhead. You see, Capting, I hain't got no har
on top of my head. I was born so, and when some growed on, a
nigger girl spilled some rusma on my crown, and I hain't hed no har
sence.’</p>
          <pb id="aughey128" n="128"/>
          <p>“Gen. B.—‘Well, old Pilgarlic, you are in a
bad fix.’</p>
          <p>“ ‘Yes, Capting, and ef I hed as soft a skull as
sum of these here young chaps, I could raze har to sell.’</p>
          <p>“Gen. B.—‘Where do you live?’</p>
          <p>“  ‘I live in a cabin with a stick chimly, in Arkansaw.’</p>
          <p>“Gen. B.—‘Does your chimney draw well?’</p>
          <p>“  <corr>‘</corr>Yes, Capting, it draws the 'tention of every fool that passes
on that trail.’</p>
          <p>“Gen. B.—‘Are you a married man?’</p>
          <p>“ ‘Not now, I ain't, but I spect to be before long, fur you see, Capting,
I hev the refusal of mor'n half a dozen widders.’</p>
          <p>“Gen. B.—‘Where did you say you were from?’</p>
          <p>“ ‘From every place but this, an' ef you'll jis send them
fellers away with the guns an' bayonets I'll be away from this
in a giffy, that is, providin' you takes this jewelry off'n my legs an' wrists.’</p>
          <p>“Gen. B.—‘Pilgarlic, what's your opinion about this war?’</p>
          <p>“ ‘I thinks, Capting, that no Southerner ort to fight agin
liberty, nor no Yankee agin his country.’</p>
          <p>“Gen. B.—‘Where's your son?’</p>
          <p>“ ‘Well Capting, I duzzent know. He give me the slip. I spec he went
off ter the war.’</p>
          <p>“Gen. B.—‘Well, sir, your son attempted to desert to the enemy, and
he now lies in prison with a ball and chain attached to his ankle.’</p>
          <pb id="aughey129" n="129"/>
          <p>“I then commenced to sing as loudly as I could:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Spread all her canvas to the breeze,</l>
            <l>Set every threadbare sail,</l>
            <l>And give her to the god of storms,</l>
            <l>The lightning and the gale.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>“The General ordered me to cease. I heeded him not,
and sang:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>When a deed is done for freedom,</l>
            <l>Through the broad earth's aching breast</l>
            <l>Runs a thrill of joy prophetic, trembling on</l>
            <l>From east to west;</l>
            <l>And the slave, where'er he cowers,</l>
            <l>Feels the soul within him climb</l>
            <l>To the awful verge of manhood,</l>
            <l>As the energy sublime,</l>
            <l>Of a century bursts full blossomed</l>
            <l>On the stormy stem of time.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>“The alienists felt my pulse and inserted a thermometer
into my mouth, which I crushed between my teeth. I then sang, or rather
shouted vociferously:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Oh! For an hour of youthful joy,</l>
            <l>Give me back my twentieth spring,</l>
            <l>I'd rather laugh a bright-haired boy,</l>
            <l>Than reign a gray-haired king.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>“At this juncture Gen. Beauregard ordered the guards to make
me hush. I then yelled, for it could not be called singing:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Prudent on the council train,</l>
            <l>Dauntless on the battle plain,</l>
            <l>Ready at the country's need</l>
            <l>For her glorious cause to bleed.</l>
          </lg>
          <pb id="aughey130" n="130"/>
          <p>“By the general's order the guards bound and gagged
me. The alienists differed in opinion as to my sanity. One
regarded me as a malingerer, the other declared that I
was in a state of mental aberration which bid fair to
culminate in incurable insanity. I was confined under
guard in a room in a hotel in Tupelo till yesterday, when I
was incarcerated in this dungeon.”</p>
          <p>Gen. Beauregard was now superseded by Gen. Braxton
Bragg. Gen. Bragg had been but a short time in supreme
command when he reviewed the testimony in the case of
Prof. Yarbrough. On the 11th of July, 1862, the order came
for his execution. He was taken from our prison to the
fatal spot where so many brave Unionists had ended
their lives. His request that they would not blindfold him
was granted. He faced the muskets with an unblanched
countenance. A volley rang out upon the evening air,
and the professor fell pierced by the bullets of the squad.
When his struggles ceased and he was pronounced dead
by the sergeant, the corpse was given into the custody
of Billingsly and Kaiser, conscripts, from near Tallaloosa,
Miss., and relatives, they claimed, of the professor. They
bore the body tenderly to a house in the suburbs of
Tupelo. These men were Unionists, and had been forced
into the Confederate service. This family, whose name
was Montreal, were pronounced Unionists. When the
putative corpse was laid upon the couch prepared for its
reception, an examination revealed that one ball had
<pb id="aughey131" n="131"/>
shattered the left arm so that amputation would have
been required had no other wound caused death. A ball
had glanced from the ribs, another ball had passed
through his clothing. The limbs had not assumed rigidity,
and it was evident that the professor was not dead, but
only in a state of syncope. From this condition he slowly
rallied. Billingsly understood surgery, and with the aid of
some Unionist neighbors Prof. Yarbrough's arm was
amputated, and upon his recovery, which was rapid, he
was conducted by night from one Union neighborhood
to another, till at length he reached La Grange, Tenn., which was in
the possession of the Federal troops. Among the first to
visit him were his son Oscar, now a captain of a company
in a Federal regiment, and a nephew, Charles Barry,
formerly of D'Arbonne, La., now an officer in the Union
army, Gen. Beauregard's statement in regard to the
capture of Oscar Yarbrough being false.</p>
          <p>The following letter will unfold some of the more

                  <p>DEAR FRIEND—Having learned through John H.
Stanton that you are chaplain of Gen. Benjamin
Grierson's old regiment, the 6th Ill. cavalry, I send you
by him this short letter. Please inform me how you
escaped from Tupelo. I heard Gen. Bragg tell
Major Grosvenor, when he tried to say something in
your defense, that you would be hanged on Tuesday
of the next week as sure as there was a God in heaven.
<pb id="aughey132" n="132"/>
He said you deserved to suffer a hundred deaths for
your disloyal speeches and your many treasonable acts.
That there was a ghost of a chance for you seemed
incredible, chained as you were, and so vigilantly
guarded, far away from the Federal lines and surrounded
by the great rebel army. Do write me at once and tell me
all about your escape. It must have been well-nigh
miraculous. The first intimation I had of your escape was
an extract from the New York <hi rend="italics">Tribune</hi> of an address
delivered by you in Cooper Institute in that city, from
which I learned that you had succeeded in effecting an
escape, but the particulars were not given.</p>
                  <p>After I was able to travel I was conducted from one
neighborhood to another, till at length I reached the
Federal lines. At one time we thought it best to travel in
daylight. There were ten of us in company, eight of us
Unionists endeavoring to reach the Federal lines. Two
were guides, Paden Pickens and Paul Paden. We called at
the house of a widow named Mrs. Violetta Markle. Her
husband had been tried by a vigilance committee and
shot, April 19, 1861, as a Unionist. We gave her the
countersign <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">taisez 
vous</hi></foreign>. She replied <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">oui, 
oui</hi></foreign>, all right,
and then after preparing a meal for us, she informed us
that we were near a rebel camp, and advised us to take
the route traveled by the guide, Solomon Frierson, who
had called at her house yesterday on his return from a
trip to the Federal lines, to which he had conveyed
twenty Unionists from Oktibbeha

and Pontotoc counties. After leaving Mrs. Markle's,
Pickens climbed a tree and made an observation of the
surrounding country. Two rebel encampments were
visible, one to the north-east, another to the north-west.
He thought that we might pass between them without
much danger. We started on our way. At one point it
became necessary to travel on a road a short distance so
as to obviate the necessity of ascending a lofty and
precipitous hill. We had just entered upon the road
when we saw a company of rebel cavalry about half a
mile distant. They had just appeared on the summit of a
hill behind which they had been concealed from view.
They descried us, and putting spurs to their horses
came rapidly toward us. We gave up all for lost, and
were about to break for the woods, when Paden, taking
ropes from his pockets, told Bryson and Birney to put
their hands behind them, when he securely bound them
with the ropes. As soon as the cavalry reached us we
went to one side of the road to let them pass. The
captain, whose name was Pender, wished to know what
this cavalcade meant. Paden replied that they had in
charge these two tories, and were taking them to camp
to surrender them to the general in command, that they
might get their just deserts. “Good,” said the captain,
“I'll go back with you. Sergeant Buford, take command,
and go on; I'll go back to camp with these men.”</p>
                  <p>On the way back Paden proposed to the captain that
we try these men now, and if they are found
<pb id="aughey134" n="134"/>
guilty shoot them. Capt. Pender agreed to this at once. He
said that was the object of his expedition at this time—to
quell the disaffected traitors to the Confederacy. He
declared that it was he that had ordered the shooting of
ten tory devils in the Poplar Springs neighborhood, led
by one Methuselah Knight, as arrant a tory as ever lived.
We then left the road, and coming to a copse of dwarf
tamaracks, we held a trial, and upon their own confession
convicted Bryson and Birney of treason against the
Confederate States of America. Paden and Pickens asked
the privilege of shooting the prisoners. This Capt. Pender
granted. Upon the pretense that they had no pistols,
Pender drew his pistols from their holsters and presented
them to Paden. Paden handed one to Pickens. The
prisoners were then bound to two saplings. Paden asked
Pender to give the command. The captain told the
prisoners that, in compassion to their souls, he would
grant them five minutes to make their peace with God.</p>
                  <p>Birney said, “Captain, we have long ago made our
peace with our God. Have you done the same?”
Pender replied, “I have killed Union traitors enough to
save me.”</p>
                  <p>He then gave the command, “<hi rend="italics">Make ready</hi>, TAKE
AIM, FIRE.<corr>”</corr> Pickens and Paden fired simultaneously, but
not at the prisoners. Pender fell pierced by two balls, and
in five minutes his soul had taken its flight to the bar of
God. As Pender fell he said,
“D—n the traitors,” and without uttering another
<pb id="aughey135" n="135"/>
word his spirit left its clay tenement. It became necessary
to kill the horse, as his presence would endanger our
safety. Bryson and Birney were unbound, and we
pursued our journey rejoicing, leaving Pender where he
fell. Without further incident of importance we reached
the Union lines, and received a cordial welcome.</p>

          <p>Having determined to attempt an escape at all hazards,
I thought it would be well to secure a companion who
would undertake with me the perilous adventure. Two are
better than one. After due deliberation, I selected Richard
Malone, his piercing eye and his intellectual
physiognomy led me to believe that if he should consent
to make the attempt with me, our prospect for success
would be enhanced. Upon broaching the matter to him, he
drew from his pocket a paper containing the proper route
to pursue, mapped out clearly. A Unionist friend had
covertly conveyed it to him. Gray Walton was his name.
For some days Malone had resolved to escape or perish
in the attempt. With all the ardor imparted by a new born
hope, we entered upon the formation of a plan of escape.
We went out now upon every possible pretext. We no
longer tried to avoid the guard that came to obtain
<pb id="aughey136" n="136"/>
detachments of prisoners to do servile labor. We were the first
to present ourselves, our object being to reconnoitre, in
order to learn where guards were stationed, so as to
determine the best method of escaping through the town
after leaving the prison, and of passing through the great
army that environed us. During the day we made these
observations, that two guards stationed on the western
enclosure attached to the prison were very communicative
and very verdant, that after relief they would come on
duty again at midnight, that there was a building on the
south side of the prison, sixteen feet distant from it, which
extended beyond our prison, and beyond the enclosure in
the rear of the prison in which the guards were stationed.
We learned that the moon would set about 11 P.M. and we
ascertained that there were no guards upon the south side
of the prison during the day. I learned this by volunteering
to go for water. Two guards accompanied me; as I neared
the prison, having drawn the soft hat I was wearing down
pretty well, I peered from under it and scanned the
surroundings as closely as possible, observing where
every vidette was stationed, and gaining by close scrutiny
all possible information. We learned that one of the planks
in the floor was in a condition to be readily removed. The
building was placed on blocks, and the planks were nailed
on perpendicularly, and the ragged edges did not in some
places reach the ground. Apertures were thus formed by
which we hoped, if once under
<pb id="aughey137" n="137"/>
the prison, egress might be secured. We then hoped
to reach the building which was about sixteen feet
distant, on the south side, and by crawling along
close to it pass the enclosure on the western end of
our prison in which the guards were stationed.
Troyer Anderson, and De<sic>'</sic> Grummond, Federal
prisoners, assisted by Hermon Bonar, Prince Shelby,
and Gaither Breckenridge, Unionists, managed to
raise the plank from the floor and replace it loosely,
so that it could be removed at the opportune moment.</p>
          <p>Benjamin Clarke came to me and said, “Take me
along with you.” I referred him to Malone, who refused.
Clarke came back, and told me that Malone would not
consent, and begged me to try to prevail upon Malone
to agree to take him with us. Said he, “I have been tried
and condemned, and should I be shot my poor wife and
eight children will perish.”
I went to Malone and asked him to consent to take Clarke
along. Said he, “No, Clarke has not nerve sufficient to
face the glittering bayonet, which we
may have to do, nor has he the tact necessary to make
his way through this great army without detection.
He would do something that would betray us, not
intentionally, of course.” As Malone was inexorable, I
told Clarke that he and Robinson must come half an hour
after us. This they failed to do. They dared not make the
attempt, which was indeed perilous. This was July 4, 1862.
We improvised a
4th of July celebration. I was the orator of the
day, and delivered a eulogy of our patriot fathers
<pb id="aughey138" n="138"/>
who had fought and bled to secure our country's
liberty.</p>
          <p>We may say of these noble men as was said of the
cathedral builder:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>The hand that rounded Peter's dome,</l>
            <l>And groined the aisles of Ancient Rome,</l>

            <l>Himself from God he could not free,</l>
            <l>He builded better than he knew—</l>
            <l>The conscious stone to beauty grew.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Yes, they builded better than they knew. They erected
a temple of freedom which we trust shall be lasting as
time. No weapon formed against it shall prosper. In the
providence of God no parricidal hand shall be permitted
to succeed in overthrowing this grand edifice, this
glorious temple of our country's liberties. Let us
endeavor to be worthy sons of these noble sires, imitate
their virtues, prize the heritage bequeathed to us by
them, and preserve it unimpaired as a blessing to our
posterity forever.</p>

          <p>I see officers approaching who may not be able to
appreciate and approve sentiments such as I am
enunciating. Permit me, therefore, to close somewhat
abruptly with this sentiment:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Our Banner: Now wave in strength its pennons fair,</l>
            <l>In peerless grandeur round the world,</l>

          </lg>
          <p>We then sang with a will,</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>My country, 'tis of thee,</l>
            <l>Sweet land of liberty, etc.</l>
          </lg>
          <pb id="aughey141" n="141"/>
          <p>J. A. H. Spear, of Ellisville, Ill., or Troyer Anderson,
sang a patriotic song. I remember but one
couplet:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>We've lofty hills and lovely vales,</l>
            <l>And streams that roll to either sea.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>It was well received. Some of the Federal prisoners
started,</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Rally round the flag, boys,</l>
            <l>Rally once again,</l>
            <l>Shouting the battle cry of freedom.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The officers who had entered, now in great anger
forbade any further patriotic demonstration. They
carried off our flag which we had improvised, and
told the guards to inform them if we disobeyed their
orders.</p>
          <p>At four o'clock P. M., our plan was fully matured. At midnight
(the moon having set and the verdant guards being on duty) we would
raise the plank, get under the floor, and, myself in advance, make our exit
through one of the apertures upon the south side of the jail, then
crawl to the building some sixteen feet distant, and thence continue
crawling close to the building till we had passed the sentinels in the
western enclosure, then rise and make our way as cautiously as possible
to a point in a corn-field in view from the prison, and where was a
garment suspended from a fence post. The one who arrived first must
await the other. A signal was agreed upon to prevent mistake. The
signal was to place the arms akimbo. The countersign, <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">taisez vous</hi></foreign>, the
<pb id="aughey142" n="142"/>
response, <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">oui, oui</hi></foreign>, (pro.) we, we. If the guards ordered us to
halt we resolved to risk their fire, for our firm resolve
was liberty or death.</p>
          <p>As soon as the prisoners learned that I was a minister,
they with entire unanimity and great cordiality chose me
chaplain, and I preached to them every evening as long
as I remained with them. Night drew on apace. Thick
darkness settled upon prison, camp, and town. Murky
clouds o'erspread the sky and obscured the stars as we
partook of our scanty allowance of corn-bread and water—
foul, tepid water. I took this meal with the Federal
prisoners who were temporarily incarcerated till after
some formalities they would
be sent to prison at Camp Oglethorpe, Macon, Ga., and
other places. Their names were Jesse L. McHatton, Co. H,
59th Ill. Vols., J. A. H. Spear, Ellisville, Fulton Co., Ill.,
Brocket and Benedict, 35th Reg. Ill. Vol. Inft., Sullivan,
Howell Trogdon, of St. Louis, Mo., M. Troyer Anderson,
Foster, Lowery, and a German, who went by the name of
Charlie, who wore a saddler's knife sewed on his coat
sleeve, Wm. Soper, Co. D, 22d Reg. Ind. Vol. Inft., and
DeGrummond, of Galesburg, Ill. The breeches I wore were
light colored. McHatton exchanged a pair of brown
colored for mine, so that I might better evade the guards.</p>
          <p>About ten o'clock Malone raised the plank, and I went
under to reconnoitre. I remained under the floor about
ten minutes, having learned that there were no guards
<sic corr="patrolling">patroling</sic> the south side of the
<pb id="aughey143" n="143"/>
prison, as we feared might be the case after night. I
had learned by observation, when returning with
water, that there were none during the day. Just at
the noon of night we heard the relief called. Malone
and I tried to find the prisoners who were to raise
the plank, but not being able readily to do so we
raised the plank ourselves, and both succeeded in
getting under without much difficulty. Malone having
gotten under first was compelled, contrary to our
arrangements, to take the lead. As he was passing
through the aperture he made considerable noise. I
patted him upon the back to indicate silence and
warn him of danger. He reached back, gave my
hand a warm pressure to assure me that all was right,
and passed out. I followed. I heard Malone in
advance of me, but it was so dark that I could not
see him. As I reached the point opposite the sentinels
in the rear, one of them, apparently on the
alert, and startled by the noise, came to the side of
the enclosure nearest me, and leaning over peered
into the darkness. He remained a considerable time
in that inquisitive attitude. I remained very quiet.
At length he walked to the door and looked into the
prison. I moved on as noiselessly as possible, passing
all the sentinels. It required great presence of
mind and vigilant care to pass them without attracting
attention or exciting their suspicion. I
reached the pre-arranged place of meeting, but Malone
was nowhere to be found. I gave the preconcerted
signals, but they elicited no response.
<pb id="aughey144" n="144"/>
Some mistake had been made, and after waiting a long
time I was compelled to set out alone. Not being able to
rejoin my friend, I regarded as a great misfortune. He had
the chart to guide us, and after reaching a point fifteen
miles north-west of Tupelo he would be familiar with the
topography and geography of the country. I had
frequently passed through Tupelo in the cars, but knew
but little of the country off the railroad through which I
must pass. Somewhat depressed in spirits by the loss of
my <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">compagnon de voyage</hi></foreign>, I resolved to reach my family
by the safest and most practicable route. I feared the
hounds and the cavalry which would scour the country in
search of us as soon as our escape became known. I was
still in the very midst of the great rebel army, and found
great difficulty in avoiding the videttes that seemed to be
well-nigh omnipresent. I soon found that day was
brightening in the east. I felt glad to think that I was no
longer in the gloomy prison. I could say with the Psalmist,
“I am escaped as a bird out of the snare of the fowler.
The snare is broken and I am escaped. God hath delivered
me out of the hand of my enemy.” I looked to the east,
and lo! the orb of day was peering above the horizon. I
must find a place to hide. I speedily discovered a small
but dense thicket amid a grove of tupelo trees. This grove
gave name to the town of Tupelo. I secreted myself as
covertly as possible. A tree with low branches was near;
I would ascend this if the
<pb id="aughey145" n="145"/>
hounds should discover my track. After the excitement
and consequent mental strain, I tried to woo tired
nature's sweet restorer, balmy sleep, and had
partially succeeded, when the noise and horrid din of the great
encampment sounding in my ears startled me, and
drove far hence the winged Somnus. Soon many soldiers passed and
repassed me. I was still in the very midst of the great army, and liable to
discovery at any moment. I broke off twigs and covered myself with leaves
and branches of the underbrush surrounding me.
I was within thirty yards of Old Town creek, an affluent of the
Tombigbee river, or rather one of the creeks forming the Tombigbee.
The soldiers had found a suitable pool for bathing, and they passed and repassed all day;
on one side their path or trail ran only six or eight feet distant, on the other
path was but fifteen or twenty feet distant from my lair. About nine o'clock
A.M. I heard the booming of cannon all around
me, proceeding from the various encampments.
The passing soldiers, whose lowest tones were distinctly
audible, said that the artillerists were firing salutes in honor
of a great victory obtained over General McClellan in the
peninsula of Virginia. According to their statements,
his whole army, after a succession of losses during
eight days' continuous fighting, had been completely
annihilated at a place named Malvern, and they were quite
sure that Stonewall Jackson would be in Washington City within
a week. This sad news depressed me more by far than the
<pb id="aughey146" n="146"/>
thought of my own condition. The hours dragged
heavily. At one time two soldiers came within two
feet of me in search of blackberries. I feared that
one of them would tread upon my feet as they passed
out of the copse, but he did not, although he must
have missed stepping upon my feet by but a few inches.
About noon, judging from he vertical rays of the sun,
two soldiers sat down at the point closest to me on the nearer path.
They were almost in juxtaposition.
Their lowest tones were frightfully audible. One of them informed
his companion that he had been in
Tupelo in the morning and that two prisoners had
broke jail. They were Parson Aughey
and Dick Malone. He said a big reward was offered fur
bringin' 'em in dead or alive. He said: “I seed the cavalry
start after 'em with two all-fired big packs of dogs. One
pack went this away and the other that away. [I supposed
he indicated the directions by pointing.] I'd give my
wages fur six month to ketch ary one of 'em. Think uv the
honor uv it, Jim, to ketch 'em afore the dogs and cavalry
did. Ole Bragg wouldn't stop at a cool thousand or two.
Ole Jurdan he were bad flustered. He was a cavortin'
aroun' hollerin' out his orders at the top uv his voice, jest
a makin' the air blue with his cussin'. I wouldn't be in them
prison guards' place for no money. I seed them officers put the
irons on 'em, an' they took 'em in ter that same jail thet the
tories hed got out on.”</p>
          <p>The other replied, “It aint no use, Jack Simeral,
<pb id="aughey147" n="147"/>
fur you to talk about them fellers. I'll bet they's sharp an'
they's safe a hidin' with sum of thar tory friends hours
ago. I'll bet they aint two miles from town. Jack, you
know the Clines an' Kaverners, they'd die ter save a
Union man. They hid Jake Broome a month, an' your own
cousin Tillie Jack, she carried him grub till the Union
fellers got the thing fixt up an' sent him off ter the
Yankees—Bill Hawkins a giden' a squad of em'.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“Well,” said the other, “them dogs'll kum up with 'em
if they hev haf a chance, an' they'll never make it to the
Yankee lines, sure as my name's Jim Billick.”</p>
          <p>Soon one of them arose and struck a bush almost
above my head. I thought that he had discovered me
and was about to rise and run, when I heard him say to
his comrade, “Bill, that was the biggest snake I've seen
lately, a regular water moccasin, but it got off inter the
bushes. I reckin' it's makin' fur the creek, kase they don't
git far from water.”</p>
          <p>I began to feel somewhat uncomfortably situated
when I learned that I was in close proximity to large
and poisonous snake, but I would have much preferred
meeting an anaconda, boa constrictor, or even the
deadly cobra di capello, rather than those vile
secessionists, thirsting for innocent blood. They too,
passed on and left me to gloomy rumination. Presently a
large number coming from the creek were about to enter
this thicket in quest of berries when one of their number
swore that there were no
<pb id="aughey148" n="148"/>
berries in that thicket. He had been there last evening
with a crowd and cleaned them out teetotally. He then
took them to a place where he said there were plenty of
berries, much to my relief. I thought this 5th of July was
the longest day I had ever known. The sun was so long
in reaching the zenith, and so long in passing down the
steep ecliptic way to the occident. But as all days,
however long seemingly, come to an end, so did this. The
stars came glittering one by one. I soon recognized that
old, staunch, and immovable friend of all travelers on the
underground railway, the polar star. Rising from my lair, I
was soon homeward bound, guided by the north star and
an oriental constellation. Plunging into a dense wood, I
found my rapid advance impeded by the undergrowth,
and had great difficulty in following my heavenly guides,
as the overarching boughs of the great oaks rendered
them invisible or dimly seen. I came to the creek—Old
Town creek. At that place it was deep and wide. I found a
place where a fallen tree partly spanned it. I walked on
the trunk till I nearly reached its terminus, then I ran and
jumped as far as I could. I alighted near the further shore,
in water only up to my arm-pits. I speedily reached the
dry ground and hastened onward. The water quenched
my raging thirst, but I was very hungry, tired, and sleepy.
I at length lay down at the foot of a large water-oak,
resolving to take only a nap, and then rise and pursue my
journey. When I awoke the sun was rising.
<figure id="ill10" entity="aughey149"><p>I ENTERED, BUT A GLANCE REVEALED TO ME THE CHARACTER OF THE PROPRIETOR. Page 149</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey149" n="149"/>
I arose full of regret for the loss of so much precious time.
Though somewhat refreshed by my sound sleep, my
hunger was almost unendurable, and I was famishing
from thirst. At length I descried a small log house by a
roadside. In the distance I could see tents. Feeling sick
and faint, I resolved to go to the house to obtain water,
and if I liked the appearance of the inmates, reveal my
condition and ask for aid. I never had much difficulty in
discerning between a Unionist and secessionist family.
The bile and bitterness of the rabid secessionist was
patent, and readily revealed his true character. He
gloried in making his proclivities known. <sic corr="The Unionist">TheUnionist</sic>
was ordinarily reticent, unless he was playing the role
of a secessionist, and even then his theatrical
performance was transparent to one who had himself
found it necessary upon occasion to assume that guise,
or to one who had mingled with both classes and had
studied their idiosyncrasies.</p>
          <p>I went to the door of the log edifice and knocked. A
gruff voice said, “Come.” I entered, but a glance
revealed to me the character of the proprietor. I did not
like his physiognomy. He looked the villain. A sinister
expression, a countenance revealing no intellectuality
except a sort of low cunning, bore testimony that it
would be the extreme of folly to repose confidence in
the possessor of such villainous looks. I asked for
water, intending to drink and leave his rude domicile.
He pointed to the bucket without speaking. A gourd
dipper was floating upon the
<pb id="aughey150" n="150"/>
surface of the water which filled it. I drank and bade him
good-bye, and took my departure, glad to escape so
easily. I had proceeded but a few steps when I heard the
command, halt! uttered in a stentorian tone. Upon looking
backward I saw two soldiers within a few steps. One was
presenting a double-barreled gun, the other was heavily
armed. I asked the soldier who had given the command by
what authority he halted me, to which he replied, “I know
you, sir, I have heard you preach frequently, you are
Parson Aughey, and you were arrested and lodged in
prison at Tupelo. I was in Col. Mark Lowrey's regiment
yesterday, and learned that you had broken jail, and now,
sir, you must return. My name is Dan Barnes. You may
have heard of me.” I had indeed heard of him. His father
had held the office of postmaster. His son had
systematically robbed the mail, and for a long time eluded
detection. A detective, at length, through a decoy letter,
discovered his guilt. When he was arrested the letter with
its contents was found upon his person. While being
conveyed to prison he escaped from the officer, fled to
Napoleon or Helena, Arkansas—was followed, brought
back, and incarcerated in jail at Pontotoc. As the evidence
against him was positive and admitted no doubt of his
guilt, he would have been convicted and sent to the
penitentiary, but fortunately for this criminal, at this
juncture Mississippi seceded. The jurisdiction of the
Federal authorities was regarded at an end—a <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">nolle prosequi</hi></foreign>
was entered in the
<pb id="aughey151" n="151"/>
case  of Barnes, and he was liberated and soon after
joined the Confederate army.</p>
          <p>Soon Barnes came to me and said, “Parson, I feel sorry
for you, I can sympathize with you for I was once in a
tight place myself, and would have been much pleased to
have found a friend to lend a helping band. Now, if you
will pay me a reasonable sum I will afford you an
opportunity of escaping.” I distrusted Barnes' sincerity,
but could not make the matter worse by accepting his
proffered aid. He named two hundred and fifty dollars as
the reasonable sum to secure his connivance at my
escape. I proffered two hundred and forty dollars. It was
accepted, and I paid it over to him. When he had
secured the money, he said, with a sardonic laugh, “I was
just playing off on you. You must go back to prison. I
have no sympathy for d—d tories, and
wish they were all in h—l.” They then brought me into the
presence of General Jordan, whose headquarters were
still at the place where I had the misfortune to meet him at
first. The proprietor of the log cabin was named David
Hough. He accompanied Barnes and Eph. Hennon, as
they returned me to the rebel authorities. Barnes
proclaimed, as be passed through the camps, his good
fortune, and received the congratulation of the soldiers.
He received everywhere an ovation. It was a sort of
triumphal march, which he enjoyed greatly.</p>
          <p>I became the cynosure of all eyes. As Barnes would
stop and recount his heroic and marvelous
<pb id="aughey152" n="152"/>
exploit in arresting me, the soldiers would crowd around
me, gazing and hurling at me a torrent of questions. They
wanted me to tell them where Malone was, and assured
me that old Bragg would be d—d glad to see me. After
running this gauntlet for hours, I was ushered into the
august presence of Gen. Jordan. He said, “Where is
Malone?” I told him that I did not know—that I had not
seen him after I had left the prison. He refused to credit
any of my statements. He told me that Malone would
soon be brought in, dead or alive. He could not evade the
bounds and the cavalry. He hoped to heaven that they
might catch him speedily, that we might die
together. He then ordered a guard to conduct me to a
blacksmith's shop. He ordered the blacksmith to forge
fetters—bands and chain—so large and strong that I might
be so securely manacled as to prevent the least
possibility of my giving them the slip till I had expiated
my crimes upon the gallows. The blacksmith was ordered
to put the bands on while red hot, and my boots were
burnt in the process of ironing. It was quite painful,
though the blacksmith was as gentle as possible. Gen.
Jordan stood by with drawn sword, superintending the
execution of his order.</p>
          <p>The blacksmith said, <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">“Taisez vous.”</hi></foreign> I replied,
<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">“Oui, oui.”</hi></foreign> He gave me his name, and embraced every
opportunity of offering a word of comfort.
He was a Unionist. He asked Gen. Jordan to allow me to go
to his house and get something to eat, but
<pb id="aughey153" n="153"/>
his request was arrogantly refused. I think his name was
Monday or Friday. I remember that it was the name of
one of the days of the week. I thus associated it in my
mind at the time. He told Gen. Jordan that he had never
manacled a man, and was averse to obeying such an
order. The General told him to go to work at once, or go
to prison. The blacksmith only obeyed upon compulsion.</p>
          <p>“Iron him <hi rend="italics">securely</hi>, SECURELY, <hi rend="italics">sir,</hi>” was the General's oft
repeated order. The ironing caused me much pain, my
ankles being long discolored from the effects. By wearing
shackles so long, ulcers were formed which have left life-long
scars. After I was secured by these manacles, they
assisted me to remount the horse. I was compelled to ride
sidewise. The irons prevented me from riding astride. I
told Gen. Jordan that I had been told that iron had become
scarce in the Southern Confederacy, but that he had
given me an abundant supply. I was conducted under
guard to Tupelo. Upon my arrival the provost marshal and
commander of the post were much rejoiced to see me.
They became hilarious. Barnes, in grandiloquent style,
stated that I had attempted to bribe him, that he had
listened to my proposition with indignation, and when he
had gotten the money did what he regarded was his duty.
The commander replied that all of the property of traitors
was theirs, and commended Barnes for deceiving me after
he had secured the bribe. He also recommended Barnes
for promotion for his heroic
<pb id="aughey154" n="154"/>
and patriotic act in arresting me, and for his incorruptible integrity.</p>
          <p>The Provost marshal said to me: “Why did you attempt to leave us?”</p>
          <p>“Because, sir, your prison was so filthy, your fare so meagre
and unwholesome, and your treatment so 
harsh, cruel, and vindictive, that I could not endure it and survive.”</p>
          <p>“Parson, you know the bible says, ‘the wicked flee
when no man pursueth, but the righteous are as
bold as a lion.’ You must have been guilty of crime
or you would not have attempted to escape.”
“I confess to the truth of some of the charges made
against me, and yet hold that I am innocent of any crime
against God or man for which I am amenable to the state or
Confederate states. As to pursuit, I think two companies of
cavalry with blood-hounds would indicate quite vigorous
pursuit.”</p>
          <p>“You shall never be remanded to the prison you
left; rest assured of that. Did any of the prisoners
know of or aid you in your escape?”</p>
          <p>“No, sir, none of them knew anything about it.”</p>
          <p>“Are you telling the truth?”</p>
          <p>“I am.”</p>
          <p>“Where is Malone?”</p>
          <p>“I know not. I never saw him after I
left the prison.”</p>
          <p>“He cannot escape. He will be brought in, dead
or alive. Why did you attempt to bribe
Dan Barnes?”</p>
          <pb id="aughey155" n="155"/>
          <p>“It was his own offer. I knew that his cupidity was
great, and thought it no harm to accept his proffered
venal aid. If Barnes had his deserts, he would now be
immured in the penitentiary at hard labor.”</p>
          <p>“Did the jury that tried him acquit him?”</p>
          <p>“No, the secession of Mississippi alone saved him.
I refer you to Col. Tison. He, being marshal of North
Mississippi, arrested Barnes. He found on his person the
evidence of his guilt—the money and drafts stolen when
he robbed the mail.”</p>
          <p>I might say here, that after this Barnes was in company
with several soldiers, boon companions of his. One of
them, named Maness, said to Barnes, in reply to some
fanciful story that he had been telling, “Now, Dan, you
know that that is a lie.” Dan, in anger, said, “If you repeat
that I will shoot you.” Maness replied, “We all know it
isn't true.” Barnes immediately shot Maness, and then
fled to Chepultepec, Alabama. Was pursued, overtaken,
and arrested. On their return, near the place where Barnes
had shot Maness, near Paden's mills, the guard, three of
whom were brothers of the murdered man, held a
consultation, which resulted in a decision to inflict
summary punishment upon the murderer. He had escaped
the penalty due his crime in robbing the mail, and they
feared that if they returned him to the army he might
escape merited punishment. They compelled him to dig
his own grave, and then they hanged him and buried him
in the grave he had
<pb id="aughey156" n="156"/>
dug. His doom was just, and no tears were shed
over his tragic fate.</p>
          <p>Some of the general officers entered the provost
marshal's office. After a short consultation, one of them,
approaching me, said, “You will be shot within
an hour. If you have any messages for your friends
you may write it, and I will see to its delivery.”</p>
          <p>I wrote thus:</p>

                  <p>MY DEAR WIFE—I must die within an hour, so
General Bragg has this moment informed me. This
is the last letter you will ever receive from me. I
die because I have pursued unswervingly what I
regarded as my duty to my God and my country. I would
not, even for the consideration of long life and the
endearments of a happy home, prove recreant to duty
and swerve from fidelity to a government that has never infringed my rights
of person or property.</p>
                  <p>To the kind protecting care of a covenant-keeping God
I commit you and our dear Kate and the unborn babe, whose face
in this world I will never see. God has promised to be the husband
of the widow and the father of the fatherless, and he is faithful
who has promised. I die at the hands of cruel, implacable, and
vindictive men, my own and my country's enemies. This is the hour
and power of darkness, but it is my time to die. My hour has come.
It is appointed unto man once to die. Of man the scriptures say,
his days are determined, the
<pb id="aughey157" n="157"/>
number of his months is with thee. There is an appointed
bound that he cannot pass. The wicked go when their
cup of iniquity is full, the righteous when they have
fulfilled the mission appointed them by Jehovah. Our
Savior was slain by wicked men carrying out according
to the freedom of their own will
their own murderous purpose, as Peter declared at
Pentecost, Him being delivered by the determinate
counsel and foreknowledge of God, ye have taken and by
wicked hands have crucified and slain. Kiss our darling
Kate for me. I have no fear of death. I
go trusting in Jesus. We will meet beyond the river.
Farewell, a long farewell.</p>

          <p>I wrote within the lines an occasional word in
phonography, which read thus: Inform Generals Nelson
and Rosecrans of my re-arrest and my sad fate.</p>
          <p>I was then placed under guard and conducted to a
small room in a hotel till preparations might be made for
my death by shooting. Two guards remained in the room
with their guns with bayonets fixed, with strict orders to
shoot or bayonet me if I made the least show of an
attempt at escape. There were two guards also
stationed just outside the door, with the same orders, to
be enforced if necessary.</p>
          <p>I remained in this room an hour or more, supposing
that as soon as the necessary arrangements for my
execution were completed I would be led to death.</p>
          <pb id="aughey158" n="158"/>
          <p>After a time orders came and I was marched into the
presence of the officers. General Bragg said, “We have
concluded to hang you.”</p>
          <p>I replied, “I deprecate that mode of execution. Do
please shoot me.”</p>
          <p>He then said, “You will also have a trial, and if it
results in conviction, of which there is no doubt, you
will be hanged in the presence of the army.”</p>
          <p>The guards were then ordered to take charge of me.
My chain was so short that I could only step about ten
inches. I could just set my heel in stepping even with the
toe of the opposite foot. They brought me to the same
old prison. When I entered it, my old friends, the true,
tried, and trusted prisoners who still survived, crowded
around me. Captain Bruce addressed me in his facetious
manner. In prison his wit had beguiled many a tedious
hour. His humor was the pure Attic salt.</p>
          <p>“Parson Aughey, you are welcome back to my hotel,
though you have played us rather a scurvy trick in
leaving without giving me or any of us the least inkling
of your intention, or settling your bill.”</p>
          <p>I replied, “Captain, it was hardly right, but I did not
like your fare, and your hotel was sadly infested with
chinches, chiggers, ticks, and graybacks.”</p>
          <p>“Well, you do not seem to have fared better since
you left, for you have returned.”</p>
          <p>“Captain, my return is the result of coercion. Some
who oppose this principle when applied to
<pb id="aughey159" n="159"/>
themselves have no scruples in enforcing it upon
others.
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>'No rogue e'er felt the halter draw</l><l>'With good opinion of the law,'</l></lg></q>
is an old saw, and the truth of proverbs is seldom affected
by the lapse of time. I am your guest by
compulsion, but remember I will leave you upon the
first opportunity.”</p>
          <p>Upon hearing this statement, an officer present,
named Cecil Hindman, with a bitter imprecation,
said that when I next crossed the threshold of that
building it would be to go to cross the railroad to the
place of execution.</p>
          <p>The prisoners gathered around me upon the exit
of the officers, and I related to them my adventures.
They then informed me of what had occurred during my
absence. At roll call the next morning we were missed.
Clarke was taken out to guide a company
in search of you. The guards on duty during the night
were put under arrest. Your method of escape was speedily
discovered and the guards were released, as they were not at fault.
The floor was spiked down, the guards increased in number, and
greater vigilance enjoined. The prisoners were questioned as to
whether they knew of your escape or had in any way
contributed to the effect it. We all positively denied any
knowledge of or complicity in the escape. They asked
me if I had given the officers any information about their knowledge
of our designs and co-operation in effecting them. I told them that I
<pb id="aughey160" n="160"/>
had positively denied that any except Malone and
myself were privy to our plans. Was this right? Is
falsehood ever justifiable?</p>
          <p>If I had revealed the aid received from my
fellow prisoners they would have been severely
punished; perhaps some of them capitally, at once. And
my fellow-prisoners would have regarded me as a base
ingrate, and would not a second time, as they did, have
risked their lives to set me free and save my life. We
ought to speak every man truth to his neighbor, but
those secessionists, thirsting for innocent blood, were in
no true sense our neighbors, though too near neighbors,
in regard to physical proximity, for our welfare. In order
to save life we may take life, and may we not deceive by
words, and be guiltless, those who would use their
knowledge to destroy the innocent? I asked Benjamin
Clarke, when he was remanded to prison, to give us the
particulars of the pursuit of Malone and myself by the
cavalry and blood-hounds, to which request he
assented.</p>

        <head>BENJAMIN CLARKE'S STORY.</head>
        <p>“You were not missed till roll-call in the morning. Your
name was the first on the roll. This man [laying his hand
on the shoulder of a prisoner] is a great mimic. When he
tries he can beat a mocking bird. He can mimic any man's
voice. He can call up any animal or bird when he wants
to shoot it. This man, Will Croghan's his name, sung out,
 ‘Here.’ Some of us that knowed you was gone looked
round, thinkin'
<pb id="aughey161" n="161"/>
it was your voice. When they got to Malone's name,
Jim Benton sung out present, but he wasn't no mimic,
and the officer called out agin, Dick Malone, an' nobody
answered. He then stopped calling the roll and sent out
an orderly. It wasn't long till old Bragg, Hardee, and
some other officers come into the prison in a hurry. The
officer commenced calling the roll agin.
Croghan was afeard to chirp, an' they found that
you and Malone was gone. Bragg stormed round a spell,
and afore long I was sent for. They
told me to mount a horse a nigger was holdin'. I
done so, and we all started off. They told me to
guide them straight to Paden's mill. We had twenty-five
cavalry men and forty dogs. They started with
that many, seein' they might have to separate to follow
different trails. How the hounds did howl and
yelp. To give you a chance, I took 'em round by
Bull Mountain, up one hill an' down the same, an'
up another. They wanted to find some of your cloze
in the prison to let the dogs git a scent. I thought Alex.
Spear, that Federal prisoner from Ellisville, Illinois, an'
you had traded pants, so you could git a dark pair so as
to git by the guards, but they wazent none the wizer for
me knowin' that. Well, nigh on to 4 o'clock in the evenin'
we struck a trail. The hounds follered it lively. I waz awful
feared it waz
yourn, still I thought you wouldent be sich a fool as
to go off on a straight shoot for Fulton, where they
took us on our way here, an' where all the roads waz
picketed. The trail was fresh, and the hounds got
<pb id="aughey162" n="162"/>
about a mile ahead. All at once we knowed they had
treed their game, an' agin I jist trembled in my boots for
fear it waz you. We loped along as fast as we could, but
the ground got swampy an' the bushes waz thick, an'
drekly we knowed the dogs hed come up with some big
varmint, an' it was givin 'em battle, and they waz gittin'
the wust of the skrimmage. We hed an awful time to git
through the chaparral, an' we had to go out of our way a
long trip to git round a sloo. But when we did come up
with the dogs they hed killed an awful big bar. But afore
he knocked under he'd got his work in on the dogs, an'
you may never b'leve me agin ef there wazzent fourteen
dogs lyin' dead as herrin's an' some more completely uzed
up. The best sentin' hound waz lyin' close to the ded bar,
and the bar's jaws was clozed on one of his hind legs like
a vise. We got his jaws loose, but the dog's leg waz
mashed into a jelly, an' we hed to shoot him to put him out
of hiz mizery. Well, these cavalry fellows swore they
wazzent goin' to leave till they hed tried some of the bar
steaks. They drug the carcass of the bar half a mile to a
hummock, an' rolled up logs till they hed made a big log-heap,
then sot it on fire, skinned the bar, sliced off the
nice steaks, an' jist enjoyed themselves. 'Fore this waz
done it waz very dark, an' the cap'n in charge of the squad
sed he reckoned they'd best go inter camp fer the night.
'Twazent fur from Fulton. 'Bout midnight ten of these
fellers stole off to go to Madam Dunderberg's, in Fulton.
She kep a bagnio
<pb id="aughey163" n="163"/>
on the edge of town. They got into a row with some roughs that waz
there an' hed monopolized all
the girls, and Bill Snediker and Jo Rucker was killed,
an' Nath Downs waz hurt bad. They had a tough
time gitten back. The cap'n hed to leave Downs at a
settler's cabin, an' sent the settler fer a doctor, but
before the doctor kum Downs hed gone wher they don't
don't need no doctors, fur as we know. Well, 'twas
nigh about noon, an' the cap'n said we'd bury Downs decent
afore we left, so we hed dinner fust of'n the bar,
then we dug a grave 'en buried Downs with the
honors of war. I thought about escapin', but there
wazent the ghost of a chance. The dogs was allowed
to tackle the bar, an there wazent much of bruin, as
the cap'n called him, left after they had done satisfied
their appetites. The cap'n, Hindman I think waz
his name, was purty bad flustered. He'd give me his compass,
an' I, hopin' to escape, pertended I'd dropped
it accidental in the swamp. The cap'n waz
mad as blazes, an' swore wus than old Van Dorn
when he foun' out the parson and Malone hed broke
jail. He told me I must git them to Paden's mill
agin night, or he'd tie me up by the thumbs.
I told him that was onpossible. He said onpossible or not
it must be did. Well, we started off, bearin' northeast.
We passed right by my house. I said, “Cap'm les make some
inquiries here.” We pulled up before the door, it opened an' my
wife an' children come to the door. I got down of'n the horse an'
they all gathered about me like so many bees. Lilly May,
<pb id="aughey164" n="164"/>
the baby, nestled her head in my bosom. Jim said, ‘Pa,
we've been workin' like beavers since you waz taken
away from us. You'll find the crops all right. Ma helped
us, too.’ Just then the cap'n ordered me to mount my
horse. ‘Oh, pa,’ the children shouted, ‘Ain't you come
home to stay?’ but the cap'n hurried on, and the last
sight I had of my wife and babes they waz all weepin' as
ef their hearts would break, an' its the last sight of 'em I
ever expect to have in this world.</p>
        <p>He stopped to weep and we all wept in sympathy
with him. “When we got to Mackey's creek,” he
continued, “near Paden's mill, we camped fur the night.
Next mornin', bright an' early, we rode up to Mr. Paden's.
The cap'n told Mr. Paden he had a disagreeable duty to
perform. He had been ordered to search his premises for a
prisoner—a son-in-law of hizzen that hed broke jail at
Tupelo. Mr. Paden said he might search, but they would
find no one. They searched the house upstairs and
down, then sent a squad to the negro quarters, another
to the mills, but their errand waz a bootless one.</p>
        <p>Again he stopped to weep, we all wept with him.
Saying, “Excuse me I could not help it,” he continued:
“Your wife sat on the sofa in the parlor, pale as death.
Before we left she came to the door and looked at the
hounds and listened to their howling. Her hands were
clasped together. Once I saw her lips move. I thought she
was praying. I stood near her, but I did not hear her
speak. I think she
<figure id="ill11" entity="aughey164"><p>JUST THEN, THE CAP'N ORDERED ME TO MOUNT MY HORSE. Page 164</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey165" n="165"/>
couldent speak for sorrow. Oh, how my heart bled for
her, an' how much I wanted to tell her that I believed
you waz safe in the Federal lines, but I could not git a
chance to do so without notice. I got a chance to say to
her father, I believed you waz safe in Rienzi by this
time, an' I told him to tell his daughter so, which I haint
no doubt but what he did. We left an' come back in a
hurry. The other company that went due north got back
about the time we did. A squad of them reported that
they caught Malone, but that he got away from them at
a house where they went to git water. They fired on
him, and have no doubt that they wounded him bad, an'
think he never could make the Federal lines. Our cap'n
told everybody he met that a big reward was offered fur
you, an' described you the best he could, an' stuck up
notices describing you an' offering a reward fur catchin'
you. When they got back they put me back in prison,
an' I waz very sorry to see you here. Well, we'll have a
chance now to go to heaven together. I reckon there
aint much show fur either of us.”</p>
        <p>M. T. Anderson said,“If I am ever exchanged I'll
publish this from one end of the North to the other. I'll
tell of the heroic endurance of the southern loyalists
who prefer death to dishonor, who prefer an
ignominious death to the guilt of treason against the
best government the sun shines upon.”</p>
        <p>I approached a prisoner who was heavily fettered.
Both hands and feet were bound with iron bands,
<pb id="aughey166" n="166"/>
and he was chained to the floor, the chain being fastened
to a bolt. I learned that he was a Minorcan. I said, “You
are a Minorcan, I learn.” He replied, “I have that honor,
sir.” After confidence had been established between us,
he gave me his history, thus:</p>
        <p>“My name is Louis LasCassas Lornette. My father is a
native of the island of Minorca. He removed with his
family and a large number of Minorcans to a town on the
St. John's river, Florida, in the year 1826. There I was born
May 8, 1828. My mother gave birth to triplets—all boys—
Louis, Pierre, and Philippe. We always dressed alike, and
bore a striking resemblance to each other. We were
devotedly attached to each other and were inseparable
companions. We became mighty hunters before the Lord.
We pursued this vocation <foreign lang="ita"><hi rend="italics">con amore</hi></foreign>, and the founder of
Nineveh himself, the renowned Nimrod, could not have
been more successful than we. At length the tocsin of war
sounded—civil war. We had all attended the academy of a
professor named Nathan Hale, of the state of Vermont. He
was a great admirer of the great statesman, Daniel
Webster. He had a copy of his speeches which we were
permitted to read. We admired them much, especially his
debate with Hayne, Calhoun, and others in the U. S.
senate in regard to the right of a state to nuillify the laws
of the national government, or to secede from the Union.
We thought those statesmen were like pigmies in the
<pb id="aughey167" n="167"/>
hands of a giant. When the war came, and we were told
that the government must be disrupted in the interest of
human slavery, my brothers and I resolved, come weal or
come woe, we would never, <hi rend="italics">never</hi> be guilty of treason to
subserve an institution we detested. Our parents had
taught us to hate slavery with a perfect hatred. Many a
poor hunted fugitive have we protected, and taught him
how to defend himself from the terrible Siberian blood-hound.
We had never entertained for a moment the idea
that we ourselves would ever be the object of pursuit by
these same horrible dogs. One night a company of cavalry
surrounded our father's house, during a re-union
of his family. We three brothers were seized, bound, and
after various vicissitudes were placed in prison in New
Orleans, La., on the charge of treason
against the Confederate States of America. We were tried
and condemned to be shot. They then offered us a
pardon on condition that we would enlist in the
Confederate army. They gave us one week's respite for
consideration. We were permitted to occupy the same cell
in prison. We debated the matter, pro and con. At first we
thought it best to send in our decision in the negative at
once. Pierre reasoned in this way: ‘Would it not be well
to accept their terms, take the oath, enter the army, and
at the first favorable opportunity desert and make our
way to the Federal lines.’ ‘But what about the oath?’ said
Philippe.  ‘An oath exacted under such circumstances is
much more honored in the breach than in
<pb id="aughey168" n="168"/>
the observance,’ replied his brother. In a moment of
weakness we sent in an affirmative answer. We begged to
be permitted to enter the same regiment and the same
company. This request was denied. We were mustered in
in different regiments, and thus separated widely. I was
put in a Mississippi regiment. I deserted, hoping to reach
the Federal lines. A company of cavalry, with a pack of
fierce Siberian blood-hounds were sent out in search of
me. I came to a planter's quarters. The colored people and
I searched all one day, thus losing much precious time, to
find some herbs with which I could have compounded a
subtle poison, and by means of pieces of meat saturated with
it, I could have destroyed a large pack of hounds. But
we could not procure the herbs. They are indigenous to a
low, swampy country. They abound in the everglades of
Florida. The colored people furnished me with
cayenne pepper, onions, and matches, and I felt
comparatively safe. But one day I heard a pack of hounds
behind me. I used every ruse and stratagem I could
devise, but just as I felt assured that the trail was broken
a company who had gone north in search of you, while
returning, came upon me and ordered me to come down
from the tree in which I had taken refuge, and here I am.”</p>
        <p>“What will be your fate?” I asked.</p>
        <p>He replied, “They have discovered the regiment to
which I belonged, and I am condemned to death by
shooting.”</p>
        <pb id="aughey169" n="169"/>
        <p>About 11 o'clock A. M., Col. Gustave Feuillevert came into
the prison. He was a planter, a slaveholder, and a friend of
General Sterling Price. He was of French ancestry. Had
formerly lived in Florida, and was an uncle of Louis
Lornette, the prisoner. He recognized him at once, as Louis a
few years before had visited his uncle and spent the summer
with him. Col. Feuillevert, who was an ultrasecessionist,
tried to induce some of the prisoners to promise to enlist in
his regiment in case he secured their release upon that
condition. He was not successful in a single instance. He
then approached his nephew, Louis, who was sitting alone
in the corner of the prison, and informed him that his
brothers, Philippe and Pierre, were at his house in hiding. He
said they had deserted from Florida regiments, and after
many remarkable adventures had reached his house in as
ragged and forlorn a condition as it was possible for men to
be found. He detested their treason, but their aunt would
save them at the peril of her life, and although he would not
betray them he felt sorry and angry at their obstinacy. The
colonel urged his nephew to abjure his allegiance to a
government that made war upon the institutions of the
South and refused to keep faith with the Southern states,
and had measurably nullified the provisions of the fugitive
slave law; but all in vain, Louis refused to swerve from his
loyalty. The colonel bade his nephew adieu, and departed.
The day of Louis' execution dawned. I conversed with him,
prayed with him,
<pb id="aughey170" n="170"/>
took his last messages to wife and children, promising
that if I survived the horrors of this prison I would
faithfully deliver them, but of this I had little hope. Louis
told me it was clear to his mind that God in His
providence had sent me to this prison for such a time as
this. Those appointed to die needed the presence of one
who could point them to the Savior, and, as a humble
instrument in the hand of God, prepare them for a dying
hour. It was a source of poignant regret that he had, even
for the hope of escape, taken the oath of allegiance to the
Confederate States of America. His oath of allegiance to
the state of Florida he thought was right and proper, as
he understood it.</p>
        <p>At noon the guards brought in a prisoner who had
voluntarily surrendered himself, declaring that he was
Louis Las Cassas Lornette and desired to rejoin his
regiment. When confronted with the condemned Louis,
they bore such a striking resemblance to each other that
the officers were puzzled. Gen. Bragg would be absent
from Tupelo for a few days, and Gen. Sterling Price, to
whom the case was referred, granted a respite till Gen.
Bragg's return. Each prisoner insisted that he was Louis
Las Cassas Lornette, and refused to recognize the other.
The officers took the matter under advisement, and
thought it best to send the two prisoners to Gen. Bragg
for his decision. Should they fail to carry out Gen.
Bragg's orders promptly they feared the consequences.
A regiment was detailed for this purpose.
<pb id="aughey171" n="171"/>
They went via Paden's Mills. Here they met a regiment of
Federal cavalry; a skirmish ensued, several were killed, and
their bodies lie buried in Mr. Paden's orchard. The Confederates
fled and were pursued four miles. They left their prisoners in the
hands of the Federals.</p>
        <p>So Louis and Pierre still live to tell their children the trials and persecutions of
the Southern loyalists. Philippe soon rejoined them in the North, and
enlisting in the same regiment, they served faithfully till the close of the war.
Philippe died May 8, 1866, of a wound received in the engagement which
resulted in the capture of Fort Fisher. Not till the war was ended did their families
rejoin them. Louis' and Pierre's and Philippe's families are citizens of California. Pierre
had resolved to save his brother or perish with him. The affection of Damon and Pythias
could not have been stronger. A kind Providence crowned the scheme to save
his brother Louis with abundant success, and these elderly veterans,
still as much alike as in their youth, save the scar of a sabre thrust which
laid open the cheek of Louis, are still fighting their battles over at the urgent
solicitation of their children and their grand-children and neighbors.</p>
        <p>These brothers are still soldiers, faithful soldiers of the Cross.
Louis dates his conversion from the time of his incarceration in Tupelo,
and when he writes to me addresses me as his spiritual father, and
speaks of himself as my son in the gospel, begotten
<pb id="aughey172" n="172"/>
in my bonds. Pierre and Philippe united with the regimental church at Beaufort,
North Carolina, brought to Jesus by their brother Louis, and their Christian
graces rapidly developed under the faithful ministrations of that godly pastor,
Chaplain LaSalle Coligny, of Huguenot ancestry.</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>We are living, we are dwelling,</l>
          <l>In a grand and awful time,</l>
          <l>In an age on ages telling,</l>
          <l>To be living is sublime.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>After being remanded to prison, I felt that my
condition was utterly hopeless. For a time, as often
as I approached the door, the guards would order me
back. I preached to my fellow-prisoners every evening.
The best possible order was maintained, as they stood
or sat upon the floor and listened to the words of eternal life.
A deep seriousness prevailed, and many believed, to the salvation
of their souls. The songs of Zion resounded through the prison house, and
a great concourse of soldiers assembled outside the guards
in front of both doors. Several officers saw fit to come in during
divine service. Some of them behaved decorously, but on one or two
occasions, officers who neither feared God nor regarded man, nor the
proprieties becoming gentlemen, interrupted the services by talking
in a loud and insulting tone, and asking me how I liked my jewelry,
pointing to my fetters. The prisoners protested against their rude
and ungentlemanly conduct but without effect; they sent a remonstrance
to the commander
<pb id="aughey173" n="173"/>
of the post, but he treated it with silent
contempt.</p>
        <p>We were a motley assemblage. All the southern states
and every prominent religious denomination had
representatives among us. The youth in his nonage, and
the gray-haired and very aged man were there. The
learned and the illiterate, the superior and the
subordinate were with us. The descendants of Shem,
Ham, and Japheth, were here on the same common level,
for in our prison were Afric's dark-browed sons, the
descendants of Pocahontas, and the pure Caucasian.
Death is said to be <hi rend="italics">the</hi> great leveler; the dungeon at
Tupelo was <hi rend="italics">a</hi> great leveler. A fellow feeling made us
wondrous kind; none ate his morsel alone, and a deep
and abiding sympathy for each other's woes pervaded
every bosom. When our fellow-prisoners were called to
die, and were led through our midst with pallid brows and
agony depicted upon their countenances, our heartfelt
expressions of sorrow and commiseration were not loud
(through fear) but deep.</p>
        <p>An officer entered. My name was called. I arose from
the floor on which I had been reclining. I recognized him
as my old friend, Col. H. W. Walter, of Holly Springs,
Miss. After the ordinary salutations, he informed me that
he was judge advocate of this army, and that he came to
inform me of the day appointed for my trial, and to learn
whether I wished to summon any witnesses, and whom.
I gave him the names and addresses of several witnesses,
<pb id="aughey174" n="174"/>
but he refused to send for them, upon the
plea that they lived
too near the Federal lines
I replied that the cavalry that had gone in pursuit of me
had visited those localities.</p>
        <p>He then asked me what I wished to prove by those
witnesses. I replied that I wished to prove that the
specifications under the charge of enacting the spy are
false; that Ferdinand Woodruff is a man of no moral
worth; that Barnes is a mail-robber, and therefore not a
competent nor veracious witness.</p>
        <p>“Your own admissions,” said the colonel
“are sufficient to cause you to lose your life.
Both charges against you will be fully established.
The testimony as to your guilt is clear and positive.” He
then read the charges and specifications:</p>
        <p>“First charge.—Treason.</p>
        <p>“First specification.—That Rev. John H. Aughey, a
citizen of the state of Mississippi, and of the Confederate
States Of America, stated to a member of Hill's cavalry,
that if McClellan were defeated the
North could raise a much larger army in the a short time;
that the North would eventually conquer the
South, and that he was a Unionist—this for the purpose
of giving aid and comfort to the enemy.</p>
        <p>“Second specification.—That when said Aughey was
requested to take the oath of allegiance to the
Confederate States of America, he refused, giving as a
reason that England and France and himself had not as
yet recognized the Southern Confederacy; stating also that
he had voluntarily taken the oath
<pb id="aughey175" n="175"/>
of allegiance to the United States government, which he
regarded as binding—this in North Mississippi.</p>
        <p>“Third specification.—That said Rev. John H.
Aughey was acting as a Federal agent in the purchase of
cotton, and that he had received a large sum of gold from
the United States government to pay for the cotton
purchased. 
</p>
        <p>“Second charge.—Enacting the spy.</p>
        <p> “That
said Aughey, while a citizen of the Confederate States,
repeatedly came into our lines for the
purpose of obtaining information for the benefit of the
enemy, and that he passed through the lines of the
enemy at will, holding an unlimited pass from Gen. Wm.
Nelson, of the Federal army, granting that privilege—this
in the vicinity of Corinth, Mississippi, in '61-2.</p>
        <p>“Witnesses—Wallace, Ferdinand Woodruff, J. B.
Coyner, Daniel Barnes, David Hough,—Williams, and J.
R. Simonson.”</p>
        <p>I demanded a copy of these charges, which Col.
Walter promised to furnish. He kindly bade me good-bye,
and left the prison.</p>
        <p>About 3 o'clock in the afternoon, I approached two
prisoners who were heavily ironed. They were
handcuffed, had bands and chains upon their ankles,
similar to mine, and were also chained together and to a
bolt in the floor. I inquired for what offence they were
incarcerated. The prisoner whom I addressed was a tall
gentleman with a very intellectual expression of
countenance and of prepossessing manners. He was pale
and sad.</p>
        <pb id="aughey176" n="176"/>
        <p>“We are charged with desertion.”</p>
        <p>“Did you desert?”</p>
        <p>“I enlisted in the Confederate service for twelve
months. At the expiration of my term of service I asked
permission to return home, stating that I had learned from
a trustworthy source that my family were suffering from a
lack of the necessaries of life; that they lived in
Tennessee, which is occupied by Federal troops.
Confederate money there has no purchasing power, not
being worth the paper on which it is printed; that I
desired to relieve my family from their distress, and as my
term of service had expired, I demanded my discharge.
This they refused, stating that the Confederate congress
had passed a law requiring all soldiers who had enlisted
for any term, however short, to be held to service during
the war, and that all who left before its close would be
considered guilty of desertion, and if arrested would be
shot. Regarding the law as a tyrannical enactment, and of
no binding force, I attempted to return to my family, but
was arrested and committed to this prison.”</p>
        <p>“What will be your fate?”</p>
        <p>“I don't know, but fear the worst. At our trial Gen.
Bragg said some salutary examples must be made to
deter soldiers from deserting, or the army would waste
away as snow before the bright beams of the vernal sun.
His bile and bitterness overflowed in acrimonious
invectives.”</p>
        <p>The other prisoner's statement was a perfect
counterpart of his comrade's.</p>
        <pb id="aughey177" n="177"/>
        <p>The first was named Melville Baillie, of Raleigh, Tennessee,
and the other Polk Childress, of Hickory
Wythe, Tenn.  Their friend, Parley Van Horn, of
Colliersville, Tenn., they left sick at the home of his
cousin, Felix Grundy Ayres, in Byhalia, Miss., who
thus escaped. I left them and walked to the opposite
side of the prison, when I observed a file of soldiers
drawn up in front of the prison. Two officers
entered, and walking up to the prisoners with whom
I had just been conversing, unfastened their chains,
and ordered them to follow. As the officers passed
Capt. Bruce, he asked, “What are you going to do
with these men?” “Going to shoot them,” was the
reply. They then showed him the warrant for their
execution, having written across it in red letters,
“condemned to death.” When the prisoners reached
the door, the file of soldiers separated, received the
prisoners into the space in their midst, marched
them across the railroad, and shot them.</p>
        <p>Thus was perpetrated an act of cruel tyranny that
cries loudly to heaven for vengeance. Two families,
helpless and destitute, were thus each deprived of its
head, upon whom they were dependent for support,
and abandoned to the cold charity of a selfish world.
The wages earned by a year's service in behalf of
the wicked, cruel, and vindictive Confederate states,
was an ignominious death and a dishonored grave.
The widow and the fatherless cry to heaven for vengeance, and
their cries have entered into the ears of the
Lord Of Sabaoth.</p>
        <pb id="aughey178" n="178"/>
        <p>The judge advocate of the army, Col. H. W. Walter,
returned to the prison and called my name. I speedily
confronted him. He brought a copy of the charges
preferred against me.</p>
        <p>He said: “My wife feels a deep interest in you. She is
very anxious in some way to secure your acquittal. I
received a letter from her to-day, a portion of which I will
read you: ‘Mr. Aughey's many friends in Holly Springs,
and I am of the number, earnestly request you to do all
you can for his release, that will comport with the
interests of our government. Remember that he is a
minister of the gospel, and deserves all the courtesy,
consideration, and kind treatment due to one who has
faithfully and zealously fulfilled his high calling in our
immediate vicinity—at Waterford and Spring Creek. Our
dear friend, Mrs. Louis Thompson, has a mother's
affection for him, and will visit him if permitted, that she
may minister to his comfort and intercede for his release.
He has often been our guest and has ever deported
himself as a Christian gentleman, <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">sans peur et sans
reproche</hi></foreign>,’ etc.”</p>
        <p>He informed me that my trial had been deferred until
Monday. He said, “You will be tried on Monday and
hanged on Tuesday at 2 o'clock P.M.”</p>
        <p>“Colonel, if my death is a foregone conclusion, you
may as well reverse the order, and hang me on Monday
and try me on Tuesday.”</p>
        <p>“I have examined the testimony against you. I know
the intention of the officers. Your own admissions
<pb id="aughey179" n="179"/>
are sufficient to condemn you. It is my
duty as judge advocate to do all I can for the prisoner,
and as a friend I would take pleasure in securing
your acquittal, if that result would comport
with the interests and safety of the
Confederate states. But you have done us all the harm
you could. Winfrey and Armstrong, young soldiers
from Choctaw county, have informed me all about
your seditious language and conduct while a pastor of churches
down there. They will appear against you.
The full extent of the injury you have done our cause
in North Mississippi can only be conjectured,
but it was to the extent of your ability
and opportunity.
Woodruff, Barnes, Crossland, Capt. George,
David Hough, Wallace, and J. B. Coyner, have given
sufficient testimony to Gens. Bragg, Beauregard, Jordan,
and Price, of your treasonable exploits to fill a volume. At
one time Gen<corr>.</corr> Bragg became so angry at the recital of your
Norman Bridge feat, that he came near ordering a detail to hang
you at once without the forms or farce of a trial. And he would
have done so, only Gen. Sterling Price interposed and insisted
that as you were a minister of the gospel
the right thing to do was to give you a fair and impartial trial.
As you were chained and closely guarded in the very midst of this
great army, escape was not possible, and a few days' respite could
not by any possibility injure the Southern Confederacy. Gen. Jordan,
who is Beauregard's chief of staff, declared that he ordered and inspected
the ironing,
<pb id="aughey180" n="180"/>
and that he would vouch for the security of the prisoner,
for a few days at least. At another time, when Dr.
Crossland recounted your insolence to Gen. Pfeiffer, at
Brooksville, Gen. Bragg could scarcely restrain his wrath,
and was upon the point of ordering your immediate
execution. He thought Gen. Pfeiffer did wrong to allow
you to express treasonable sentiments and to denounce
the Confederate cause. Your execution will be as
conspicuous as possible. It will take place in the
presence of two brigades, composed of soldiers, many of
whom are personally acquainted with you. There are
many Unionists up there in North-eastern Mississippi,
and a salutary example will not be lost on them. Some of
them are in our army here perforce, and will witness an
execution suggestive of their own fate if they should be
guilty of treasonable language or conduct. Your crimes
will be read to them and commented on by Major General
Hardee, if present, or Gen. Mark Lowrey, in case of his
absence.”</p>
        <p>“Colonel, I am a civilian. What right have they to try
me by military law. The civil court has jurisdiction, and
not a court-martial.”</p>
        <p>“All citizens of the Confederate States between 18 and
35 have been declared in the army, by congressional
enactment, and have been required to report themselves
at the head-quarters of the commander of the nearest
military district within a given time, or be considered
deserters. Have you complied with this law?”</p>
        <p>
          <figure id="ill12" entity="aughey180">
            <p>THEY HUNG MY SON TO THE LIMB OF A TREE. Page 187</p>
          </figure>
        </p>
        <pb id="aughey181" n="181"/>
        <p>“No, I have not. You have furnished me a copy of
the charges against me, with the specifications.
Desertion is not one of the charges.”</p>
        <p>“No, there are charges enough without that. I only
mention it to show you that that enactment gives
military jurisdiction over all citizens of military age. All
your interests are with the South. It is your adopted
home, though like myself you are of northern birth.
Why did you not cast in your lot with the dominant
class, for whose society you are fitted by
literary culture, and not with that class which is
giving us so great trouble, and whose treasonable
utterances and acts we must suppress with an iron
hand. Our own safety requires that we tolerate no
longer the traitors in our midst. We must confiscate
their property and exterminate them as we would
venomous serpents.”</p>
        <p>“Jefferson Davis, in his inaugural address, quoting
from the Declaration of Independence, declares that
when governments become destructive to the ends for
which they were established it is the right of the people
to alter or abolish them. Was it the end for which our
government was established to foster the interests of
human slavery? If so, and you deem it right to protect
those interests, go and fight in their defence, but do not
endeavor to compel me and the great majority of the
southern people who own no slaves to fight for your
interests, and to become the foes of a government that
has never trespassed upon our rights, a government
which has no superior
<pb id="aughey182" n="182"/>
upon the face of the earth. You may murder me, but you
cannot murder the government. If I had a thousand lives
I would gladly lay them all upon the altar of my bleeding
country.”</p>
        <p>“Parson, recanting your opinions would not save
you now. You have forfeited your life, and I will not insult
you by characterizing your crimes by their true names.”</p>
        <p>“Who said anything about recanting? I have no
desire to recant truthful principles. You may express
your opinion of my crimes, if you wish, and give their
true names.”</p>
        <p>“Well, your crimes are, treason, enacting the spy,
base ingratitude to your benefactors, and those who
have heretofore reposed confidence in you, by siding
with their enemies.”</p>
        <p>“Colonel, I have given a fair equivalent for all that I
have received, and I have injured no one wittingly, in
person, property, or reputation. My present condition
indicates that the ingratitude is all upon the other side. I
have labored faithfully for eleven years to promote the
intellectual and moral and religious interests of the
southern people, and they thus repay me with bonds and
imprisonment, and they intend to pay the last installment
by putting me to an ignominious death on the scaffold.”</p>
        <p>“Parson, I will call to-morrow, and should you have
any requests to make, such as conveying messages to
friends, disposition of property, or benefit of clergy at
your execution, I will fulfill them for you.”</p>
        <pb id="aughey183" n="183"/>
        <p>“I would be glad to have Rev. James A. Lyon,
D.D., of Columbus, to be present at my execution, also
Rev. James Pelan, of Macon.”</p>
        <p>“I will telegraph them at once.”</p>
        <p>“I will prepare messages for my wife and other friends by to-morrow
evening.”</p>
        <p>“I will secure their delivery at the earliest possible moment.”</p>
        <p>“Thanks, Colonel.”</p>
        <p>Soon after Col. Walter left, Col. Clare came in
and asked me whether I had been president of a female
college in Rienzi. I replied in the affirmative.
“ 'Tis strange,” said he, “that one who has been
so favored, and one who has accumulated property
in the South, should prove a traitor to his adopted
country and become its enemy.”</p>
        <p>I replied that I had given a fair equivalent for
every dollar I had obtained from the citizens of the South;
that for eleven years I had labored faithfully
as an educator and minister of the gospel to promote
the educational, moral, and spiritual interests of the
southern people in the states of Kentucky, Tennessee,
Louisiana, and Mississippi, and that now I was receiving
my reward by being chained, starved, and insulted, and that
they intended soon to pay the last installment
by putting me to death ignominiously on the scaffold.
I denied being an enemy to my country or to the
South, I regarded those who would promote
divisions and overthrow the government as the real
enemies
<pb id="aughey184" n="184"/>
of the South who were imperiling all her best interests. If
my advice had been followed the South and the whole
country would now be enjoying its wonted peace and
unparalleled prosperity, and would not have suffered
W. L. Yancey and other demagogues to precipitate a
desolating and ruinous revolution.</p>
        <p>He replied, “Ingrate, traitor, wretch, I have no
sympathy for you.” He then called upon all the supernal
and infernal powers to blast my soul in everlasting death
and confine it forever in fiery torments.</p>
        <p>The prison walls echoed and re-echoed his blatant
blasphemy. The prisoners stood aghast, and with faces
blanched with fear for my safety, plucked me away and
crowded the space between me and this vile blasphemer,
who, with hand upon the hilt of his sword and pistol belt
alternately, seemed ready to wreak his vengeance upon
me.</p>
        <p>At this moment Major Irion entered, and was informed
by this minion of Jeff Davis that he had relieved his mind
by giving me a “good cussen.” He left the prison with
this officer, cursing as he went.</p>
        <p>Perhaps I should have been more circumspect—more
reticent, and thus prevented this outpouring of the vials
of Confederate wrath by this cursing Shimei.</p>
        <p>At this moment Gen. Braxton Bragg and several
officers of high rank entered. A distinguished
<pb id="aughey185" n="185"/>
French officer was visiting this country on a tour of
inspection. He desired to visit this prison, and this
was the occasion of their visit. When they came to
the place where I was standing, Gen. Bragg said,</p>
        <p>“This man dies on Tuesday next.”</p>
        <p>“What is his offence?” inquired the officer.</p>
        <p>“He is a prisoner of state, and is guilty of treason.”</p>
        <p>“Are they all state prisoners in this prison?”</p>
        <p>“All except a few prisoners of war, who will be
removed to Macon, Ga., in a few days.”</p>
        <p>“This is a bastile, I suppose, but what has this prisoner done?”</p>
        <p>“What has he not done, would be a more pertinent question.
He has thrown all the influence of his official position as a minister
of the gospel into the scale of opposition against our government.”</p>
        <p>“He is a minister, then?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, a Presbyterian minister, of Northern birth and education.”</p>
        <p>“Ministers are usually regarded as non-combatants.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, but by word and deed and sermon and pen
and every species of treasonable act and utterance, he
has done our cause infinite harm. He is far from being a non-combatant.”</p>
        <p>“What is his name?” [Producing a note-book].</p>
        <p>“He spells his name A-u-g-h-e-y. I am not sure of its
pronunciation.”</p>
        <p>“O, yes, General, I recognize that name as of
French origin. We have the name in France—a
<pb id="aughey186" n="186"/>
family of Huguenots. Many of that family were banished
because of their opposition to the religious traditions of
our empire, and some of them, after the revocation of the
edict of Nantes, fled to the British Islands, and to
Germany and Holland, to avoid the penalty affixed to
disobeying the ecclesiastical regulations of our country.
He comes by his refractory opinions and conduct
legitimately.”</p>
        <p>Gen. Bragg is a cadaverous, plain-looking man. He has
bushy black eyebrows and piercing eyes. He stoops
slightly in walking, and his stubby iron-gray beard and
his receding forehead give him a plebeian look. He is
cruel as the grave. Nearly every day he shoots some of
his own soldiers, often for trivial offences. Cruelty is
plainly written in indelible characters upon every
lineament of his features, which are stern and almost
savage in their expression.</p>
        <p>After a thorough inspection of the prison our
distinguished visitors retired.</p>
        <p>I approached two elderly, gray-haired men, who sat in
the north-west corner of the prison. These old gentlemen
had become fast friends, and wept at the thought of
their bleeding country's woes, brought on by designing,
scheming politicians (not statesmen) in the interests of
an institution subversive of all the inalienable rights of
man. They gave me their history. The older gentleman,
John Champe, was the youngest son of a revolutionary
sire. His father had been chosen by Washington to effect
the capture of Benedict Arnold after his treason, so as to
save
<pb id="aughey187" n="187"/>
the life of Major André. This, because of untoward
circumstances, he could not accomplish. But the effort
was a gallant and heroic one, and merited and received
high commendation from Gen. Washington. This is his
story:</p>
        <p>“I resided in Tuscumbia, Ala. I had four sons.
Three of them had joined the Federal army. One
night an attack was made on my house. My youngest
son and I defended ourselves, but after killing
four of our assailants, they burst in the door. We
fled by the back door, and endeavored to reach the
Federal lines. A company pursued us with blood-hounds.
They overtook us. We fought with desperation.
We killed five hounds and four of the
soldiers. We expended all our ammunition. We
were both severely wounded. They hung my son to
the limb of a tree, and left the body to be devoured
by the birds of prey. They put me in irons and
brought me here. Why they spared my life I know
not. The surgeon informs me that my wound in the
breast will prove fatal in a short time. It gives me great
pain. I would like much to see my aged wife, who, alone
and surrounded by bitter foes, is mourning our
absence.”</p>
        <p>The other said. “My name is Carter Braxton. I was
named for my grandfather, a signer of the Declaration of
Independence. My home is in Obion county, Tenn. My
four sons are all in the Federal army. This is the cause of
my imprisonment. They asked me if I were a Unionist,
and I replied that it
<pb id="aughey188" n="188"/>
was a principle of law that no one was bound to
criminate himself. I have had my trial. They
proved that I had refused to take Confederate money,
that I have traded with the Yankees, that my four
sons were in the Federal army, that I was not a
slaveholder, that I refused to take the oath of allegiance
to the Confederate states, that after the reduction
of Fort Donaldson I had told one George Sarbaugh
that it would take more than one Southerner to whip
five Yankees.”</p>
        <p>While he was yet speaking, the officer entered, and
this old gentleman and a prisoner named Jason Chenault
were unchained and marched to the fatal plat
and shot. Chenault was a Kentucky Unionist,
who had come to Mississippi to collect money due him for
mules sold the year before. He was arrested, charged
with enacting the spy, found guilty, and shot. I
might record the sad fate of Nicholas Vedder, Bynum,
Sorrell, and Oswald, all shot at the same time, for
avowed Unionism, but space is wanting. I
may place upon a permanent record in the near future the
biographies of these and other martyrs to the holy
cause of our country's integrity imperiled by traitors.</p>
        <p>I preached every evening. One evening my text was I. Kings xviii. 21:
“How long halt ye between two
opinions.” As none of us had a hymn book, I composed
these hymns for the occasion. I parceled them out by couplets, and
all joined in the singing:</p>
        <lg type="song">

        <p>Two young men, John N. Maple, of Verona, Miss., and
Samuel Melvin, of Tallaloosa, Miss., the former a
Primitive Baptist, the latter a Methodist, held a
discussion on the doctrine of foreordination. Some point
in my sermon occasioned it. They both appeared to
believe in the doctrine, since the term was used in the
Bible. Melvin said the decrees of God were founded
upon His foreknowledge. In the case of Paul, God
foresaw all the contingencies and knew because of His
prescience how they would eventuate, and based His
decree that Paul should stand before Cæsar upon that
foreknowledge. Maple affirmed that God knew that Paul
would stand before Cæsar because He had decreed it.
That He did not stand aside an indifferent spectator to
observe how affairs would result, and then decree that
they should take place, as He foresaw they would
happen anyhow. That all that God does in time He
always intended to do, and all that wicked men do He
always intended to suffer or permit them to do. He would
allow them to do wickedly in the exercise of the freedom
of their will, only so far as He chose to overrule their
wickedness for the promotion of His declarative glory,
and the remainder of wrath He would restrain. Beyond
the boundary of His will He would hem them in by His
providence, and say, so far shalt thou go and no farther.
Foreordination is founded upon the will of God, and not
upon His foreknowledge of what man will do or what He
foresees will happen. At the close of their debate
<pb id="aughey191" n="191"/>
it was found that neither had convinced the other of
his error, nor any one else.</p>
        <p>A man of Herculean frame, whose height was six
feet eight inches, occupied the space on the floor next
to mine as sleeping quarters. This space he called his
dormitory. He gave me his history thus:</p>
        <p>“I am a native of East Tennessee. I was born in Tellico Plains, Monroe
Co., measurably brought up in Conasauga, Polk Co. I married
Miss Tennie Paden, bought a farm near Dandridge, of one Geo.
Cogsil, and moved on it in the year 1860. My own name is Hermon
Bledsoe. I was chosen a delegate to the mass convention of Unionists,
held June 17, 1861, in Greenville, Tennessee, to protest against the
tyranny inaugurated over us by the rebel authorities. I was a member
of the committee which prepared the following address, which was
adopted by the convention with entire unanimity. We first detailed the
facts of the election, how in Middle and West Tennessee the people were
overawed, bullied, persecuted into an adoption of the ordinance; how
the secessionists had prepared for the furtherance of their schemes, though
the state had voted No Separation; how no provision was made for
examining the returns otherwise than by a disunion governor, whose
hold on power depended upon the success of the secession program;
how volunteers in the secession army were allowed to vote within and
<hi rend="italics">without</hi> the state, contrary to any law; how discussion was forbidden in
those sections where the secession vote was triumphant,
<pb id="aughey192" n="192"/>
while every Union paper there was crushed out; how a
military despotism was ruling in spite of the wishes and
rights of the people. The address then went on to say, in
behalf of the loyal Unionist majority:</p>
        <p>“ ‘We prefer to remain attached to the Government of
our fathers. The Constitution of the United States has
done us no wrong. The congress of the United States
has passed no law to oppress us. The president of the
United States has made no threat against the law abiding
people of Tennessee. Under the Government of the
United States we have enjoyed, as a nation, more of civil
and religious freedom than any other people under the
whole heaven. We believe that there is no cause for
secession nor rebellion on the part of the people of
Tennessee. None was assigned by the legislature in
their miscalled declaration of independence. No
adequate cause can be assigned. The select committee
of that body asserted a gross and inexcusable falsehood
in their address to the people of Tennessee, when they
declared that the Government of the United States had
made war upon them.</p>
        <p>“The secession cause has thus far been sustained
by deception and falsehood, by falsehood as to the
action of congress; by false dispatches as to battles that
were never fought and victories that were never won;
by false accounts as to the purpose of the president; by
false representations as to the views of Union men; and
by false pretenses as to the facility with which the
secession troops would take possession
<pb id="aughey193" n="193"/>
of the capital and capture the highest officers
of the Government. The cause of secession or rebellion has
no charms for us, and its progress has been marked by the most
alarming and dangerous attacks upon the public liberty. In other
states, as well as our own, its whole course threatens to annihilate
the last vestiges of freedom. While peace and prosperity have
blest us in the Government of the United States, the following may be
enumerated as some of the fruits of secession.</p>
        <p>“ ‘It was urged forward by members of congress
who had sworn to support the Constitution of the United States,
and were themselves supported by the Government; it was effected
without consultation with all the states interested in the slavery
question,
and without exhausting peaceable remedies. It has plunged
the country into civil war, paralyzed our commerce, interfered
with the whole trade and business of our country, lessened the
value of our property, destroyed many of the pursuits of life, and
bids fair to involve the whole nation in irretrievable
bankruptcy and ruin. It has changed the entire relations of states,
and adopted constitutions without submitting them to a vote of the
people, and where such a vote has been authorized, it has been upon
the condition prescribed by Senator Mason, of Virginia, that those
who voted the Union ticket must leave the state. It has advocated a
constitutional monarchy, a king, and a dictator, and is, through the Richmond press,
at this moment recommending to the convention
<pb id="aughey194" n="194"/>
in Virginia a restriction of the right of suffrage, and
in severing connection with the Yankees, to abolish
every vestige of resemblance to the institutions of that
detested race. It has formed military leagues, passed
military bills, and opened the door for oppressive
taxation, without consulting the people, and then, in
mockery of a free election, has required them by their
votes to sanction its usurpations, under the penalty of
moral proscription or at the point of the bayonet. It has
offered a premium for crime in directing the discharge of
volunteers from criminal prosecutions, and
recommending the judges not to hold their courts. It has
stained our statute book with the repudiation of
Northern debts, and has greatly violated the
Constitution, by attempting through its unlawful
extension to destroy the right of suffrage. It has called
upon the people in the state of Georgia, and may soon
require the people of Tennessee, to contribute all their
surplus cotton, corn, wheat, bacon, beef, etc., to the
support of pretended governments alike destitute of
money and credit. It has attempted to destroy the
accountability of public servants to the people by secret
legislation, and set the obligation of an oath at defiance.
It has passed laws declaring it treason to say or do
anything in favor of the Government of the United
States, or against the Confederate states, and such a law
is now before, and we apprehend will soon be passed by,
the legislature of Tennessee. It has attempted to destroy,
and we fear will soon utterly prostrate, the freedom
<pb id="aughey195" n="195"/>
of the speech and of the press. It has involved the
Southern states in a war whose success is hopeless,
and which must ultimately lead to the ruin of the people.
Its bigoted, overbearing, and intolerant spirit
has already subjected the people of East Tennessee to
many petty grievances; our people have been insulted;
our flags have been fired upon and torn down; our houses have
been rudely entered; our families subjected to insult;
our peaceable meetings interrupted; our women and children
shot by a merciless soldiery; our towns pillaged; our citizens
robbed and some of them assassinated and murdered.
No effort has been spared to deter the Union men of East Tennessee
from the expression of their free thoughts. The penalties
of treason have been threatened against them, and murder and assassination
have been openly encouraged by leading secession journals. As
secession has been thus overbearing and intolerant while in the minority
in East Tennesee, nothing better can be expected of the pretended
majority than wild, unconstitutional, and oppressive legislation;
an utter contempt and disregard of law; a determination
to force every Unionist in the state to swear to the support of a
constitution he abhors, and to yield his
money and property to aid a cause he detests, and to become the
object of scorn and derision as well as the victim of intolerable and
relentless oppression.</p>
        <p>“In view of these considerations, and of the fact that the people of East
Tennessee have declared their fidelity to the Union by a majority of
about
<pb id="aughey196" n="196"/>
twenty thousand votes, therefore we do resolve and declare.’</p>
        <p>“Here followed a series of patriotic resolutions, and
the appointment of a committee to prepare a memorial,
asking the consent of the legislature of Tennessee to
consent to the separation of East Tennessee, and those
counties of Middle Tennessee which desired it, from the
rest of the state, that they may be formed into a separate
state.</p>
        <p>“Brownlow, Maynard, Etheridge, Nelson, Hawkins,
Johnson, etc., led the Unionists. It was not long before
those Unionists and protestants against wrong were
flying for their lives, and were hunted down like wild
beasts. The leaders disappeared from observation, and
the people could only become quiescent in a state of
affairs which, in the presence of the armed minions of the
Southern Confederacy, they were powerless to prevent.</p>
        <p>“I was placed on the proscribed list, and was
compelled to hide in a cavern with other Unionists. One
night I visited my family, which consisted of my wife and
twin babes, Mark and Paul. A band of guerrillas, lying in
ambush in the chaparral near my residence, surrounded
the house, and rushing through the door, which for the
moment I had forgotten to fasten, took me prisoner. They
searched my person and found several copies of the
address above given, and some letters in a drawer, which
were construed unfavorably by these cruel men. They
handcuffed me and took me to the chaparral copse. They
held
<figure id="ill13" entity="aughey196"><p>I CALLED, ‘HALLO, UNLCE!’ AS HE RESTED FOR A MOMENT. Page 200</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey197" n="197"/>
a brief trial, which resulted in my conviction and
condemnation to death. Immediate preparations were
made for my execution. Douglas Flinn declared that
hanging was too good for such a wretch as I. Jim
Bainbridge coincided with him in opinion. ‘What do you
want done with him?’ said Bob. Torrence, who
commanded the gang. ‘Let us burn him at the stake, like
Col. Brown's Sam last week, for assaulting a white girl.’
 ‘All right,’ said Torrence. ‘All in favor of 
burning this d—d
renegade, this Lincolnite, this tory and traitor, say aye.’
A vociferous aye resounded. ‘All opposed, no.’ Only two
voices responded in the negative. Sam Lovell took off
the handcuffs and bound me to a sapling with the rope
with which they had intended to hang me. The trial had
begun in the gloaming, and now darkness had
enshrouded all the land. Flinn ran and gathered an
armful of dry sticks and deposited them in a pile at my
feet. Soon many were engaged in gathering fagots.
Flinn declared that this was the happiest night of his
existence. He would soon have the pleasure of seeing
this miserable traitor going up like Elijah in a chariot of
fire. ‘So mote it be,’ growled Jacob Embry, in a
sepulchral tone. George Goshen, Peter Peters, and J. B.
Coyner were dispatched to Aunt Sylvia Caldwell's for a
firebrand with which to ignite the pile of fagots.
I commended my soul to God and calmly awaited death.
Flinn approached me with a pile of (as he said) very
dry wood. He approached quite near, and dropping the
<pb id="aughey198" n="198"/>
fagots he placed a knife handle between my teeth. The
large blade of the knife was open. He then ran to and
mounted a stump about fifty yards distant, and
commenced to deliver a harangue laudatory of the
Southern Confederacy, and denouncing all traitors,
wishing them in the bottom of the lowest hell.</p>
        <p>“With some effort I managed to sever the cord binding
my wrists. I then cut the cord bound around my waist,
and quietly and quickly made my escape. The crowd
around Flinn, who was doubtless a Unionist in disguise,
were cheering vociferously, which aided my escape, as
the noise drowned the crackling of the fagots as I
removed or trampled upon them on the farther side from
the stump orator and his auditors. Soon the men with the
fire arrived and applied it to the heap around the sapling.
Looking back from a hill about two miles distant I saw the
flames rising higher and higher, till a large space was
illuminated. Suddenly I heard fierce yells of disappointment
and rage, emanating from the throats of this infuriated
and disappointed crowd of demons incarnate, maddened
to frenzy by my escape. I traveled by night, but lay
concealed during the day.</p>
        <p>“When in hiding near Siluria, Shelby county,
Alabama, I heard the sound of a wood-chopper's ax,
quite near, and peering from the copse in which I
was concealed, I saw a slave at work felling a tree.
Soon he began to declaim a piece:</p>
        <pb id="aughey199" n="199"/>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“ ‘The hillsides in places are white I know,</l>

        </lg>
        <p>“ ‘Now,’ said he, apparently well satisfied with his effort,
 ‘Dat's 'bout as good as young Massa Josiah hisself could

from his labor, with arms akimbo.  ‘Who am dat calling?’
he cried out, with some degree of trepidation. As he
looked in my direction, I beckoned him to approach me.
When he came near I said, ‘To whom do you belong?
Where do you live?’ He replied, ‘I belongs to Major

Shorter, of Choccolocco, Calhoun county, last year. I

finger of his right hand to a cabin almost lost to sight in
the distance, nestling among the trees in a grove
surmounting a hill of great height. He named it cosy cot,
and the name was not a misnomer.</p>

he and his kind wife fed and lodged me for a week, till I
was sufficiently recovered from my fatigue to continue
my journey.

<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>On the broad highway of action,</l><l>Friends of worth are far and few;</l><l>But when one has proved his friendship,</l><l>Cling to him who clings to you.</l></lg></q>
Should opportunity ever be afforded for reciprocating
the kindness of this slave husband and wife, Isam
and Tabitha, I will gladly avail myself of it, and do them
all the kindness in my power.</p>
        <p>“I continued my journey, and with but little of
incident or adventure worth narrating, I at length arrived
at the home of my cousin Jerry Humboldt, in Selma,
Ala. My cousin was a staunch Unionist,
a stalwart, uncompromising friend of the United
States government and the old flag, the star-spangled
banner, the emblem of freedom and the inalienable rights of man.</p>
        <p>“Every day dangers thickened around us. We
were compelled to devise a plan of escape to the
Federal lines. Twenty-five of us set out together,
under the guidance of Leander Browning. At Talahatta
Springs, Clark county, a band of guerrillas, or partisan
rangers, as they called themselves, overtook us as we
were camping for the night. We fought them long and well,
till we had slain nearly twice our number of our pursuers, then,
as the darkness grew denser, the remnant of us, wounded and
bleeding, fled.</p>
        <p>“I was captured at Sanwilpa, was taken to Tuscahoma, put into
a guard house. Soon after I was conveyed to Pushmataha; thence
I was removed to
<pb id="aughey202" n="202"/>
this dungeon in Tupelo, Miss. I adroitly concealed my
identity, and though under violent suspicion nothing
definite was proved against me. To save my life, I have
agreed to take the oath of allegiance, and join the rebel
army. I may soon be able to desert and reach the Union
lines. My <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">nom de guerre</hi></foreign> is Ralph Benton.”</p>
        <p>“Have you any conscientious scruples about the
propriety of taking an oath with the deliberate intention
of violating it?”</p>
        <p>“Not any. It may save my life. At least deliver me from
this prison. Deception is certainly justifiable in a case like
this. The rebels have violated every oath that they have
ever taken. Shall we keep faith with them? Naught but
Punic faith for them. As soon trust a rattlesnake as a
rebel. I hope to reach the Union lines and offer my
services to General Pope as a volunteer in his army.”</p>
        <p>On the next day my friend was permitted to take
the oath and enter the rebel army. He had several
copies of the address concealed about his person, as
he thought beyond the reach of rebel search, one of
which he gave me. I retain it as a sacred memento.
A rumor reached me through Philip Henson, a
Federal spy, that my friend was under violent
suspicion by the rebels, and was caught in his attempt
at escape, and shot by order of Gen. N. B. Forrest.</p>
        <p>Anent this rumor, Gen. Jefferson C. Davis told me
that a soldier in his command bore the name and
answered the description of Hermon Bledsoe; that
<pb id="aughey203" n="203"/>
he was a deserter from the enemy; that he was
severely wounded in a skirmish, and that his recollection
was that his wound proved fatal.</p>
        <p>One of my fellow-prisoners became suddenly insane.
He frothed at the mouth, rolled his eyes wildly, and
butted his head against the walls of the prison. His
paroxysms were very violent in the presence of the officers.
I sat near him, and after observing him for awhile
I came to the conclusion that he was a malingerer.
Presently an officer entered, at that instant the crazy man
was seized with another paroxysm.
He became very violent. The officer watched him for some
time and then said, “We must remove him to the hospital
that he may die there, for there seems little hope of his ultimate
recovery, he is so sick and crazy and fierce.”</p>
        <p>This man's name was Bovard Willis, a Unionist, of Biloxi, Miss.
After the officer's departure he quieted down in a very short time.
I approached him and said:</p>
        <p>“Willis, I do not profess to be an alienist, but I
know that you are no more crazy than I am. I will
not betray you. What is your motive in feigning madness?”</p>
        <p>He replied, “If I am taken to the hospital I will have a far better
opportunity of escaping. I voted against secession, I led the Unionists
in our county, I became very obnoxious to the secessionists, and
there is no hope for me but escape.”</p>
        <p>In the evening he was removed to the hospital. The next morning he was
missing. He had unfortunately
<pb id="aughey204" n="204"/>
left some clothing in the hospital. The company
that went in search of him let the hounds smell the
garment. Soon they struck his trail and followed it to the
creek. Willis, upon reaching the creek, waded in it three
miles, and thus baffled his pursuers for several hours. In
the afternoon they recovered the trail and followed it
rapidly for several miles. By this time Willis had reached
a house ten miles south-west of Tupelo. He went to it at
a venture. He asked for water. The proprietor seemed to
know by intuition the character of this wanderer. He told
his wife to prepare some food for this stranger. While he
was eating, the howling of the hounds was heard. Willis
rose in great trepidation. His host at once interpreted
the reason. No plan seemed feasible for the concealment
of the fugitive. Mrs. Quay suggested the closet as a
hiding
place, but her husband thought it unsafe, as it was in a
part of the house so exposed that it would be among the
first places searched. The blood-hounds finding the
track fresh were pursuing with great speed.</p>
        <p>Mr. Quay said, pointing to a tree about two hundred
yards distant, “If you could reach that tree, you would
find a secure asylum till your pursuers had gone on, or
returned supposing they were on the wrong trail. The
horses are in the field, if I can only get one up in time
and carry you over to the tree and get back before they
reach us you will be safe.”</p>
        <p>Just then the hounds broke out afresh into loud
howls and sharp yelps.</p>
        <pb id="aughey205" n="205"/>
        <p>“They are too near for that that” said Willis, “I am
lost.”</p>
        <p>“Pa,” said little Violetta Quay (who was only
six years old), “you just tote that man over to the tree.”</p>
        <p>“I'll do it,” said her pa. He stooped down, and Willis perched himself
upon his shoulders and was borne to the tree, and in an incredibly
short space of time was concealed amid the foliage of the loftiest
branches of this mighty king of the forest.</p>
        <p>Quay had just time to return and enter his house
when the hounds bounded into his yard, their fierce
yelps betokening that they knew that the object of
their pursuit was near. Soon the pursuing cavalry
entered the yard, and dismounting, began unceremoniously
a thorough but bootless search of the house
and premises. They questioned strictly each member of the
family, but they were all woefully ignorant. The officer
in charge asked little Violetta if she had seen any stranger
about lately. She replied, “If I
had I wouldn't tell you. I just wish the poor man
would come here, I'd hide him if I could from those
awful dogs.” The hounds were completely baffled. They would
not leave the track indicated by the scent of Willis' garment for
any other. After two hours of fruitless endeavor to recover the track,
they left Mr. Quay's house and returned.</p>
        <p>Willis was now among friends. After some night spent in hiding, Willis was
conveyed by nocturnal journeys from one friendly post to another, till he
<pb id="aughey206" n="206"/>
reached the Federal lines at Memphis, Tenn. Willis did
not change quarters till the guides were ready to enter
upon their perilous task of guiding a band of Unionists,
of which Willis was one, to the Federal lines. He said,
“There is no place so safe as where the hounds have
been.” And so the experiment proved the adage true.
Willis was not molested in this sylvan retreat, though the
whole country north to the Federal lines was repeatedly
traversed by cavalry and hounds.</p>
        <p>M. T. Anderson, of Millersburg, Holmes Co., O., came
to me and said:</p>
        <p>“Mr. Aughey, I am very sorry for you. There is hope
for me. I am a prisoner of war. If I survive the horrors of
imprisonment I will be exchanged, but for you, a prisoner
of state, there is no hope except by eluding the vigilance
of the guards and making your way through this great
army, and traversing a long stretch of hostile country to
the Federal lines. Now, sir, I am not superstitious, but I
had a dream last night that has deeply impressed me. I
thought that I was caught up into heaven, into the midst
of the Paradise of God, and as I stood dazed amid the
splendors of the city of the Great King, and
bewildered by the light and resplendent glory that
emanated from the great white throne, and Him that is
seated thereon, I heard a voice saying, ‘Who will go for
us to earth, and deliver my servant from bonds and
imprisonment and impending death, that he may longer
proclaim my gospel?’ Suddenly there appeared
<pb id="aughey207" n="207"/>
before the throne a form of wondrous beauty,
apparently a young man—of radiant countenance;
from every feature beamed love and peace and good-will,
who said, ‘Here am I. Send me. I will go and deliver him and
bring him safely to the desired haven.’  ‘Who art thou?’ said the
recording angel, who sat hard by the throne of God. ‘I am Ariel,
the lion of Jehovah, who am made strong to deliver his chosen ones
from all their enemies that rise up against them to destroy them. I
delivered Peter from Herod's dungeon, and many saints who were
shut up in prison have I released,’ and he was bidden to perform
the mission. And then I heard the voice of a multitude saying, ‘Go,
and Jehovah, merciful and gracious, mighty and strong to deliver,
give thee abundant success.’ And all the host of heaven responded,
 ‘Amen.’ Then a voice said to me,  ‘Return and make known the vision
to my servant, who in bonds is breaking to thee and those with thee the
bread of eternal life.’ I awoke trembling and astonished.</p>
        <p>“Now, I entertain more than a mere presentiment
of your escape. I am so fully impressed with the truth that my
dream was a revelation of God's will concerning you, that I
firmly believe that these wicked men will not be suffered in the
providence of God to take your life. I predict that many, many years
of successful labor in your Master's vineyard are before you;
many souls, by your instrumentality, are to be brought into the fold
of Christ and the kingdom of heaven.”</p>
        <pb id="aughey208" n="208"/>
        <p>“I wish you may not be a false prophet, and that
your dream may not be verified. The eye of faith alone
can discern a ray of hope. Sight shows a prison, strong and
closely guarded, a mighty army of watchful and malignant foes, chains,
fetters, guards on the alert, pickets, patrols, videttes, blood-hounds
innumerable, my sun of life apparently on the horizon's
verge. The hour of my departure fixed. Many, many
miles intervening between my prison and a place of safety—a
city of refuge. A physical frame
enfeebled by starvation and surrounding horrors
which have been endured for many weary months,
which are lengthening into years. It does indeed
require strong faith to discern a ray of hope or glimmer
of light to irradiate the future. Next Tuesday
ends all, my foes have decreed. If God in his providence
has longer life in store for me I will be spared.
But I feel that I have received dying grace,
and dying grace is reserved for a dying hour.
However, should any plan of escape present itself, I will
not be slow to avail myself of it. But my only hope is
in escape. The vindictive Confederate authorities
are determined to put me to death at the hour mentioned
by Col. Walter. They are implacable and
unmerciful, and it irketh them to await the appointed
hour. I would like much to live for my
dear wife's sake, and our dear infant's sake. By
this cruel deed of rebel hate, my wife will be widowed
and my child made fatherless. But God has
promised to be the husband of the widow and the
<pb id="aughey209" n="209"/>
father of the fatherless. To his covenant-keeping care I
commit them both, and the babe unborn.”</p>
        <p>Feeling assured that my departure from this terrestrial
sphere was near, I sat down upon the floor of my
dungeon and penned the following letter to my wife:</p>
        <q direct="unspecified">

                <p>The Confederate authorities announce to me that I have
only a few more days to live. When you receive this letter
the hand that penned it will be cold in death. My soul,
divested of the body, will have passed the solemn test
before the bar of God; I have a good hope through grace
that I will then be rejoicing amid the sacramental host of
God's elect, singing the new song of redeeming love in
the presence of Him who is the chief among ten thousand
and the one altogether lovely. Mary, meet me in heaven,
where sorrow and tears and temptation and sin are
unknown, and where the wicked cease from troubling
and the weary are at rest. If General Bragg will
permit my body to be taken in charge by my friends,
I will ask your brother, D. R. Paden, and cousin,
Capt. Jas. H. Tankersley, to convey it to you. Bury
me in the cemetery at Bethany church. That was
my first ministerial charge. Plant a cedar at my
head and one at my feet, and there let me repose in
peace till the archangel's trump shall sound, summoning
the dead to the judgment of the great day,
and vouchsafing to saints the long hoped for redemption
<pb id="aughey210" n="210"/>
of the body. As to my Property has all, by
Confederate laws, been confiscated, and after years of
incessant toil I leave you penniless and dependent,
but I implore you to trust in God. To his kind,
protecting care I commit you and our dear little Kate.
Jehovah has promised to be the widow's husband and the
father of the fatherless. Rest assured the Lord
will provide. Only trust Him and love Him with
your whole heart and soul and mind and strength. I
know that it shall be well with them that love God.
Be not faithless, but believing, and though clouds
and darkness surround you at present, well-nigh obscuring
the spiritual sky whence hope emanates, yet be assured a more
auspicious day will dawn, and God will bring you safely to your
journey's end, and our reunion in heaven will be sweet.</p>
                <p>Our dear little daughter, Kate, bring up in the
nurture and admonition of the Lord. Teach her to walk
in wisdom's ways, for all her ways are pleasantness and
all her paths are peace. Her infant mind may be compared
to wax in its susceptibility for receiving impressions, and to
marble for its power in retaining those impressions. O! that
she may be satisfied early with thy mercy, O, God, that she
may rejoice and be glad all her days. Teach her to remember
her Creator in the days of her youth, before the evil days come in
which she shall say, I have no pleasure in them. Make the Bible,
the precious Bible, her constant study, and let its words be as household words to her.
Inspire her mind with a
<pb id="aughey211" n="211"/>
love of <hi rend="italics">the Book</hi> which is able to make wise unto
salvation. See to it that the words of Christ dwell richly in
her soul, that she may be filled with knowledge and
wisdom and spiritual understanding. Pray for the Holy
Spirit to bless your labors and counsels. Without his
blessing all your labor would be in vain. Pray that the third
Person of the adorable Trinity, the Spirit of the living God,
may take up his abode in her heart, to abide with her
forever. As my duties in regard to instructing our child will
devolve solely upon you, take for your guidance in this
respect Deut. vi. 5-9. Let your example be such as you
would wish her to follow. Children are much more inclined
to follow example than precept. Exercise care in this
respect, for as is the mother so is her daughter. I regret
that my family, from the force of circumstances, will be
compelled to remain in a section where, by many, my
course of conduct which led to my death will be
considered disgraceful. But this cannot be avoided. The
time, I feel sure, will come when, even in Mississippi, I
will be regarded as a patriot martyr. My conscience is void
of offence as regards guilt in the charge preferred against
me. When the wicked bear rule the people mourn. What
cruelties are being perpetrated by rebels against God and
their country. How long, O, Lord, how long shall the
wicked triumph? How long will God forbear to execute that
vengeance which is his, and which he will repay in his
own good time? I have an abiding confidence that
<pb id="aughey212" n="212"/>
the right cause will prevail, and though I shall not live to
see it, for my days are numbered, yet I firmly believe
since God is a God of justice and an avenger of the
righteous who serve him faithfully, that the rebel power
will be destroyed utterly.</p>

Rev. John H. Aughey.</p>
                <p>The subject of the above 
notice suffered death on the
gallows at the hands of the Confederate military
authorities, on the charges of treason and enacting the
spy. John H. Aughey was born in New Hartford, Oneida
county, N. Y., May 8, 1828. Removed with his parents to
Steubenville, O., July 4, 1837. Is an alumnus of Franklin
College, New Athens, Ohio. His theological instructors
were, Revs. L. A. Lowrey, Winchester, Ky.; Jahleel
Woodbridge, Baton Rouge, La.; John H. Gray, D.D., Geo.
W. Coons, D.D., and Rev. J. O. Steadman, D.D., Memphis,
Tenn.; Rev. Chas. S. Dod, Rev. H. H. Paine, and Rev. S.
Irwin Reid, Holly Springs, Miss. Was licensed to preach
the gospel by the Presbytery of Chickasaw, October 4,
1856. Ordained to the full work of the ministry by the
Presbytery of Tombeckbee, April 19, 1861. Was married
January 22, 1857, by Rev. R. Henderson, to Miss Mary J.
Paden, of Iuka, Miss., who, with one child, a daughter,
born September 3, 1858, survives him. God blessed his
labors by giving him many souls as seals to his ministry.
After eleven years labor in the South as an educator and
minister of the gospel, having never injured a citizen of
the South in person or property, he fell a victim to
secession hatred, and died a felon's death, because he
would not become
<pb id="aughey214" n="214"/>
a traitor to the government which had never in a
single instance trespassed upon his rights of person or
property. He rests in peace and in the hope of a blessed
immortality beyond the grave. “Take

in the perfect, spotless robes of his own righteousness
and thus present me faultless before the throne. With this
trust I go to the judgment seat, assured that the soul that
implicitly trusts in Jesus shall never be put to shame. He is

the sun. All that a man hath will he give for his
life. Having promise of the life that now is. The
life is more than meat. They hunt for the precious

the high estimate that is placed upon life. My life
is not precious in the eyes of these virulent secessionists,
for their military rulers declare that on the 15th

me the all-beholding sun shall see no more in all his

debt of gratitude which I can never repay. Though I
cannot, God will grant you a reward lasting as eternity. It
will add to that exceeding and eternal weight of glory
which will be conferred upon you in that day when the
heavens shall be dissolved and the elements shall melt
with fervent heat. I die for my loyalty to the Federal
Government. I know that you would not have me turn
traitor to save my life. Life is precious, but death, even
death on the scaffold, is preferable to dishonor.

Remember me kindly to all my friends.
Tell Sallie, Violetta, David, Lizzie, Mary, and
Emma, my dear sisters and brother, to meet me in
heaven. I know that my Redeemer lives. Dying is but
going home. I have taught many how to live and how to die
happily. Now by example I am called to teach them how to die
as becometh the Christian. May God in mercy grant that as my day
my strength may be, and that in my last moments I may not by
slavish fear bring dishonor upon my Master's cause, but may glorify
Him in the fires. Remember me to my old, tried, true, and trusted
friend, Henry Spence. I have no doubt you are constantly praying
for me. I will soon be in that glorious home where prayer is lost
in praise, faith is changed to sight, and death is swallowed up in
victory. Farewell till we meet beyond the river.</p>

                <p>DEAR SIR— A large number of citizens of Mississippi,
holding Union sentiments, and who recognized
no such military usurpation as the so-called
Confederate States of America, are confined in a filthy
prison, sadly infested with vermin, and are
<pb id="aughey218" n="218"/>
famishing from hunger—a sufficient quantity of food not
being furnished us. We are separated from our families,
and not suffered to hold any communication with them.
We are compelled under a strong guard to perform the
most menial services, and are often grossly and flagrantly
insulted by the officers and guards of the prison. The
nights are very cool, after the torrid heat of the day. We
are not furnished with bedding, and are compelled to lie
down upon the hard floor of our dungeon, where
refreshing sleep is not possible. When exhausted nature
can hold out no longer our slumbers are broken, restless,
and of short duration. Our property is confiscated and our
families left destitute of the necessaries of life, all that they
possessed, yea, all their living having been seized by the
Confederates and converted to their own use. Heavy iron
fetters are placed upon our limbs, and daily some of us
are led to the scaffold or to death by shooting. Many are
forced into the army, instant death being the penalty in
case of refusal, thus constraining us to bear arms against
our country, to become the executioners of our friends
and brethren, or to fall ourselves by their hands.</p>
                <p>These evils are intolerable, and we ask protection
through you from the United States Government. Please
present our humble and earnest petition to his
excellency, Abraham Lincoln, president of the United
States, that he may take it under advisement and if
possible afford us speedy relief. The Federal Government
may not now be able to release us, but we
<pb id="aughey219" n="219"/>
ask the protection which the Federal prisoner receives.
Were his life taken, swift retribution would be
visited upon the rebels by just retaliation; one or
more rebel prisoners would suffer death for every
Federal prisoner whom they destroyed.</p>
                <p>Let this rule hold good in case of Unionists who
are citizens of the states in rebellion. The loyal
Mississippian deserves the same protection accorded
the loyal Rhode Islander or Pennsylvanian. We
ask also that our confiscated property be restored to
us, or, in the event of our death, to our families. If
it be destroyed, we ask that reparation be demanded
from the rebel authorities, or that the property of
known and avowed secessionists be sequestered to
that use. Before this letter reaches its destination
the majority of us will have ceased to be. The judge
advocate, Col. H. W. Walter, of the rebel army, has
informed the writer that he must die on the 15th
inst. We have therefore little hope that we individually
can receive any personal benefit from this petition,
even though you should regard it favorably and
consent to its suggestions, but our families who have
been robbed, so cruelly robbed, of all their substance,
may, in the future, receive remuneration for their
great losses, and should citizens of avowed secession
proclivities who are within the Federal lines be
arrested and held as hostages for the safety of Unionists
who are and may be hereafter incarcerated in Tupelo and
elsewhere, the rebels will not dare put another Unionist to death.
</p>
                <pb id="aughey220" n="220"/>
                <p>Trusting that you will deem it proper to take the
prayers presented in our petition under advisement, and
afford us the protection desired, we remain, with high
considerations of respect and esteem your oppressed
and imprisoned fellow-citizens,</p>

        <p>Two young men, Donald Street and Samuel Maynard,
informed me to-day that they had been impressed into
the rebel service. They had been taken prisoner at
Corinth by General Pope, and had taken the oath of
allegiance to the Federal Government, to which their
hearts had always been loyal. Recently they had been
arrested by Parson Ellis and six other guerrillas, near
Rienzi, and being brought by them into the rebel camp,
they refused to rejoin their regiments, and in
consequence were immured in this dungeon. From the
threats of the officers they expected to be shot at any
moment. They had used every means to banish the
thoughts of death—had forced themselves to engage in
pleasantry and mirth to drive away the sadness and
gloom which oppressed them when alone, and when they
recalled the delights of their happy homes which they
would never see again. I counseled them to prepare to
meet their God in peace, wisely to improve the short time
granted them to make their peace, calling, and
<pb id="aughey221" n="221"/>
election sure. They replied that they hoped all
would be well. They had long since confessed
Christ before men, and hoped for salvation through
his merit alone. Still, they could not help feeling
sad, young as they were, in the near prospect of
death. They were both in their 20th year.</p>
        <p>While I was gone for water, these men were taken
to their doom and I never saw them more.</p>
        <p>One morning, as I lay restless and sore, endeavoring
to find some position which would be sufficiently
easy to permit me to secure, even for a few moments,
the benefit of tired nature's sweet restorer—
balmy sleep, the thought occurred that it would be
well to attempt an escape, though it should result in
death from the fire of the guards; this would be by far
preferable to death by strangulation at the rope's end,
and in the presence of a large concourse of hooting, jeering,
yelling, infuriated rebels. I had just finished the preparation
of the following address, to be delivered from the scaffold if
not forbidden. I gave a copy to M. T. Anderson, who
desired it for publication upon his exchange:</p>

                <p>Hear the words of a man about to die. Last
words are of solemn import. Keep them in remembrance.
Follow the counsels given, if they commend themselves to your judgement.
The Confederate officers have brought you here to witness my fate,
<pb id="aughey222" n="222"/>
that you may thus learn the penalty they deem proper to
be inflicted for inflexible adherence to patriotic principles.
They declare that I am guilty of treason. Who are the
traitors? I affirm that those who would subvert the
integrity of the government founded by our patriotic
ancestors, are the real traitors. Our politicians, I will not
call them statesmen, would first overthrow the best of
governments, and then construct from its ruins a
government whose corner-stone shall be human slavery.
Will it stand? Forbid it, Almighty God! forbid it, heaven.
The millennium dawn is too near for God to permit to
prosper a government organized to maintain a barbaric
relic of the dark ages, and to preserve intact an institution
subversive of all the rights of man. Human slavery is
made a fundamental feature of the Confederate States of
America—the corner-stone, as Alexander Stephens terms
it. Should we who have no slaves risk life and limb in the
interests of slaveholders, and at their bidding war against
a government that has never trespassed upon our rights?
I, for one, prefer death, and gladly welcome its embrace
rather than to violate the monitions of conscience, the
voice of reason, the decision of judgment, and the
teachings of pious and patriotic ancestors. You believe in
state rights, so do I. State sovereignty and national
supremacy. They are not incompatible. State and nation
each sovereign in its own sphere. One needs not and has
not trenched upon the prerogatives of the other. <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">E
pluribus unum</hi></foreign>, one composed
<pb id="aughey223" n="223"/>
of many. Distinct as the billows, yet one as
the sea. Forced into the army as conscripts, you are
not warring against the government by choice. Accept
deliverance when it comes. See to it that the
republic receives no detriment at your hands. The
time is not far distant when the last assassin's dagger
shall be stricken from his rebellious hand. How earnestly
I have prayed to be permitted to see the downfall of
treason, but God in his wisdom declines to grant
my petition. The government will live and flourish
long after all its foes are dead, buried, and forgotten,
for the memory of the wicked shall rot. It will dispense
blessings to your posterity and mine, till the 
angel of Jehovah, standing with one foot on the sea
and the other on the solid land, shall, with trumpet
voice, proclaim that time shall be no more. It is the
last, the best, and most benign government ever bestowed
upon man by Him who establishes the nations and fixes
their boundaries and ordains their duration. Our government
would be unworthy of respect were it impotent to enforce
obedience to its wise, humane, and beneficent laws, and to
perpetuate its existence, if necessary, by the complete overthrow
of all opposing forces. The government under which we have as a nation
so greatly prospered is the ordinance of God. The wheels of the chariot
which bears it onward will ever revolve. He who stands in the way of
its progress will be crushed as sure as fate.</p>
                <p>Although in durance vile, and in rebellious ranks
<pb id="aughey224" n="224"/>
perforce, your conscience, your judgment, the teachings
of true wisdom, the word of God that enjoins obedience
to lawful authority, the patriotic utterances of
Washington and his compatriots, should be the chart to
direct you in the path of duty in every emergency. Firmly
resolve that the republic, through you, shall receive no
detriment. The government has done you no harm.
Reciprocate with grateful hearts the benefits received
from its benignant laws and beneficent institutions.
When treason dies an ignominious death, be present to
bury its gory corpse beyond the possibility of a
resurrection. I see before me many who were with us on
the high hills and in the deep glens devising plans to
resist the detested conscription. Many of your comrades
are in the ranks of the patriotic army aiding in crushing
the hydra serpent head of treason and rebellion. See to
it that they suffer no harm at your hands. May their lives
be precious in your sight.</p>
                <p>“Oh, Liberty, how many crimes are committed in thy
name,” exclaimed one well known to fame, but we are
murdered by the craven hordes of treason to promote
the fancied interests of chattel slavery, of human
bondage.</p>
                <p>I die, but the sacred cause I humbly represent will not
perish with me on this scaffold. The roots of the tree of
liberty, moistened by the blood of the noble phalanx of
hero-martyrs who have perished here in Tupelo and on
other fields, made classic and sacred by the outpouring
of the precious blood of true
<pb id="aughey225" n="225"/>
Southern patriots, will strike deep and spread wide,
and will send up through every pore the vital fluid
which shall keep forever fresh and green the leaves of
that sacred tree planted by our fathers in the
primeval forest, under whose wide-spreading branches
they and their children, and, we trust, their remotest
posterity, will find safety and freedom and perennial
happiness.</p>
                <p>These, our murderers, would dig up the tree of
liberty and plant in its stead the deadly upas tree of
human bondage. Its roots would reach down and take
hold upon perdition. The inalienable rights of man would
perish beneath its blighting shade.</p>
                <p>Shall we tamely and basely surrender our God-given
heritage of freedom to save our lives imperiled
by treason's minions? Shall we basely betray a
cause dearer to us than life, for the sake of eking out
a miserable, cowardly existence, purchased at the
cost of our manhood and of every virtuous and holy
principle? Shall we sell our birthright for a mess
of pottage, and thus ignobly receive, as a boon graciously
accorded by these fiends incarnate who are thirsting
for our blood, a few years' longer lease of life, till nature
calls us to pay the inevitable debt, and we slink into dishonorable
graves?</p>
                <p>No. A thousand times, no. My free soul, not trammeled by the fetters
that blind and torture my body, gladly, joyfully embraces death, exultingly
leaping into its outstretched arms in preference to the acceptance
of life on terms so vile, so ignominious,
<pb id="aughey226" n="226"/>
that were I to do so, high heaven with ire would
spurn my wretched soul, when seeking admission into
Paradise, from all association with the spirits of the pure
and good, and consign it to the doom of those who
rebelled in heaven and on earth against the God who
ordained the powers that be, to whom, when ruling by
divine appointment, all are commanded to be subject.</p>
                <p>The glorious cause, in the interests of which I lay
down my life, will ultimately triumph. Truth crushed to
earth will rise again. Entertain no doubts on this subject.
Rebellion will be utterly subverted as sure as the God of
justice reigns, who will ever prosper the cause approved
in heaven.</p>

        <p>The prisoners who were shot suffered death in the
following manner: A hole was dug, I can scarcely dignify
it by the name of grave. The victim was ordered to sit
with his legs dangling in it. The file of soldiers took
position in front of their victims, when three balls were
fired into the brain and three into the heart, and the body
falling into this rude excavation was immediately covered
with earth. At first coffins were used, but of late these
had been dispensed with, owing to the expense, and the
increasing number of executions. In some cases the
soldiers purposely missed their aim. It was an odious
duty which they endeavored to shun, and only
performed it upon compulsion. If the corpse was to be
delivered to friends they invariably tried to aim so
<figure id="ill15" entity="aughey229"><p>AS I WAS RAPIDLY TRAVELING ALONG A NARROW PATH I SUDDENLY MET A NEGRO. Page 240</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey229" n="229"/>
as to wound without taking life, and many of the
condemned have, by feigning death, escaped in this
way. Gen. Bragg's name was a synonym for cruelty. He
shot many of his own soldiers for trivial offenses, and
upon the poor Unionists he had no mercy. One of his
officers said to me, “So many men are put to death by
Bragg, and executions have become so common that
now when they occur they scarcely excite remark.” He
was a martinet who never failed to punish the most
trivial offenses with great severity.</p>
        <p>I had not long meditated upon this subject when I
arose, resolved upon immediate death or liberty. Of two
evils I chose the less. My intentions were communicated
to several prisoners, who promised me all the aid in their
power. My fetters were examined, and it was the opinion
of Amos Deane and Amzi Meek that with proper
instruments my bonds could be divested of the iron rods
which secured the chain rings. A long-handled iron
spoon, my knife, which had a file blade, and a file which
one of the prisoners had procured from a Unionist
visitor, were secured, and two were detached at a time to
work upon my manacles. We went to a corner of the
prison, and a sufficient number of prisoners stood in
front of us to prevent the guards from observing the
proceedings. We changed our location frequently to
avoid suspicion, and when officers entered, labor was
suspended till their exit. Several prisoners were shot to-day,
and six Unionists were incarcerated. A reign of
terror had been inaugurated only equaled
<pb id="aughey230" n="230"/>
in its appalling enormity by the memorable French
revolution.</p>
        <p>Spies and informers in the pay of the rebel government
prowl through the country, using every artifice and
stratagem to lead Unionists to criminate themselves.
After this they are dragged to prison and to death. The
cavalry dash through the country making daily raids,
burning cotton, carrying off or wantonly destroying the
property of loyal citizens, and committing depredations
of every kind.</p>
        <p>Several prisoners resolved to attempt to escape with
me. Our plan was to bring in from the enclosure in the rear
of the prison the ax with which we cut and split wood for
cooking, and if possible to raise a plank in the floor by
cutting away the wood and drawing the spikes, a
sufficient number to stand around those who did the
work to prevent observation, and to make a hilarious
noise so as to drown the sound that would be made.
Then in the night we would get under the prison and
make our way out on the north side through the guards
who were off duty. At this time there were three guards in
front of each door, and two on the south side of the
building. On the north side of the prison there were no
guards on duty, it not being thought necessary if the
other sides were vigilantly guarded. There were, however,
several hundred guards who, when off duty, slept on this
side of the prison.</p>
        <p>When relieved they came there to sleep, and those
whose turn it was went on duty. They were constantly
<pb id="aughey231" n="231"/>
coming and going, and during the whole night
they kept up an incessant noise. My friends labored
unremittingly during the day to remove the irons that
secured the chain ring. Those who stood around us
to prevent the observation of the guards standing in
front of the doors told stale jokes and laughed at them
immoderately, so as to drown the noise of the filing. The
sun was now setting, but the ax had not
yet been brought into the prison. Jimmie Tevis had
hidden it under his blouse and tried to pass the
guards with it, but they detected him by the protruding
helve, and made him return it. Now the extra guards
had gone on duty. There were three in front of each door.
The doors had been removed. The apertures we called
doors. A guard was seated on each threshold, and one
inside the building promenaded the floor backward and
forward throughout its entire length all night. During the
day no guards
were on the thresholds, nor in the building.</p>
        <p>While deliberating upon the best plan to pursue,
since we had failed in securing the ax, Gen. Jordan
and Col. Clare entered. I was standing in the middle of the floor,
midway between the doors, eating some rice
which had been surreptitiously conveyed to me.
A note accompanied the mess, deftly enclosed.
It read: “From your sincere and sympathetic friend,
Mrs. Lydia Runyan.” Gen. Jordan came directly to the
place where I stood, and holding a lantern in front of my face,
said, “You are here yet, are you?”
I gave an affirmative nod. “Well,” said he, to Col.
<pb id="aughey232" n="232"/>
Clare, “I must examine this fellow's irons to see what is
their condition.” Suiting the action to the word, he put
his hands down, and ascertaining that they had been
tampered with, he endeavored ineffectually to pull off the
bands. He did not notice that I could slip the chain rings
off. “These irons,” said he, “are very insecure. Who
helped you to put them in this condition?” I made no
reply. After waiting till he was assured that I intended
none, he turned to Col. Clare and said: “Colonel, have
these irons welded, put handcuffs upon him, and chain
him to that bolt in the floor. The gallows shall not be
cheated of their due.”</p>
        <p>Col. Clare said, “Must I do it to-night?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, to-night. Do it at once.”</p>
        <p>“But,” replied the colonel, “it is nearly nine o'clock,
and I can't find a blacksmith to weld the irons on his
ankles. The forges are out of blast at this hour.”</p>
        <p>“Well, wait till morning, but do it bright and early.”</p>
        <p>“All right,” replied Col. Clare, “I'll have it done by
sunrise or before.”</p>
        <p>After these officers had taken their departure, the
prisoners crowded around me and affirmed that they
believed that there was a spy in the house in the guise of
a prisoner. With entire unanimity they held the opinion
that Aleck Stephens was the man. He was a red-haired,
low-browed, grim-visaged, freckle-faced, hard-featured,
villainous specimen of
<pb id="aughey233" n="233"/>
the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">genus homo</hi></foreign>, who sat reticent in a corner, peering
from under his bushy eyebrows, and rejecting all
familiarity or kind offices tendered by his fellow-prisoners.
All realized that I must escape that night or
it would be too late. When chained to a bolt in the
floor, with securely welded anklets and wearing hand-cuffs, I
would be in an utterly helpless condition.
There were eleven guards on duty: three in front of each door,
one seated upon each threshold, and one promenading
the house, which was
lighted during the whole night. There was also a special
police force
on duty, as some Federal prisoners who were in prison till
some formalities took place would be sent in the
morning to Columbus, Miss., and it was feared that
they might attempt to escape ere they were sent farther
south. I was seated with some Federal prisoners,
sending messages to my friends. I told them that I would
slip off my chain, run by the guards, and that it would
draw their fire and be shot; that perhaps my mangled
corpse would be brought into the prison in a few minutes.
I asked them to be sure to inform my friends of the manner
of my death. With this request they promised faithfully to
comply. I said, “Farewell, perhaps forever,” and arose to make
the hazardous attempt.</p>
        <p>At this moment a young man whom we nicknamed “Mississippi” ran
up to me and said, “Parson, I think I have found a way by which you
may escape.” His true name, I think, was Leonard Humphrey.</p>
        <pb id="aughey234" n="234"/>
        <p>Said I, “What is it?”</p>
        <p>He replied, “I was out in the front enclosure, and
I saw a hole by the step under the jail, and I think
you could get under.”</p>
        <p>“Why,” I replied, “that would be impossible.
The three guards standing in front would see me;
the guard seated in the doorway would see me;
in their presence it would be impossible to get under
the building without discovery.”</p>
        <p>“I thought of that, and while you was preaching I was
fixing up a plan, and by golly, I think we can
get you off.” We were permitted to go into the front
enclosure, three at a time, at pleasure, during the day,
and on moonlight nights till ten o'clock.
He continued, “I must have help.” He soon secured
the requisite number, who, at the risk of immediate
death, upon discovery, agreed to run the risk for my sake.
May the Lord reward them.</p>
        <p>He then detailed his plan. When the guard promenading the house approached
we talked about the price of cotton or some indifferent topic.
When he went from us we resumed the business in hand. We all promised
implicit obedience. Just at 9:45 four of us went out. I went out clanking my chains, to lull suspicion, and they did not order me back, as
they had done so often before. The rule required that but three be permitted
to be in the enclosure at one time, but they providentially did
not enforce the rule this time. My three fellow-prisoners stood
between me and the guards, and entered into a fierce discussion
<pb id="aughey235" n="235"/>
with them in regard to the comparative merit of
Mississippi and Tennessee troops. The enclosures, in
front and rear, were formed by stakes surmounted by
poles. Their form was a parallelogram, whose dimensions
were about ten by sixteen feet. The guards became much
excited, and the discussion was becoming loud and
acrimonious. Howell Trogden, a prisoner, sat inside and
held the guard in conversation, who was seated on the
threshold. I sat by the aperture under the building,
removed my chain, put my legs under the building, and
leaned my head upon my elbow, my elbow upon the step,
upon which rested the guard's feet, who was seated upon
the threshold of the prison door. My fellow-prisoners, in a
wordy war with the guards, were
diverting their attention, with every appearance of
success. I reflected that a few moments would decide
my fate. If detected in this forlorn hope, this last attempt
with any prospect of success, I must end my life
ignominiously upon the scaffold. In the early morning my
anklets would be securely welded; I would be handcuffed
and chained to a bolt in the floor of our gloomy dungeon.
Then all hope must end, and soon my corpse would be
borne into the presence of her whose tears were flowing,
and who refused to be comforted, because of my ominous
absence.</p>
        <p>'Tis ten o'clock; I hear the order for the relief guard.
They come; I see their bayonets glittering in the bright
moonlight. The set time, the appointed
<pb id="aughey236" n="236"/>
moment, pregnant with my fate, had arrived. I offered an
ejaculatory prayer to Him who sits upon the throne of
heaven for protection at this critical moment. The guards
stood within ten feet of me. Now they look steadily at me.
I return their gaze. The relief guard has confronted them.
They turn to receive it. At that moment I moved backward
under the building and disappeared from view. The new
guard enter upon their duty. The old guard, without a
backward glance, march away. The prisoners are ordered
into the dungeon. The guards see but three, and know
that that is the highest number permitted by regulation
order within the enclosure. They did not suspect that four
had been suffered to be out, in violation of orders. I was
under the prison, but there were vigilant guards on every
side. We were in the midst of the great rebel army. The din
of a multitude sounded in my ears. It seemed almost
impossible even now to escape detection. Burdette
Danner had thrown me his canteen, but it struck against
the prison wall. It glittered in the bright moonlight; I was
famishing from thirst, but I feared to seize it, though I
knew that it was full of that precious liquid whose price
was now estimated far above rubies. I did not wish to take
any unnecessary risk. The hand protruding from under the
prison would probably be observed by the guards and
excite their suspicion. I could hear their lowest tones. After
awhile one of them said, “Gilmore, I always do forget the
countersign.” The other replied,
<pb id="aughey237" n="237"/>
“It is ‘Braxton’ for to-night.” Though uttered in
an undertone, I caught it. “Well,” replied his
comrade, I thought it was  ‘Braxton,’ or ‘Bragg,’
or something like that. I won't forgit it agin.”</p>
        <p>I crawled to the north side of the prison, and found that there were three apertures
which would admit my egress. Upon reaching the first, I found that
the guards were so numerous and so close, that
it would be extremely hazardous to run the risk at
this point. Crawling to the second, I remained till there
was comparative quiet. But at the instant I was about
to creep out, a soldier, who was lying with his face toward me,
sat up and commenced coughing, and continued to cough at
intervals for more than an hour. Finding it unadvisable to run the risk of
detection at this point, I made my way with considerable
difficulty to the third and last aperture, near the rear of the prison, and not
far distant from the guards in the rear enclosure. Here exhausted
nature could hold out no longer, and I slept. How
long I know not. The vermin and the cold awoke me. Presently
I heard one soldier say to another. “It is 3 o'clock in the morning and
we will have to go on duty.” I felt confident that then was my time or never.
Morning would soon appear, and my escape would be discovered and my
re-arrest follow. Commending myself into the hands of God, and
pleading that he would mercifully keep me from detection, and grant me
safe conduct through this mighty host of watchful foes, I arose from under
<pb id="aughey238" n="238"/>
the building, and in passing two sleeping soldiers lying
within four feet of the prison wall, I struck my foot
against the head of one of them. I had not walked for so
long a time without a chain, which necessarily compelled
me to make such short steps, that I reeled as if under the
influence of intoxicants, when freed from it. This made
me swerve from my intended course and strike with my
foot the head of the somnolent guard. He awoke, and
looking at me in the bright moonlight, said, “D—n you,
don't do that again.” He turned over and resumed his
slumbers. He doubtless mistook me for one of his
comrades, who, in his awkwardness, had made the
unintentional assault.</p>
        <p>In prison I had purchased a shirt, paying eleven
dollars in gold for it, which resembled that worn by many
rebel soldiers. This doubtless contributed to my escape,
by warding off suspicion, which would have been
aroused at once, if I had appeared in their midst in
citizen's dress. I was also wearing McHatton's dark-colored
pants. After proceeding a few steps I sat down by a stump, around which
a number of
guards were collected, some standing, some sitting, and
some reclining. To appear at ease I took my knife from
my pocket and commenced to whittle the stump and to
whistle. This apparent unconcern may have deceived
them, and contributed to ward off or allay suspicion. It
was an almost unparalleled wonder that some of them
did not observe me emerge from underneath the prison,
as the moon was shining
<pb id="aughey239" n="239"/>
brightly and they were very near the prison wall in
great numbers. Doubtless God had held their eyes
or obscured their vision. I soon arose, returned my
knife to my pocket, and wound my way cautiously
among the various groups, endeavoring to reach the
corn field to which I had made my first escape. I
endeavored to see every vidette before he perceived me.
I had some narrow risks in passing them. As I
came near the corn field, a vidette, who had been
concealed behind a tree, appeared, evidently with the
intention of halting me if I approached nearer. I
halted without the order. If he had given the command
to halt, I should have given the countersign, Braxton, which
I had learned while under the prison, and then have made some excuse for
wandering away from my comrades. To avoid suspicion I resorted to
a ruse which I cannot narrate. It proved successful. I, after a time, started
toward the prison, till seeing videttes in front, I fell upon the ground and deflected
from my course toward the prison. After passing through many
perils and hair-breadth escapes, as the least blunder would have proved
fatal, I reached dense woods and bore south-west. Kneeling down under
a larch tree, I returned God thanks for thus far crowning my efforts with
success, and most earnestly besought Him to continue His kind
protecting care, to choose my path before me, and make it safe, that
I might rejoin my family and friends in safety. I had asked Him in prison
to lengthen my life by fifteen years, as he did Hezekiah's.</p>
        <pb id="aughey240" n="240"/>
        <p>I now pursued my journey rapidly in a south westerly
direction, choosing that which led directly from my
home for two reasons. The cavalry, with the blood-hounds,
would not probably be sent in that direction.
After listening attentively while in prison to the reveille
and tattoo, and the din from the surrounding camps, I
thought the coast was clearest in that direction, and that
I could, by taking that route, with the greater ease evade
the rebel pickets. I hastened onward with all possible
speed, avoiding roads, till the sun arose. As I was
rapidly traveling along a narrow path, I suddenly met a
negro. He was scared. So was I. I, in a peremptory tone,
addressed him in quick succession, the following
questions:</p>
        <p>“Where are you going? Where have you been? To
whom do you belong? Have you a pass?”</p>
        <p>“I belong,” said the boy, trembling, “to Col.
Kohlheim, I have been to wife's house, and am gwine
back to Massa's.”</p>
        <p>He handed me his pass which read: “The bearer,
Tabor, has permission to go to Major Smith's to visit his
wife and return. Good till to-morrow evening, the—inst.”</p>
        <p>“Well, sir,” said he, as I handed him his pass, “you
see it am all right wid me.”</p>
        <p>Concluding that it was not <hi rend="italics">all right</hi> “wid ” myself I
hurried on. Tabor called to me ere I had gone twenty
yards. I halted. He came up and asked me if “dis bill
(presenting one on a Tennessee bank) was
<pb id="aughey241" n="241"/>
good.” “Good as the bank,” said I, and hurried
speedily leaving the path and turning into
a dense woods. Traveling on till about 12  <sic corr="A. M.">M.</sic>,
judging from the vertical rays of the sun, I came to
an open champaign country, through which I
could not travel with safety, in daylight.
I sought a place in which to hide, and discovering a ditch which bisected
a corn-field, I concealed myself in that. Many passed near me during the day.
I was very hungry. Sullivan and Soper, Federal prisoners had each given
me, before leaving prison, a small piece of bread, which they had in
their haversacks when captured. I found both pieces were saturated with
tobacco.
The prisoner with whom I had exchanged pants used tobacco, and had
carried some in both pockets. As tobacco is very offensive to me, its presence
upon my bread caused me to lose it. I reflected on the best course to pursue
in order to secure the greatest degree of safety in my flight. I though
at one time it would be best to go west until I reached the Mississippi
river, then hail a gun-boat and thus be saved, but I reflected that I was
a <hi rend="italics">long, long</hi> distance from that river—that there was the great
Mississippi bottom to pass through, which was full of
lagoons, lakes, bayous, and swamps, and
that it was infested with bears, rattlesnakes, vipers, bull-snakes,
centipedes, tarantulas, and venomous reptiles
and wild beasts of many kinds. I would also have to swim
across the Yazoo and Tallahatchie rivers, which I feared
I could not do, enfeebled as I would
<pb id="aughey242" n="242"/>
be when I reached those rivers, and encumbered as I was
with the heavy iron bands. The day ended and the night
came. The stars, those beautiful nocturnal luminaries,
came out in silent glory, one by one. Fixing my eye upon
the polar star, the underground railroad traveler's guide, I
set out bearing a little to the west of north. I soon reached
the thick woods and found it very difficult to make rapid
progress, in consequence of the dense undergrowth and
obscure light. The bushes would strike me in the eyes,
and often the top of a fallen tree would compel me to make
quite a circuit. Soon, however, the moon appeared in her
brightness—the old silver moon. But her light I found to be
by far less brilliant than that of the sun, and her rays were
much obscured by the dense foliage overhead, hence my
progress was necessarily slow, labored, and toilsome.
During the day I had slept but little, in consequence of the
proximity of those who might be bitter foes, and also
because of the unpleasant position I occupied, as the
ditch in which I had concealed myself was muddy and
proved a very uncomfortable bed. I therefore became
weary, my limbs stiff from travel and from the pressure of
the heavy iron bands. Sleep overpowered me, and I lay
down in the leaves and slept till the cold awoke me. I slept
an hour and a half, as I judged from the moon's descent.
The nights are invariably cool in Mississippi, however
sultry may have been the weather during the day. Arising
from my uneasy slumber I pressed on. My thirst, which
had for
<pb id="aughey243" n="243"/>
some time been increasing, now became absolutely
unendurable. I knew not where to get water, not
daring to go near a well for fear of arrest. I must obtain
water or perish. At length I heard some sucking pigs and
their dam at a short distance from me in the woods.
There seemed to be no alternative. I must either perish
or obtain some fluid to slake my raging thirst, so I
resolved to catch one of the little pigs, cut its throat, and drink
the blood. I searched for my knife, but ascertained that I
had lost it. I was therefore reluctantly compelled to abandon
my designs upon the suckling's life. As I went forward,
the sow and her brood started up alarmed, and in their
fright plunged into water. I followed fast and found a
mud-hole—a perfect lob-lolly. The water was tepid, foul,
and mingled with the spawn of frogs. Removing the
green scum, I drank deep of the stagnant pool. My thirst
was only partially allayed by this foul draught, and so
returned. As day dawned, I found some sassafras leaves,
which I chewed to allay the pangs of hunger,
but they formed a paste which I could not swallow.
I remembered that this day was the holy Sabbath,
but it brought neither rest to my weary frame, nor
composure to my agitated and excited mind.</p>
        <p>The course decided upon as safest and best was
to go far to the south and west, and there wait till
the cavalry had returned from their search for me, then by a
very circuitous route to endeavor to reach the
Memphis and Charlestown railroad, find some Federal
<pb id="aughey244" n="244"/>
outpost on that road, and thus be saved. About ten
o'clock I came to an open country, and sought a place
to conceal myself. I found a dense copse on a hillside,
and hid within its friendly depths. I had about departed
to the realm of dreams when I heard the voice of song. A
human voice quickly aroused me. I peered out from my
lair, and on an opposite hill I saw a gigantic Ethiopian
making his way laboriously. He had a plank in his hands,
there was one underneath him upon which he was
walking. When he reached the end of it, he laid down the
plank he bore in his hands, stepped upon it, and
reaching back he lifted the other plank, and thus he
wended his way. He accompanied his task by singing a
song heard often upon every southern plantation:</p>
        <lg id="song">

        </lg>
        <p>As he laid down his plank and stepped upon it, it slid
from under his feet and he fell prone upon the ground.
He jumped up and sang:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“If Charley slip upon his track</l>
          <l>Der's danger de hounds will bring him back,</l>

          <l>Run, nigger, run, hit's almos' day.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Thus he improvised his song as he wended his
weary way. He was trying to evade the hounds by
thus leaving no scent for them to follow. As he passed
me he sang:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“De pore white trash dey lives an' grows,</l>
          <l>Dey noze far less dan the nigger noze.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Then he sang the chorus with a will:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“My name's Sam, I don't care a d—n,</l>
          <l>I'd radder be a nigger, dan a pore white man.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>He look around in alarm, and muttered, “Old Charley
alwa's dun furgit hizsef when he sings dat song.” He
then passed onward in silence, carrying his planks
with him.</p>
        <p>A singular noise attracting attention, as I gazed up
the hill I saw a man descend from a tree and look
around warily. As he passed near me, I called out, in a
low tone, <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">Taisez vous</hi></foreign>.</p>
        <p>Quickly glancing in my direction, he replied,
<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">“Oui, oui.”</hi></foreign></p>
        <pb id="aughey246" n="246"/>
        <p>I bade him come to me. He did so. He had been in
hiding for a month, and becoming hungry he left his
lofty perch to procure the food that would be left at the
designated spot by his wife or eldest daughter. He told
me to await his return and he would share his food with
me, and he assured me of all possible aid. As he emerged
from the jungle, a man with fierce aspect confronted him.
He told him to throw up his hands. I had accompanied
him and was about to retreat with all possible speed, but
the thought of abandoning my friend restrained me. I
determined to stand by him and abide the result. My
friend refused to throw up his hands. He said he
preferred to die there and then in preference to
submitting to be bound. This man, who I learned was
known as Col. Ned Barry, ordered us to march in front of
him, or if we hesitated he would let its have the contents
of his revolvers. We obeyed, hoping to escape by
darting into the woods at some suitable point, or by
some providential deliverance.</p>
        <p>As we neared a large tree, Col. Barry said: “Israel
Nelson, I've been prowlin' around arter you for more'n
three weeks. Now, sir, you got ter go two miles from
here, an' Gen. Yerger will be d-d glad ter see yer.” He
turned around to make this little speech. As he closed,
and was about to advance, a dusky form suddenly sprang
from behind the tree,
a bludgeon descended swiftly upon the Colonel's skull,
and our would-be captor lay unconscious at our feet.
We found cords in his pockets and securely
<pb id="aughey247" n="247"/>
bound our fallen foe. Soon he returned to
consciousness, and begged piteously for his life. We
took possession of his weapons. A little boy of ten years
of age appeared on the scene. He came to find his father.
He told him that ma wanted him to come to the house at
once, there was strangers there to see him. What should
we do to secure our own safety. Nelson proposed
shooting both father and son. We took them both to the
copse, and with the aid of this Ethiopian, who had
appeared at an opportune moment, gagged both father
and son, and bound them to the same tree. I urged
Nelson to escape with me, and to leave these persons
bound. He replied that he must see his wife, and that he
would go to the trysting place, and she would probably
be there, or in case she was not there, he would find a
note secreted near by. The note was there, but contained
no special information. Nothing but words of comfort
and affectionate sympathy.</p>
        <p>We heard hounds, and feared to return to our
prisoners for a long time. The African, Charley, had left
us, and as night had dropped down upon the scene we
cautiously returned to the copse.</p>
        <p>I hope never again to witness such a ghastly sight.
The mangled remains of father and son were still
adhering to the tree. Fierce hounds had torn them to
pieces. I could no longer stay to gaze upon this sad
tragedy. Nelson told me that he had resolved to shoot
them both, as his safety and mine would be
compromised by sparing their lives. I am glad that the
<pb id="aughey248" n="248"/>
terrible necessity was obviated. Nelson refused to
abandon his family, and I could no longer delay, so
hastened onward.</p>
        <p>The dismal night passed away. I found a place to hide—a
ditch as usual. I slept, and saw in my dreams tables
groaning under the weight of the most delicious viands,
and brooks of crystal waters babbling and sparkling as
they rushed onward in their meandering course, but
when I attempted to grasp them they served me as
Tantalus of olden time was
served, by vanishing into thin air or receding from my
grasp. While lying here, I was occasionally aroused by
the trampling of horses grazing in the fields, which I
feared might be bringing on my pursuers. Once the
voices of men mingled with the sound of prancing
steeds upon a little bridge some twenty feet distant,
induced me to look out from my hiding place, and lo! two
cavalry men, perhaps hunting for my life, passed along.</p>
        <p>When the sun had reached the zenith, I was again
startled by voices, which approached nearer and still
nearer my place of concealment, till at length the cause
was discovered. Several children, both black and white,
had come from a farm house about a quarter of a mile
distant to gather blackberries along the margin of the
ditch. They soon discovered me and seemed somewhat
startled and alarmed at my appearance. I soon saw them
gazing down upon me in my moist bed, with evident
amazement and alarm. Pallid, haggard, unshaven, and
covered with mud, I
<pb id="aughey249" n="249"/>
must have presented a frightful picture. As soon as the
children passed me, fearing the report they would carry
home, I arose from my lair and hastened onward. After
traveling three or four miles I came to a dense woods
bordering a stream, which had ceased running in
consequence of the unprecedented drought that had for
a long time prevailed throughout this section of
Mississippi. The creek had been a large one, and in the
deep cavities some water still remained. Though warm
and covered with a thick green scum, and mingled with
the spawn of frogs, I drank it from sheer necessity, tepid
and unwholesome as it was. It did not allay my thirst,
but created a nausea which was very unpleasant. After traveling several
hours, I came to a place where was a depression in the
ground. I thought I might possibly find water. Soon the
sight of water gladdened me, but it was stagnant and
covered with a thick, greenish,
yellowish scum. As I approached it I was startled by
seeing the tracks of some one who I thought might have
been a fugitive like myself. By closely observing
the footsteps and the surroundings, I discerned
this to be the place I had left hours ago. I was
traveling in a circle. My bewildered brain had lost
its power to locate accurately the cardinal points.</p>
      </div1>
      <div1 type="chapter">
        <p>About 4 o'clock P.M. I was startled by the baying
of blood-hounds behind me, and apparently upon my
track. Before escaping from jail I had been advised
by my fellow-prisoners to procure some onions, as
these rubbed upon the soles of my boots would
<pb id="aughey250" n="250"/>
measurably destroy the scent. These could only be procured
by visiting a garden, and I feared to approach so near a
house. I had not left any clothing in prison from which
the hounds could obtain the scent so as to recognize my
track, and my starting in a south-western direction was
an additional precaution against blood-hounds. Having
heard them almost every night for years, as they hunted
down the fugitive slave, I could not mistake the fearful
import of their howling. I could devise no plan for
breaking the trail. Daniel Boone, when pursued by
Indians, succeeded in baffling the dogs with which they
pursued him by laying hold of overhanging branches
and swinging himself forward. One slave on Dick's river
in Kentucky, near Danville, Boyle Co., ran along the
brink of a precipice, and dug a recess back from the
narrow path. Crawling into it, he remained concealed till
the hounds reached that point, when he thrust them from
the path. They fell and were dashed to pieces upon the
jagged rocks below. Some slaves, before escaping,
provide themselves with a large supply of cayenne
pepper. When the hounds are heard in pursuit they set
down their heels with considerable force so as to make
as deep an impression as possible, they then sprinkle
their tracks with the cayenne pepper. The hounds, in
rapid pursuit, inhale the pepper. It produces such pain
and irritation that they will not pursue any fugitive for
months, and even then with caution so great that they
are nearly worthless as negro dogs.</p>
        <pb id="aughey251" n="251"/>
        <p>None of these plans were practicable, and I believed
death imminent, either from being torn to pieces by the
hounds or by being shot by the cavalry who were
following hard after them. Climbing a tree, I resolved to
die rather than be taken back to Tupelo to suffer death
on the gallows in the presence of a hooting, howling,
mixed multitude of infuriate demons. I knew that upon
my refusal to come down from the tree a volley from
their carbines would end my life. The tree into which I
had climbed was a large black oak; a juniper tree stood
on a knoll between the oak and the route by which my
pursuers would approach. The oak would afford perfect
concealment from observation
till my pursuers stood underneath the tree, then,
by peering into its umbrageous recesses on all sides, my
presence would be discovered. Oh! how I wished for
my navy repeater, that I might sell my
life as dearly as possible—that ere I was slain I might
make some secessionist bite the dust. I thought of the
couplet in the old song:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>The hounds are baying on my track,</l>
          <l>Christian, will you send me back?</l>
        </lg>
        <p>A feeling of deep sympathy arose in my heart for the
poor slave who, in his endeavor to escape from the iron
furnace of southern slavery, encountered the blood-hounds,
and was torn to pieces by them. A fellow
feeling makes us wondrous kind. A touch of sympathy
makes all the world akin. Now I hear the deep-mouthed
baying of the hounds. The pack is large, and they realize
that the object of their
<pb id="aughey252" n="252"/>
search is near. I see them now on the crest of the hill
but a mile distant. Down the hill they plunge. The
cavalry follow hard after them. Men and dogs seem
intent upon their fell purpose. Soon they will seize their
prey, their hapless victim is almost within
their grasp. These fierce dragoons are mentally
gloating over the reward which they will receive for their
bloody work. Success will be achieved ere ten minutes
elapse. All hasten forward to be in at the death. Must I
die as the fool dieth? Like Jezebel,
my blood lapped by dogs, and my body devoured by
these fierce blood-hounds and those wild swine feeding near?
My friends will never learn how I perished, and 'tis better they
should not know the horrible circumstances attending my death.
Oh! that I could see my dear wife and darling Kate, to
kiss them a final farewell ere the tragic scene closes
forever all my hopes of, and aspirations for, a long
and happy life in their society. Now the hounds
appear on the further brink of a ravine, a few hundred
yards distant, a ravine I had crossed a short
time before. Their loud baying, their quick, sharp
yelps rang with frightful clearness on the summer
air. All hope of escape died within my bosom.
There seemed to be a pack of forty fierce hounds as
they leaped down the steep declivity. I waited in
terrible suspense their advent on the hither bank.
The cavalry, with rattling sabers and glittering carbines,
appeared on the farther bank, and halting on
the brink found the declivity too steep to attempt
<pb id="aughey253" n="253"/>
the descent on horseback. A number dismounted and
speedily disappeared within the ravine. Two gray foxes,
driven from their covert by the noise of pursuit, ran by the
tree in which I was concealed, and plunged into a cacti
copse. A half-dozen men appeared upon the crest nearest
me. The hounds were yet howling in the glen. They were
bearing eastward, up the ravine, and soon the dismounted
dragoons recrossed, and remounting began to follow in
that direction. On, on they went, with precipitate speed.
The howling of the hounds and the yelling and horrid
noise indicated that they were receding in the distance.
Fainter and fainter the breezes bore to my ears the echoes
of pursuit, till at length they were lost in the distance, and
I was mercifully saved from a violent and horrid death.
How had Divine Providence interposed in my behalf! It
long remained a mystery. A negro fugitive, escaping from
slavery, had crossed my path—had gone up the ravine.
The hounds will always leave the track of a white man for
that of a negro. On the next afternoon they caught the
poor slave, who had concealed himself in a tree, and
returned him to bondage. His master lived in Natchez,
Adams Co., and this boy, Jingo Dick, had absconded
three months before his capture.</p>
        <p>I climbed down from the oak, and sat under the juniper
tree. I sat under it, a long time, returning thanks to God
for my deliverance from a horrible death, yet depressed
with the apparently hopeless prospect of ever evading
my pursuers and reaching a place of ultimate safety.</p>
        <pb id="aughey254" n="254"/>
        <p>Soon a mocking bird from a neighboring tree began to
sing. He seemed to mock me in my agony. When he
ceased, a bird perched in the highest branches of the
same tree poured from its little throat a song of hope—the
sweetest song I ever heard, and then another and
another joined in glad refrain, till the whole grove grew
vocal with their notes of joy. My soul, responsive to
these glad strains, grew hopeful, and I, leaving more than
half my weary burden of care, trudged on, homeward
bound. After awhile I became bewildered, but soon
peeping from a flowery dell I saw the yellow compass
flower. Its polary property I knew. And true as the
magnetic needle it pointed the way to the desired haven.
Coming to a hazel dell I saw the patriotic pimpernel. Its
flowers of red, white, and blue were closed, and I knew
that a storm was impending. Soon the sky became
overcast. Dark, threatening, murky clouds o'erspread the
sky and shut out the sun. Oh! that the rain might fall in
torrents. I could then assuage my burning, raging thirst.
On a distant hill I saw it falling, but only a few drops
reached me, and my consuming thirst remained
unquenched. I had the same sensations as Burton, one
of the explorers of the Dark Continent. He says, “For
twenty hours we did not taste water, the sun parched our
brains and the mirage mocked us at every turn.” As I
jogged along, with eyes shut against the fiery air, every
image that came to my mind was of water; water in the
cool well, water bubbling from the rock, water
<pb id="aughey255" n="255"/>
rippling in shady streams, water in clear lakes, inviting
me to plunge in and bathe. Now a cloud seemed
to shower upon me drops more precious than pearls,
then an unseen hand seemed to offer me a cup,
which I would have given all I was worth to receive. But
what a dreary, dreadful contrast. I opened my eyes to a
heat-reeking plain and a sky of that deep blue so lovely
to painter and poet, so full of death to us
whose only desire was rain and tempest. I tried to pray
but I could not. I tried to think, but I had only
one idea—water, water, water. A cup of cold water.
Oh! how precious. No comparison is adequate to
express its worth. But I will trust Him who is able
to supply all my needs.</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“When first before his mercy seat</l>
          <l>I did to him my way commit,</l>
          <l>He gave me warrant from that hour</l>
          <l>To trust his mercy, love, and power.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>“Though He slay me, yet will I trust in Him.”</p>
        <p>Becoming confused again in regard to the cardinal
points, I fortunately came to a cemetery. In all
Christian lands the headstones at the graves are to
the west. I took my bearings and traveled on in a
north-easterly direction. The Savior said, in Matt.
xxiv. 27, “As the lightning cometh out of the east,
and shineth even unto the west, so shall also the
coming of the Son of Man be.” The early Christians supposed
that this verse taught that Christ, at the second advent would
appear in the east. Hence the burial of the dead so that
in rising on the resurrection
<pb id="aughey256" n="256"/>
morn they would face the east. While steadily
pursuing my weary way the faint howling of a distant
pack of hounds coming from the direction in which I was
traveling caused me to halt in consternation. I was
ascending a lofty hill, and was nearing the summit, when
these ominous sounds were heard. It was evident they
were not in search of me, for they were coming south,
but they might accomplish my destruction as certainly as
if they had been commissioned to effect this object. I
hastened to the summit of the hill. A lofty umbrageous
oak, a venerable forest king, with lateral branches near
the ground, stood on the highest eminence. As the
increasingly distinct baying of the hounds indicated
their rapid approach, I resolved to climb this tree. With
less difficulty than I had anticipated I succeeded in doing
so. Higher and higher I ascended, till I reached the lofty
coronal of leaves that decked this mighty monarch of the
woods. A grand panorama was spread out before me.
Two miles distant, in the east, the tents of a great
encampment were spread out in full view. The sentries
were at their posts; the roads on all sides were picketed;
a general review was in progress, and the bustle and
excitement of camp life was evident in all its
appointments. A company of cavalry with blood-hounds
were just coming in from the north. They had twenty-five
or thirty men in charge, in citizens' dress, evidently
Unionists. They were driving these men before them on
the double quick. Presently I saw one fall prone upon
the
<pb id="aughey257" n="257"/>
earth. Three or four cavalry men dismounted, and
pricking him with their bayonets, compelled him to
rise. He staggered on a short distance and fell again.
A second time they used their bayonets, when one
of the prisoners left his companions, and running
to the fallen man, thrust aside the bayonets. The guards
on foot presented their carbines. A puff of smoke
indicated that they had discharged them. This man, who
seemed desirous of aiding his fellow-prisoner, fell upon
the prostrate form of the fallen man,
whom they now transfixed with their bayonets. After
a few moments spent in inspecting their victims, they
remounted their horses and rejoined their company.
But what startled me most was the sight of a large
company of hunters, composed of ladies and gentlemen,
who, spread over a considerable space, in high
glee and with loud and boisterous halloos were pursuing
a bear. They were coming rapidly toward me
from a point due north. That they would pass near
me was evident. The bear was but a half mile in
advance of the hounds, and they were gaining rapidly
upon him. I perceived that the bear's strength was
waning. He seemed to be running in a direct line
toward the tree amid whose friendly foliage I was
concealed. A planter, whose residence was upon a
hill to the west, had heard the hounds, and I saw him
hastily make preparations to join in the chase. Colored
men brought out several saddled horses; a number of
hounds were unleashed and unkenneled, and several
men mounted the horses, and with guns in hand hastened
<pb id="aughey258" n="258"/>
away to join in the chase. I observed that from the
direction they took they would not be
likely to intercept the bear. On, on, they rode, and ere
long joined the hunters in pursuit. The bear, with failing
strength, reached a point about three hundred yards from
my tree, and turning his back against a tree, stood at bay.
The dogs, as fast as they approached, were driven back,
howling in agony. As the bear was on the opposite side
of the tree, I could not see the battle. It became fierce, and
the mingled growling of the bear and the howls and yells
of pain upon the part of the discomfited dogs made for a
time a perfect pandemonium. The bear seemed on the
point of gaining a victory, but the hunters rode up, called
off the not reluctant hounds, and a volley from their
carbines laid bruin dead at their feet. I could hear their
conversation distinctly. The planter invited the hunters to
come over and spend the night with him. He promised to
send some of his slaves to flay the bear and care for the
meat. The visitors' dogs were taken care of by the planter.
They were leashed in his yard; but his own hounds were
allowed to roam at will all night. The negroes came down
from the house, skinned and dressed the bear, and it
seemed to be attractive labor to them. The hounds came
under the tree and barked furiously. One of the colored
men said be believed there “was coons up dat tree, or
dem dogs wouldn't bark so fierce.” One of them said he
believed he'd “go and tell master dat dere was coons in
dat tree.” Off he started,
<pb id="aughey259" n="259"/>
and soon came back to tell de boys to “kum up an' take
keer of sum dogs dat de bear had almost killed.” About
ten o'clock I came down from the tree and pursued my
journey in the direction of the polar star. I experienced
greater difficulty in descending the tree than in the
ascent. My limbs were weary; the fetters upon my ankles
had become quite galling; My tongue was swollen in my
month and cracking open from thirst. I had not gotten far
from the tree when a hound, which had been lapping the
blood of the bear, sprang toward me with open month. A
well-directed blow from a club, which I took the
precaution to secure, sent him howling away. All the
hounds within hearing howled in concert, and a more
frightful chorus I have never heard. I hastened onward as
rapidly as possible, and there seemed to be no pursuit. I
feared to deviate from my pathway to the right or left, as I
had learned from my lofty point of observation, from my
perch in the pinnacle of the lofty monarch of the forest,
that there was a large camp to the eastward and a much
less formidable one to the westward; on the one hand was
Scylla, on the other Charybdis. Every hour death stared me
in the face. Foes were lurking all around. There was but a
step between me and death. The days of my appointed
time were waning fast. Hunted like a partridge upon the
mountains, by blood-hounds and bloody men, a price
upon my head, escape seemed impossible. I knew that
prayer, fervent prayer, was continually ascending
<pb id="aughey260" n="260"/>
to God in my behalf. Implicitly I believed in omnipotence
of prayer—that no good thing will be denied the prayer of
faith. But I had no promise to plead for longer life. It
might be the will of the all-wise God to call me from earth,
to suffer me to perish, as many patriotic men had done
since the inauguration of rebellion, by rebel cruelty. I
was never for an hour out of the hearing of howling
hounds or yelping dogs. The hound ordinarily used in
the pursuit of fugitive slaves is a cross between a mastiff
and the bull-dog. It is very fierce, and will assault and
tear to pieces the fugitive as soon as caught. A hound
sometimes used is the blood-hound of the Talbot or
southern breed. He has long, pendulous, drooping ears;
he is tall and square-headed; has heavy, drooping lips
and jowl. He has a stern expression. He is broad-chested,
deep-tongued, and much slower than the cross between
the mastiff and bull-dog. His powers of scenting are
extraordinary. Let him smell any article of clothing that
has been worn by the fugitive, and he will at once
recognize his track and follow it, though it should be
more than twenty-four hours old. Often one or two of
these blood-hounds are kept to guide the pack. They are
not so fierce as the other dogs, and any stout negro, by
getting
his back against a tree, so that he may not be
surrounded, could defend himself with a club, and kill his
assailants as fast as they approached. But the ordinary
dog used to hunt the fugitive—the cross between the
mastiff and the bull-dog—is so large, strong,
<figure id="ill18" entity="aughey261"><p>THE DOOR BLEW OPEN AND I STAGGERED IN. Page 267</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey261" n="261"/>
and fierce that the fugitive stands but little chance to
defend himself from the combined attack of a dozen of
them. Were it not for the blood-hounds with them, he
could much more readily break the trail and baffle
pursuit. The blood-hound is in color tawny, with black
muzzles. The former dog has some scenting powers, but
it is as inferior in these to the true blood-hound as it is
superior to him in blood-thirstiness and cruel,
indiscriminate pugnacity. It has no utility except as a man-hunter.
In hunting the fugitive slave men always
accompany the hounds, and are seldom far in the rear.
When the fugitive finds all his skill to baffle pursuit
unavailing, he climbs a tree and awaits the arrival of the
horsemen, who call off the hounds, order the slave to
come down, and they then tie him up and give him one or
two hundred lashes, well laid on, on his bare back. Then
he is ironed and conveyed home, where he receives the
remaining installments of the penalty due to his vain
attempt to secure his inalienable rights—life, liberty, and
the pursuit of happiness. Life, one of the inalienable
rights which God ordains for man, is not servile life.
Servile life is induced by the avarice and cruelty of man.</p>
        <p>I lay down in the woods and fell asleep; visions of
abundance both to eat and drink haunted me, and every
unusual sound would startle me. A fly peculiar to the
South, whose buzz sounded like the voice of a man in his
senility, often awoke me with the fear that my enemies
were near. As soon as Ursa
<pb id="aughey262" n="262"/>
Minor appeared I took up my line of march. The night
was very dark, and I became somewhat bewildered. At
length I reached a cross-roads, and as I was emerging
from the woods I saw two videttes a few yards distant.
As quickly and as noiselessly as possible, I made a
retrograde movement. As I was
retiring I heard one vidette say to his comrade, “Who is
that?” He replied, “It is the corporal of the guard.”
“What does he want?” said the first. “O,” was the reply, “I
suspect he's just slipping around here to see if we are
asleep.”</p>
        <p>After I had reached a safe distance in the bushes, I lay
down and slept till the moon arose. To the surprise of
my bewildered brain it seemed to rise in the west. Taking
my bearings I hastened on, through woods, corn-fields,
and swamps. Coming to a large pasture in which a
number of cows were grazing, I tried to obtain some milk,
but the cows would not let me approach near enough to
effect my purpose. My face was not of the right color,
and my costume belonged to a sex that never milked
them. I traveled till day-break, when I concealed myself
in a canebrake. I had scarcely fallen asleep, when I heard
the sound of the reveille in a camp near by, and,
listening, distinctly heard the soldiers conversing.
Arising, I hastily beat a retreat, and cautiously avoiding
the videttes I traveled several hours before I dared take
any rest. At length I lay down amid the branches of a
fallen tree and slept. Visions of home and friends flitted
before me. Voices sweet
<pb id="aughey263" n="263"/>
and kind greeted me on all sides. The bitter taunts of
cruel officers no longer assailed my ears. The loved ones
at home were present, and the joys of the past were
renewed. But, alas! the falling of a limb dissipated all my
fancied pleasures. The reality returned. I was still a
fugitive escaping for life, and in the midst of a hostile
country. I fancied the woful disappointment of the rebel
officers when they learned that the bird had flown and
that they could no longer wreak their vengeance upon
me, nor have the pleasure of witnessing my execution. I
thanked God and took courage. I was still hopeful and
trusting, often repeating a verse from one of Watts'
beautiful hymns:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>Through many dangers, toils, and snares</l>
          <l>I have already come;</l>
          <l>'Tis grace has brought me safe thus far,</l>
          <l>And grace will bring me home.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>During this night I traveled steadily, crossing
corn-fields, woods, and pastures. I crossed but one
cotton-field. I suspected every bush a secessionist,
though I felt much more secure at night than in daylight. I
avoided roads as much as possible, traveling on none
except to cross them, and this I did walking backward, so
that if the hounds found my track the cavalry would be
deceived when the plain tracks in the road indicated a
false direction. Every possible deception was practiced
by Unionists to avoid detection.</p>
        <p>The rising sun still found me pressing onward.
<pb id="aughey264" n="264"/>
Hunger and thirst were now consuming me. My tongue
was swollen and cracking open from thirst. I thought of
opening a vein in my arm and drinking the blood. When I
had almost despaired of getting water, a presentiment—I
may call it an assurance as if an inspiration front heaven,
took possession of my whole soul that soon I would be
supplied with water. The sky was clear. No clouds
indicated rain. I quietly walked along, as consciously sure
of water as if I were being refreshed by it. I came to a
road and crossed it. A gin house was visible a few
hundred yards distant, and there was a grove near it. I
knew that embowered within its sylvan shade was a
plantation house. After crossing the road I came to a
gorge surrounded by converging hills, from which issued
a copious fountain of crystal water. Near it there was no
trace of human foot, nor hoof of cattle. I seemed to be the
discoverer. On beholding it I wept for joy. I knelt down
and in words of thanksgiving expressed my gratitude to
Almighty God for this great deliverance, this sparkling,
life-giving liquid brewed amid the forest shades by the
hand of Jehovah, merciful and gracious. I then stooped
down and quaffed the living water, the first pure water I
had tasted since my imprisonment. Oh! that men would
praise the Lord for his goodness and feel truly grateful
for his common benefits. Were water to become scarce
men would realize its worth. Blessings brighten as they
take their flight. I remained at this spring four hours,
quaffing its
<pb id="aughey265" n="265"/>
cool, refreshing waters. I removed my clothing and
performed my first ablution since I fell into rebel hands,
yet the irons prevented a thorough ablution. I named this
spring Fons Vitæ. I was rejoiced when I discovered this
spring, but not surprised, for I felt as fully assured of
finding water as if an angel had spoken to me from
heaven indicating its location. It came into my mind with
the force of a revelation. My regret was sincere when I
was compelled to leave this spring and continue my
wearisome journey.</p>
        <p>Three o'clock P.M. arrived. I felt bewildered. I knew not
where I was. I might be near friends, I might be near blood-thirsty
foes. I could scarcely walk. My iron bands had
become very irksome. I felt that I was becoming childish. I
could tell all my bones. I tried to pray, but could only
utter, “God, be merciful to me a sinner.” The sky became
overcast with clouds. I could not distinguish the
cardinal points. I therefore concealed myself and slept. It
was night when I awoke, and the clouds still covered the
face of the sky threateningly, concealing my guides, the
stars of heaven, and rendering it impossible for me to
proceed. Thus when I wished most to advance, my
progress was arrested and my distressing suspense
prolonged. During the night I was asleep and awake
alternately, but could not at any time discern either moon
or stars. I slept behind a
fallen tree by a roadside. A horseman passed by
at midnight. His dog, a large, ferocious animal,
came running along by the side of the tree by which
<pb id="aughey266" n="266"/>
I was lying. When he reached me I rose suddenly, and
brandishing a club menacingly, the alarmed and bowling
dog incontinently and ingloriously
leaving me master of the field. The horseman stopped
and listened. I lay silent as the grave. After a time, which
my suspense and alarm doubtless magnified, he rode
onward, when I changed my hiding place for safer
quarters farther in the dark forest. The next morning the
sun was obscured until nine o'clock. I guess at the time,
as I had not my watch. I was then sick. There was a
ringing in my ears, and I was afflicted by vertigo, a
dimness of vision, and faintness, which rendered me
absolutely unfit for travel. It required an hour to walk a
quarter of a mile. Before me was a hill, the top of which I
reached after two hours laborious ascent. I despaired of
getting much farther. Feeling confident that I must be
near the point where intersect the counties of Tippah,
Pontotoc, Itawamba, and Tishomingo, and knowing that
there were many Unionists in that district, I resolved to
call at the first house I came to whose appearance
indicated that its inmates were not slave-holders. Slave-holders
were almost invariably secessionists. If I
remained in the woods I must perish, as a great storm
was impending. If I met with a Unionist family I would be
saved, if with a rebel family I could but perish, and I felt
that I could not survive the night and approaching storm.</p>
        <p>Soon I came to a cabin by the side of a road, two
<pb id="aughey267" n="267"/>
miles north of New Albany, Tippah county. The
storm had reached me. The wind was blowing a
gale, and the rain began to fall in torrents—just such
a storm visits the gulf states after a protracted drought.
I went up to the door of the cabin and rapped.
“Come,” was the laconic response. I pulled
the latch-string. The door blew open and I staggered in.
When the lady present looked upon me
she threw up her hands in terror, and said:</p>
        <p>“Are you from Tupelo?”</p>
        <p>“I am.”</p>
        <p>“What is your name?”</p>
        <p>“John Hill.”</p>
        <p>I suppressed my surname. I was not much surprised
at the lady's alarm. My hair, long and unkempt, covered
with mud, my clothes nearly torn from my body by the thorns
and briars in the ditches which
bisected the fields that I was compelled
necessarily to cross, my face pallid, the iron bands upon
my limbs, made me present a frightful apparition
to her startled gaze. And coming as the
harbinger of a fierce storm, added doubtless to
her terror. She, scrutinizing me closely, was about to
proceed with her catechising. I forestalled her
by turning to her husband, a man of Herculean
proportions, sitting near by saying:</p>
        <p>“Sir, the Yankees are overrunning all our country.
Why are you not in the army trying to drive
them away?”</p>
        <p>The lady replied tartly, “He's not there, and he's
<pb id="aughey268" n="268"/>
not goin' there, either.” She then animadverted upon Jeff
Davis, the Southern Confederacy, and the conscript
law, in terms that pleased me much. I never before
delighted so much in hearing Jeff
Davis abused. I felt safe, and pointing to the iron bands, told
this couple—Mr. and Mrs. Chism—of my escape from the
prison at Tupelo and the death preordained by General
Bragg.</p>
        <p>Their house had been searched for Malone and me,
and they were cognizant of our escape. Both husband
and wife promised to render all possible aid.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Chism immediately began to prepare supper. I told
her that I could not await the slow process of cooking,
that I was too near starvation for that. She turned down
the table-cloth which covered the fragments remaining
from dinner, and disclosed some corn bread and Irish
potatoes. I thought this was the sweetest morsel I had
ever tasted. After eating a little I became quite sick, and
was compelled to desist. It was so long since I had
partaken of any substantial food that my stomach rebelled
against it. Soon Mrs. Chism prepared supper, consisting
of broiled chicken and other delicacies. The fowl was
small, and I ate nearly the whole of it, much to the chagrin
of a little daughter of mine hostess, whom I heard
complaining to her me in an adjoining room, saying, “Ma,
all I could get of that chicken was a tiny piece of a wing,
and wasent that gentleman a hoss to eat,” with other
remarks not very complimentary to my voracious appetite.
I ate too heartily after so long a
<pb id="aughey269" n="269"/>
fast, and it caused nausea and vomiting. My stomach was
too weak to bear it. After supper mine host endeavored to
remove the heavy iron bands with which my ankles were
encircled. Fortunately he was a blacksmith by vocation,
and with the use of the implements of his trade he
succeeded. I keep these as sacred relics. The good lady
furnished me with water and a suit of her husband's
clothes. After performing a thorough ablution I donned
the suit, and was completely metamorphosed and
thoroughly disguised, as my new suit was made for a man
of vastly larger physical proportions. I spent the night
with my new friends, during which a heavy storm passed
over, accompanied by vivid lightning and loud,
reverberating thunder. Had I been out in the drenching
rain in my wretched and enfeebled condition I must
certainly have perished.</p>
        <p>A rebel camp was within a mile and a half, and
horsemen clad in gray passed constantly. In the
morning my host informed me of a Unionist who
knew the country in the direction of Rienzi, the point
which I now determined to reach. This gentleman
was a near neighbor, Mr. Sanford by name. Mr.
Chism accompanied me to a thicket near his house,
in which I concealed myself. Before leaving I
handed Mrs. Chism, a double eagle. She refused to
take it. Said I, “You have saved my life.” “I
charge you nothing for that,” was her laconic reply.
I threw the money down upon the table and left with
her husband. As we were departing, she said, “Well,
<pb id="aughey270" n="270"/>
if you get to the Federal lines you won't begrudge it, and
if you don't you won't need it.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Chism went to the shop of Mr. Sanford, who was a
hatter by trade. There were two rebel soldiers talking with
him, so Mr. C. had to wait till they went away of their own
accord. As he staid more than two hours I feared
treachery—that he might have gone to the rebel camp and
given information. I therefore left my place of
concealment and ascended an adjacent hill and climbed a
eucalyptus tree. When I saw Mr. Chism coming,
accompanied by but one man, I descended. The reason for
delay was given. Mr. Sanford said, “I am not familiar with
the route to Rienzi, but will accompany you to my brother-in-law's,
Mr. John Downing's, who I know is well
acquainted with the road. He can take you through the
woods so as to avoid the Confederate cavalry. As I
undertake this at the risk of life, we must use all possible
precaution. You will have to spend the day concealed in
my barn. I would gladly entertain you at my house, but I
have a large family and many of them are girls, and you
know that girls will talk, and might say something that
would lead to suspicion and search, for these rebels are
lynx-eyed and are on the alert. There are many notices
affixed to trees and shops and posts in the most public
places describing you and offering a large reward for your
capture. I will carry you provisions during the day, and at
midnight we will start to Mr. Downing's. We will be
compelled to make a large circuit to avoid the rebel
<pb id="aughey271" n="271"/>
camp, and to go around a spur of the mountain. We will
have to travel forty-five miles of a circuit, while it is only
nine miles as the raven flies.”</p>
        <p>At one time Mr. Sanford's twin daughters came into
the barn in search of eggs. They approached near my
place of concealment, but did not discover me. When
Mr. S. came with delicacies his wife had prepared, I
informed him of it. He said, “I will send all my girls to
their uncle's on a visit, so that there may be no danger of
their suspicions being aroused. We are in daily,
imminent peril. I do
hope that the Federal troops will make haste to occupy
the country and save us from our bitter and malignant
foes, who will soon attempt to force all
Unionists into their army; then it will be necessary
to leave home and escape to the Union lines.” He
brought his wife up to see me, and we sat sadly discussing
the perils and troubles surrounding the loyal
people of the South. At length night came, and I
slept. At midnight Mr. S. awoke me. He told me to mount
the horse he held by the bridle. Said he, “That is a
blooded animal of high mettle and good bottom, one of
the swiftest horses in Tippah Co. He runs like a streak of
lightning.” I provided a good whip, resolving in case of
danger to put my horse to his utmost speed.
We traveled rapidly till nine o'clock in
the morning, having to make a detour on account of
discovering an unexpected camp. We must have
traveled over fifty miles. When we
reached Mr. Downing's we partook of an excellent
<pb id="aughey272" n="272"/>
breakfast. The guerrillas had a few nights before
murdered a Unionist—a Mr. Newsom. His sentiments
had become known to the rebels. They
watched his house till they knew of his presence at
home. He had been in concealment, but run the risk of
going home to see a sick daughter. They offered him the
oath of allegiance to the Confederate states.
He refused to take it. In their anger they resolved
upon his immediate death. Some proposed hanging,
some shooting, but the majority prevailed, and these
fiends in human form, these devils incarnate, then
deliberately heated water, and in the presence of his
weeping, pleading wife and helpless children they
scalded to death their chained and defenceless victim.
They then suspended the corpse from a tree, with a label
attached threatening a similar death to any who should
remove the corpse or bury it. Thus perished a patriot of
whom the state was not worthy. These,
my friends, cut down the corpse by night and buried it in
the forest. May God reward them. Oh, the inhumanity of
man to his fellow-man. The mother-in-law of Mr. Newsom
was a daughter of Gen. Nathaniel Green of revolutionary
fame. She was very aged. I asked her, for we stopped at
her house, if she remembered much about the war of the
revolution. She kept repeating, “Oh, it was dreadful times.
The British before, the Indians behind, and the tories in
the middle.”</p>
        <p>Ere I left Mr. Downing's there were more than fifty
Unionists called to see me. They held a council,
<pb id="aughey273" n="273"/>
and Mr. Downing was deputed to convey me to the
Federal lines. We immediately set out upon our perilous
journey.</p>
        <p>Mr. John Downing, my guide, thought it best to travel
by day, as the recent rains had raised the waters of the
Hatchie and Tallahatchie rivers, both of which we must
cross. Fording would be quite dangerous at night. We
must follow trails, and thus avoid, if possible, the rebel
cavalry and camps. There was one point of special
danger at a place where stood a mill, at the base of
converging lofty hills. We were traveling in a semi-mountainous
country. We at length reached the summit
of a very high bill. Far below us, winding around the base
of this hill, which might not inappropriately be termed a
mountain, ran the clear waters of a considerable creek.
This was the dangerous point. Here was a large grist mill.
We hitched our horses in copse and reconnoitered.
Believing the coast to be clear, we warily descended the
steep declivities, till at length we reached the mill. The
miller appeared at the door and poured forth a torrent of
interrogatories, to all of which my guide answered warily
and discreetly, and I thought measurably allayed his
suspicions. Presently we espied a covered wagon drawn by
Sumpter mules approaching. The saddle marks were visible.
It halted at the mill, and eleven Confederate soldiers
emerged from underneath the low, dingy covering. We were
about to ride on, when they halted us, and the following
dialogue ensued
<pb id="aughey274" n="274"/>
between my guide and the soldiers, who had been out
on sick furlough ever since the battle of Shiloh, and were
now returning to camp at Ripley, Miss.:</p>
        <p>“Hello! strangers, whar are ye from?”</p>
        <p>“From New Albany, Tippah county.”</p>
        <p>“Whar ye gwine?”</p>
        <p>“On the hunt of stray oxen. Hev ye seen nothin' of a
black ox and a pided (pied) ox nowhar in yer travels?”</p>
        <p>“No, we hain't.”</p>
        <p>“Is ther any danger of meeting any Yanks on that
road over yender?”</p>
        <p>“No, ther ain't. But ther's a road turns offen it 'bout
three mile from here, to ther right, that is a mighty
dangerous road. The Yankee cavalry's on it most every
day. Say, who's that feller with ye? He jes' looks like
death on a pale hoss.”</p>
        <p>“He's my brother-in-law from Alabam. He's hed the
aiger for more'n a year, an' ther ain't no quinine in the
country an' he can't git it stopt. Some of 'em thinks he's
purty well gone with quick consumption.”</p>
        <p>“Golly, he looks like it. But what's that air notis up thar
on the mill?”</p>
        <p>The miller replies, “It's a notis of a reward fer a
prisoner that broke jail at Tupelo. Jes' read it. I can't.”</p>
        <p>“Nun of us kin read. Jim Colquitt stopped back a piece
thar to see his sister, Missis Curlee. He'll be along
dreckly. We is to wait for him hyar. He kin read an' rite too.”</p>
        <pb id="aughey275" n="275"/>
        <p>The miller replied, “The officer that axed me to
stick this notis up said a prisoner that hed escaped
before wuz follered with blood-hounds an' tuck back
an' put in irons, but he'd broke jail agin the day before
he wuz to be hung. That old Bragg wuz all-fired mad
about it, and offers a big reward to
whomsomever brings him back dead or alive. His
name is Mohave or suthin like that. He is a parson an' lives
in Rienzi, an' it's thought he's makin' fer that point.”</p>
        <p>We were about to start, when one of the soldiers
said, “Stranger, what mout your name be?”</p>
        <p>“My name is Jim Chalmette, and my brother-in-law's
name is Oliver Folsom Brownlee, from Florence, Alabam,” said
my guide.</p>
        <p>The soldier then said, “Can't one of you fellers read
that air notis?”</p>
        <p>We rode up in front of it and Mr. Downing read it thus:
<q direct="unspecified"><text><body><div1 type="letter"><p>“Ten thousand dollars reward will be paid for the return, dead
or alive, of a prisoner who escaped from the military prison
at Tupelo, Miss. His name is John Mohave. He is over six feet
high, of dark complexion, heavy beard, black eyes, high cheek bones, and
was dressed in broadcloth, somewhat the worse for prison wear.
Any soldier who captures him will, in addition to the cash
reward, receive suitable promotion.</p><closer><signed>“BRAXTON BRAGG,<lb/>
<hi rend="italics">“Major General Commanding.”</hi></signed></closer></div1></body></text></q></p>
        <p>I thought Downing had read it correctly, till I
rode up and read it. I felt some tremor when I recognized
<pb id="aughey276" n="276"/>
an exact description of myself. Even the missing
molar had been noticed.</p>
        <p>One of the soldiers said, “Well, stranger, that settles
it. I thought afore yer read that notis as how yer
brother-in-law mought a ben the feller what broke jail,
but he don't fill the bill, by odds. But he's got on awful
fine boots an' hat. They don't suit them cloze, an' his
cloze don't nigh fit him. They wuz made fer a long sight
bigger man.”</p>
        <p>“Them's a suit of my cloze he put on this mornin' so
my wife could wash an' mend hizzen.”</p>
        <p>“Well, I s'pose yer all right, but ther's a camp about
three mile from hyar. You an' yer brother-in-law hed better
let them oxen go fer awhile an' come with us to camp.
Chalmers or Baxter will be thar, or mebbe old Forrest
hisself. He'll be mighty glad to see ye, I reckon. Then ye
kin explain some things about ye that we don't zackly
understand.”</p>
        <p>At this time we were surrounded by them, and
Downing thought it best to express his acquiescence.
One of the soldiers presently went to the wagon, and
producing a jug, asked us to drink with him. We rode to
the further side of the wagon. The soldier then said,
“Here's to Jeff Davis and the Southern Confederacy,
wishin' 'em success and that we may kill a hundred
Yankees apiece an' all git home safe.”</p>
        <p>At this moment Downing said, “We must go on,” and
putting spurs to our horses we soon put considerable
space between us and these soldiers. They called after
us to halt. Downing said, “We haven't
<figure id="ill19" entity="aughey276"><p>SLAVES WORKING IN THE COTTON FIELD.</p></figure>
<figure id="ill20" entity="aughey277"><p>THE MEN RAN UP THE KNOLL AND FIRED AT US. Page 277</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey277" n="277"/>
time, howsomever we're all right.” We rode on rapidly,
thankful that we had escaped imminent peril. We soon
came to a turn in the road. Just as we made the turn, we
saw two men, with guns in their hands, on a knoll
covered with a heavy growth of walnut trees. We were
not sure whether they were hunters or guerrillas. They
called to us to halt. We did so and asked them what
they wanted. They replied that they would come to the
road and tell us, and said, “Wait till we come to you.”
Downing said, in a low tone, “We are in danger, as we
are in range, and they can bring us down with their
guns. We will wait till they get to the bottom of the hill,
among the chaparral which will intercept the shot if they
fire.” He then called to them to come on. They started
toward us, and when they had reached the dense
chaparral, we put spurs to our horses and galloped
rapidly away. When we started, the men ran back up
the knoll and taking aim fired at us. The shot from one
of the guns whistled harmlessly through the branches of
a mulberry tree under which we were passing. The shot
from the other gun was more effective. One shot struck
my horse in the flank. He reared and plunged wildly. I
managed, however, to keep my seat. A shot struck
Downing's saddle, and glancing inflicted a wound in the
thigh. The men then hastened through the chaparral,
and upon reaching the road, both fired the two
undischarged barrels of their guns. We were now so far
away, and had turned a slight bend in the road, that
<pb id="aughey278" n="278"/>
the shot did us no injury. We, however, heard their
patter and whistle as they passed through the branches
of the trees in close proximity to us. Neither Downing nor
I felt the least fear. The excitement of the moment and the
comical and excited appearance of our would-be captors,
both of whom had lost their hats in the bushes, excited our mirth.
Downing said he believed the men were Porter Rucker and Albert
Braddock, guerrillas or partisan rangers, as Jeff Davis
styled those who were engaged in hunting down
Unionists, and capturing and returning to camp deserters.</p>
        <p>“Perhaps,” said I to Downing, “it will delight us
hereafter to recall even the present things to mind.”
“Yes, if we outlive this terrible war and survive its horrors.
But there is not much pleasure in them now.”</p>
        <p>In a short time we came to the road designated as
dangerous by our would-be captors at the mill. As we
reached it we saw in the distance ahead of us, on the road
we were now traveling, a few straggling cavalrymen.
They saw us and halted, apparently to await our
overtaking them. We turned off on the road which the Yankee
cavalry were said to frequent ere we reached them. A boy whom
we overtook informed us that Baxter's rebel cavalry had just
passed. They would have swift steeds to follow with any prospect of
overtaking us. A former classmate in Richmond College,
Ohio, Matthew Thompson by name, was an officer
under Baxter, and
<pb id="aughey279" n="279"/>
would have recognized me had we been a few minutes
earlier at that point, and been captured by this doughty
rebel. Baxter's scouts infested this section for a long
time, murdering Unionists and hunting with blood-hounds
the poor conscripts who, having been forced
into the Confederate service, endeavored to escape to
the Federal lines. Baxter concocted a plot to capture Gen.
U. S. Grant, but failed to accomplish his nefarious
purpose.</p>
        <p>Having traveled several hours after escaping Baxter's
cavalry, we rode into the woods, dismounted, and
sat down to rest and take an inventory of our injuries.
Downing's boot had some blood in it and his thigh was
beginning to be quite painful. The left leg of his
pantaloons was completely saturated. I examined his
wound, and used Downing's knife as a probe, but I could
not find the shot. I cut off a piece of cloth from one of
my under garments and bandaged the wound to stop
the hemorrhage. My horse had bled considerably from
the wound in his flank, but did not show any perceptible
sign of weakness or flagging gait. We remounted and
rode on Antioch or Hinkle. I think we passed through
both these hamlets. Here Downing left me to return home. He
must travel by a different route in returning. He would
lodge that night at the house of a stalwart Unionist, Elihu
Noble, who had recently moved from Ingomar, Issaquena county, to
Molino Del Rey. I gave him a double eagle, and we parted
with fervent adieus and good wishes for each other's
<pb id="aughey280" n="280"/>
welfare. I again assumed the role of a pedestrian, and ere
long reached Rienzi.</p>
        <p>When I gazed on the star spangled banner, emblem of
my country's glory and power, beneath whose ample
folds there was safety and protection for the poor,
pursued, panting, perishing Unionist, and saw around me
the loyal hosts of brave men, eager to subvert rebellion
and afford protection to the wronged and persecuted
southern patriot, I shed tears of joy. I felt that I was safe,
my perils o'er, and from the depths of a grateful heart I
returned thanks to Almighty God, who had given me my
life in answer to importunate prayer, preserving me amid
peculiar dangers, seen and unseen, till now I had reached
the desired haven and was safe amid hosts of friends.
When I reached the picket line, a horse was furnished me,
and I was taken to the head-quarters of Col. Mizener. My
brother, David H. Aughey, and brother-in-law, Prof.
Robert K. Knight, residents of Rienzi, heard of my arrival
and came at once to see and convey me to their homes.
Col. M. had sent an orderly to report my presence. Col.
Mizener requested me to report all that would be of
service to Gen. Rosecrans, who was ten miles south at
Booneville, which I did, he copying my report as I gave it.
I reported the particulars of my escape, the probable
number of Confederate troops in and around Tupelo, the
topography of the country, the probable intentions of the
rebels, the putative number of troops sent to Richmond to
re-inforce Gen. Lee, the
<pb id="aughey281" n="281"/>
harsh, cruel, and vindictive treatment of the southern
Unionists incarcerated in the bastile in Tupelo, etc. The
Colonel requested me to go with him to visit Gen.
Rosecrans at his head-quarters in Booneville the next
morning, but at the hour specified reaction had taken
place, and I was very sick. My report was carried up to
Gen. Rosecrans by Col. Mizener, who immediately
forwarded it to Gen. Grant at Memphis, who noted it and
placed it on file. It has been published in official Records of
the War of the Rebellion, Union and Confederate, Vol. 17, page 107.</p>
        <p>Gen. W. S. Rosecrans, upon hearing that I was sick,
sent Surgeon Berridge Lucas, of an Illinois brigade,
raised in Peoria, Ill., and Dr. Hawley, of the 36th Ill.
Infantry, to attend me during my illness. Under their
skillful and efficient treatment I measurably regained
health, though for some time I was apparently upon the
border land, and it was feared that I would be a mental
and physical wreck. My sufferings at the hands of the
rebels produced a lesion from which I will never fully
recover. Two of my soldier comrades have recently succumbed
to a similar malady, and I cannot hope to resist it much longer.
The citadel of life must eventually yield to its force, and
death supervene. Skillful medical treatment and extremely
temperate habits alone have thus far held it in abeyance.
Hardships incurred afterward in the service, as chaplain,
aggravated the malady.</p>
        <p>But why should I repine since my country's integrity
and permanence has been secured, never more
<pb id="aughey282" n="282"/>
to be imperiled by traitors to their government and their
God? The salutary lesson they have learned will prevent
a repetition of their folly.</p>
        <p>When I recovered sufficiently to leave my room I was
honored with a serenade by a brigade brass band,
through the politeness of Col. Bryner and Lieut. Col.
Thrush, of the 47th Ill. regiment. At the close they called
for a speech, to which call I thus responded:</p>
        <p>GENTLEMEN—I desire to express my sincere thanks
for the honor conferred. In the language of the last tune
played by your band, I truly feel at home again, and it
fills my soul with joy to meet my friends once more.
What a vast difference between Tupelo and Rienzi.
There I was regarded as a base ingrate, as a despicable
traitor, an enemy to the country, chained as a felon,
doomed to die, and before the execution of the sentence
subjected to every species of insult and contumely. Here
I meet with the kindest expressions of sympathy from
officers of all ranks, from the subaltern to the general,
and there is not a private soldier who has heard my tale
of woe that does not manifest a kindly sympathy. I hope
you will speedily pass south of Tupelo, but in your
victorious march to the gulf I wish you to fare better
than I did in my journey from Tupelo to Rienzi. Traveling
day after day without food or water would cause you to
present the emaciated appearance that I do. On your
route, call upon the secession sympathizers and compel
them to furnish you with all the viands
<pb id="aughey283" n="283"/>
that you need. My good horse, Bucephalus, I left
at Tupelo. He is an animal of pure blood and high mettle.
The rebel general Hardee, in the true spirit of secession,
appropriated—that is, stole him. He often insolently rode
him by our prison, surrounded by his staff. He did not return him
to me when I left. However, I did not call to demand him upon leaving.
Being in haste I did not choose to spare the time, as I am
a great economist of time, and leaving in the night I did
not wish to disturb the slumbers of the Tupelonians. He
is a bright bay. If you find him you may have him gratis. I would much
prefer that he serve the Federal army. I bought him of
Gen. Lionel Colquitt, at West Point, Miss., for three
hundred and fifty dollars.</p>
        <p>If you take Gen. Jordan prisoner, send me word, and I
will furnish you with the irons with which he bound me,
by which you may secure him till he meets the just
penalty of his crimes, even death, which he richly deserves
for the murder of many Unionists.</p>
        <p>When I became convalescent I rode to Jacinto, the
Federal outpost nearest to my family. I called upon
Gen. Jefferson C. Davis, who at once ordered eight
regiments of cavalry, accompanied by a section of artillery,
to bring them into Jacinto. I soon had the pleasure of
beholding my wife and child, whose faces I recently had
given up all hope of ever seeing upon earth. The meeting
was mutually a joyful one. Gen. Davis ushered them into
his office, where I was
<pb id="aughey284" n="284"/>
awaiting them, and then considerately retired. My little
daughter, during my ominous absence, would often try
to comfort her ma by telling her, when she was weeping,
“Ma, I think they will let pa loose, 'cause we pray so
much for him. Don't cry, I think God will send him to us
soon. He has said He will hear us when we pray.”</p>
        <p>Richard Malone lived in Jacinto. Gen. Davis and I
called to see him. He rejoiced greatly upon seeing me. He
had informed Gen. Davis of my capture and re-arrest. Gen.
Davis had ordered the arrest of four prominent citizens of
Jacinto, to be held as hostages for my safety. The officer
was just about to start to execute the order when I
arrived at his headquarters. The citizens were named
John G. Barton, Col. Runnels, Barton Key, and Calvin
Taylor.</p>
        <p>When Malone reached the point where we agreed to
meet he awaited my arrival. He gave the preconcerted
signals, but I came not. We agreed to meet at a point
where a garment was suspended from a post of the corn-field
fence. But as there may have been more than one
garment suspended from the posts, as many rebel
soldiers, after washing, hung their clothes out to dry, we
mistook the place, and reached the corn-field at different
points, and so were compelled to set out alone on the
hazardous journey. At one time Malone resolved upon
the risk of walking upon a road a few hundred yards to
reach a forest. A company of cavalry came suddenly upon him and
ordered him to go before them, declaring that they
<pb id="aughey285" n="285"/>
would gladly return him to prison. They made him
go on the double-quick. He said, presently, “I am
very thirsty; will you give me some water?”
They replied that they were going to that house on
the distant hill to get water. When they reached
the house and drew the water, Malone noticed that
there was no dipper at the well with which to lift
the water from the bucket. He said, “I will go
into the house and ask for a dipper.” Two cavalry
men followed him, and stationed themselves at
the door. Malone went into the house, shut the
door, and the back door being open, he ran through
the house, opened the garden gate, ran through the
garden, leaped over the palings at the farther end
into a corn-field. Two women who were in the
house ran to the door clapping their hands and
exclaiming, “O! your Yankee is gone, your prisoner
has escaped.” The cavalry men ran round the
house, and seeing Malone running through the corn-field
called to him to halt. Malone, not heeding
the order, ran onward. They fired. Malone ran
zigzag to avoid the bullets which whistled uncomfortably
close to his ears. They failed to bring him
down. They followed, but Malone outran them to a
swamp, and after many other narrow risks reached his
home in Jacinto.</p>
        <p>I returned to Rienzi. I reached Rienzi from prison on
the day that the 2d Michigan regiment made a present of
a fine black cavalry horse to Gen. Philip Sheridan. As the
presentation was made in
<pb id="aughey286" n="286"/>
Rienzi, the general named the horse after the town, calling
him Rienzi. This was the horse he rode in his famous ride
from Winchester, Va., to Cedar creek, when he turned the
tide of battle, changing an inglorious rout into a glorious
victory over Jubal Early<corr>.</corr> We soon left Rienzi for the
North. When we reached the home of my parents the
rejoicing was as if one who was dead had been restored
to life. They had heard through war correspondents with
the army of my imprisonment, escape, re-arrest, and
re-incarceration. They had not heard of my second escape.
Thirteen days after our arrival at my father's house a son
was born to us, August 20th, 1862, whom we named John
Knox. Our third child, Gertrude Evangeline, was born
February 12, 1867. Our first child, Anna Katharine, now
Mrs. Ferguson, of Congress, O., was born September
3, 1858.</p>
        <p>As soon as I felt able to do so, I accepted the position
of chaplain, first in the army of the Potomac, afterwards
in the western army. The officers of the 6th Ill. calvary, of
which I was chaplain, asked me at one time to give them
an address on the subject of my arrest, imprisonment,
and escapes. I complied with their invitation. At the
close of the address, a soldier who had deserted from the
rebel army and was now a member of a company in our
regiment, came to Col. Lynch, who at this time
commanded the 6th Ill. calvary (Col. Benjamin Grierson
was the 1st colonel), and informed him that he was one
<pb id="aughey287" n="287"/>
of the guards on duty at the prison in Tupelo on the
night of my escape. He said that I was missed in the
morning, very early. One of the guards noticed
my chain, which I had coiled up and left by the side
of a little stump, inadvertently placing it on the side
next the guards. He called the officer of the guard
and showed him the chain. Soon many officers
came into the prison. All the guards who had been
on duty during the night were brought into the
prison in irons. They thought that some of them must
have been in collusion with the prisoner, or he could
not have escaped. The prisoners were strictly questioned
as to whether they knew anything in regard to
the escape, or if any of them had rendered any assistance.
They denied all knowledge of or complication
in the matter. One of the officers said,“God Almighty
alone must have known and helped him. He could
not have gotten away without assistance, and you all
deny having rendered any.” Col. Lynch said, “If
you had known of his intention to escape, would you
have helped him?” “No,” said the soldier, “I was
a rebel in sentiment then, and would have done my
duty and taken stringent measures to prevent his
escape, had I known of his intention to do so. Two
companies of cavalry were sent in pursuit, with strict
orders to shoot him on sight and not bring him back
alive.” But providentially they never got the sight.
One went north toward the Federal lines. The
other north-east. One went in sight of the Federal
pickets near Rienzi. The other visited my father-in-law's,
<pb id="aughey288" n="288"/>
at Paden's mills, south-east of Iuka. They again,
as upon their first visit, searched the house,
mills, negro quarters, and every crevice capable of
secreting a hare.</p>
        <p>A Unionist, Washington Gortney, whose name
I have mentioned, was murdered by a band of
guerrillas under the lead of his nearest neighbor,
one Bill Robinson. Gortney and Reece had
enlisted in the Union army. Gortney desired to visit his
family, one mile from Paden's mills. Reece accompanied him.
Robinson heard of it, and gathering a few partisan rangers,
murdered Gortney in the midst of his family. Reece was left
for dead, but recovered. In retaliation, a company of Federal
soldiers were sent out to burn Paden's, Vawter's, and
Robinson's mills and ten houses. This they accomplished, and
returned. This salutary proceeding had the effect of checking
guerrilla murders and predatory raids by them for a time.</p>
        <p>How terrible for a family to see and hear the
howling hounds in search of one of their number, and
to hear the horrid and blasphemous oaths of the
fierce dragoons, swearing what terrible vengeance
they will wreak upon their victim when caught and
in their power.</p>

                <p>DEAR SIR—I take the <hi rend="italics">National Tribune</hi>, that most
excellent soldiers' paper. In it I noticed your request for
the address of Leslie Barksdale and others who were your
fellow-prisoners in the South. I am now known as Melvin
Estill, having changed my name for reasons which will be
hereinafter given. I was a fellow-prisoner with you in that
miserable den at Tupelo, Miss. Delevan Morgan, John
Truesdale, Byron Porter, Ulysses Chenault, and I were
conscripted, and because of our refusal to take the oath
and enlist we were immured in prison. We were tried by
court-martial, and condemned to death, with the proviso
that if we took the oath and entered the army the sentence
would be suspended. We were given twelve hours for
deliberation. You will remember we consulted you, and
you advised us to take the oath, enter the army, and desert
the first favorable opportunity and escape to the Federal lines.
We accordingly took the oath. I think our motive was suspected.
We were taken to Saltillo and
<pb id="aughey290" n="290"/>
placed under guard in an old rickety building, with a
number of other prisoners.</p>
                <p>That same night we evaded the guards and escaped.
Guided by the north star, we hastened northward with all
possible speed. Soon after daylight we heard the baying
of the blood-hounds; nearer and nearer they came. When
they came in sight three of our number climbed a tree.
Delevan Morgan and I essayed to climb a large tree that
stood near. Morgan caught hold of a withered branch. It
broke in his grasp and he fell to the ground. He arose and
ran. I jumped down and followed him. The hounds and
cavalry appeared upon the scene. Our three companions
were shot, and as they fell the hounds tore them limb
from limb. Morgan had sprained his ankle, and his
progress was quite slow. I made a detour and concealed
myself behind the huge trunk of a fallen tree. Soon the
hounds overtook my friend and tore him to pieces. These
hounds were under the care of a miscreant named Jasper
Cain, who was assisted by one Laverty Grier, John
Graham, and others.</p>
                <p>I supposed that death was inevitable. Cain and his
men held a council of war. Cain enquired, “How many
prisoners did old Bragg say there wuz?”
“Four,” replied Grier. “Well we've got 'em all,” replied
Cain. Some one said he believed General Bragg said, “there
wuz five,” but it was decided that “it wuz only
four.” Cain said, “Our orders wuz, to take 'em dead or
alive. Now how will we prove to
<pb id="aughey291" n="291"/>
old Bragg that we killed 'em all, an' git the reward?”
“Take their scalps,” suggested Grier. “Good,
that is a bright idea,” said Cain. “Now, Laverty,
you scalp 'em with that 'ere knife that's in your
belt.” The order was obeyed, the scalps stuck in
Grier's belt, and the cavalcade returned to camp.</p>
                <p>I now hastened onward. After traveling about four
miles I came to a cabin in a clearing. I knew that pursuit
would not long be delayed. I went to the cabin and
knocked. A lady came and opened
the door. She bade me enter. I asked her if she
Union or Secesh. She assumed an air of great
ignorance and stupidity, and replied, “I ain't neither, I'm
a Baptist.” That was enough for me. I felt sure she was
all right. I at once revealed my condition, and told her of
my imminent peril. She and her daughter and her sick husband
at once set about devising a plan of escape. There was a cave
in the hillside about a half a mile distant. This lady, who was
of Amazonian proportions, and her daughter, carried me to
this cave. I found a cot within it and a little table.
This lady, Mrs. Cameron, gave me a pair of her daughter's shoes
in exchange for mine. Her daughter, Miss Alverna Cameron, put on
my shoes and traveled five miles northward to a swamp. She then took 
off my shoes and put on a pair of her mother's, which she had carried
in her apron, and returned.</p>
                <p>Jasper Cain, after considerable delay reported to
General Braxton Bragg, and told him of the fate of
the prisoners, whom he had left unburied, to be
<pb id="aughey292" n="292"/>
devoured by wild hogs and buzzards. He then displayed
exultingly the scalps which he bore as a trophy and as a
proof of having carried out the orders of his commanding
general. “But there are only four scalps,” said the general,
“where is the fifth?” “You said there wuz four prisoners
what escaped,” said Cain. Gen. Bragg ordered Cain to
start in pursuit of the fifth at once and to bring in his
scalp or consequences might follow not pleasant for
Cain to contemplate. This infuriate demon obeyed with
alacrity, and ere long the domicile of the Camerons was
surrounded by howling hounds and blaspheming rebels.
Soon, however, they seemed to have discovered the
track, and off they went pell-mell on the route which
Miss Alverna had taken to mislead them.</p>
                <p>Miss Alverna and her mother visited me in the cave,
bringing with them hoe cake, butter, and milk. The rebel
soldiers had robbed them of all other provisions. I
feasted upon the regale these kind ladies furnished me.
They were delicious viands indeed to one who brought
the sauce of hunger to the repast. Starvation in the rebel
camp and prison had so improved my appetite that it
required all they brought to appease it. Miss Alverna
told me of the pursuit by Cain with his blood-hounds,
and how she had misled them. They then prepared to
take their departure. Mrs. Cameron and her daughter
sang “Jesus, lover of my soul,” and a hymn, one stanza
of which I shall ever remember.</p>

                </lg>
                <p>Miss Alverna then read 
the 31st Psalm. Two verses,
the 35-6, seemed very pertinent. “My times are in thy
hand; deliver me from the hands of mine enemies and
from them that persecute me. Make thy face to shine
upon thy servant and save me for thy mercy's sake.”
Also the 13th verse, etc., “Fear was on every side, while
they took counsel together against me, they devised to
take away my life. But I trusted in thee, O Lord, I said
thou art my God. Have mercy upon me, O Lord, for I am in
trouble. Thou art my rock and my fortress, therefore for
thy name's sake lead me and guide me.” Mrs. Cameron
then led in prayer, asking the Lord to deliver me from
surrounding foes, the bears, venomous serpents, and
still more venomous Confederates. They then bade me
good-bye and returned home. When night came I feared
to stay longer in my cave. I started off on my perilous
journey toward the Federal lines. I lay concealed by day
and traveled by night, guided by the polar star.</p>
                <p>One night I felt that I must run a great risk to procure
some food, as I was in a starving condition. I found a
cabin inhabited by slaves. I went to the door and rapped.
Soon a venerable aunty appeared
<pb id="aughey294" n="294"/>
at the door. I asked her for something to eat. She
appeared alarmed, and calling a little colored boy she
bade him guide me to a place where I should be fed.
When I reached the terminus of my journey under this
boy's guidance, I found a man about my own age, who
was, like me, a fugitive bound for the Union army. Soon
a number of kind colored people appeared, and in this
swamp we were fed with all the luxuries procurable by
these kind friends who bore the image of God carved in
ebony. My fugitive friend said his name was Johnny
Peterson, and that he lived on the Taccaleeche in North
Mississippi. After many thrilling adventures we reached
the Union lines and were joyfully welcomed. A minister
of your church informs me that, by examining the year
book or minutes of your general assembly, he learns that
you are pastor of the Presbyterian church in the city of
Chariton, Iowa. My address will be Memphis, Tenn.,
for a few months. Write me at your earliest convenience.</p>
                <p>After reaching the Federal lines both Peterson and I
enlisted and fought through the war. Through fear that I
might be taken prisoner and recognized, I changed my
name, and found it almost impossible to resume my old
name after the war.</p>
                <p>I am glad to know that you made your escape. Tell me
all about it at your earliest convenience.</p>

        <p>In the years of grace, 1881-2, I was pastor of the
churches of Ebenezer and Good Will, in Sumter Co., S. C.
While I was conversing with Mr. Williamson, a merchant
in Mayesville, a gentleman in front of his store said to
another, who spoke of Judge S. McGowen: “The Judge
has a national reputation as far as South Carolina is
concerned.” This man was evidently still laboring under
the delusion that South Carolina was a sovereign,
independent nation, and that the United States was a
mere confederacy of nations to be dissolved at will by
the states individually. The war had taught him nothing.</p>
        <p>In conversation with prominent citizens of Sumter and
Mayesville I found that there was no concealment of the
frauds practiced at elections. They declared that the
negroes and scalawags should not rule over them. They
divulged to me the fraudulent methods by which the
dominant party, though greatly in the minority
numerically, retained their political power. Said I,
“Suppose that congress should send a committee to
inquire into the matter, what would you do?” “We would
testify upon oath that there had been a free ballot and fair
count.” “Would that
<pb id="aughey296" n="296"/>
be morally right?” said I. “Of two evils choose the
less,” was the reply.</p>
        <p>Sam. Lee, had there been a free ballot and fair count,
would have been elected over his competitor,
Richardson, by more than three to one. Yet Richardson
received the governor's certificate of election, and
represented the district in congress.</p>
        <p>The <hi rend="italics">Century</hi> magazine, in the April, 1885, No.,
publishes articles by Henry W. Grady, of Atlanta, Ga.,
and Edward P. Clarke, from which we quote. Mr. Clarke
describes the revolution by which the minority overcame
the majority who ruled in the period of reconstruction in
the Carolinas, Florida, Mississippi, Louisiana, etc.</p>
        <p>“It became evident that there must be a revolution,
and it was carried through. The negroes were intimidated
from going to the polls, so far as possible, and when
violence did not suffice to keep them away, their ballots
were tampered with and neutralized after they had been
cast. By force or by fraud the race, which in several
states possessed an actual numerical majority, was
reduced into an apparent minority. The negro vote was
practically suppressed and the majority ceased to rule.
This result was inevitable. Reconstruction had sought  ‘to
put the bottom rail on top,’ to reverse the highest and
lowest strata of society, to place ignorance and poverty
in authority over intelligence and property. Such an
attempt had never before succeeded in the world's
history; it could not have succeeded permanently in the
South
<pb id="aughey297" n="297"/>
without destroying civilization. It was from the first only
a question how soon and in what way it should be
defeated.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Grady's opinion is plainly inferred from the
following, quoted from his article discussing the status
of the freedmen:</p>
        <p>“As a matter of course this implies the clear and
unmistakable domination of the white race in the South.
The assertion of that is simply the assertion of the right
of character, intelligence, and property to rule. It is
simply saying that the responsible and steadfast
element in the community shall control, rather than the
irresponsible and the migratory. It is the reassertion of
the moral power that overthrew the reconstruction
governments.”</p>
        <p>Thus in many southern states the minority represents
in Congress the suppressed majority. This is in
direct conflict with an explicit article in the Constitution
of the United States adopted for the express purpose of
preventing this flagrant wrong. To good men in the
southern states, to all true and loyal Americans, how
humiliating is this oft-repeated slander upon the fair
fame of the southern states,  that only by violence
practiced upon a weaker race, or by fraud in tampering
with the ballot-box, which necessarily includes
deliberate perjury, can the cause of
good government be maintained in the South. We do
not believe any such libel, but what else can be meant
by the language quoted above.</p>
        <p>We cannot do better than append here an extract
<pb id="aughey298" n="298"/>
of a very different kind—one that does honor to the hand
that wrote it and the courage that pronounced it. We
take it from the inaugural address of President
Cleveland.</p>
        <p>“In the administration of a government pledged to do
equal and exact justice to all men, there should be no
pretext for anxiety touching the protection of the
freedmen in their rights or their security in the enjoyment
of their privileges under the Constitution and its
amendments. All discussion as to their fitness for the
place accorded to them as American citizens is idle and
unprofitable, except as it suggests the necessity for their
improvement. The fact that they are citizens entitles them
to all the rights due to that relation and charges them
with all its duties, obligations, and responsibilities.”</p>
        <p>The legislature was in session in Columbia. I visited
the halls of legislation. There was a bill pending upon
which there was much discussion. The bill proposed to
require eight separate ballot-boxes and that but one voter
at a time should enter the polling place; that no one
should speak to him while in the polling place; and that if
he failed to deposit his ballots in the boxes properly, his
vote would be lost. Though the boxes were labeled, this
would leave the illiterate voter to the almost absolute
certainty of losing his vote. The fraudulent intent of the
bill was patent. The Charleston <hi rend="italics">News and Courier</hi>,
commenting on this bill, says: “We have great
confidence in the wisdom and foresight of the
<pb id="aughey299" n="299"/>
present General Assembly of South Carolina, and believe
that in their hands the state will be safe. They will not fail
to remember and to act on the knowledge that the
colored voters outnumbered the white voters in South
Carolina, and that while the prosperity, nay! the
existence of the state in its present condition, depends
on the supremacy of the civilization which the whites
represent, the people of the United States (who have
already proved themselves more than a match for South
Carolina) will not continue to acquiesce in revolutionary
processes, and will not consent to have us represented
in Congress by modes which have been hitherto
indispensable in the conduct of our state affairs.
But were they?”</p>
        <p>It will be observed from the above quotation that the
Charleston <hi rend="italics">News and Courier</hi> admits the revolutionary
processes, that is, fraudulent methods used in
controlling the elections in South Carolina. I found no
one who denied that fraud was resorted to to defeat the
scalawags and colored voters. I found three colored men
representing sea island districts. In those districts the
colored population so greatly preponderated that they
found means to prevent election frauds being practiced
upon them. This may be the ultimate solution of this vexed
question. The whites in the southern states increase
decennially twenty per cent and the negroes thirty-five
per cent. The blacks will ultimately greatly outnumber the
whites in that region. In the seven Atlantic and Gulf states,
the two Carolinas, Georgia,
<pb id="aughey300" n="300"/>
Florida, Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, the whites
numbered in 1880, 3,814,395, and the blacks, 3,721,481.
There will be, at these proportionate rates of increase,
in 1985, about 30,000,000 whites and
about 125,000,000 blacks. This ratio of increase holding,
the negroes will be, in one hundred years from this year
of grace, 1885, quadruple the number of whites in the
southern Atlantic and Gulf states. Long ere that date
they will suppress with iron hand all attempts to defraud
them of the right to exercise the elective franchise and
to have a fair count of the ballots cast.</p>
        <p>I found peon slavery in full force in the Carolinas,
through the labor contract system. Men hire the colored
people to labor for them, taking as security a lien on the
prospective crop, for supplies furnished in advance. At
the settlement at the close of the year the negroes are
found to be in debt, and each annual settlement only
increases the indebtedness. The colored people may
labor hard from dawn to dusk, live sparingly, wear
the coarsest clothing, and yet end the year in debt. They
cannot enforce their rights, though well assured of the
frauds practiced upon them.</p>
        <p>I enquired if the Southern Presbyterian Church had
made any provision for the education of the colored
people, their former slaves. I learned that there was a
theological seminary established at Tuskaloosa, Ala., for
the education of young colored men who desired to
enter the ministry. I could not learn that
<pb id="aughey301" n="301"/>
there was any institution under the control of the
southern church for the education of the colored people in the
common or higher branches. The northern church have
established many good schools in the
South, in which all the branches of a good common
school education are taught. They have also a number
of schools of a high order, in which the classics
and higher mathematics are very successfully taught.
I visited the Mayesville School. Misses Kate H.
Moorhead and Jennie S. Hemphill, of Bridgewater,
Beaver Co., Pa., were the very efficient teachers.
There were enrolled 150 scholars, in every grade of progress.
These young ladies labored from dawn until dusk, and seemed
never to weary of their arduous duties, which they doubtless
entered upon <foreign lang="ita"><hi rend="italics">con amore</hi></foreign>. Many sable children have they
enlightened and evangelized. Many other schools and seminaries
and colleges under the control of the northern church are
doing a noble, a grand work among the children of
freedmen and poor whites.</p>
        <p>The public school system of South Carolina and
many other states was organized by the reconstruction
governments, and since these have been overthrown,
the powers that be have not abrogated it, though there
is much opposition to this relic of “Yankee, negro,
and scalawag rule.” Revolutions seldom go backward,
and it is probable that the public school system
may survive, and by its beneficent effects overcome
the prejudice of the ex-slaveholders against the
education of all classes. Strange that any should oppose
<pb id="aughey302" n="302"/>
universal education—that glory and cheap defense of
states and nations.</p>
        <p>I attended the meeting of the synod of Atlantic, which
was held in Columbia, S. C., in December, 1881. I saw
there a large number of educated colored men, who, as
Presbyterian ministers, were conducting the business of
synod in a very creditable manner. I heard some of them
preach. Their sermons were earnest, lucid expositions of
practical duties, enforced by pertinent quotations from
the word of God.</p>
        <p>The moderator, Rev. Moses Aaron Hopkins, presided
with dignity and ability. On points of order his rulings
were admirable. He afterward received the appointment
from President Cleveland of minister to Liberia, where he
died of acclimating fever, lamented by the whole synod
of Atlantic. Many colored men were present as ruling
elders, representing churches in the bounds of the
synod, which embraces the states of North and South
Carolina and Georgia. When I was a citizen of the South,
in the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">ante bellum </hi></foreign>days, these men were all illiterate
slaves, whom to teach the alphabet was made a crime
punishable by incarceration in the penitentiary.</p>
        <p>It is not wise to say that the former times were better
than these. The change for the better seemed to me to
indicate the millennial dawn.</p>
        <p>Before the war these men were helpless slaves, with
no rights that white men felt bound to respect, scourged
to their tasks by the lash of the cruel, brutal overseer,
many of whom delighted in every refinement
<pb id="aughey303" n="303"/>
of cruelty, universally denied legal marriage, even by
masters who were professedly christians, not suffered to
learn to read the word of God, affirmed by a decision of the
supreme court of the U. S. to be chattels personal,
possessed of no rights above that of the ox or ass. Now
the key of knowledge is placed in the hands of this chattel,
by which he opens the door which gives his eager, anxious
mind access to all the stores of intellectual wisdom and
spiritual lore. His disabilities are yet many, through peon
bondage and fraudulent disfranchisement, but they are no
greater than those of the poor whites of the South, but he
is rising in the scale of intelligence; he is improving his
opportunities, he is increasing and waxing strong in
numbers and power, and the day is not distant when,
rising to the full dignity of full-fledged manhood, he will
assert and maintain his God-given rights, if need be at the
cannon's mouth and at the point of the bayonet. He who
would be free, himself must strike the blow. The
government has enfranchised him, and bestowed upon
him all civil rights, but they are in part kept back by fraud,
but he will ere long, we trust, burst the shackles by which
he is illegally bound and become a freeman, in deed, as well
as in name, possessed of and enjoying all the rights,
immunities, and franchises of an American citizen with
which our national constitution endows him, and which
he, knowing and prizing even above life itself, will dare
maintain as his birthright forever.</p>

        <pb id="aughey304" n="304"/>
        <p>In 1883 I had an invitation to a field of labor in
Kentucky. I went down to look at the lay of the
land. At Bowling Green I met Col. George M.
Edgar, who was president of a female seminary. I
remarked to the colonel, who was a Presbyterian,
that it was unfortunate that there were two branches
of the Presbyterian church in that state. In many
towns each branch has a feeble organization struggling
for existence. United, their success would be
assured, and their aggressive power quadrupled.
The colonel replied that union could be effected in no
other way than by the northern branch coming over
to them with their property. They could never
unite with a church that intermeddled with politics
by making political deliverances, as the Northern
General Assembly had done during the late civil
war. They had declared slavery to be heresy, and
secession treason and rebellion, and that as a church
the southern branch was guilty of schism in separating
from the northern assembly.</p>
        <p>I replied, “Did the southern assembly ever make any
political deliverances?”</p>
        <p>The colonel responded, “No, sir. I challenge you to
point to a single one.”</p>
        <p>I replied, “The southern assembly of 1862 took action,
of which this is part, ‘The assembly desires to record
with its solemn approval this fact of the unanimity of our
people in supporting a contest to which religion as well
as patriotism now summons the citizens of this country,
and to implore for them
<pb id="aughey305" n="305"/>
the blessing of God in the course which they are now
pursuing. The long continued agitations of our adversaries
have wrought within us a deeper conviction of
the divine appointment of domestic servitude, and have
led to a clearer comprehension of the duties we owe to
the African race. We hesitate not to affirm that it is the
peculiar mission of the <hi rend="italics">southern</hi> church to conserve the
institution of slavery and make it a blessing to both
master and slave.’ Now, colonel, if that be the peculiar
mission of the southern church, her mission has
terminated, and it might be well to return to the bosom of
the church whence you departed. It may be, however,
that the following deliverance made after slavery had
been abolished prevents it. In 1865 the southern
assembly adopted a long paper, in which this occurs:
 ‘While the existence of slavery in its civil aspects may
be regarded as a settled question, an issue now gone, yet
the lawfulness of the relation as a question of social
morality and of scriptural truth has lost nothing of its
importance.’ This from the assembly of 1862:  ‘From all our
churches we hear the report that the ranks of the armies of
our national independence are crowded with the noblest
of our brethren and the choicest of our youth, who have
rushed to the rescue of the republic, driven by the
impulses of patriotism in obedience to the call of God and
our country. We sympathize with you as you
consecrate everything dear on earth on the altar of
patriotic duty.’ Again:  ‘The antagonism of northern and
southern sentiment on the
<pb id="aughey306" n="306"/>
subject of slavery lies at the root of all the difficulties
which have resulted in the dismemberment of the Federal
Union, and have involved us in the horrors of an
unnatural war.’ In 1861 the southern assembly resolved to
spend half an hour in prayer to Almighty God for his
blessing on these Confederate States. * *  ‘The assembly
met and spent the first half hour in special prayer for the
blessing of God upon the cause of the Confederate States,
according to previous order.’ After many other
deliverances, both political and martial, in 1865, the
southern general assembly, with most remarkable self-complacency,
made this utterance:  ‘Upon no one subject is
the mind of this assembly more clearly ascertained, upon
no one doctrine is there a more solid or perfect agreement
among those whom this assembly represents, than the
non-secular and non-political character of the church of
Jesus Christ.’ It would have been a glorious thing for your
religion if you had not mingled politics with it, for your
politics are of such a character as to impair the worth of
any religion with which they are mixed. Now, colonel,
please to be silent forever hereafter as to the non-political
character of the southern church. How could a Southerner,
sentimentally opposed to human slavery, and who was a
loyal citizen of the United States of America, remain a
member of a church which declared slavery to be a divine
institution, and declared resistance to the government to
be true patriotism?”</p>
        <pb id="aughey307" n="307"/>
        <p>“Well,” said the colonel, “I am willing to argue the
question of secession.”</p>
        <p>To which I replied, “Colonel, I had hoped that that
issue had been buried beyond the possibility of resurrection.”</p>
        <p>“Sir,” said the colonel, “It is mere twaddle for a man to declare
that a state has no right to secede.”</p>
        <p>“Col.,” I replied, “Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, Gen.
Jackson, and many other eminent statesmen, both
northern and southern, believed that a state had not the
right to secede.”</p>
        <p>“I admit that,” said the Col.</p>
        <p>“Well,” replied I, “I prefer their twaddle to that of less lights.”</p>
        <p>The Col. returned to the charge by saying that Virginia
and some of the other states had framed a proviso
granting the right of secession at will before they agreed
to adopt the Federal constitution.</p>
        <p>Said I, “Did the other states agree to the proviso?”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” said the Col., “they did.”</p>
        <p>“Well, sir,” I answered, “is the proviso you speak
of inserted in the constitution of the United States?”</p>
        <p>“No, I believe not,” admitted the Col.</p>
        <p>“Well, sir,” I said, “if it is not written in the
constitution of the United States, it is not of any
binding force. But if, as you admit, it is not in the
constitution of the United States, where is it?”</p>
        <p>The Col. replied that he did not know.</p>
        <p>“No, nor does any one else know,” said I. “Your
statement is a mere figment of the imagination. But
<pb id="aughey308" n="308"/>
when,” I continued, “will you try to exercise this right of
secession again.”</p>
        <p>Col. Edgar answered, “I am as far as any one from
ever wishing to try it again.”</p>
        <p>“Col.,” said I, “it may not do much harm to hold the
sentiments you entertain, merely as abstract theories,
but the moment you attempt to carry them out in action
and give them a practical bearing, there will be ten
million bayonets ready to prevent your rebellious
designs against our national integrity.”</p>
        <p>“Sir,” said the Col., “one who entertains and expresses
the sentiments you do would not be welcomed
as a resident of this section.”</p>
        <p>“Sir,” said I, “I have no intention of settling
here. I suffered once, for the expression of loyal
sentiments, the loss of all things temporal except life,
and saved that only by the skin of my teeth.”</p>
        <p>I said, “Good-bye, Col.,” and started to leave. To my
surprise the colonel then cordially invited me to visit the
female seminary, at 9 o'clock the next morning, and to
take part in the opening exercises. I accepted his
invitation. At the close of the opening exercises, which I
conducted, the colonel asked me to address the young
ladies. I complied with his request. I then accepted an
invitation to dine with the colonel, who, as long as I
remained in Bowling Green, treated me with marked
courtesy. I think that he regretted his brusqueness. He
met me on Saturday, and told me that on to-morrow he
must hear his old friend and former pastor preach, Rev.
<figure id="ill23" entity="aughey308"><p>THE COLORED ELDER.</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey309" n="309"/>
Dr. R. K. Smoot, of the state of Texas, but that if I should
preach on the succeeding Sabbath he would hear me. In
the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">bellum</hi></foreign> and 
<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">ante bellum</hi></foreign> 
days the expression of
sentiments such as I expressed would have met with dire
punishment. Now the penalty is comparatively light. The
world moves. I visited the graded public schools of
Bowling Green. Prof. Wylie, of Danville, Ind., was the
very efficient principal. This school was conducted as
successfully as our best northern schools, but the public
school system of the state I found to be as yet quite
inefficient. Progress, however, is being made.
Educational interests move slowly in the South. A few
years ago there were no public schools, and it requires
time to create a popular sentiment that will give them a
high degree of efficiency.</p>
        <p>The question of reunion is before the general
assemblies of both the northern and southern
Presbyterian churches. That reunion is a consummation
devoutly to be wished, is patent to all who have made
this subject a matter of investigation. The southern
church was born of rebellion. Her prominent ministers
entered the arena of politics, and in sermons, magazine
articles, and stump speeches urged the states to secede
in order to the strengthening and perpetuation of the
institution of slavery. After their success in inducing
many states to plunge madly into the maelstrom of
secession and treason, they effected the organization of
the general assembly of the Presbyterian church in the
Confederate States of America,
<pb id="aughey310" n="310"/>
thus linking with their church the name of the rebellious
usurpation, recognizing it as a government to which
allegiance was due, praying for its success in overcoming
the Federal authority and in establishing a permanent
slave-holding confederacy founded upon the total
subversion of the rights of man. Rev. Dr. J. H. Thornwell,
of S. C., was a leader in the secession movement. I have
heard Rev. Dr. B. M. Palmer, Revs. Carothers and
Gaston, of Mississippi, Mitchell, of Alabama, J. N.
Waddell, of Tenn., and many other Presbyterian
ministers, all from the pulpit, and some of them from the
platform, discuss all the phases of the secession
movement, urging the people to favor secession, as the
institution of slavery could not otherwise be extended
and perpetuated. This church, in its origin, history,
ecclesiastical deliverances, and affiliations, is so
associated with and allied to slavery and secession that
nothing but union with the northern church can give her
proper confidence and standing with the loyal people of
the United States of America. The southern church
would, by reunion, be made national. It is now territorially
confined to the former slave states. By union many weak
churches would become strong and able for self-support,
through the coalescing of contiguous congregations. We
would no longer hear of the northern branch and the
southern branch of the Presbyterian church. The schism
would be at an end, and our glorious church would no
longer be sectional but national, her boundaries being
coterminous
<pb id="aughey311" n="311"/>
with the republic, and her evangelizing influences would
speedily be quadrupled in their efficiency. The
majority of the southern branch would not, if they could,
re-establish slavery, and they regard the secession idea
as no longer tenable, and in every way they give their
adhesion to principles made the supreme law of the land
by the stern legislation of war.</p>
        <p>There are a few bourbons in the southern branch who
are unable to forget anything or to learn anything.
These bitterly oppose reunion. Did the majority of the
southern ministers hold the sentiments of this factious
minority, reunion would be the height of folly and
madness. “How could two walk together unless they
are agreed?” at least as far as essentials are concerned.
A committee appointed by the minority of the Southern
General Assembly dissenting from reunion have published an
“open letter,” purporting to be the views of the protestants
against reunion. Those who hold the opinions couched in the
open letter have not been reconstructed, and would be a
discordant element in the reunited church. They hold
views that could not be tolerated by the northern branch,
principles, both political and scientific, so contrary to
reason, truth, and justice, that were they, as citizens, to
attempt to give them a practical bearing, another civil war
would speedily ensue. Dr. W. C. Gray, editor of<hi rend="italics"> The Interior,</hi>
says: “Rev. Dr. R. L. Dabney (one of the committee) is constantly
howling,  ‘They have robbed us of our lawful bondmen.’ He doubtless
desires the return of the stolen
<pb id="aughey312" n="312"/>
property. Nothing but full restitution and a humble apology
would satisfy him. This would restore human slavery to
the South.” The Presbyterian <hi rend="italics">Banner</hi> thus speaks of this
unreconstructed rebel: “Rev. Dr. Dabney seems unable to
accept the new situation in the South, and is not in good
temper with the dispensations of Providence. He does not
believe that the southern people have any direct
responsibility in the education of the colored people. For
a man of Dr. Dabney's gifts and attainments to write such
stuff as this is most strange. ‘The northern people have
everywhere proclaimed that the bible teaches the
abolition dogma, and advised them not to listen to any
bible which does not. But we know that our bible
condemns the abolition dogma. We cannot, we dare not
falsify God's truth, even for the amiable purpose of
getting access to the negro minds. Those who have
obstructed us by falsifying and misrepresenting God's
word, must bear the responsibility.’ This accords with
the view adopted by the Southern General Assembly in
1865, just after the suppression of armed rebellion and the
enfranchisement of the slaves, which was as follows:  ‘The
lawfulness of the relation’ of slavery,  ‘as a question of
social morality and of scriptural truth, has lost nothing of
its importance.’ While the war was progressing
the southern branch declared it to be the peculiar mission
of their church to conserve the institution of slavery.” As
this cannot be done till the South becomes strong
enough to re-enslave her “lawful bondmen,”
<pb id="aughey313" n="313"/>
taken violently from her by “robbers,” it seems
to be her duty to perpetuate the doctrine of slavery as
one of “social morality and scriptural truth,” till it can be
restored to its pristine vigor.</p>
        <p>This committee has decided that the question,
“whether the allegiance of the citizen is primarily due to
the state or to the central authority,” was not determined
by our forefathers.</p>
        <p>There is probably not a minister in the northern
church who believes that political deliverance.
All regard it as a political heresy fraught with danger, and as
a treasonable view necessary to be suppressed <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">vi et
armis</hi></foreign>, if any practical bearing should be given it in the
interests of state sovereignty and secession.</p>
        <p>We believe that our fathers who framed the Federal
Constitution spoke with no uncertain sound, and that
they formed a “perpetual union,” which it was treason to
attempt to dissever. Rev. Dr. R. K. Smoot, one of the
committeemen, was pastor of the church at Bowling
Green, Ky., at the commencement of the war. He was a
virulent and violent secessionist, and did all he could to
harass and annoy the members of his church who were
loyal to the government. One of whom, in his rebellious wrath,
<sic corr="challenged">challanged</sic> to mortal combat in the duel, according to the
southern code of honor. Save the mark! At
last he sent all of them letters of dismission, for which
they had not applied, and thus drove them out of the
church. While Mr. Smoot was a student at Hanover
College, Indiana, he was repeatedly guilty
<pb id="aughey314" n="314"/>
of the infraction of the college laws. The faculty often
found it necessary to admonish and reprove him, but he
remained obdurate and incorrigible. At length, Rev. Drs.
Edwards and Crowe, the president and vice president of
the college, summoned Mr. Smoot into their presence and
advised him to send in his declinature longer to receive
aid as a beneficiary of the education fund, as they
deemed him unworthy of it. Mr. Smoot wished to know if
this course were compulsory upon him. They replied that
in case he declined to accept their advice, compulsory
measures would be enforced. Mr. Smoot became quite
angry, and affirmed that this was persecution on account
of his southern birth, and in his wrath he declared that he
hoped that the time would speedily come when, in civil
war, he would be able with his own hands to discharge a
cannon loaded with grape and canister for the
destruction of his northern enemies, and for securing
southern independence and freedom from northern
domination. Circumstances pointed very strongly to Mr.
Smoot as the assassin of a Federal picket at Bowling
Green, Ky., while that city was in the occupancy of the
Federal army in the civil war.</p>
        <p>A young man was robbed of $2,000 at a hotel in
Louisville, Ky. Dr. Smoot roomed with him at the time,
and many believed that the reverend Dr. was the robber,
as circumstances very strongly implicated him in the
robbery. The minority brethren should have chosen a
man of less unsavory reputation to serve on their
committee.
<pb id="aughey315" n="315"/>
The committee state that, “It cannot be denied that
God has divided the human race into several distinct
groups, for the sake of keeping them apart.” They also
affirm that the “differentiation through color and other
physical characteristics are fixed by the hand of God,
since science fails to trace the natural causes by which it could be produced and
history is silent as to the time when these changes.
occurred.” Thus making their own ignorance the basis
and proof of a false, odious, and indefensible theory.</p>
        <p>Do they really believe in the unity of the human race?</p>
        <p>Again, the committee inform us that wherever the
people belonging to different groups have practiced
amalgamation, the result has been a stock inferior in
quality to both the factors which sunk their superior
virtues in an emasculated progeny. That in Mexico and
South America, where the people of different groups
have intermingled and thus enfeebled their offspring, we
see slipping from their hands the reins of power.</p>
        <p>These last two propositions are presented as
arguments to establish the first.</p>
        <p>Many believe that science does trace the causes of
difference in the races of men. They regard it as due to
climate, food, and mode of life. They would be loth to
accept without argument the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">ipse dixit</hi></foreign> of the committee
that it is due to the miraculous interposition of
Almighty God, in order to create, propagate,
<pb id="aughey316" n="316"/>
and perpetuate superior and inferior races of men. Rev.
David Livingstone, who spent many years in the heart of
Africa, and whose subjection to climatic influence and
food and mode of life were not different from that of the
natives, though a Scotchman of fair complexion when he
entered the Dark Continent, had become, when found by
Stanley, as bronzed and dark as the Makololos whom he
had rescued from the degradation of heathenism. Had he
taken his wife and children with him to the land of Ham,
after a few generations they would have become veritable
negroes. There are many black Jews in Africa. Climate,
food, and mode of life have rendered them
undistinguishable from the negro.</p>
        <p>As to the Mexicans and South Americans losing
power because of their mixed blood, the committee is at
fault, not knowing the facts of history. The Spanish
people are of unmixed blood. Their colonial possessions,
one after another, in Mexico and South America, were,
after fierce and bloody struggles on the ensanguined
plains of battle, wrested from the Spaniards by the mixed
races. Does this prove their inferiority?</p>
        <p>Many southern people pride themselves on being
lineal descendants of Pocahontas. Are her descendants
inferior in virtue or intelligence? The Randolphs, the
Bakers, the Oswalds, the Castlemans prove their
superiority. Are the mulattoes, the quadroons, and the
octoroons, who are found by millions in the South, an
emasculated progeny inferior to
<pb id="aughey317" n="317"/>
their mothers (their fathers are supposed to be
unknown)? Their superior intelligence disproves the
theory of the committee. Must we receive as truth all
those political and scientific fallacies in order to induce
them to unite with us? The southern church united with
the new school body in the South on the same basis of
union as that which served as the basis of union—the
standards pure and simple—between the old and new
school Presbyterians in the North, and yet this latter
union is mentioned, by this committee, as an argument
against reunion with the northern church.</p>
        <p>When I lived in the South, in the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">ante bellum</hi></foreign> days,
the fact that the races of men were marked by diversities
of color and physical characteristics was not made an
objection to miscegenation, as that was, and still is,
practiced to a fearful extent in the South, but it was
advanced by the southern people as an unanswerable
and irrefragable argument in favor of the right and duty
of the superior to reduce to slavery the inferior race. The
committee declare: “At the first we hoped to hold him
(the negro) in connection with us in our churches, as in
the old time we were accustomed to worship together in
the house of God. We were slow in coming to his
ground, when under the race instinct he demanded a
church and ministry of his own.” Just prior to this they
have said, or rather asked the question: “How can two
races be brought together in nearly equal numbers in
those confidential and sacred relations which belong to the
<pb id="aughey318" n="318"/>
ministry of the Word without entailing that personal
intimacy between ministry and people which must end in
the general amalgamation of discordant races.”</p>
        <p>Yes, there may be something of excellent reasoning in
this. In the old time you were accustomed to worship
together in the house of God, and if that “personal
intimacy in those confidential and sacred relations” was
the true cause of that amalgamation which has resulted
in changing the hue of more than half of your former
slaves, it is well to let them have churches and a ministry
of their own.</p>
        <p>The committee speak as if they were in extreme peril,
and as if, were the colored people to worship with the
white people in nearly equal numbers, general
amalgamation could not be avoided and would be the
result in the near future. Your danger seems imminent, and
we would not urge you to unite with the northern church
if the result would be a general stampede of your
daughters into the arms of the negro. It is your strong
argument, your sheet anchor to keep your barque from
drifting out upon the stormy ocean of reunion. Your
wayward sons and daughters must be restrained. At least,
there must be no temptation thrown in their way to induce
them to gratify their perverted tastes and prurient desires.
It might be well to elaborate additional arguments so that
this impending calamity may be averted. Our northern
missionaries and teachers who are laboring among the
colored people of the South, though outnumbered by
them twenty to one, are in no peril.
<pb id="aughey319" n="319"/>
No case of amalgamation has ever occurred among them.
Their tastes and instincts will ever prevent a
calamity so deplorable. I think it possible that the “race
instinct,” which has led the colored people to go out
from you, will interpose a barrier to amalgamation, and
were you to woo them, I think you would not succeed in
winning them back to worship with you as in the old
time, therefore your children will be measurably safe.</p>
        <p>Re-union, desirable as it may be in certain aspects,
could not be entertained for a moment were the majority
of the southern people found to hold the political,
scientific, and absurd theories of the committee.</p>
        <p>The northern branch has not made a deliverance in
regard to evolution. The southern branch has decided, at
least in part, this vexed scientific question. Though they
will doubtless admit that the body of Eve, the mother of
all living, was made of ossified dust, yet they have
decided ecclesiastically that the body of Adam was made
of dust inorganic. They may deem it their duty in the near
future to decide the mooted question whether the wife of
Moses was an Ethiopian of the negro race, or the
question, “If the northern people will not restore to us our ‘lawful
bondmen,’ what means would we be justifiable in using to
compel them to restore to us those human chattels of
which they have robbed us, that we may hold them in
bondage as we did in the old time.” It is true, as the
Master teaches, that Christians are the
<pb id="aughey320" n="320"/>
light of the world and the salt of the earth. The truth of
the gospel is to work like leaven until the whole structure
of society is changed. But there is need of earnest hearts
and strong hands to accomplish this result. The purpose
is to permeate every department of human life, and men
are the agency. Wherever there is iniquity the church is
summoned to cry aloud and spare not. When there is a
sword in the land the danger must be exposed. Who, if
not the church, shall dissect and denounce corruption?
Who, if not the church, shall expound to the state
the principles of righteousness, and emphasize the
importance of morality in law? The function of the state is
comparatively limited, but the sphere of the church
covers the whole domain of morals and religion. The
Bible is dogmatic against iniquity. It is the duty of the
church to reprove sin wherever found, and strive for its
eradication, whether in the domain of science or politics,
whether in the state, the family, or the individual. The
claim of the southern church is, that it is within its
province “to conclude nothing but that which is
ecclesiastical.” Its theory and practice are diametrically
opposed to each other. Its purely political deliverances
are numerous, and they were all made in the interests of
slavery and secession.</p>
        <p>Rev. Dr. R. L. Dabney was a member and prominent
leader of the synod of Virginia, which, in October, 1861,
made this deliverance: “<hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That the assertion of
their rights and separate independence by the
Confederate States is necessary and righteous.
<pb id="aughey321" n="321"/>
* * * * * * The question of civil allegiance
has been properly determined as to us by the commonwealth
of which we are citizens.” Now he joins in
condemning the northern church for “a palpable
invasion of the province of the state,” in deciding a
political question. O, consistency, thou art a jewel!</p>
        <p>The <hi rend="italics">Philadelphia Presbyterian</hi>, of April 21, 1888,
noticing the southern digest, among other things,
says: “It is somewhat amusing to see that the southern
assembly in 1861 approved a clause in the
constitution of the Confederate States.”</p>
        <p>From the synod of North Carolina, in 1861, we
have this deliverance: “<hi rend="italics">Resolved</hi>, That the synod sits
appointed by her Divine Head as a witness for the right
and for truth, truly sympathizes with the state and with
the Confederate States in their present righteous
struggle, and cordially approves their action in asserting
and maintaining their sovereignty and severing the ties
that bound us to the late United States of America.”</p>
        <p>From the presbytery of Charleston, July 24,1861, we
have this deliverance: “We do most heartily, with the full
approval of our conscience before our Lord God,
unanimously approve the action of the state and people
of the Confederate States of America.”</p>
        <p>When the southern general assembly, which were
holding their sessions in Baltimore in 1888, adjourned to
Philadelphia to unite with the northern general
assembly in the centennial celebration of the organization
<pb id="aughey322" n="322"/>
of the general assembly in 1788, Rev. Dr. Bullock, the
moderator of the southern assembly, repeatedly alluded to
the southern church by the appellation of the Presbyterian
church of North America. He thus seemed to
ignore the United States of America. Was this designed
or accidental? Is it true that the name of the southern
church has been changed so as no longer to recognize
the United States? Has the southern branch ever made a
loyal deliverance since their secession and slavery
deliverances, or during their existence as a separate
organization?</p>
        <p>The Northern General Assembly of 1888, adopted the
following resolution, <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">nemine contradicente</hi></foreign>:</p>
        <q direct="unspecified">
          <text>
            <body>
              <div1 type="resolution">
                <p><hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> On the near approach of Decoration Day,
the day set apart in memory of those, who, during the
civil war, gave their lives that the union and the country
should not die, this General Assembly desires to put on
record its grateful recognition of the inestimable services, the devotion unto death, of
these heroic patriot soldiers, and our undying attachment
to the great principle for which they fought and died, and
with the great multitude of our fellow-citizens to extend
our prayerful sympathy to those throughout our whole
country to whom this day brings still the memory of
immeasurable bereavement.</p>
                <p>It is probable that a few leaders in the southern
church, if reunion were consummated, would continue a
ceaseless agitation which would embroil the church in
a perpetual turmoil. Many in the South
<pb id="aughey323" n="323"/>
blindly and implicitly follow the lead of those whom they
esteem as “big men.” A few southern politicians (not
statesmen), ambitious as Lucifer, inflamed that very
excitable thing, the southern heart, and precipitated the
rebellion in opposition to the wishes and warnings of the
conservative and loyal majority. A few ecclesiastical
leaders are endeavoring to prevent reunion by threats
of secession from the church if it be approved by the
majority, and by a resort to tactics, subterfuges, and
stratagems, which they will persistently practice in order
to compel the majority to yield to them and make an
unconditional surrender for the sake of peace.</p>
                <p>For these reasons it is probably best to postpone
reunion, at least for another decade, when it is to be
hoped that sentiments and theories and practices so
repugnant and abhorrent to Christians and friends of
stable government and human rights, shall have disappeared
from the southern church. Then they will be
welcomed with open arms and joyful acclamations by the
whole membership of the northern church. For this
blessed consummation let all true Christians ever
devoutly pray. Then will there be indeed a new and
regenerated South, relegating into the gulf
of oblivion the grim, absurd, and barbarous traditions of
the past era, and rising, phoenix-like from her ashes, she
will join with the North and the East and the West with
glad acclaim in the angel's song “Glory to God in the
highest, peace on earth, good will to men.” This will be indeed the golden age,
<pb id="aughey324" n="324"/>
the harbinger of millennial glory, which we trust is soon
to be ushered in in all its fullness and blessedness, to
gladden the hearts of all men everywhere, and to unite in
bonds of sympathy and love all races and kindreds and
tongues and nations to earth's remotest bounds, and to
make them one in Christ Jesus.</p>

        <p>Since the war I have been very kindly and hospitably
received by the southern people while a sojourner among
them. They say, “We will gladly welcome northern
people as citizens, if they will only let politics alone.” I
enquired if that meant that northern people who emigrate
South must refrain from voting and from holding office.
They replied, “That is just what we mean.” Said I, “You
wish us to purchase citizenship at too great a cost. The
exercise of the elective franchise, that badge of freemen,
will not be basely bartered for a ‘mess of pottage’ by the
descendants of revolutionary sires who shed their blood
on many an ensanguined battle field to secure this
priceless boon for themselves and their posterity, to be
enjoyed and exercised till the last moment of recorded
time.”</p>
        <p>The reason assigned for this course is, that if a “free
ballot and fair count” were tolerated it would change the
political complexion of many of the southern states,
notably the states of South Carolina, Mississippi,
<sic corr="Louisiana">Lousiana</sic>, and Florida. The colored people and
“scalawags” in these states outnumber the party in
<pb id="aughey325" n="325"/>
power, and the majority of the northern immigrants would
doubtless join with them and bring about a political
revolution, which, they say, “we must prevent by all the
means that God and nature have placed in our power.”
This is the reason that they contravene the idea of
allowing residents among them of northern birth to vote
or hold office.</p>
        <p>I have found a spirit of intolerance prevailing among
the colored people. If one of their number should vote
with the dominant party he immediately lost caste and
was virtually ostracised. I enquired what punishment
would be inflicted upon a renegade colored man. The
reply I received, which was vociferously applauded, was,
“The women would drive him from the settlement with
switches.” A missionary sent them, who was not of their
party, would not be received as a religious teacher or
minister of the gospel. They are very bitter against the
white people who defraud them and keep them in peon
bondage through the infamous labor contract system, and
who defraud them of the exercise of the elective franchise,
guaranteed them by constitutional amendment. They are
earnestly hoping and praying for deliverance to come.
Every American should resent every insult offered to
humanity, for if the rights of the lowliest are trampled
upon the rights of the highest are not safe.</p>
        <p>The day of vengeance and wrath will come perhaps
much sooner than the southern people are aware.
Many feel as I did, when residing in the Carolinas
<pb id="aughey326" n="326"/>
in 1881 and 1882, that I would be willing, if there
were any hope of ultimate success, to shoulder my
musket, and throwing down the gage of battle, contend to
the bitter end for my God-given and constitutional 
rights of which I was fraudulently deprived,
for I had no more privilege than the darkest African
to vote and have my vote counted if I chose to cast
my ballot against the dominant party.</p>
        <p>Coming events cast their shadows before. This great
crime against the genius of free institutions and the
republican form of government will not long be tolerated.
This stain upon our nation's fair escutcheon will, we
opine, be speedily washed away, and, if necessary, in the
blood of the offenders.</p>
        <p>Before the war I felt certain that slavery was doomed
and near its extinction. The insolence of the slave-holders,
the increasing rigors and barbarities of slavery,
led to the conviction that if God were just and merciful he
would not longer tolerate in his providence an institution
whose victims, numbered by millions, were subjected to
every refinement of cruelty that base men could devise.</p>
        <p>There was an additional evidence that redemption
was drawing nigh in the fact that the prayers of the
oppressed slave for deliverance were daily ascending to
the throne of a prayer hearing and prayer answering God,
and in the knowledge that millions of humane Christian
people, North and South, were fervently imploring God to
hasten the time when Ethiopia should stretch out her
hands to God, when every
<pb id="aughey327" n="327"/>
yoke should be broken and the oppressed become free,
God thus pouring out the spirit of grace and of
supplication upon his people, putting it into their hearts
to pray mightily for the deliverance of the bondmen, the
benign spirit of the age, the quickened conscience of the
wise and good, the increase of an enlightened public
opinion, the wide dissemination of Gospel truth, the signs
of the times, and the fulfillment of prophecy, indicating
the probably speedy approach of the millennium—all, all
conspiring to the overthrow of this horrid, murderous Moloch;
and these elements of its destruction were observable by even the
least acute observer.</p>
        <p>It is now evident that the moral sense of the nation is
aroused to a true view of the enormity of the crime
against civil liberty, practiced with bold effrontery, and
thus far with impunity, by the southern
people, in preventing, by fraud, intimidation, and
violence, a free expression of political opinion at the
polls by those who have a constitutional right to exercise
the elective franchise. The end is near of this
great wickedness. Thousands have been murdered at the
polls when endeavoring to exercise the rights of
American freemen. Had an American citizen who had
committed no crime lost his life at the hands of Austrians
or Mexicans our government would have
speedily instituted a court of inquiry, or have sent a
minister plenipotentiary with full powers to investigate
the outrage, and see to it that the perpetrators
of the crime were brought to speedy and condign
<pb id="aughey328" n="328"/>
punishment; or, failing in this, through the escape of the
criminals, the nation whose citizens were the guilty
parties would be held responsible for the act which
could only be atoned for by an humble apology and
ample reparation.</p>
        <p>In the South many, very many, of our best and truest
men, true to moral principle and loyal to the government,
have fallen by the hands of ex-Confederates for this
reason and no other, that they were loyal and patriotic—
and the government has been silent. Occasionally
congress has gone so far as to appoint a committee of
investigation. The murderers were proven guilty, but
they were not brought to justice, and when the
committee returned to make their report to congress
these southern murderers slew all who had as witnesses
testified against them. What impotence on the part of
congress. Can they expect any more witnesses to
criminate themselves (in Southern estimation), by
testifying against the murderers of loyal men? Many
thousands of loyal men have been murdered since the
war. Congress has discovered the murderers in
numerous instances, but not one of them has been
punished, and with impunity they have been suffered to
continue their murders by putting to death all who
testified against them before the congressional
committee. What the object of the congressional
investigation was is a mystery difficult of solution.
Sometime, “in the course of human events,”
congressional investigation may be undertaken with
some object in view worthy of the great
<pb id="aughey329" n="329"/>
nation whose interests they have been chosen to subserve,
and of the citizens of the republic, whose lives
and property they should protect by the exercise of
all the powers vested in them, whether the endangered
persons are citizens of South Carolina or Massachusetts,
and without regard to their “race, color, or previous
condition of servitude.”</p>
        <p>Land of great fertility can be purchased in the
Gulf states at from two to ten dollars per acre. In
the near future the attention of northern people will
be attracted to this cheap and productive land, when
an exodus from the North to this genial clime, of
gigantic proportions, will be inaugurated. Within
five years after its commencement ten million robust,
energetic Yankees, with all the vim and perseverance
of that people will be precipitated upon the South.
They will come with their churches, their free schools,
and their higher educational institutions. They will
come with their innate ideas in regard to civil liberty
and human rights. And as iconoclasts they will,
with irresistible might, destroy the idols of the southern
oligarchs, and establish and cherish civil and religious
liberty in its true and highest sense. They
will coalesce with the loyal element of the South,
thus making it at once dominant politically and
ecclesiastically. Then, portraits of the arch traitors,
Jeff Davis, and Gen. R. E. Lee, and Stonewall
Jackson, <hi rend="italics">et alii.</hi>, will no longer be found adorning
the walls of southern parlors. The portraits of patriots
will supersede them. Histories of the war, lauding
<pb id="aughey330" n="330"/>
treason and arguing in favor of the treasonable
principles underlying the “lost cause,” will be driven
from circulation, and thus the minds of the rising
generation of southern youth will no longer be poisoned
by them. Monuments erected to commemorate
the perfidious acts of hostility against the government
by perjured rebels will be suffered to fall into
decay, or will be removed and destroyed. The
southern papers would then be compelled to be loyal,
and in their utterances give no uncertain sound.</p>

      <div1 type="chapter">
        <p>The notorious Col. Smith, under the <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">nom de plume</hi></foreign>
of “Bill Arp,” thus writes in the weekly Atlanta
<hi rend="italics">Constitution</hi> of Jan. 3, 1888: “The northern man
ought to say: ‘Oh! well, those people down south
thought they were right, and they are just as patriotic
as we are. * * * Let us begin to pension
their soldiers, just as we pension ours. In fact we
ought to pay them something for their slaves. England
paid for hers when they were set free, and
Gladstone, that great and good man, got three hundred
thousand dollars for his, and our southern
brethren are just as good as Gladstone. * * The
South is looming up, and she will come to the front
in a few years. She is solid and always will be,”
etc. Pension the soldiers of the defunct Southern
Confederacy, that military usurpation which marshaled
its millions to subvert the government purchased
for us at infinite cost by our revolutionary
sires! Forbid it, Almighty God! Forbid it,
heaven! The servants of the devil might as well
<pb id="aughey331" n="331"/>
make this demand of the judge in the great judgment day:
“Reward us as well as those upon the right hand. We
served your enemy, the devil. We promoted his interest
with fidelity, but heaven has triumphed over us and we
found the devil, our lord, a bad paymaster. In his service
we have lost all. We staked all we possessed upon the issue of the
contest, the supernal powers have triumphed over the infernal,
and all is lost. Do thou pay us, even as thou payest thy loyal servants, many of
whom at the bidding of our master, the devil, we put to
death, and we would have destroyed them all if it had
been possible for us to compass their destruction. It is
true we have never repented nor confessed that we erred in choosing
the service of the devil, and in aiding and abetting his warfare against heaven. But we
are in a sad plight. Do thou compensate us for the losses
we have incurred in our attempt to subvert thy throne.”</p>
        <p>Yes, Bill Arp, you ought to be paid. You fought
against the government in the interest of human
bondage. You strove to sever the Union cemented with
the blood of our patriot fathers. In mistaken clemency the
government spared the lives of the whole rebellious
horde, who strove to raze it to its
foundations. Yes, you ought to have been paid long
ago, and if you had received your just deserts you
would not now be on terra firma to make a demand so
insolent, and with such brazen-faced effrontery.</p>
        <p>“If all are pardoned, and pardoned as a mere act
<pb id="aughey332" n="332"/>
of clemency, the very substance of government is made
nugatory,” says Isaac Taylor, and, I fear, with truth.
Treason should have been made odious by the death
penalty being visited upon many of the arch
conspirators. Now they demand the reward of loyalty,
and compensation for their slaves. Would Gladstone
have received compensation for his emancipated slaves
if he had rebelled against his government and
inaugurated a civil war to perpetuate slavery? No.
When overcome he would have been blown to pieces
from the mouth of a cannon, as were the leaders of the
Sepoy rebellion, and his property would have been
confiscated, including his slaves.</p>
        <p>If the penalty due to treason had been inflicted upon
many of the chief conspirators in the South, the
survivors would have a more salutary respect for the
government whose mistaken clemency spares their
forfeited lives. Now they live to make the most insolent
demands. Now they have reached the sublime height of
arrogance and presumption, by asking for the reward of
loyalty and the same compensation as that nobly earned
by those who imperiled their lives in defense of the
government assailed by those minions of treason. What
will be their next demand?</p>
        <p>Let there be more legislation by congress in the
interests of the loyal majority in the South. At least let
congress emancipate this loyal majority from their
disabilities imposed by the disloyal and semi-loyal
elements who bear rule and repress all opposition to
their peculiar modes and acts against the true
<pb id="aughey333" n="333"/>
principles of civil liberty and human rights. Oh!

          <head>THE SOUTHERN LOYALISTS.</head>
          <p>Col. Benj. H. Grierson, of the 6th Illinois cavalry, with
his regiment, together with the 7th Ill. and the 2d Iowa,
by order of Gen. U. S. Grant, made his famous raid in April, 1863, from LaGrange,
Tennessee, through Mississippi to Baton Rouge, La. As a
result of his operation Gen.. Grierson writes: “The
strength of the rebels has been overestimated.
They have neither the arms nor the resources we have
given them credit for. Passing through their country I
found thousands of good Union men who were ready
and anxious to rally round the old flag whenever it was
possible. I could have brought away a thousand with me
who were anxious to come—men whom I found
fugitives from their homes, hid in swamps and forests
where they were hunted like wild beasts by conscripting
officers with blood-hounds.”</p>
          <p>Pollard says: In the last periods of the war the
demoralization of the Confederacy was painfully
apparent. Rich and powerful citizens managed to
<pb id="aughey334" n="334"/>
escape the conscription—it was said in Richmond that it
was easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle
than for a rich man to enter Camp Lee. But the rigor of the
law did not spare the poor and helpless, and the complaint
was made in the Confederate Congress that even destitute
cripples had been taken from their homes and confined in
the conscription camps without reference to physical
disability so conspicuous and pitiful. It was not unusual
to see at the railroad stations long lines of squalid men
with scraps of blankets in their hands, or small pine boxes
of provisions, or whatever else they might snatch in their
hurried departure from their homes, whence they had been
taken almost without a moment's notice and ticketed for
the various camps of instruction in the Confederacy. In
armies thus recruited desertions were the events of every
day. The conscript, constantly on short rations,
sometimes without a scrap of meat, and frequently in a
condition bordering on absolute starvation, hearing
constantly of destitution at home, and being distressed
with the sufferings of his family, was constantly devising
plans of escape that he might go to their relief. It was
estimated in 1864 that the conscription would put more
than 400,000 men in the field. Scarcely one-fourth of this
number were found under arms when the close of the war
tore the veil from the thin lines of Confederate defence.
Thousands of Confederate soldiers were sent by the
Confederate government to engage with packs of blood-hounds in the
<pb id="aughey335" n="335"/>
hunt for deserters and conscripts, who, when caught,
would desert again at the first favorable opportunity.
Thus the army was depleted. The great majority of these
conscripts and deserters were Unionists. They hated the
Confederate cause with a perfect hatred. Pollard writes in
his history: Much has been said of the sufferings,
persecutions, humiliations, and spoliations inflicted
upon Union men in the South, but when the period arrives for a dispassionate
examination of the real facts, the reader of history will
be amazed at the moderation of the southern people,
more especially of the Confederate government toward
a class of persons capable of so much mischief in a
society threatened by imminent and fearful peril from
within and without. He states as an offset that a system
of terror was established in the North, where public
sentiment was unanimous as against the South; opinions
only differing as to the best means of reducing the
distant rebellion. This system of terror he asserts could
only be warranted in the South. The following letter is a
specimen of the truculent hatred of the southern
secessionist toward the Unionist:</p>

          <p>The white Unionists suffered the loss of all things,
and for them there is no redress. The Government
will not pay for their property destroyed or confiscated
by the rebels, nor will they grant them a pension for
loss of health caused by their incarceration
in rebel prisons, and although many have lost their lives
at rebel hands, their families receive no pension. They do
not complain of this neglect, but the survivors rejoice in
the subversion of rebellion, and feel themselves more
than compensated for all their losses by its overthrow.
In one settlement in North Carolina there lived a large
number of unconditional Union men. Twelve of these
men were forced into
<pb id="aughey337" n="337"/>
the army by the conscripting officers. Muskets were
given them, but every man of them refused to touch the
weapons. Every conceivable insult and outrage were
heaped upon them. They were starved, tied up and
whipped; still they remained firm to their conscientious
convictions. Finally the muskets were strapped to their
bodies. One of these men was singled out as especially
obnoxious, and whipped unmercifully. The officer in
charge was lawless and brutal, and on one occasion
ordered him to be shot as an example to others. He called
out a file of men to shoot him. While his executioners
were drawn up before him, standing within twelve feet of
their victim, the latter, raising his eyes to heaven and
elevating his hands, cried out in a loud voice: “Father,
forgive them, they know not what they do.” Instantly
came the order to fire. But instead of obeying it the men
dropped their muskets and refused, declaring that they
could not kill such a man. This refusal so enraged the
officer that he knocked the victim down and then strove
repeatedly to trample him to death under his horse's feet.
But the animal persistently refused to step over his
prostrate body. In the end they were marched with the
rebel army to Gettysburg. In that battle they remained entirely
passive, fired no shot, and trusted in God for preservation.
Very early in the action the officer referred to was killed.
These men, all unhurt, were taken prisoners and sent to
Fort Delaware. Here, by accident, it  became known in Philadelphia that
<pb id="aughey338" n="338"/>
a number of Friends were among the captured, and two
members of the society went down to inquire into the
circumstances, but they were refused permission to see
them. They went immediately to Washington, and there
obtained an order for their discharge, conditioned upon
their taking an affirmation of their allegiance. This
opened their prison door. The affirmation made, these
martyrs for conscience's sake were released, and coming
to Philadelphia were cared for by the Friends of that
hospitable city.</p>
          <p>In a memorial addressed to President Lincoln by Union
officers who were prisoners, occurs this statement in
regard to the prisoners of war at Andersonville: “They
are fast losing hope and becoming utterly reckless of
life. Numbers, crazed by their sufferings, wander about in
a state of idiocy. Others deliberately cross the dead line
and are remorselessly shot down.”</p>
          <p>The following is an extract from an official report by
Col. D. T. Chandler, formerly an inspector general in the
Confederate service, addressed to Col. Chilton, at
Richmond, Va., under date of Aug. 5, 1864:</p>
          <p>“My duty requires me respectfully to recommend
a change in the officer in command of the post,
Brigadier General J. H. Winder, and the substitution in
his place of some one who unites both energy and
good judgment with some feelings of humanity and
consideration for the welfare and comfort (so far as
is consistent with their safe keeping) of the vast number
<pb id="aughey339" n="339"/>
of unfortunates placed under his control; some one
who at least does not advocate, deliberately and in cold
blood, the propriety of leaving them in their present
condition until their number has been sufficiently reduced
by death to make the present arrangements suffice for
their accommodation, who will not consider it a matter of
self-laudation, boasting that he has never been inside the stockade—<hi rend="italics">a place of
horrors</hi> which it is difficult to describe, and which is a
disgrace to civilization—the condition of which he might,
by the exercise of a little energy and judgment, even with
the limited means at his command, have considerably
improved.”</p>
          <p>The Confederate authorities at Richmond were thus
officially notified of these atrocities, and yet took no
action. The conclusion seems inevitable that they fully
approved the measures adopted by the commanding
officers at Andersonville, and also at Belle Isle, which
was so immediately under their eyes
that ignorance could not possibly be pleaded.</p>
          <p>In the southern prison pens where our soldiers and
Unionists were incarcerated, diarrhœa ground out their
bowels, scurvy cut off their extremities, rheumatism
racked their bones, the sun parched their skin,
the nights chilled their blood, the storms beat upon them
until their garments looked like the clothing of a
scarecrow, and the silent frost stole upon many a
one and held his eyes closed so tightly that the morning
sun could not warm to life.</p>
          <p>John Beman, a watchman employed on a southern
<pb id="aughey340" n="340"/>
steamboat, who had a family in Boston, Mass., was
arrested by a vigilance committee for the expression of
opinions loyal to the United States government. The
committee proposed to forgive him if he took an
oath to support the southern states. He indignantly
repelled the proposition and said that he would die first,
when they immediately hanged him.</p>
          <p>The congressional committee on the conduct of the
war report that Major Bradford, who was captain at Fort
Pillow, while being conveyed from Brownsville to
Jackson was taken by five rebels, one an officer, led
about fifty yards from the line of march and deliberately
murdered, in view of all those assembled. He fell
instantly, pierced by three musket balls, even while
asking that his life might be spared, as he had fought
them manfully and deserved a better fate. The motive
assigned for the murder of Major Bradford was the fact
that, although a native of the South, he remained loyal to
his government. Major Bradford had witnessed the
murder in cold blood of three hundred of his fellow-prisoners
after their surrender at Fort Pillow.</p>
          <p>Gen. Wm. T. Sherman to the mayor of Atlanta: “I
myself have seen, in Missouri, Kentucky, Tennessee,
and Mississippi, hundreds and thousands of women and
children fleeing from your armies and desperadoes,
hungry and with bleeding feet. Now that war comes home
to you you feel very differently. You deprecate its
horrors, but did not feel them when you sent car loads of
soldiers and ammunition and

moulded shell and shot to carry war into Kentucky and
Tennessee and Mississippi, to desolate the homes of
hundreds of thousands of good loyal people, who only
ask to live in peace at their old homes and under the
government of their inheritance.”</p>
          <p>Captain Phillips, who captured Florence, Alabama,
says, in his official report: “We have met the most
gratifying proofs of loyalty everywhere, across the
Tennessee, and in North Mississippi and North
Alabama, where we visited. Most affecting instances
greeted us hourly. Men, women, and children gathered
in crowds, shouted their welcome, and hailed their
national flag with an enthusiasm there was no mistaking.
It was genuine and heart-felt. They have experienced, as
they related, every possible form of persecution. Tears
flowed down the cheeks of the men as well as of the
women.”</p>
          <p>A British officer, Lieutenant Col. Fremantle, of the Cold
Stream Guards, who made a tour of inspection during the
war, says: “I met Capt.—, of Duff's Cavalry. The captain
was rather a boaster. Some Unionists had crossed the
river to Matamoras, Mexico. This captain had made a raid
across the river and had carried off some of these
 ‘renegadoes,’ one of whom, Montgomery, he had left on
the road to Brownsville. General Bee, a brother of General
Bee who was killed at Manassas, told me that the
Montgomery affair was against his sanction and he was
sorry for it. He said that Davis, another renegado, would
also have been put to death had it not
<pb id="aughey342" n="342"/>
been for the intercession of his wife. Gen. Bee had
restored Davis to the Mexicans. Half an hour after
we left Gen. Bee we came to the spot where Montgomery
had been  <hi rend="italics">‘left,’</hi> and sure enough, about two
hundred yards to the left of the road, we found him.
He had been slightly buried, but his head and arms
were above the ground, his arms tied together, the
rope still round his neck, but part of it still dangling
from a small mosquite tree. Dogs or wolves had
probably scraped the earth from the body, and there
was no flesh on the bones. I obtained this, my first
observation of lynch law, within three hours after
landing in America. About three miles beyond this
we came to Col. Duff's encampment. He is a fine
looking, handsome Scotchman. He received me with
much hospitality. Col. Duff confessed that the
Montgomery affair was all wrong, but he added that
his boys <hi rend="italics">meant well</hi>. I was presented to—, rather
a sinister-looking party, with long yellow hair down
to his shoulders.. This is the man who hanged
Montgomery. We were treated by all the officers
with much consideration. Col. Luckett gave me a
letter to Gen. Van Dorn, whom they consider the
<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">beau ideal</hi></foreign> of a cavalry soldier. They said from
time immemorial the Yankees had been despised by
the Southerners as a race inferior to themselves in
courage and in honorable sentiments. Duff's regiment
is called the Partisan Rangers. They are
armed with carbines and six-shooters. I saw them
come in from a scouting expedition against the Indians,
<pb id="aughey343" n="343"/>
300 miles off. They told me that they were in the
habit of scalping an Indian when they caught him, and
that they never spared one, because the only good
Indian was a dead Indian. This regiment had been employed
in quelling a counter-revolution of Unionists in Texas. Nothing
could exceed the rancor with which they spoke of these renegadoes, as
they called them. When I suggested to some of the
Texans that they might as well bury the body of
Montgomery a little better, they did not at all agree with
me, but said it ought not to have been buried at all, but
left hanging as a warning to others. Col. Duff comes from
Perth. He was one of the leading characters in the
secession of Texas. He said his brother was a banker at
Dunkeld. At the consulate, —, a Texas Unionist, confided
his sentiments to me. On the next evening he came to me
and said he hoped I would not compromise his safety by
revealing to any one the sentiments he expressed the day
before.</p>
          <p>“I attended the evening parade and saw Gen. Bee,
Cols. Luckett, Buchel, Duff, and —. The
latter, who hanged Montgomery, improves upon
acquaintance.</p>
          <p>“Gen. Bee took me for a drive in his ambulance,
and introduced me to Major Leon Smith, who captured
the Harriet Lane. After the Harriet Lane had been
captured she was fired into by the other ships, and
Major Smith told me that his blood being up he sent
the ex-master of the Harriet Lane to Commodore
<pb id="aughey344" n="344"/>
Renshaw, with a message that, unless the firing was
stopped, he would <hi rend="italics">massacre</hi> the captured crew. After
hearing this, Commodore Renshaw blew up his ship
with himself in her. I met Gen. Bankhead Magruder.
He speaks of the Puritans with intense disgust,
and of the first importation of them as <hi rend="italics">‘that pestiferous
crew of the May Flower!’</hi> * * * Mr. Sargent and the judge
finished the gin, and the former being rather drunk
entertained us with a detailed description of his treatment
of a refractory negro girl, which, by his own account
must have been very severe. The distance from
Brownsville to San Antonio is 330 miles. San Antonio is
prettily situated on both banks of the river of the same
name. It contains about 10,000 inhabitants, and is the
largest place in Texas, except Galveston. The houses are
well built of stone, generally one or two stories high. All
have verandas in front. In the neighborhood of San
Antonio one-third of the population is German, and many
of them by no means loyal to the Confederate cause.
They resisted by force of arms, but were settled by Duff's
regiment. I heard a dispute between — and a German militia
general. The latter spoke strongly in disapproval of <hi rend="italics">‘secret or
night lynching.’</hi> In spite of their hanging, shooting, etc., there is much to like
in the southern chivalry.</p>
          <p>“An able-bodied male negro in Texas brings $2,500,
while a well skilled seamstress is worth $3,500. In the
cars I was introduced to General Samuel Houston, the
founder of Texan independence. He
<pb id="aughey345" n="345"/>
told me he was born in Virginia seventy years ago,
that he was United States senator at thirty, and
governor of Tennessee at thirty-six. He emigrated into
Texas in 1832; headed the revolt of Texas, and defeated
the Mexicans at San Jacinto in 1836. He then became President
of the Republic of Texas, which he annexed to the United States in 1845. As
governor of the state in 1860, he had opposed the
secession movement and was <hi rend="italics">deposed</hi>. He is evidently a remarkable
and clever man, and much disappointed at having to subside from his former
grandeur. I was introduced to Col. Chubb, who
served as coxswain to the United States ship Java.
He was guilty of hiring a colored crew at Boston and then coolly
<hi rend="italics">selling</hi> them at Galveston. I was introduced to Major —,
a brother-in-law to the man who had hanged the Unionist, Montgomery.
He spoke with some pride of the exploit of his relative.
An indignant drayman came to complain of a military
outrage. A semi-drunken Texan, of Pyron's regiment, had ordered him
to halt; the latter declining to do so, the Texan fired five shots at him from
his six shooter. Capt. Foster said that the regiment would
probably hang the soldier for being such a<hi rend="italics">disgracefully bad shot.</hi></p>
          <p>“We breakfasted <sic corr="at">a</sic> Huntsville. The Federal
officers captured in the Harriet Lane are confined
in the penitentiary, and are not treated as prisoners
of war. This seems to be the system now with
regard to officers, since the enlistment of negroes by
<pb id="aughey346" n="346"/>
northerners. My fellow-travelers of all classes are much
given to talk about their ‘peculiar institution.’ They do
not attempt to deny that there are many instances of
cruelty, and all seem to be perfectly aware that slavery,
which they did not invent but which they inherited from
us (English), is and always will be the great bar to the
sympathy of the civilized world. I have heard these
words used over and over again.</p>
          <p>I started again by stage for Monroe, La. My
companions were a Mississippi planter, a mad dentist
from New Orleans (called by courtesy doctor), an
old man from Matagorda, buying slaves cheap in Louisiana, a
wounded officer, and a soldier. The soldier was a very
intelligent Missourian, who told me (as others have) that
at the commencement of the troubles both he and his
family were strong Unionists, but the Lincolnites by
using coercion had forced them to take one side or the
other and now there were no more bitter secessionists.
This soldier (Mr. Douglas) was on his way to join Bragg's
army. A Confederate soldier when wounded is not given
his discharge, but is employed at such work as he is
competent to perform. Mr. Douglas is quite lame, but will
be employed at mounted duties or at writing.</p>
          <p>“At a charming little town called Minden, I met an
Englishman, who deplored to me that he had been such a
fool as to naturalize himself, as he was in hourly dread of
conscription. Nearly every man
<pb id="aughey347" n="347"/>
in this part of the country has a military title.
Remarking upon the prevalence of military titles, Gen.
Johnson said, ‘You must be astonished to find how
fond we are of titles, though we are all republicans,
and as we can't get any other sort, we all take military
ones.’ I find the soldiers sober from necessity, as
there is literally no liquor to be got. There is great
indisposition upon the part of the Confederates to
take prisoners, particularly among these wild
Mississippians. One of Henderson's scouts apologized
for bringing in a Yankee prisoner by saying that he
surrendered so quick he couldn't kill him. Gen.
Johnston told me this evening that he had been
wounded ten times. He was the senior officer of the
old army who joined the Confederates, and he
commanded the Virginia army till he was severely
wounded at Seven Pines, called Fair Oaks, by the
Federals. News arrived this evening of the hanging of a
negro regiment with forty Yankee officers. I
attended a review by Gen. Hardee. After the review the
troops were harangued by Bishop Elliott,
in an excellent address, partly religious, partly patriotic.
Col. Richmond gave me the particulars of Gen.
VanDorn's death. He had ravished the wife of Dr.
Peters, and was shot by the aggrieved husband.”</p>
          <p>This, from a southern newspaper indicates the
temper of the times in 1861: “We unhesitatingly
say that the cause of justice and the cause of humanity itself
demands that the black flag shall be unfurled
<pb id="aughey348" n="348"/>
on every field—that extermination and death shall be
proclaimed against the hellish miscreants who persist in
polluting our soil with their crimes. We will stop the
effusion of blood, we will arrest the horrors of war, by
terrific slaughter of the foe, by examples of overwhelming
and unsparing vengeance. When Oliver Cromwell
massacred the garrison of Drogheda, suffering not a man
to escape, he justified it on the ground that his object
was to bring the war to a close, to stop the effusion of
blood, and that it was, therefore, a merciful act on his
part. The South cannot afford longer to trifle. She must
strike the most fearful blows—the war cry of extermination
must be raised.”</p>
          <p>The Nashville (Tenn.) <hi rend="italics">Courier</hi> published this news item:</p>
          <p>“We learn that a squad of twelve men were sent to
Franklin yesterday to arrest some Lincolnites. They had
collected to the number of fifteen at the house of one of
their number, one Bell, and defying the party, fired at them,
killing one man by the name of Lee, and wounding one or two more.
Our men then charged the house and set fire to it, and all the men in it,
it is believed, but two, who escaped, perished in the
conflagration.”</p>
          <p>The act of the Confederate congress for the
suppression of the slave trade was couched in the usual
terms, but contained a provision for dealing with the
negroes found on board the captured vessels, which is
somewhat amusing. “If the vessel is cleared
<pb id="aughey349" n="349"/>
from any port in the United States, the president shall
communicate with any governor of that state, and shall
offer to deliver such negroes to the said state on
receiving a guarantee that the said negroes shall enjoy
the rights and privileges of freemen in such state, or in
any other state of the United States, or that they shall be
transported to Africa and there be set at liberty, without
expense to the government.” The notion of the
Confederate states bargaining with Massachusetts or
Ohio that a negro shall have all the rights and privileges
of a freeman might imply a doubt as to the sincerity of
their professions in behalf of the negro. In default of the
foreign state accepting this offer, the president was
empowered to receive any propositions made for the
transportation of the negroes to Africa by private
persons; should no such philanthropist offer himself, the
president shall cause the said negroes to be sold at
public auction to the highest bidder. This is a sad
declension from the lofty morality of the earlier part of the
clause. This act was passed with entire unanimity by the
Confederate congress.</p>
          <p>Near the close of the war the Confederate congress
called upon the negro for help, offering him his freedom
and a quarter section of government land for his services
as a soldier. But the offer came too late, the rebellion
soon after collapsed. The South, before this, professed
to regard freedom as a curse to the negro and slavery as
a blessing. O! consistency, thou art a jewel.</p>
          <pb id="aughey350" n="350"/>
          <p>The southern leaders had been preparing for years to
destroy the Union. Mr. Keitt, of South Carolina, in the
convention which met to carry the state out of the
Union, said: “I have been engaged in this movement
ever since I entered political life.” Mr. Inglis said, “Most
of us have had this subject under consideration for twenty years.”
Mr. Rhett said, “It is nothing produced by Mr. Lincoln's election
or the non-execution of the fugitive slave law. It is a matter that has
been gathering head for thirty years.”</p>
          <p>Preamble to the Florida ordinance of secession:</p>
          <p>WHEREAS, All hope of preserving the Union upon
terms consistent with the safety and honor of the slave-holding
states has been finally dissipated by the recent
indications of the strength of the antislavery sentiment
of the free states. This compels Florida to secede from
the Union, and to become a sovereign and independent
nation, and that all ordinances heretofore adopted, in so
far as they create or recognize the confederacy of states
called the United States of America are rescinded.</p>
          <p>Stephen A. Douglas said: “The question is, are we to
maintain the country of our fathers or allow it to be
stricken down by those who, when they can no longer
govern, threaten to destroy? What cause, what excuse
do disunionists give us for breaking up the best
government on which the sun of heaven ever shed its
rays? They are dissatisfied with the result of the
presidential election. Did they never get
<pb id="aughey351" n="351"/>
beaten before? Are we to resort to the sword when we get
defeated at the ballot-box? I understand it that the voice of
the people expressed in the mode appointed by the
constitution must command the obedience of every
citizen. They assume, on the election of a particular
candidate, that their rights are not safe in the Union. What
evidence do they present of this? I defy any man to show
any act upon which it is based. What act was omitted to
be done? I appeal to these assembled thousands, that so
far as the constitutional rights of slave-holders are
concerned, nothing has been done and nothing omitted,
of which they can complain. There has never been a time
from the day that Washington was inaugurated first
president of the United States, when the rights of the
southern states stood firmer under the laws of the land
than they do now; there never was a time when they had
not as good cause for disunion as they have to-day. What
good cause have they now that has not existed under
every administration. If they say the territorial question—
now, for the first time, there is no act of congress
prohibiting slavery anywhere. If it be the enforcement of
the laws, the only complaints that I have heard have been
of the too vigorous and too faithful fulfillment of the
fugitive slave law. Then what reason have they? The
slavery question is a mere excuse. The election of Lincoln
is a mere pretext. The present secession movement is the
result of an enormous conspiracy formed more than a year
since, formed by
<pb id="aughey352" n="352"/>
the leaders in the Southern Confederacy more than
twelve months ago. But this is no time for the
detail of causes. The conspiracy is now known.
Armies have been raised, war is levied to accomplish
it. There are only two sides to this question. Every
man must be for the Union or against it. There can
be no more neutrals in this war, only <hi rend="italics">patriots</hi> or
<hi rend="italics">traitors.</hi></p>
          <p>“Thank God, Illinois is not divided upon the
question. I know they expected to present a united
South against a divided North. They hoped that in
the northern states party questions would bring civil
war between democrats and republicans, when the
South would step in with her cohorts, aid one party
to conquer the other, and then make easy prey of the
victors. Their scheme was carnage and civil war in
the North. There is but one way to defeat this. In
Illinois it is being so defeated by closing up the
ranks. I express it as my conviction before God
that it is the duty of every American citizen to rally
around the flag of his country.”</p>
          <p>Gen. Grant says: “In the South no opposition
was allowed to the government which had been set
up. The Union sentiment was thoroughly subdued.”</p>
          <p>In Kentucky Valley, Ala., ten Unionists were
arrested at their homes, taken to a Primitive Baptist
church and tried by the vigilantes, and condemned as
submissionists and as traitors to the Southern Confederacy,
and immediately shot. Their names were: G. W. Castleman,
Eli Paul Manning, Geo. Pentecost,
<pb id="aughey353" n="353"/>
Emory Paden, Rodman Tankersley, Sydney Smith,
John Bunyan, Verner Kaiser Knight, Clay Bonar,
and David Crockett, Jr.</p>
          <p>Like the ferocious tiger when he tastes blood,
they started to arrest Louis Saterthwaite, a noted
Unionist. Upon reaching his cabin they found it
barricaded. They ordered Saterthwaite to open the
door. He refused. Going to the woods they procured
a large log to be used as a battering-ram to
break down the door. As they came within range a
well directed volley from the cabin leveled ten of
these miscreants in the dust. This unexpected defense
caused the assailants to drop their battering-ram
and beat a hasty retreat to an adjoining forest.
Four of their number were killed outright: Joe. Hines,
Sam Kendall, Bill Gaddy, and Josh Blue. The
others managed to crawl into the woods, but Jo
Bardwell, through whose head a buckshot had passed,
died the next day. Saterthwaite had with him five
friends, staunch Unionists, who resolved to sell their
lives as dearly as possible. Their names were Middleton
Walker, John Franklin, Alonzo Winston,
Morris Jefferson, and Pelham Shelby. Upon the
retreat of their enemies they held a council of war
and decided that as soon as the twilight deepened into
night they would make their escape, and abandoning
their homes and families for a time, would follow the
polar star till they reached some Union outpost.
They well knew that the discomfited vigilantes
would soon return with large reinforcements, and
<pb id="aughey354" n="354"/>
they had no hope that mercy would be shown them by
these infuriate demons incarnate. Two days elapsed
before the vigilantes returned. They came five hundred
strong, led by Aaron Bloch, a virulent secessionist, but
such was their dread that they did not dare leave the
woods. At length, the cannon which they had sent for
arrived, and they, with this engine of war, demolished
the cabin without demanding a surrender. But the birds
had flown and were far on their way toward the Federal
lines. A large company for pursuit was organized. Fifty
hounds were secured and put on the trail. For four days
they followed fast. Saterthwaite and his little band of
compatriots had reached the Union lines. The general in
command, kindly granting his request, sent out a large
force of cavalry to bring in the families of these men and
of the ten that were murdered. Six hours after they had
left the camp they heard the loud baying of the blood-hounds,
indicating the near approach of their foes. Concealing
themselves they awaited their advent. Soon they came in
full view and in good range. A well directed
volley emptied many a saddle. They turned and fled.
Pursuit was rapid. Twenty-five prisoners were captured,
and many vigilantes were slain. The families were
reached and brought into the Federal lines and sent
north. As to the twenty-five prisoners, Rufus Curlee,
their leader, was compelled to witness the death by
hanging of twenty-three of the number. Curlee then met
the fate of his confederates in guilt. Gideon Brevoort
<pb id="aughey355" n="355"/>
was recognized by Saterthwaite as a Unionist who was compelled to
join this band of pursuers as a guide, in order to save
his life. He was brought in with them and at once
enlisted in the service of the government in a company
of sappers and miners. He was a man of fine physique,
and of great physical strength. He proved an invaluable
addition to the service. Near the close of the war he was
instantly killed by a rebel sharp-shooter, while engaged
with others in the construction of a pontoon bridge, and was
buried with the honors of war. His comrades erected a
monument to his memory. They confiscated a number of
monuments found in a marble works in a town near
their encampment. Two of their number, marble cutters,
engraved on the monument the following: “In
Memoriam. Died on the field of honor, March 1st, 1865,
Gideon Brevoort, aged 32 yrs. 4 mos. and 15 days.”</p>

                  <p>I have just learned your address. I, too,
made my escape to the Federal lines. When
the tocsin of war sounded I was teaching in Pensacola,
Florida. Teachers and ministers employed in their
vocation were by Confederate law exempt from service
in the army. When the summer vacation of 1861
came I felt that body, soul, and spirit with united
voice demanded rest—a period of absolute freedom
from all secular cares and avocations. The duties of
the class-room had been peculiarly severe and exacting
during the academic year just closed. But the trying
ordeal was passed, and vacation had come. Homer
and Horace, Virgil and Xenophon, Legendre and
Bourdon, Watts and Whately, and all the tomes of
ancient and modern lore were consigned for the time
to the gloomy alcoves of the library, there to rest in
silent companionship till vacation ended and scholastic
duties were resumed.</p>

                  <p>The young 
men have donned their hunting apparel
and hied away to the forest, where the red deer wander,
and to the rivers, where the finny tribes abound, and I,
whither shall I go? The bow that is kept continually in a
high state of tension, and the mind that is never relaxed,
lose elasticity and become permanently impaired. The
environment has a tendency to recall the duties
performed in it, which one wishes wholly to throw off for
a time, and thus the benefits of recreation are
diminished. It is better, therefore, that needful rest be
taken at some place remote from the scenes of labor.
New scenes, new faces, new employments divert the
mind, and call into action other faculties, and give those
that have been overburdened the desired rest. With this
end in view I prepared to leave our classic shades and
hie away to the home of one of my students, whose
warm invitation I felt happy in accepting. On a beautiful
morning, just as the auroral brightness was assuming a
vermilion hue, sure harbinger of coming day, the colored
coachman drove to my door and I was soon outward
bound for the home of Jasper Pettigru, whose hospitable
residence I was never to reach. The oriole, the mocking-bird,
the paroquet flitted from tree to tree, and a great
variety of feathered songsters made the forests vocal
with their harmony, and by the brilliancy of their
plumage encircled our pathway with a halo of glory. One
could readily imagine himself in the enchanted land. The
balmy air, the fragrant flowers, the silvery
<pb id="aughey358" n="358"/>
sparkling waters, the odor-laden breeze, all
contributed to the highest happiness, the most ecstatic
delight of the votaries of pleasure—a crowd of whom were
with me in the diligence. But ever and anon there came
borne upon the unwilling breeze an agonizing sigh,
proceeding from the inmost recesses of a bleeding,
broken heart—a heart crushed by some sorrow too great to
be sustained long and the victim live. I thought perhaps it
is a fugitive slave on the top of the diligence who is being
returned to his master. When we arrived at Daphne, Ala.,
where I intended lodging for the night with an old friend,
Joe Poindexter, an officer got out of the diligence, ordered
a carriage from the livery stable, and obtaining assistance,
took a white man from the top of the stage and placed him
on the rear seat of the carriage. He said this was a state
prisoner whom he was conveying into the presence of
Col. Bonham, at Tensas, to be dealt with as he was
accustomed to deal with all tories. As my friend lived near
Tensas, I mentioned this fact to this man, whose name
was Major Samuel Rodney. Major Rodney said he
would be glad to have me go with him for company. I at
once accepted the proffered favor, having a desire to
assist, if possible, this suffering Unionist. When within
two miles of Tensas we came to the residence of a
gentleman, a friend of Major Rodney, Col. Wardlaw by
name (if my memory is correct). A dance was in progress
at his house, and he insisted upon Major Rodney's
attending the dance. The
<pb id="aughey359" n="359"/>
major said this d—d tory must be delivered tonight to Col.
Bonham. “Can't your friend take him in?” replied the
colonel. “Yes, or I can drive in and return,” said the major.
“You'd miss oceans of fun if you were to do that. Just
send him in and let your friend put the team in the livery
stable at Tensas. I'll send for it in the morning.” I
cordially assented to this arrangement.</p>
                  <p>After driving a few hundred yards I asked my prisoner
to give me his story. He replied that his name was Isaac
Simpson, that he was a Unionist, and supposed that this
would be the last night of his life, as Col. Bonham spared
the lives of no Unionists, and that he would not recant
his opinions to save his life. I replied, “I, too, am a
Unionist.” “Glory to God,” said the prisoner, “then there
is yet hope for me.” “Yes, we will survive or perish
together.” Col. Rodney had given me the key of the
prisoner's manacles. I had no difficulty in liberating him.
There was no road by which to turn off, so we were
compelled to go into Tensas, then bear north, and trust in
God for divine guidance. We drove rapidly, and were far,
very far from Tensas by daylight. Near Shongalo, Smith
Co., Miss., we sold our horses and carriage to a planter
for $500, Confederate money. At Tougaloo, Hinds Co., we
bought suits of clothes in order to conceal our identity.
At Brandon, Miss., we bought tickets for Grand Junction,
Tenn., and without any further special adventures
reached Cairo, Ill., where we both enlisted in the Federal
service.
<pb id="aughey360" n="360"/>
At Brandon I bought a newspaper which gave a
description of us, and offered a large reward for our
capture.</p>
                  <p>Prof. Simpson has never yet been able to correspond
with his family, nor has he heard what may have befallen
them since his arrest; nor have I been able to visit my
student friend for whose hospitable mansion I started in
what appears, because of the thronging events and
various vicissitudes of the past years, to be the “auld
lang syne.” We hope that soon the bottom will fall out
of that rotten old hulk—the Southern Confederacy.</p>

          <p>On April 29, 1877, occurred the cold-blooded
assassination of Judge Chisholm, of Kemper Co., Miss.,
and the killing of his little son and the wounding of his
brave young daughter, aged eighteen, who died of her
wounds soon after. This tragedy, and the fact that every
physician in the place refused to attend upon her dying
father and herself, reveal the
<pb id="aughey361" n="361"/>
state of terrorism which prevailed under the reign of
the “White League” in the South.</p>
          <p>An armed band of two hundred chivalrous white
men attacked this family, and after the brave young
girl had, with her right arm, parried the guns of several
of those defenders of their rights, which were
placed almost against her father's breast, while with
the other arm around her wounded father's neck, she
received a wound which shattered her right hand and
was six times wounded in one of her legs. Her
father at last fell, pierced by eleven balls. He still
lived, and this heroic girl, though fatally wounded
herself, assisted her dying father to their home, a
distance of over one hundred yards. Her younger
brother of thirteen years of age was shot dead while
clinging to his father. Gov. Stone, of Mississippi,
refused to send aid and protection to this distressed
family. The great crime of which Judge Chisholm
was guilty was his staunch adherence to the
government, and his attempt to enforce the laws as sheriff
of the county.</p>
          <p>Near this, Rev. James Pelan, my dear friend and
co-presbyter, was murdered because of his avowed
Union sentiments, though he was a non-combatant,
and only desired to live in quietness and retirement
till the contest was decided. We were both members
of the Presbytery of Tombeckbee. I was by far
less discreet than my friend Pelan. I could not conceal
my sentiments by a judicious reticence when in
the presence of avowed secessionists. My friend
<pb id="aughey362" n="362"/>
Pelan warned me again and again against rashness and
ill-timed expression of opinions which would be sure to
bring down upon my devoted head the murderous wrath
of the devotees of treason. I still live, but my dear friend
Pelan died a martyr to the truth, at the hands of those
atrociously cruel men.</p>
          <p>When the southern people hate it is with great
intensity; if they love their love is intense. In the war
times the secessionists would destroy Unionists as they
would vipers or rattlesnakes or water moccasins or
cotton-mouths. They had no spark of sympathy or
compassion for them. They loved their friends, and
would promote their interests in every possible way.
They took delight in serving their friends, and I
personally owe them a debt of gratitude for much
kindness shown me by the southern people during my
sojourn among them in the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">ante bellum</hi></foreign> days. Any favor I
desired was accorded gladly. I never found them
deceitful. If they manifested friendship it was genuine, if
they did not like any one they made no pretence of
friendship. I found them generous and truthful. A
minister in traveling always went directly to a brother
minister's house, and invariably met a glad welcome and
munificent entertainment. I knew of one exception. The
Rev. Mr. Bland, of Memphis Presbytery, visited the city
of Memphis, accompanied by his wife. They went
directly to the residence of the pastor of the 1st
Presbyterian church of that city. They were received in
the parlor. It was cold weather and
<pb id="aughey363" n="363"/>
there was no fire in the parlor. After remaining
awhile, and receiving no invitation to stay, they left,
quite indignant at their uncivil treatment. At the next
session of presbytery the attention of presbytery was
called to this incivility. The minister guilty of
this breach of the rules of hospitality prevailing in
the South found it necessary to make a humble apology
for his rudeness. He, however, never regained the
confidence of his brethren and ere long found it
necessary to seek another and distant field of labor.</p>
          <p>Mr. Woolley wished to borrow money from a Mr.
Goodloe. Mr. John H. Brown, at the request of
Mr. Woolley, agreed to become his security. Upon
reflection, Mr. Brown changed his opinion in regard to
becoming surety for Mr. Woolley, and instead of
going to Mr. Woolley and informing him that he had
reconsidered the matter and had reversed his decision,
he went to Mr. Goodloe and said to him, “When Mr.
Woolley comes to you and asks to borrow money, I wish
you would tell him that you have no money to lend.”
Mr. Goodloe replied “I have the money to lend, and, sir, if a d—d
lie has to be told you must tell it yourself.” This affair becoming
known, Mr. Brown lost caste at once in the community.</p>
          <p>I knew of four grave elders in a northern church
who wished to accomplish a certain purpose which
they knew could only be attained by clandestine
means. They held a private meeting, and after a full
discussion of the matter, agreed upon a false
<pb id="aughey364" n="364"/>
statement, to the principle underlying which at least two
of their number were sentimentally opposed.</p>
          <p>At the next regular meeting of session, the one
designated as spokesman, in solemn tones and with a
sanctimonious air, made the statement agreed upon.
Upon the presumption of the truth of the statement but
one result could follow, and they secured the end
desired. Upon the discovery of the falsehood, one of its
perpetrators called upon the minister and said he hoped
that he would not take offense at what they had done, as
they had, at a private meeting, decided that the course
they had pursued was the best to be taken under the
circumstances. The minister replied that they should
have told the truth and have given the real reasons
which had led them to desire the end they had secured
by falsehood.</p>
          <p>“Yes,” he replied, “it would have been better. I was
opposed to the principle upon which the statement was
based. Yes, it would have been better to have told the
truth.”</p>
          <p>“Certainly it would, for you have led your minister to
make unwittingly a false statement to the other
congregation in his pastoral charge, which, to establish
his own veracity, he must publicly correct, and must
give his reasons for having been misled. This will
necessarily criminate you, and expose your duplicity. It
was a sin of no small magnitude to fabricate a falsehood,
and, in your official capacity as office-bearers in the
church of Jesus Christ, deliberately, and in accordance
with your preconcerted
<pb id="aughey365" n="365"/>
scheme announce it as the truth in order to accomplish
an end really beyond the realm of your jurisdiction, and
thus determine a matter by no means within your
province to decide. It would have been the part of true
wisdom, even after you had taken your seats as members
of session, to have followed the dictates of an
enlightened conscience, and the teachings of God's
word, and to have uttered nothing but truth, though with
the certainty of failure to accomplish your wicked and
unhallowed purpose. The end, even though right, which
it was not in this case, does not justify the use of such
base, craven, cowardly means.”</p>
          <p>This probably could not have occurred in the South.
Lying is not one of their vices. It is regarded as the act of
a coward, who has not the principles of a brave and true
man. Their sins are open before going to judgment. This
probably could not occur again in the North. It was
probably an anomalous case, without precedent or
parallel. Four church officers, who have been elected as
overseers of their brethren in spiritual things, conspiring
together to fabricate a falsehood and to palm it off upon
their unsuspecting minister as truth, is doubtless an act
unparalleled in and unknown to the annals of any other
church North or South.</p>
          <p>It might be well to state that the spokesman, and
probably the chief fabricator of the false statement, was
neither born nor bred in America, nor was he brought up
within the pale of the Presbyterian church.</p>
          <pb id="aughey366" n="366"/>
          <p>A custom which physicians tell me is as old as the
medical profession universally prevails both North and
South. Physicians are debarred by this custom, which is
of as strongly binding force as if it were a statutory
enactment, from making any charge for medical services
rendered to ministers of all denominations and their
families, or to members of their own profession.
Physicians inform me that they have never known this
custom to be violated by any member of the medical
fraternity who is in good and regular standing in his
profession, and that were any physician to violate this
custom, suspicion would attach to him at once.</p>

        <div2 type="part">
          <p>When I speak of the Southern people as truthful prior
to the war, I affirm that this is still a trait of their
character, with this exception, they will defraud the
“negroes and scalawags” of a free ballot and fair count
by fraud, violence, and perjury. They do not attempt to
conceal their conduct in this respect, declaring it to be a
political necessity for the preservation of white
supremacy. This they are determined to enforce in the
church, the school, and the state, peaceably if they can,
forcibly if they must.</p>
          <p>During the war southern Unionists, to avoid
persecution, would conceal their sentiments, sometimes
deeming it necessary to resort to deception in speech
and conduct to avoid imprisonment and death.
Guerrillas, Jeff Davis' “partisan warriors,” when arrested
by Federal troops, would resort to every kind of
subterfuge and deception to escape the
<pb id="aughey367" n="367"/>
penalty due their crimes. The course of Unionist
and secessionist was very like that of the English
during the wars of the roses, as indicated by a toast
which used to be drank in those days:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“God 
bless the faith, God bless the faith's defender,</l>
            <l>God 
bless, no harm in blessing the pretender,</l>
            <l>But 
which pretender, or which king,</l>
            <l>God bless us all, 
that's quite a different thing.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Gen L. Q. C. Lamar, of the rebel army, once said to me,
“The ten commandments are suspended during the
prevalence of war.” This seemed to be a true statement;
at all events the Southern Confederacy ignored them all
during its whole wicked existence. <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">“Inter
arma leges silent”</hi></foreign> was its motto and practice,
both in regard to Divine and human laws, till God
in his providence and wrath blotted out its name as a
nation from under heaven—a justly merited doom.</p>
          <p>The heroism of the loyal women of the South, in
their patient, uncomplaining endurance of persecution,
often unto death, is deserving of lasting
remembrance. They concealed their husbands, sons,
brothers, and lovers from the rage and malice of the
secessionists, in swamps, caverns, and mountain fastnesses,
and at the risk of life carried them provisions
while in hiding. They toiled with their own hands in the
field to procure a support for themselves and those
dependent upon them. Many sleepless vigils
were endured by them while they and those dear to
them were every hour environed by fearful peril.
<pb id="aughey368" n="368"/>
They possessed intense convictions. They were
women of faith and prayer, and they abounded in
good works. The remembrances of those righteous,
holy, and loyal women is blessed.</p>

          <head>THE NORTH AND SOUTH CONTRASTED.</head>
          <p>In the year of our Lord, 1856, I listened to an address
pronounced by Col. Jefferson Davis, in Holly Springs,
Mississippi, in which he strongly and unequivocally
avowed secession sentiments, and urged his auditors to
make due preparation for it, as it was an event greatly to
be desired and would be an accomplished fact in the near
future, as sure as fate. He thus spoke:</p>
          <p>“The people of the North and South are not
homogeneous and they never have been. From the first
the Union was an alliance between two peoples as diverse
in habits, manners and customs, and modes of thought as
in their climates and productions. The South has always
been restive under this bond. There are strong contrasts
between the characteristics and idiosyncrasies of the
people of each section. These existed in the mother
country. The chivalric Norman Cavaliers settled the
South. The Puritans of Saxon origin, exiled and poverty
stricken, settled on the cold, rugged, bleak, and
inhospitable shores of New England. When I contemplate
the hostility of their descendants to our peculiar, patriarchal, popular,
and truly beneficent institution—an institution so essential
to southern prosperity, and the conservation and
development of a high type of civilization, I can look with
great leniency upon the persecution and banishment by
our ancestors of a people so superstitious, hypocritical,
inappreciative, meddlesome, and
<pb id="aughey370" n="370"/>
refractory. They brought the same spirit with them to the
new world. They envy us our superior civilization and
many advantages. The Norman and the Saxon can never
coalesce. They can never live under the same
government on terms of equality. The Norman, by his
ancestral traditions, by his intellectual superiority and
restless ambition, aspires to bear rule and hold the reins
of government. And this consummation of his hopes and
aims he eventually secures. All history proves this. The
Cavaliers have always been the rulers. The Puritans the
ruled. There is no common bond of sympathy, no affinity
by which to cement the heterogeneous elements into
homogeneity. Slavery gives us superiority so patent that
the world readily recognizes it. When our citizens travel
abroad they are accorded honors never bestowed upon
Yankee travelers. Labor to wring by the sweat of the face
a bare subsistence out of a barren glebe, leaves upon the
features the ineffaceable marks of their plebeian
condition and origin. I have seen them abroad aping the
manners of the refined and cultured Southron, and
northern mudsills is the whispered comment of the
courtly European, who cannot be deceived by the
exhibition of the stolen livery. The ass's ears protrude
from the lion's skin.</p>
          <p>“They threaten war if we secede. We would have
secession, peaceably if we can, forcibly if we must. If
they force war upon us because we spurn with contempt
governmental association with them, let
<pb id="aughey371" n="371"/>
them come. We will welcome them with bloody hands to
hospitable graves. There is, however, no necessity for
any fear that the Yankees will attempt to retain us by
force in a Union which we will sever whatever may be the
consequences. I will volunteer to shed all the blood from
my own veins that will be necessary to be shed because
of the secession of Mississippi from the Union. We have
submitted too long to Yankee insolence and domination.
I long to enjoy the sweets of liberty, and to see my
fellow-citizens of Mississippi in the enjoyment of them. I
was educated in the North and I regard it as the greatest
misfortune my life. I fear that during my sojourn there I
adopted insensibly some of their brusque manners and imbibed
some of the modes of thought of an inferior
people. I think, however, I have gotten quit of them, but it
required extraordinary and persistent effort to do so.
I would advise our people to patronize no longer teachers
and ministers from the North. They insidiously instill
sentiments hostile to southern interests. Their students
and parishioners are in peril so long as they are
under the mental and moral instruction of men born and
bred in the abolition states. Our slave-holding population
not subject to the necessity of manual labor have all their
time to devote to literary pursuits, to the rites of
hospitality, and to social and convivial pleasures and
recreations. This is impossible among a people toiling for
a livelihood, their minds engrossed with the problems
connected with the daily supply of their
<pb id="aughey372" n="372"/>
physical necessities, taking thought in regard to what
they shall eat, what they shall drink, and wherewithal
they shall be clothed. Physical drudgery is their
predestined lot, and concomitant mental anxiety
attending it precludes the possibility of a high degree of
culture and refinement. The <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">otium cum dignitate</hi></foreign> is found alone
in southern society. Slavery removes us far from the untoward
condition that militates against advanced thought.</p>
          <p>“The slave, the serf, the peasant, the mudsills of
society, will always exist to toil and perform necessary
physical drudgery. Providence has so ordained it, and
has so constituted society. There are the ruler and the
ruled, the noble and the peasant, the slave and his
master, the employé and the employer. Those who toil
and moil, and those who enjoy the fruit of their labor.
And we do not wish to rebel at the allotments of Divine
Providence. Providence has been kind to us, and we
must not surrender our birthright. Cotton is king, and we
must see to it that he is not dethroned. We can rule the
North better out of the Union than in it. New England
avarice will bow the supple knee to our king. They must
have cotton. Subvert their manufacturing interests and
they perish. They will perforce become tributary to us,
and it will be a happy sight to behold the Yankee
cringing at our feet, supplicating us
for permission to live—his insolence all gone, his
moral ideas radically changed, and his hostility to
slavery merged into professed love for our peculiar
<pb id="aughey373" n="373"/>
institution. I am not a prophet, nor a prophet's son,
but I will venture the prediction that another decade
will not pass until all these things will be fulfilled.
Heaven speed the day of their complete consummation.
Coming events cast their shadows before.”</p>
          <p>Pollard, the historian of The Lost Cause, thus speaks of an address
of President Davis upon the return
of the peace commissioners, Hunter, Campbell,
and Stevens: “He made a powerful and eloquent address,
but in parts of it he fell into weak and bombastic speech,
and betrayed that boastful characteristic of almost all his oral
utterances in the war. As a writer, Mr. Davis is careful, meditative, and full
of dignity; but as a speaker he is imprudent, and in moments of passion
he frequently blurts out what first comes into his mind. On this
occasion he was boastful, almost to the point of grotesqueness. He
declared that the march which Sherman was then making would be his
last, and would conduct him to ruin. He predicted that before the summer solstice fell upon
the country it would be the North that would be soliciting peace.
He affirmed that the military situation of the Confederacy was all
that he could desire, and drawing up his figure, and in tones
of scornful defiance heard to the remotest parts of the
building, he remarked that the Federal authorities who
had so complacently conferred with the commissioners
of the Confederacy little knew that they were talking to
their masters.”</p>
          <p>A quotation from the same history will be pertinent:
<pb id="aughey374" n="374"/>
“Slavery is the most prominent cause of distinction
between the civilizations or social autonomies
of North and South. In the ante-revolutionary period the
differences between the populations of the northern and
southern colonies had already been strongly marked.
The early colonists did not bear with them, from the
mother country to the shores of
the New World, any greater degree of congeniality
than existed among them at home. They had come, not
only from different stocks of population, but from
different feuds, in religion and politics. There could be no
congeniality between the Puritan exiles who established
themselves upon the cold, rugged, and cheerless soil of
New England, and the Cavaliers who sought the brighter
climate of the South, and drank in their baronial halls in
Virginia confusion to round-heads and regicides. The
intolerance of the Puritan, the painful thrift of the northern
colonists, their external forms of piety, their lack of the
sentimentalism which makes up the half of modern
civilization, are traits of character visible in their
descendants. On the other hand, the colonists of Virginia
and the Carolinas were from the first distinguished for
their polite manners, their fine sentiments, their
attachment to a sort of feudal life, their landed gentry,
their love of field sports and dangerous adventure, and
the prodigal and improvident aristocracy that dispensed
its stores in constant rounds of hospitality and gaiety.
Slavery established in the South a peculiar and noble type
of civilization. It was not without
<pb id="aughey375" n="375"/>
attendant vices, but the virtues which followed in its
train were numerous and peculiar, and asserted the
general good effect of the institution on the ideas and
manners of the South. If habits of command sometimes
degenerated into cruelty and insolence, yet in numerous
instances they inculcated notions of chivalry, polished
the manners, and produced many noble and generous
virtues. If the relief of a large class of whites from the
demands of physical labor gave occasion in some
instances for idle and dissolute lives, yet at the same time
it afforded opportunity for extraordinary culture, elevated
the standards of scholarship in the South, enlarged and
emancipated social intercourse, and established schools
of individual refinement. The South had an element in its
society—a landed gentry—which the North envied, and for
which its substitute was a coarse, ostentatious
aristocracy, <hi rend="italics">that smelt of the trade</hi>, and that, however it
cleansed itself and aped the elegance of the South, could
never entirely subdue a sneaking sense of its own
inferiority. The civilization of the North was coarse and
materialistic. That of the South was scant of shows, but
highly refined and sentimental. The South was a vast
agricultural country, waste lands, forest, and swamps often
gave to the eye dreary picture; there were no thick and
intricate nets of internal improvement to astonish and bewilder
the traveler, no country picturesque with towns and
villages to please his vision. Northern men ridiculed the
apparent scantiness of the South, and
<pb id="aughey376" n="376"/>
took it as an evidence of inferiority. But this was the
coarse judgment of the surface of things. The
agricultural pursuits of the South fixed its features, and
however it might decline in the scale of gross prosperity,
its people were trained in the highest civilization, were
models of manners for the whole country, rivaled the
sentimentalism of the oldest countries of Europe,
established the only schools of honor in America, and
presented a striking contrast in their well-balanced
character to the conceit and giddiness of the Northern
people. There is a singularly bitter hate which is
inseparable from a sense of inferiority, and every close
observer of northern society has discovered how there
lurked in every form of hostility to the South, the
conviction that the northern man, however disguised
with ostentation, was coarse and inferior in comparison
with the aristocracy and chivalry of the South.”</p>
          <p>Pollard states, at the close of his history, that “the
Confederates have gone out of the war with the
consciousness that they were the <hi rend="italics">better men</hi>.”</p>
          <p>Pollard also states that the people of the South were
reduced to terrible straits during the war. He thinks the
lowest degree of humiliation was reached when delicate
and refined ladies were compelled to perform the
drudgery of cooking for themselves and their children to
avoid starvation. The whole tenor of southern teaching
led to the prevalent belief that manual or mental labor for
pecuniary remuneration was degrading. The degradation
of labor was
<pb id="aughey377" n="377"/>
dreaded by all classes and conditions of the whites.
The colored people were driven to it by the lash.</p>
          <p>Manual labor was associated in the southern mind
with slavery. In the eleven seceded states forming the
Southern Confederacy there were but two hundred and
fifty thousand slave-holders. The great majority
of the white population were non-slave-holders. Social ostracism was
rigorously enforced. The poor whites
were less esteemed by the rich than
the slaves. Many of the slaves were more intelligent than they.
Notably the house servants, who,
by their intimate association with their masters' families,
had gained a surprising amount of general information. Many of
them were mulattoes, quadroons, and octoroons. They entertained a very low estimate
of the poor white, regarding him as much lower in the scale of intelligence
than themselves. The cracker and the sandhiller were the objects of their
derision. They scorned association with them, and
often spoke of them and treated them with scorn and contempt.
A refrain to one of their popular songs is brusque but expresses the truth:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“My name's Sam, I don't care a d—n,</l>
            <l>I'd rather be a nigger than a poor white man.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The cause of the poverty and illiteracy of the poor
whites of the South is easily accounted for by their
history and disabilities. Bancroft, the historian, thus
speaks of this class:</p>
          <p>“A class of people dwell in the southern states
whose history and character have received less attention
<pb id="aughey378" n="378"/>
than they deserve. These people have been
properly called the poor whites of the South. The
original charter of King James, extending from Florida to
the present northern boundary of the United States, was
divided into two departments, named North and South Virginia.
They have ultimately become the North and the South. The South was
originally colonized by the Norman element, then
esteemed the English aristocracy, while the North was
chiefly peopled by the race termed the
Saxon, an equality and liberty loving people. The South
from the first sought to maintain high and low classes;
the North equality. At a certain time the English
Government opened its prisons and poured
forth a flood of convicts upon the southern colonies.
At this period the aristocratic party, both in England
and America, was hostile to educating the lower
classes.</p>
          <p>“Sir William Berkley, an early governor of Virginia,
said, ‘Every man instructs his children according to his
ability;’ a method which left the ignorant in hopeless
blindness. The instinct of aristocracy dreaded the general
diffusion of intelligence, and even the enfranchising
influence of the ministers. ‘The ministers,’ continued Sir
William,  ‘should pray oftener and preach less. But I thank
God there are no free schools, no printing, and I hope we
shall not have them these hundred years, for learning has
brought disobedience, heresy, and sects into the world,
and printing has divulged them and libels against
<pb id="aughey379" n="379"/>
the best government. God keep us from both.’
Bancroft's Hist., Vol. II. The people of the South
now became permanently divided into an aristocracy
and the convict race of poor whites. The latter, for
the want of education, were disqualified to rise, and
sank deeper and deeper into wickedness and degradation,
lost all spirit of enterprise and self-respect, and
became too indolent to seek fortunes or better their
condition. In the east they habited along the coasts of
North and South Carolina, and near large rivers, as the
Great Pedee, Yadkin, and Cape Fear, a climate that
favored their indolence. They lived on oysters, crabs,
and periwinkles, and had a strange habit of eating clay,
hence they were known by the name of clay-eaters.
A more substantial subsistence, however, was furnished
from half wild hogs and cattle. The former
of these subsisted in the woods upon roots and mast,
the latter upon browse and range. To these may be
added the opossum, fattened upon wild grapes.
About the same time with the convicts, the negro
race was introduced into this country, which, from the
first, was held to be more respectable than the convict
race. The traveler, passing up the Pedee on the
early steamboats which navigated it, would be surprised
to see at night-fall fires lighted up along the
banks and on the neighboring hills. Upon enquiring
he would be told that these were the encampments
of the poor whites for the sake of shad fishing.
If he were a European, it would lead him to think
of the gypsies of his native country; indeed they resemble
<pb id="aughey380" n="380"/>
the gypsies. Their habits are migratory, they own
no real estate, and might, not inappropriately, be called
American gypsies. Their want of enterprise and energy
has been mentioned. To this, however, there were
exceptions. Many picked up courage and beat back to the
mountains. The famous county of Buncombe was largely
settled by poor whites. Some of these were descendants
of depredators and murderers who possessed great
energy. The spirit of violence continuing in the veins of
some, would reappear in future generations by the law of
heredity. Hence from the notorious Buncombe were
known to come many notorious characters, so that any
violent character in the settlement of the Southwest was
commonly slanged with the epithet of “Roarer from
Bunkum,” and in the same phraseology, a plucky deed
was denominated “Bunkum.” Some of the most
audacious thieves and bloody highwaymen that ever
infested the earth emigrated to the South-west from the
Pedee and Yadkin. Such were the Puebloes of East
Tennessee, and the Harpes of Kentucky. The majority of
these people have not the least tendency to acknowledge
God or recognize religion. In this they coincide with the
gypsies, but profanity uttered in the most trite and
distasteful oaths seemed to them a second nature: They
practice every vice and have but few virtues. Families of
the patrician order, falling into decay, are compelled by
force of circumstances to migrate north or to unite their
destiny with this class. And many families of
<pb id="aughey381" n="381"/>
poor but respectable people, being unable to educate
their children because of the expense attending it, and
manual labor being considered disgraceful, gradually
sink till they become blended with the poor and vicious
whites. Their aristocratic neighbors lend no helping
hand to enable them to avoid this catastrophe, and avert
a fate worse than death.</p>
          <p>In the <hi rend="italics">ante bellum</hi> days there was not a single free
school for the education of youth in the seven states
which afterward seceded and organized the Southern
Confederacy. The dominant class, the slave-holders,
numbered but a quarter of a million. This class ignored
the existence of the poor whites, except so far as it was
possible to use them, and they ruled with rigor over the
blacks, and wishing to extend their domination they
determined to rule or ruin the whole United States of
America. According to state laws, it was a criminal act to
teach a slave to read. Although there was no statutory
enactment to prevent the children of the poor whites
from receiving instruction, they were debarred from even
a rudimentary education by their environment. Free
schools were unknown, the slave-holders controlled the
schools and rigorously excluded the children of the poor.
It seemed an utter impossibility for a child belonging to
the lower class to secure an education. Senator
McDuffie, of South Carolina, became the patron of a
poor white child, and gave him the benefit of the
schools. He learned rapidly and became an eminent
minister, known to the world as Rev.
<pb id="aughey382" n="382"/>
Jas. H.. Thornwell, D.D. Some ladies educated a poor
white boy who is known to fame as Hon. Alexander
Stephens. It is not for want of intellectuality, but for lack
of opportunity that the children of the poor whites are
ignorant. It seems strange that Dr. Thornwell and
Alexander Stephens should have become champions of
slavery, the institution guilty of oppressing beyond
measure the class to which they belonged, and in which
they would have remained had it not been for the charity
of individuals whose benevolence in this line was a
glorious exception to the prevalent sentiment of the
southern aristocracy.</p>
          <p>I was principal of the high school connected with
the Princeton, Ind., graded schools. A number of
refugee children belonging to the poor white class of
the South attended these schools. They fully equaled
the other children in progress in their studies. Afterward
I was superintendent of the Cambridge City
and Leavenworth graded schools, in the same state,
and found many children of refugee families in attendance.
These children showed no intellectual inferiority,
but kept equal pace with the other children in
all their studies. The masses of the people in the
South were deprived of every privilege. They were
kept in ignorance, that they might not know their
wrongs, and they were reduced to and kept in extreme
poverty by every possible device, that they
might not be able to rise superior to the degradation
which their environment had forced upon them. To
contemplate this bestial wretchedness, hopeless ignorance,
<pb id="aughey383" n="383"/>
and forlorn condition, filled with joy the souls of
the aristocratic slave-holding oligarchy—if it be conceded
that they were possessed of souls.</p>
          <p>Slave-holders were bitterly opposed to the education
of the masses, and used every possible means to
prevent their acquiring even the ability to read and write.
They desired for their own caste a monopoly of wealth,
culture, and everything that rendered life
worth living. There were some glorious exceptions
to this view. Tishomingo county, in the north-eastern
corner of Mississippi, contained many Scotch
and Scotch-Irish people. These people were anxious
to give their children a good education. There were
but few slaves in the county and the majority of the people could
not be induced to favor secession. </p>

      </div1>
      <div1 type="chapter">
        <p>A
Presbyterian minister, who became president of
Corona Female College, located in Corinth, Miss.,
strove by tongue and pen to rouse the people of the
state to adopt measures looking to the education of
the masses. He delivered an address before the legislature
at Jackson, urging upon the legislators the
necessity of adopting a free school system for the
state, but his efforts were looked upon with disfavor
by the slave-holders; some of his utterances had the
true ring and were well-nigh prophetic. This
divine, Rev. L. B. Gaston, published an article in the
Corona <hi rend="italics">Wreath</hi>, a monthly periodical, edited by his
wife, Mrs. Susan B. Gaston, which I will copy. Its
earnest plea for the general diffusion of knowledge
among the people only rendered Mr. Gaston unpopular,
<pb id="aughey384" n="384"/>
and failed of convincing men joined to their idol—
slavery, that popular education was desirable. This
article was published in the July number in the year 1858:</p>
        <p>“The idea of universal education is the grand central
idea of the age. But in this country no system,
however perfect, no enactments, however enlightened,
and no authority, however constituted, can attain to the
full accomplishment of their object, however praiseworthy
and laudable, without the hearty and efficient
co-operation of public sentiment. These extracts are
taken from Randall's Common School System of New
York, and are placed at the head of our speculations
on the subject of education, as indicative of our feelings
and purposes in adopting it as a standing theme
for discussion and remark. It is even now apparent
that the current century will be noted in the pages of
history for the educational progress made by human
family, for the expansion given to the idea that
knowledge is power; and for the device and establishment
of a comprehensive system of popular instruction.
In committing to record its memorable
events, it will be the future historian's task to trace
the rise of national dominion and grandeur to the
introduction of schools for the instruction of the
masses, and to contrast the conditions of those states
and kingdoms that adopted or rejected the policy.
With almost prophetic pen we can predict the
attainment of empire to the little kingdom of Prussia,
simply from a consideration of the vast moral and
<pb id="aughey385" n="385"/>
intellectual power that is now growing up through
the medium of her common school system, which
was perfected in 1819. As the past history of the
world furnishes no parallel to such a case—a people
universally educated in the best literature, science, art,
and religion that time has ever produced—we know
not how to estimate the force, or calculate the action
of her power; but this generation will not pass away
before the national policy of Prussia will tell upon
the destinies of Europe. We have the light of all
past ages to show that a people trained or educated
to be of one mind and feeling are irresistible to all
surrounding nations not so taught or disciplined.
Numbers in this comparison are of minor consequence.
Mind has always governed matter, or mere
brute force, and so it ever will govern. Regarding
this as the order of nature, and looking to the condition
and prospects of our own country, our feelings
are profoundly stirred with mingled emotion. In
one portion of it we find that education is fully
appreciated, and the means of dispensing it to all are
judiciously applied. The North has always been
distinguished for its attention to this great social interest,
but within the last thirty years it has made
advances that seem to border on perfection. By
means of public meetings, addresses, and lectures,
teachers' associations and institutes, governors' messages
and superintendents' reports, the public mind
has become thoroughly imbued with the spirit of
education. The cities, towns, and populated country
<pb id="aughey386" n="386"/>
have been meted out and districted for schools, within a
convenient distance from every man's dwelling, and in
some states the school-house door, like that of the
church, is thrown open and made free to all of a
schoolable age. These measures and appliances that
constitute the most powerful machinery for intellectual
elaboration and development are almost unknown in the
South. The work of education with them is the
movement of a spirit, with us it is the operation
of a simple sense of expediency. They have accumulated
means of knowledge, we are dependent.</p>
        <p>“There you may see the evolution of the steam engine
in its thousand protean forms, of the steam threshers,
and diggers, and reapers, of the Cyclopean gnomes that
mould iron like wax, of the machines that sew, weld,
stamp, dovetail, bevel, shear, turn, weigh, weave, spin,
saw, veneer. We are comparatively destitute of all these
mechanical appliances and powers. They have type
foundries, book-printing presses, authors, writers,
publishers, and other instrumentalities for producing and
dispensing knowledge of which we have scarcely any.
They furnish our school-books, our center table and
library books, and most of our current and periodical
literature. They provide, prepare, and administer the larger
portion of our intellectual food, and God never made a
<hi rend="italics">man</hi>, much less a <hi rend="italics">people</hi>, to receive sustenance without
being subject to the sustainer. While we, therefore, take
pride in the North, as a portion of our country, for the
eminence to which it
<pb id="aughey387" n="387"/>
has attained in the world of letters, and the glory to
which it is advancing, we cannot but view with
sensations of alarm the adverse bearing and threatening
tendency of its social organism upon the state and well-being of the South.</p>
        <p>“The difference of attention paid to the single matter of
education by the two sections of the Union, North and
South, leads directly to the generation of a strife between
them, the most bitter and destructive contests for power
will inevitably grow out of unequal association. The wiser
and more crafty portion will strive to rule its less
cultivated and capable associate. To those who have the
discernment to perceive it, this is no longer a
philosophical speculation; it is stubborn and grating fact.
The North already holds three of the four great reins of
national control—commerce, manufactures, and legislation.
It would soon have the fourth, religion, had not our
southern politicians had sense enough (and just about
sense enough) to discover what was going on, and by a
sort of wild, vehement clamor, rouse the whole nation to a
feeling of the wrong meditated
against our political rights. It remained only for
our pulpit and religious press to become thoroughly
abolitionized for the North to have consummated its
purpose—absolute ascendency. But the resistance
of the South, through its politicians, has brought a
healthier religious sentiment, and a reaction favorable
to it is taking place in our own country and
throughout the world. But this advantage is of
<pb id="aughey388" n="388"/>
small moment, and will soon pass away, if not husbanded
and vigorously improved by a direct resort
to fundamental considerations. Our <hi rend="italics">stumping</hi> politicians
as a class are very ordinary men, and as public
teachers are exceedingly unreliable. Generally
the braggart and buffoon is more than a match for
the sober, earnest, sound reasoner before the people.
The rank of competition for office is deteriorating
and becoming less gifted in almost every canvass.
The great lights of former days have expired, and
we have no successors to Hayne, Crawford, Calhoun,
Randolph, Clay, Benton, and Jackson to lift up and
bear onward the banner of the South. In legislation
and governmental policy we can no longer cope
with the North. Unrestrained by constitutions and
unchecked by master minds, they will use us at discretion,
and our <hi rend="italics">wisdom</hi> will be <hi rend="italics">to bear</hi> it. Revolt,
secession, or revolution will be worse than madness;
for we can build no Chinese wall high and strong
enough to bar the intercourse or intrusion of neighbors
wiser than we are. We are doomed to degradation low,
if we do not change materially the present
aspect of things.</p>
        <p>“And let us pause to consider what there is innate in
man or people to produce such disparity of progress and
power. Why are they our masters? Why can they control
our labor, dictate our opinions, agitate our passions, and
lull us into quiescence as they choose?</p>
        <p>“Is it because they are naturally our superiors in
<pb id="aughey389" n="389"/>
whatever advances man over his fellow-man? Has our
Yankee brother a clearer head, a sounder heart, and a
bigger soul than a southern born? Does he grow up on a
more fruitful soil, under a more genial sun, or in a wider
field for the expansion of mind and the cultivation of
genius? Can we believe that the people who generate and
mature such moral monstrosities as Millerism, Mormonism,
Free-loveism, Spiritism, Beecherism, women's rights
conventions, etc., etc., are the people that Heaven has
ordained to be our rulers? Eternal Justice forbid it. And
yet we are the strong man shorn and bound—the Philistines
are upon us. Why is it so? What is it? We demand, what is
it that makes the difference between the North and South.
It is simply <hi rend="italics">education</hi>. Would that we had a hundred tongues and iron voice to
proclaim it till every southern ear should hear it in notes
of startling thunder. We are <hi rend="italics">overmatched. We are
subdued,</hi> and from this thralldom there is no escape by
human means, but by the redeeming process of universal education.
To have the work partially done—one class taught and another neglected
—is only aggravating the evils of our condition. It is quickening
the body politic to feel the miseries of its situation,
without imparting the ability to obtain relief. We must
begin at the foundation if we would elevate the superstructure.
We must make capable voters if we would have able representatives. We must be
respectable at home if we would command respect
abroad. And we must be powerful in intellect if we would
prevail in counsel.</p>
        <pb id="aughey390" n="390"/>
        <p>“We have thus opened up a subject which we expect
to present in some form or other in every following
number of this periodical. Its intrinsic merits are sufficient
to entitle it to all the consideration we are able to bestow
upon it. But we adduce directly the plain, practical reason
that addresses every southern man's and every national
patriot's heart—the equalization of the different parts of the
Union for the integrity and well-being of the whole—that we
may secure attention to the subject. We enter a field of
discussion to which we see no well-defined limits. The
race of man is nearly six thousand years old, and yet the
question, What is education proper? has never been
settled. Perhaps it cannot be arbitrarily determined, but as
an appliance it must be modified and adapted to the
various characters and conditions of men. But be that as
it may be, it is with us an open question. What is
education proper <hi rend="italics">for us</hi>? By what scheme shall we enlist
the teaching talent and subject to discipline the teachable
mind of the South? To this investigation we hope to call
forth many a competent assistant. We hope to see it
occupy a prominent place in the newspapers of the state,
and to become a common theme for discussion by
candidates before the people. By so doing we hope to
prepare the way for our next legislature to take hold of the
subject of popular instruction and turn to good account
the vast resources at our command for supporting a
system of schools that may embrace all classes
<pb id="aughey391" n="391"/>
and conditions of society. We have the materials and
means for rearing up the most cultivated, accomplished,
refined, polished, and powerful population on earth, for
we have a strictly laboring class in the producing and
sustaining avocations of life. We could have a most
capable operative and managing class, and then a class
exempt from manual labor, which by proper mental culture
and application would become the glory and defence of the South, and
command the respect and admiration of the world. Let
there be light.”</p>
        <p>The wealthy class in the South were not possessed of
a high degree of culture. They were much inferior to the
educated class in the North. They received their
education in northern colleges and seminaries, or of
teachers of northern birth and education who had gone
south to pursue their vocation. Spending life in a ceaseless round of hilarious social
enjoyments and pleasures, and often in dissipation and
vicious associations, was not conducive of a high degree
of mental culture. It was a lady of wealth and high social
position who informed me that she very much feared that
there would soon be a <hi rend="italics">resurrection</hi> of the negroes. It
was a company of aristocratic slave-holders who, upon
organizing themselves into the Silver Gray Home Guards,
in Jan., 1861, adopted this as one of the articles of their
constitution: “Section 2, Art. 3. We will not leave the state
of Mississippi <hi rend="italics">unless it be invaded.</hi>” It was a
physician of high standing who informed me that
<pb id="aughey392" n="392"/>
Gen. Albert Sidney Johnson had been killed in the battle
of Shiloh. He averred that the femoral artery had been
severed <hi rend="italics">below the knee</hi> and that this caused
hemorrhage which resulted in death.</p>
        <p>Servile insurrections were constantly feared, especially
by the female portion of the population. I lodged a few
days at the house of Dr. Dunlap, near Holly Springs.
Mrs. Dunlap informed me that she noticed a large
gathering of their colored people at one of the cabins.
Wishing to learn the cause, she slipped round to the
back window unobserved, as the night was dark, to play
the role of an eavesdropper. A well-dressed burly
African, in an earnest tone, was haranguing them after
this manner: “I tells you, ladies an' gentlemen, we's all
gwine to be free before long. We's all going to enjoy
liberty, mos' right away. We won't be slaves no longer
an' be whipped an' cuffed by de white folks.” “ How duz
you know all dat?” said White Jim, an octoroon. “Why
didn't I hear massa Jeff Davis say so. I done drove him
out in de carriage to dat stan' where he 'dressed de
people to-day, an' I hed to wait to bring him back. From
what he said de people of de Norf is comin' down to set
us free an' dey'll jes mow dese southern people down as
dey mows de grass. An' he said de northern people
believed in negro 'quality, dat de white folks up dar wuz
willing to marry our daughters an' let us marry theirn. Jes
be ready, as the hime sez, your redemption draweth
nigh.” The doctor, as soon as I
<pb id="aughey393" n="393"/>
informed him of what was going on, went out with a
whip and drove off this orator whose incendiary speech
had a tendency to incite servile insurrection. He ought
to have tied him up and given him five hundred
lashes.”</p>
        <p>In 1856 one slave murdered another. Judge
Scroggs, of Holly Springs, inserted a card in the papers
asking for information, as he could not find any law to meet the case.
Afterward he published a card stating that as there was no law to punish
one slave for the murder of another, he had ordered that
the culprit receive three hundred lashes, and had sent him home
to his master. A physician in Lexington, Ky., forcibly violated the
person of a female patient—an octoroon. A moot court was held
by the young lawyers of the city, who tried the physician, and
the jury impaneled for the occasion condemned him to pay
for the oysters. This woman was married, and suffered severe
mental anguish because of the crime committed against her virtue, but she could
obtain no redress. A planter living in Fayette county, Ky., murdered his wife because
she truthfully accused him of infidelity to his marriage vows.
The murder was witnesses by forty of his slaves, two of
whom were severely wounded trying to save the life of their mistress.
The murderer was arrested, tried, and acquitted for lack of testimony,
slaves being incompetent by southern law to give testimony in a court of justice.
But retributive justice overtook this man a few months after his acquittal.
He died at the hands of his brother-in-law.</p>
        <pb id="aughey394" n="394"/>
        <p>In the Mississippi bottoms and in mountainous
districts, in the everglades of Florida and places not
easily accessible, large numbers of maroons make
their homes. Here they live in comparative security
and raise families. The maroons prefer death to
slavery. They have bludgeons with sharp knife
blades deftly inserted in the heavy end of them, and
woe to the hound that comes within their reach.
Those who live upon the mountains are properly
called cimaroons. They are very adroit in evading
capture, and should they be captured they will induce
other slaves to escape with them and become
cliff-dwellers and troglodytes amid the fastnesses of
the mountains, or they will make their home on some
hummock near a lagoon, whose shores are embowered
by the evergreen cypress, the long-leafed pine, the
trailing vine, and the pendent moss. By the aid of
the friendly lagoon or bayou they can evade the
sleuth-hound, and the fish which abound are readily
taken in their skillfully woven nets. By the aid of
traps they feast upon wild turkeys, opossums, wild
pigeons, and every variety of game. Without the
aid of guns the wild deer becomes a victim of their
skillfully constructed snares. From a noxious plant
indigenous to southern swamps, they manufacture a
subtle poison in which they saturate meat and place
it near the kennels of hounds. The poison is nearly
inodorous and insipid. It is sure death to all animals
born blind. The maroons call it “stagger pizen,”
because the poisoned animal staggers as if intoxicated
<pb id="aughey395" n="395"/>
till almost the last moment of its existence.
When pursued by hounds, pieces of meat saturated
with this poisonous decoction are thrown on
his track by the fugitive as he flies; the hounds devour it with
avidity. It is a very active poison. Its fatal effects
are speedily developed, and as there is no known
antidote the hounds soon die in convulsive agony. Thus
many a poor hunted fugitive has been saved from a
cruel death, or the infliction of a terrible flagellation
with the loss of dear but precarious liberty, at apparently
the last moment, even when the hounds were
within a mile of their victim. Thus proving the
truth of the adge, “Man's extremity is God's opportunity.”</p>

          <head>THE SOUTHERN BARBECUE.</head>
          <p>Twenty-four hours before the feast is to be served
the preparations are under way. Seventy-two South-down
sheep have been slaughtered and suspended
in undivided carcasses. Twenty-five shoats
bear the mutton company. While the butchers are doing their
work, a gang of darkeys, whose shovels fly as if it
was a labor of love, have excavated three trenches, sixty
feet long, three and a half feet wide, and four
feet deep. They are side by side, clean cut through
sod and clay, and if a surveyor had gone over them
he could not have found fault with the symmetry. Then the
wood is hauled. It is only the best seasoned
hickory which goes into the pits, and cord after cord
<pb id="aughey396" n="396"/>
is piled in, until there is an amount which would stock a
wood yard in a northern city. Stick after stick is laid on
until the wood rises above the surface. Coal oil is brought
and poured on the wood. Then fire is applied in a dozen
places and the contents of the trenches blaze from end to
end. From midnight till daylight the smoke and flames and
the trenches are not approachable. It is Gehenna in
miniature. At five o'clock the contents have settled down
to a bed of coals a foot thick, from which arises a fervent
heat. In the waiting hours the spits, long, smooth-shaven
poles of hickory, have been made ready, and in pairs have
been run through the carcasses lengthwise. They form
stretchers, and as they rest on supporters the sheep or
shoat is stretched out flat. Grasping these hickory poles
the darkies, one at each end, carry the carcasses and lay
them over the trenches, the spits holding them in position.
Over the intense heat, the surface flesh begins to sputter
and fly, and then ensues a lively scene. To prevent
scorching the carcasses have to be turned over every ten
minutes, and the attendants fairly rushed along the sides
of the trenches grasping and flopping over the roasting
pork and mutton. At one end of the pits is a great
cauldron, where the seasoning, salt and pepper and other
condiments, is mixed in water and boiled. This compound
is dipped out in buckets, and men go from carcass to
carcass with great swabbing cloths tied on sticks. In this
way they apply the seasoning. As the embers drop lower
the heat becomes less intense,
<pb id="aughey397" n="397"/>
and the barbecuing goes on more soberly. Occasionally
a little water is thrown on the coals, and steam relieves
the cooking of too much dryness, but the basting goes
on unceasingly. In ordinary times Uncle Jake Hostetter
may be an humble citizen in Lexington. Now,
as master of the barbecuing, he rules supreme in the
cooking lot, for the trenches are enclosed by a tight
board fence, and it requires some persuasion to get
past the guards. There are only a few favored persons
within. The thousands who sniff the odors, and
look longingly toward the incense arising from the
fires, are wandering through the park wondering when
dinner will be ready. The master of the barbecue
moves among the trenches and his word is law. He
served his apprenticeship away back when presidents
came to these Kentucky festivities. Barbecues have
not been so frequent of late years. But Uncle Jake
feels safe in his experience, and he shows no uneasiness
over the fact that 5,000 people are holding him
responsible for their dinners, and some of them have
gone breakfastless to stimulate appetite. Now and
then two of the cooking corps bring up from the
trenches to the table under the big tree a carcass to
inspect. He cuts into it, slices off bits of the flesh,
tastes, and looks knowing. Even the president of the
day, Hon. W. C. P. Breckenridge, recognizes the
authority. The speaking has commenced from a
stand in the park, and somebody wants to know when
the orators are going to stop for dinner. “Just when
Uncle Jake Hostetter says the mutton is done to a
<pb id="aughey398" n="398"/>
turn,” replies Mr. Breckenridge, and another statesman
is let loose to say a great many pretty compliments
about Kentucky, and a very few words about national
politics.</p>
          <p>The Blue Grass country has contributed to this
occasion three great caldrons. Whatever useful purpose
they may have subserved about hog killing time, they are
now doing duty in the manufacture of 900 gallons of
burgoo. Burgoo has a basis, as the chemist says. The
basis on this occasion consists of 150 chickens and 225
pounds of beef in joints, and other forms best suited for
soup. To this has been added a bushel or two of
tomatoes. The heap of shaven roasting ears tells of
another accessory before the fact. Cabbage and potatoes
and probably other things in small quantities, but too
numerous to mention, have gone into the pots. The fires
were lighted under the vats before the roasting
commenced on the trenches, and the burgoo has been
steadily boiling ever since. This boiling necessitates
steady stirring, and next to Uncle Jake's ministerial
powers the old expert who presides over each kettle
comes in for due respect and glorification. “You might not
think it,” says the old grey-headed Kentuckian whose eye
is on the largest of the pots where 500 gallons of burgoo
are bubbling, “but a piece of mutton suet as large as my
hand thrown into the pot would spoil the whole mess.
That shows you that there are some things you can't put
in burgoo. Sometimes out in the woods we put in squirrels
and turkeys, but we
<pb id="aughey399" n="399"/>
didn't have any this time. I think they've got a
leetle too much pepper in that pot down there, so if
you don't find what you get is just right come to me
and I'll fix you up with some of this.” As the meat
boils from the bones the latter are raised from
the bottom of the kettle by the paddle and thrown out.
Gradually vegetables lose all distinctive form and
appearance and the compound is reduced to a
homogeneous liquid, about the consistency of molasses.
“Burgoo ought to boil about 14 hours,” says the old
expert, “we've only had about 8 for this, but I think
they'll be able to eat it.”</p>
          <p>Gradually the heap of barbecued meat accumulates
before Uncle Jake. He goes over and looks at the burgoo,
and consults with the old expert. Then he glances over
the fence at the long tables, and finds that two wagon
loads of bread have been hewn into rations and strewn along
the pine boards. The tin cups, 3,000 of them, are hurriedly
scattered with the bread. From all parts of the
grounds there is a sudden but decorous movement toward
the tables, and the orator on tap runs off a peroration and stops.
Uncle Jake's corps of assistants bring out the carcasses
still on the stretchers, and every rod of table
length finds a smoking sheep and a shoat. Gus Jaubert
and a dozen butchers, with their long, sharp knives,
shave and cut and deal out with all the speed that long
practice has given them. The burgoo, steaming hot in
new wooden buckets, is brought in, and as the
attendants pass along the lines the hungry people dip
<pb id="aughey400" n="400"/>
out cupfuls and sip it as it cools. There are no knives nor
forks. Nobody asks for or expects them. Neither are there
spoons for the burgoo. The great slices of bread serve as
plates for the meat. There are 5,000 people eating
together, and all busy at once. Not a basket has been
brought. All types and classes of Blue Grass people are
facing those tables, and handling their bread and meat
and burgoo with manifestations of appetite which tell of
the relish of the fare. Finally, nothing but skeletons remain
of the sheep and shoats, and the tables are swept. Uncle
Jake moves among the throng, and men like Senator Beck
and Gov. Blackburn and Gen. Wm. Preston shake his
hand, and tell him he has eclipsed his former efforts. It is
the proud happy hour of Uncle Jacob's life. He is the hero
of the hour. Don Piatt and several other reporters were
present taking notes of this wonderful institution, the
southern barbecue, and graphic reports find their way to
the northern papers. The southerner, notably the
Kentuckian, regards the man's life a failure who has not
attended a barbecue.</p>

          <pb id="aughey401" n="401"/>
          <head>THE GENERAL JUDGMENT.</head>
          <p>The text was 2 Cor. v. 10: “We must all appear
before the judgment seat of Christ, that every one
may receive the things done in his body, according
to that he hath done, whether it be good or bad.”</p>
          <p>The doctrine of a general judgment was revealed
to mankind at a very early period of the world's
history. Enoch, the seventh from Adam, prophesied,
saying, “Behold the Lord cometh with ten
thousand of his saints, to execute judgment upon all,
and to convince all that are ungodly among them of all
the ungodly deeds which they have ungodly committed,
and of all their hard speeches which ungodly sinners
have spoken against him.” Job declares: “I know
that my Redeemer liveth, and that he shall stand at the latter day
upon the earth.” Daniel also speaks
of a general judgment: “I beheld till the thrones were cast down,
and the Ancient of days did sit, whose garment was white as snow,
and the hair of his head like the pure wool; his throne was like
the fiery flame, and his wheels as burning fire. A
fiery stream issued and came forth from before him;
thousand thousands ministered unto him, and ten
thousand times ten thousand stood before him: the judgment
was set, and the books were opened.” The New Testament is
also explicit in its declaration that god hath appointed a day
in which he will judge the world in righteousness by that man whom
he hath ordained. The text declares that we must all appear before the
judgment seat of Christ.</p>
          <pb id="aughey402" n="402"/>
          <p>The scenes which will usher in the judgment of
the great day will be of the most magnificent character.
“The heavens shall pass away with a great noise,
and the elements shall melt with fervent heat; the
earth also, and the works that are therein, shall be
burned up.” This does not indicate annihilation.
God will never annihilate any of his creatures,
animate or inanimate.</p>
          <p>The inquiry is often made, what becomes of the
soul after death, and where does it await the general
judgment? A sect called the Soul-sleepers take the
position that the soul, after death, goes into a torpid
state, like bears in winter, and thus remains till the
sounding of the Archangels trump. There is no
scripture to sustain this view, and, it is only assumed,
to avoid the objection that God would not judge a
soul, and send it to reward or punishment, and then bring
it back, to be again judged. That the soul, at death,
passes immediately into glory or torment, is
proved by many scriptures. Paul “desired to depart, and be with
Christ, which was far better,” than remaining on earth. He declares that to be present
with the body, is to be absent from the Lord. The
dying Stephen calls upon the Lord Jesus to receive
his spirit. These holy men would not thus have
spoken, if they supposed that ages must elapse ere
they entered heaven. God is not the God of the dead
or torpid, but of the living. Moses and Elias appeared on
the mount of transfiguration in a state far from torpidity.
The dying thief received the promise,
<pb id="aughey403" n="403"/>
“This day shalt thou be with me in paradise.”
No mention is made of purgatory or torpidity.
The objector urges that paradise is not heaven. We are told
that the river of life flows from the throne of God, that
the tree of life grows on both sides of the river, and that
the tree of life grows in the midst the paradise of God.
The paradise of God is where he is seated on his throne,
which is heaven. Paradise is where Christ is. The thief
would be with Christ in paradise. He who regards the
Lord as the Chief among ten thousand, the One
altogether lovely, will deem his presence heaven indeed.
As to the wicked, it is said of the rich man, that in hell he
lifted up his eyes, being in torment. If, after being judged,
the souls of believers do pass immediately into glory,
and the wicked into torment, what use is there of another
or general judgment. I reply, we are responsible not only
for our acts, but for the influence which those acts exert
through all time. Gibbon, Hume, Rousseau, Paine, and
other infidel writers wrote works which, during the life
of the authors, did great evil. If those wicked men passed away
from earth impenitent, they are now suffering the
vengeance of eternal fire. But the influence for evil of
those wicked works did not cease with the death of their
authors. Thousands of young men every year are led into
pernicious and hurtful errors by their perusal. At the
general judgment the accumulated guilt for the baleful
influence exerted through their writings in all time will sink them
<pb id="aughey404" n="404"/>
deeper in the flames of perdition. The sainted Alexander
and other pious men who are now in heaven wrote many
works whose influence for good was great while their
authors lived, and since their death they are, and will
continue to be, instrumental in the hand of God in turning
many to righteousness. All the good accomplished by
their writings through all time, will, at the judgment, add
to their exceeding and eternal weight of glory.</p>
          <p>In this life, we often see the righteous man contending
with life's unnumbered woes; all the dealings of
Providence seem to be adverse. While the wicked are in
great power they flourish in life like the green bay-tree,
and have no bands in their death. These things are
strange and mysterious. We understand them not now,
but we shall learn in that great day when all mysteries are
made plain that God's dealings were just, both with the
righteous and the wicked.</p>
          <p>The text declares that <hi rend="italics">we</hi> must all appear before the
judgment seat of Christ. This <hi rend="italics">we </hi>includes all who are now
within the sound of my voice, and not only us, but all
who live upon the face of the earth; and the Archangel's
trump will wake the pale nations of the dead and summon
them to judgment. The dark domain of hell will be
vacated, and the angels that kept not their first estate and
are now reserved in chains of darkness will appear in the
presence of the Judge. Heaven's holy inhabitants will be
present. Thus heaven, earth, and hell will be represented
in that august assemblage. This scene will bear some
<figure id="ill27" entity="aughey404"><p>THE OLD EXPERT WHO PRESIDES OVER EACH KETTLE. Page 398.</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey405" n="405"/>
resemblance to that which takes place in our earthly
courts. The Lord Jesus Christ will be the Judge, and the
angels and saints will be the jurors, who will consent to
and approve of the acts of the Judge. The angels will be
the officers who will summon from the prison-house of
hell the devils to the trial, and also those wicked men
who will call upon the rocks and mountains to fall upon
them to hide them from the face of the Lamb. Nor, as is so
often the case with earthly officers, will any be able to
elude the vigilance of these. They will be clothed with
ample power to compel the attendance of all; none will
escape. We must all appear before the judgment seat. As
in earthly courts, law is the basis of judgment, so we
shall be judged according to law in that day. The heathen
will be judged by the law of nature—the law written in
their hearts and on their consciences. The light of nature
teaches the being, wisdom, power, and goodness of God.
For a violation of this law they will be beaten with few
stripes. The Jews will be judged by both the law of
nature, which they have in common with the heathen,
and the Mosaic law. But we who live in the nineteenth
century, in the full blaze of gospel light, will be judged
not only by the light of nature and the Mosaic law, which
we possess in common with the heathen and the Jew, but
also by the glorious gospel of the Son of God, which
brought life and immortality to light; and if condemned,
how fearful our doom, who are so highly favored! In
earthly courts,
<pb id="aughey406" n="406"/>
we are judged for our overt acts alone, but in the
court of heaven the commandment is exceeding broad;
it reaches every thought. Our words, too, are taken
into account. We must give an account for every
idle word. By our words we shall be justified, and
by our words we shall be condemned. Our thoughts,
our words, our deeds will all be taken into account.</p>
          <p>As in our courts there are witnesses, so also there will
be at the bar of God. Our pious relatives and friends will
bear this testimony, that they have prayed with us and
for us; that they had a deep concern for our souls, and
that we who are found on the left hand of the Judge,
refused all their counsel, and despised their admonitions.
Ministers of the gospel will testify that they came as
ambassadors from the King of kings, and beseeching
you, in Christ's stead, to be reconciled to God, pointing
to the coming wrath, and warning you from that wrath to
flee; and yet their labor of love ye despised, and scorned
the message from on high. The Bible will be a witness
against you. Its teachings are able to make wise unto
salvation. It is the chart which is given to guide us
through this wilderness-world, to fairer worlds on high. It
tells of the Lamb of God, who taketh away the sin of the
world. It is truth without any mixture of error, and yet you
have despised this necessary revelation, and chosen to
perish, with the Word of Life open before you. God, the
Father, will be a swift witness against you. In the
greatness of His love for you, in the counsels of eternity, He
<pb id="aughey407" n="407"/>
devised the plan of salvation, and sent His only
begotten Son to suffer and die, that you might live, and
yet you have despised that love, and rejected that
Saviour. God, the Son, will bear this testimony,
that He came from the shining abodes of glory,
where seraphim and cherubim fell prostrate at His
feet, in humble adoration and emptying Himself of
His glory, bore all the ills of life—the persecutions
of wicked men, and the accursed death of the cross,
that salvation might be yours, and yet ye refused it,
and trod the blood of the Son of God under foot, and
put him to an open shame. The Holy Spirit, the
Third Person of the adorable Trinity, will bear
witness that He often knocked at the door of your hearts
for admittance; that He wooed you to embrace His
love, offering to abide with you forever, and yet you
rejected the offer, and did despite to the Spirit of Grace,
till, in sorrow, He took His everlasting flight.</p>
          <p>The devil is now going about as a roaring lion,
seeking whom he may devour. And sometimes
transforming himself into an angel of light, he is tempting
you to sin, by presenting before your minds the
superior charms of the riches and pleasures of earth,
to things, that are unseen and eternal. He has no
power to compel you to sin. His evil suggestions
are whispered in your oft too willing ears, and then
it remains with you to accept or reject. He has no
power of compulsion. Your sin must be an act of
your own will, or it is not sin. When you consent
to the wiles of this arch enemy, and sin against God,
<pb id="aughey408" n="408"/>
remember that with eager desire and base ingratitude he
will fiercely accuse in the great day of God Almighty,
and urge these very sins of his suggestion as a reason
that he should have you to torment you forever in the
bottomless pit.</p>
          <p>That internal monitor, that light which enlightens
every man that cometh into the world—the moral sense,
or conscience—will be a swift witness against you. By it
you have been enlightened and warned; and in the case
of many who have denied a future state of punishment,
the goadings of remorse have convinced them that there
is a hell, the kindlings of whose fires they have felt in
their own bosoms. Conscience will compel you to
confess that your doom is just, though forever debarred
from the joys and happiness of heaven. O! my fellow-prisoners
and travelers to the bar of God, listen to her warning
voice to-day, before it be too late, and you are compelled
mournfully to exclaim, “The harvest is past, the summer
is ended, and I am not saved!” The conscience of the
sinner will be compelled to admit the truth of the
testimony. In earthly courts, oftentimes witnesses are
suborned, and their testimony false. Not so at the grand
assize. Not a scrap of false testimony will be admitted.
The evidence will be in truth, and the judgment in
righteousness.</p>
          <p>After all these scenes have occurred, the Judge will
render a verdict, and pronounce the sentence, which will
be irreversible and eternal. With regard to the righteous,
though they have been guilty of many sins,
<pb id="aughey409" n="409"/>
both of omission and commission, and have no merits of
their own to plead, and consider themselves justly
obnoxious to eternal banishment, their Advocate, the Lord
Jesus Christ, in whom, while in the flesh, they exercised a
true and living faith, will now present them, clad in the
white robes of His perfect righteousness, faultless before
His Father, and they will now hear the welcome plaudit,
“Come, ye blessed, inherit the kingdom prepared for you
from the foundation of the world.” But those on the left
hand, who all their life rejected the mercy offered—the great
salvation proffered without money and without price—will
now hear the dread sentence, “Depart, ye cursed, into
everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels!”</p>
          <p>O my dear, impenitent fellow-prisoners! how can ye take
up your abode, your eternal abode, in everlasting
burnings? How can ye dwell with devouring fire? How
can ye endure everlasting destruction from the presence
of the Lord and the glory of His power, shut up forever in
the fearful pit out of which there is no egress except for the
vision of the damned, and the smoke of its torment? Be
wise to-day, 'tis madness to defer. Procrastination is the
thief of time. Delay is fraught with awful danger. Trust not
in promises of future amendment. The way to hell is
paved with good resolutions, which are never kept. The
future convenient season never arrives. Like Felix, we may
tremble when the minister reasons of a judgment to come;
and like Agrippa, we may
<pb id="aughey410" n="410"/>
be almost persuaded to be Christians, and yet come short
of the glory of God through procrastination.
Procrastination has populated hell. All the doomed and
damned from Christian lands are victims of this
pernicious and destructive wile of the devil. It is foolish
to procrastinate. Though the Bible teems with rich and
glorious promises of a hundred-fold blessings in this life,
and eternal glory in the world to come, to those who
break off their sins by righteousness, and their
transgressions by turning unto the Lord, yet all these
promises are limited to the present tense. There is not a
single blessing promised the future penitent. He
procrastinates at the risk of losing all. Behold, <hi rend="italics">now</hi> is
the accepted time, and <hi rend="italics">now</hi> is the day of salvation. <hi rend="italics">To-day</hi>
if ye will hear his voice, harden not your hearts.
“Ho, every one that thirsteth, <hi rend="italics">come</hi> ye to the waters; and
he that hath no money, <hi rend="italics">come</hi> ye, <hi rend="italics">buy</hi> and <hi rend="italics">eat</hi>; yea,
<hi rend="italics">come, buy</hi> wine and milk without money and without
price.” “Seek ye <hi rend="italics">first</hi> the kingdom of God and his
righteousness.” “And the Spirit and the Bride say,
<hi rend="italics">come;</hi> let him that heareth say, <hi rend="italics">come;</hi> and let him that is
athirst, <hi rend="italics">come;</hi> and whosoever will, let him <hi rend="italics">take</hi> the water
of life freely.”</p>
          <p>Choose ye <hi rend="italics">this day</hi> whom ye will serve. There is no
warrant for deferring till to-morrow the momentous and
eternal interests of the immortal soul. The shortness and
uncertainty of life furnish a strong reason that we should
not procrastinate. In the Bible, life is compared to
everything that is swift,
<pb id="aughey411" n="411"/>
transient, and fleeting in its nature. It is compared to the
swoop of the eagle hastening to the prey; to
the swift post, to the bubble on the river. Life is
compared in its duration to a year, a day, and to nothing,
yea, less than nothing, and vanity. All
these comparisons indicate that it is very brief and
evanescent. We have no lease of life; we hold it by a very
slight tenure; and this is especially true of us in our
present condition. Confined in prison, some of us led to
death every day without a moment's warning, every
evening I address some who, before the next evening, are
in eternity. Myself in chains, my life declared forfeited,
ought we not all to be deeply impressed with the
necessity of immediate preparation to meet our God?
I feel that I am preaching as a dying man to dying men,
and I beseech you in Christ's stead, be ye reconciled to God. Believe in the
Lord Jesus Christ, and ye shall be saved. Trust in Him for salvation,
for He is faithful who has promised. God has never said to any,
seek ye my face in vain. By the love and mercy of God,
by the terrors of the judgment, by the sympathy
and compassion of Jesus, I entreat you, my
fellow-prisoners, to seek an interest, a present interest, in
the great salvation!</p>
          <p>I close for the present. We shall never all engage
in divine service together again on earth. We separate
—some to go to a distant prison, and some to death. May
God grant that when we are done with earthly scenes, we
may all meet in the realms of bliss,
<pb id="aughey412" n="412"/>
where there is in God's presence fulness of joy, and at his
right hand pleasures forevermore! And may the love of
God, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and the
communion of the Holy Spirit, rest and abide with us,
and all the Israel of God, now, henceforth, and forever,
Amen!</p>

          <p>I preached longer than I had intended, having become
so fully engrossed with the subject as to forget my
chains and my frustrated plans. My fellow-prisoners were
listening apparently with interest; great solemnity
prevailed, and penitential tears were flowing. It was
evident that the Spirit of the living God was in our midst;
and though danger and death were before our eyes, the
consolations of
<pb id="aughey413" n="413"/>
the glorious gospel of the blessed God caused our peace
to flow like a river. The precious seed was sown
in tears. May we not entertain a good hope that he
who cast the seed into this soil, prepared by affliction,
shall come again with rejoicing, bringing his sheaves
with him.</p>

          <head>AMERICAN SLAVERY AS IT NOW STANDS REVEALED
TO THE WORLD.</head>
          <bibl><sic corr="[">(</sic>From <hi rend="italics">Good Words</hi>, edited by Norman McLeod, D.D., and published in
Edinburgh and Glasgow, Scotland.]</bibl>
          <p>Whatever may be yet the issue of the American
conflict, it will have done two great things,—it will have
cast a flood of light upon the condition of the American
slaves,—it will have given freedom to great masses of
them, if not to all.</p>
          <p>Until the secession war broke out, the means of
accurately ascertaining the positive conditions of the
slave in the United States were scanty, and to a great
extent doubtful. On the one hand, we had the
representations of masters and of their friends. These
were always likely to be warped by self-interest; even
when most sincerely meant, to exhibit but a portion of
the truth. In all countries the best employers are the most
accessible, the most willing to come forward in testimony
of the condition of the employed; yet none are generally
more ignorant of the worst practices used in their trade.
How much more must this be the case in the slave
system, where every possible malpractice in the
employment of labor must be intensified a hundredfold,
by the practically absolute powers of the master, and by
the darkness with which he has the right to surround
his proceedings. Here evidently those who come into the
light of publicity will be those only who
<pb id="aughey416" n="416"/>
have no cause, or think they have no cause, to fear it; and
who, living in comparative light themselves, have no idea
of what may be passing in the dens of darkness around
them. The tendency of slave-owning is, moreover,
emphatically, one of insulation. The best of slave-owners
as well as the worst would fain have never a neighbor,
since all intercourse with other plantations tends to
undermine either the slave-owner's moral or his physical
authority.</p>
          <p>Now slavery has come to be seen at once in all its
breadth and in all its detail. Where formerly it
could only be outlined or lightly sketched from a few
points of view, it may now be photographed in its
minutest features, and from every point. The mass
of testimony is overwhelming, and may be checked
and counterchecked from white to black and from
black to white to any extent. But an ugly picture
it offers, look at it how and whence you will. For
the result of all this mass of new evidence is simply
this,—that the worst that has been hitherto said by
isolated voices against American slavery, has been
abundantly confirmed; that the distant picture of it
has turned out faint and pale beside the reality; that
contact with the “patriarchal institution,” so far
from converting one sincere abolitionist from the errors of
his ways, or confounding one dishonest one, has turned
into ardent abolitionists, hundreds and thousands of
men who, when they first went down South, were
avowedly strong pro-slavery men.</p>
          <p>The legal elements of the slave's condition have
<pb id="aughey417" n="417"/>
long since been known. They are all mainly summed up in
this: He is not a person, but a thing; at least as towards
his master, he or she has no signal honor, no family ties.
There is no punishment under any of the southern slave-codes
for the worst outrage by a master on a slave
woman's virtue, on a slave man's marriage-tie; no legal
limit to the uses to which he may put either. The slave has
no rights of property; is legally forbidden to develop his
intellect by education.</p>
          <p>Instead of saying, Because slaves are property they
will be well treated, the true reasoning is, Because slaves
are property, therefore they will be ill-treated, therefore
they will surely call forth against them in many an
instance every latent capacity of absolute devilhood
which lies in the master's bosom.</p>
          <p>Are you sorry that this should be so? God forbid.
As is the tree, so is its fruit. Thank God that men do not
gather grapes of thorns, or figs of thistles! else would
they allow the whole world to be over-spread of them. Let
the thorn tear, let the thistle prick, that man may know
that they are there simply to be fought with and rooted
out.</p>
          <p>Now the worst side of slavery is no doubt the
moral side of it. Though it had no evil physical side to it,
it would yet be abominable. Though every slave had
plenty to eat, plenty to drink, good shelter, good
clothing, moderate work, skillful care in sickness, it is yet
hideous that a man should not be a man, a husband not a
husband, a father not a
<pb id="aughey418" n="418"/>
father. But the war has shown that the physical
maltreatment of slaves was anything but a rare
exception.</p>
          <p>An officer, writing from Louisiana to the <hi rend="italics">Boston
Transcript</hi>, stated that not one recruit “in fifteen is
free from marks of severe lashing,” and that “more
than one-half * * are rejected” (the rejections
being themselves more than half of the number that
offer) “because of disability, arising from lashing of
whips, and biting of dogs on their calves and
thighs;” whilst Mr. Wesley Richards, a surgeon,
writing May 25, 1863, to the Cincinnati <hi rend="italics">Free Nation</hi>,
after examining about 700 recruits, says that “at
least one-half bore evidence of having been severely
whipped and maltreated in various ways;” some
“stabbed with a knife, others shot through the limbs,
some wounded with clubs until their bones were
broken,” and others had their hamstrings cut to prevent
their running off. And General Saxton, in
command of the Department of the South (comprising
South Carolina, Georgia, Florida), on being examined
before the “Freedmen's Inquiry Commission,” stated
that there was scarcely one of the negroes whose back
was not “covered with scars.” East and West, it will be
seen, the testimony is the same.</p>
          <p>The Rev. William Taylor, in a pamphlet on the “Cause
and probable results of the Civil War in America,”
relates the following, which has the advantage of
showing the patriarchal institution under its “pious”
aspect:</p>
          <pb id="aughey419" n="419"/>
          <p>“A dear friend of mine, in my native county, in
the Shenandoah Valley, Virginia, was passing the
house of a neighbor, and saw in the barn-yard,
suspended from a beam * * * a colored woman
hung up by her hands. She was nearly naked, had
been whipped until she was unable to moan aloud,
and had an ear of Indian corn stuck in her mouth
as a gag. In that condition she was left hanging till
her master should take his breakfast, <hi rend="italics">and have family
prayers.</hi> My friend went in to see him, and remonstrated in vain
to have her taken down, <hi rend="italics">till after the family devotions
were over.</hi>  * * * This pious (?) family I knew well, and
their three children, William, Arthur, and Adeline, were
taught authority between the ages of five and ten years
by being set to whip the said poor woman at will, and she
was beaten and scarred up so as to present a most unnatural
and hideous appearance.”</p>
          <p>But these are only the milder mercies of the eastern
seaboard. We must go to the dreaded Southwest to
find the lashings carried to the pitch of disabling
the sufferer—the stabbings, shootings, poundings of
limbs with clubs, cutting of hamstrings, of which
the surgeons speak. Yet the surgeons had nothing
to say but to men, and those living ones. In God's
avenging hosts, which we see not, there may be other
and more helpless recruits. The Rev. Mr. Aughey,
who was a minister in Mississippi at the outbreak of
secession, in a work called the “Iron Furnace,” tells
of some of these. “Mr. Pipkin, who resided near
<pb id="aughey420" n="420"/>
Holly Springs (Mississippi), had a negro woman
whipped to death while I was at his house during a
Session of Presbytery. Mr. Cole, of Waterford,
Mississippi, had a woman whipped to death by his
overseer. But such cruel scourgings are of daily
occurrence. * * * Mrs. Frederick recently
whipped a boy to death within a half a mile of my
residence. Old Mr. Cole, of Waterford, Mississippi,”
(apparently the same patriarch as before referred to)
“punished his negroes by slitting the soles of their feet
with his bowie-knife. One man he put into a cotton-press,
and turned the screw until life was extinct.
He stated that he only intended to alarm the man, but
<hi rend="italics">carried the joke too far.</hi>” 
Of course the laws which
exist in every state against the murder or torturing of
slaves are about as well observed as might be laws
enacted by wolves against sheep-murder, and providing
that between wolf and sheep no sheep could
be witness. Sometimes, indeed, in this black Southwest,
some peculiarly atrocious excess of patriarchalism
raises the horror even of the white crowd, and
the offender is lynched or his or her home burnt
down. But in no single one of the instances above
quoted do we find that any punishment was inflicted.
When Mrs. Frederick, of Mississippi, whipped her
slave boy to death, the coroner's jury returned a verdict
of death by cruelty; but Mr. Aughey expressly
states that “nothing more was done.”</p>
          <p>In the real South the lash is evidently a regular daily
element of the institution. “I am residing,” writes Mr.
<figure id="ill28" entity="aughey420"><p>THE BEGGAR. Page 435.</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey421" n="421"/>
Aughey, “on the banks of the Yockanookany. * * In this
vicinity there are large plantations, cultivated by
hundreds of negroes. * * * Every night the negroes are
brought to a judgment-seat. The overseer presides. If
they have not labored to suit him, or if their task is
unfulfilled, they are chained to a post and severely
whipped.” Of these overseers the writer has just said: “I
never knew a pious overseer—never. * * * Overseers, as a
class, are worse than slave-owners themselves. They are
cruel, brutal, licentious, dissipated, and profane. They
always carry a loaded whip, a revolver, and a
bowie-knife.” Such are the dispensers of the Southern
slave-owners' justice. Of course the terror they excite is
extreme; and the writer says he has known an instance of
a woman, through fright, giving birth to a child at the
whipping-post. It need hardly be said that it is at the
option of the overseer to strip the slaves to any extent.
“In Louisiana, women, preparatory to whipping, are often
stripped to a state of perfect nudity.” Black women
only, some aristocrat of color may think. “There is a
girl,” said one Colonel Hanna, a member of Mr. Aughey's
church, to the latter, “who does not look very white in
the face, owing to exposure; but <hi rend="italics">when I strip her to whip
her, I find that she has a skin as fair as my wife.</hi>” It is
thus evidently the habit of these Mississippi patriarchs
to strip and whip women as white of skin as their own
wives. And the slaves are so fond of the system that
“every night,” Mr. Aughey tells us, “the
<pb id="aughey422" n="422"/>
Mississippi woods resound with the deep-mouthed
baying of the blood-hounds.”</p>
          <p>Remember always, that, between Virginia, and even
South Carolina, on the one hand, and the Southwest on
the other, every intermediate stage must be supposed to
exist.<hi rend="italics"> E. g.</hi>, Mr. Taylor—a Virginian, let us recollect, of the
Shenandoah Valley, whose wife was brought up in
Alabama—mentions an instance in the latter state where a
master, riding home with a runaway, flogged the latter
with a heavy whip “till he sunk in his tracks, and died
within a few hours;” whereupon all the neighborhood
sympathized deeply with the patriarch who had lost so
valuable a man, and deemed the accident “a warning to
niggers to stay at home and mind their own business.”
“One beautiful Sabbath morning,” says Mr. Aughey,
“I stood on the levee at Baton Rouge, Louisiana, and
counted twenty-seven sugar-houses in full blast. I found
that the negroes were compelled to labor eighteen hours
per day, and were not permitted to rest on the Sabbath
during the rolling season. The negroes on most
plantations have a truck patch, which they cultivate on
the Sabbath. I have pointed out the sin of thus laboring
on the Sabbath, but they plead necessity; their children,
they state, must suffer from hunger if they did not
cultivate their truck patch, and their masters would not
give them time on any other day.” But even where the
work is not in itself so severe, it is made oppressive by
its continuousness. Thus, in the sea islands, where the
<pb id="aughey423" n="423"/>
hours of work were from daylight to five P.M., there
was no cessation of labor allowed for meals, and the
slave must eat whatever food he could get without
leaving off his hoeing or cotton picking. And those
who are most overworked are of course the weakest—those
least able to bear it—women and children.</p>
          <p>In passing from the physical to the moral aspects of
slavery, we are met by the great difficulty that a
large portion of its daily working consists really of
things such as should not be named among Christian men.
It is difficult for us to realize the fact that men and
women professing to be Christians should allow other
men and women around them, whom they
claim as their own property, to gratify their passions
like brute beasts, the name of marriage representing
a mere temporary relation. In the sea islands, Captain
Hooper bears testimony to the fact that “many of
the negro men have two or three wives, and children
by each.” The masters, it is distinctly stated, do not
care whether the slave women are married or not, so
long as they have children, nor have they, as a matter
of fact, any scruple in breaking up such unions. The
wife and children of Solomon Bradley, an “Uncle Tom”
among the Port Royal negroes, were sold away
some years ago, and he never expects to meet with them again.
Between white and colored it is a principle of law
throughout the slave states that there can be
no legal union. But the number of mixed bloods shows
that the white man's horror of “amalgamation” only
starts into vitality within the church
<pb id="aughey424" n="424"/>
door. On Port Royal island already the “yellow niggers”
form a considerable part of the population. “In almost all
the schools,” says Mr. Nordhoff, “You find children with
blue eyes and light hair—oftenest yellow.” Yet the
description lists found at Hilton Head of the slaves
shipped thence showed that the greater number of these
were mixed bloods. Now as such shipments are almost
universally for the dreaded South, it follows that the
“patriarchs” and their overseers send their own offspring
to a harsher slavery than that around themselves. And,
owing partly to these shipments of the mixed breeds,
partly to the more unbridled licentiousness of the whites
themselves, it appears beyond a doubt that in the South
and Southwest the proportion of “white” and “yellow
niggers” is far higher than in the eastern states. Mr.
Aughey speaks of preaching “to a large congregation of
slaves, the third of whom were as white as himself,” some
with red hair and blue eyes. We remember that slave in
Mississippi whose skin, when she was stripped for
whipping, was as white as that of her master's wife. Mr.
De Camp, the surgeon above referred to, speaks of
having seen standing before him three negro recruits, in
whom <sic>the</sic> “the most critical examination could not detect
the slightest trace of negro blood.” General MacDow
says that in the district of Louisiana which he is writing
from, there are very few slaves of unmixed negro blood. It
is notorious that many planters have families of white
and families of colored children, and perhaps give the
<pb id="aughey425" n="425"/>
latter to wait on the former. Remember always that
the chastity of the slave has <hi rend="italics">no</hi> legal protection. I
cannot here enter into details; suffice it to say that
the slave system has ere this enforced incest at the
will of the master. But, without descending to such
horrors, let any of my countrywomen picture to herself
what must be the lot of women (often, as we
have seen, as white as herself) placed from year's end
to year's end under the absolute control of an overseer
such as Mr. Aughey, and in fact almost all witnesses,
describes—“cruel, brutal, licentious,” always
armed with the loaded whip, the bowie-knife, and the
revolver—liable, too, at any time, without any recourse
under heaven, to be sold or hired out into
harlotry, as is practically done in every southern city
—and then say whether the system in which such things
are possible has the right to insult God and man any
longer by its existence.</p>
          <p>Treating the slave thus like a brute, none could feel
surprised if he were to become such. The colored
witnesses who have been examined before the Freedmen's
Inquiry Commission are very frank on the
subject of the moral condition of their race. The
slaves, says Robert Small—a bold fellow, who ran a
steamer, the “Planter,” out of Charleston Harbor,
past Sumter and its dangers, to join the Federal fleet,
a feat which Mr. Nordhoff calls “one of the bravest
and most brilliant acts of the war”—are very envious
of one another, cannot bear to see any one of their
number advanced to any position which all cannot
<pb id="aughey426" n="426"/>
reach, and will resort to any means in their power to
degrade him. They are, as slaves, selfish, cowardly,
untruthful, thievish. Though they have strong religious
impulses, their religion is little more than
sentiment. Even professedly pious slaves have often
no scruple in “taking” from their masters—the term
“stealing” being reserved for thefts as between
themselves—the general argument being that, as their
masters take everything from them, they may take
back what they can. And let it always be remembered
that the negro has no means of self-improvement.
A father is known to have received twenty
lashes for teaching his son to read. “In Mississippi,”
says Mr. Aughey, “a man who taught slaves to
read or write would be sent to the penitentiary instanter.”
As a matter of fact, out of the eight thousand slaves
whom the occupation of Port Royal threw upon the
hands of the Federal government, only a very few had
picked up the elements of book learning, and a couple of
the older men were able actually to read. And whilst the
means of self-instruction are forbidden by law, religious
teaching is entirely subject to the discretion of the master.
If the preacher does not preach sound patriarchal
doctrine he is either hunted out of slavedom or lynched
within it.</p>
          <p>The jargon used by the slave is of itself sufficient
proof of the degradation to which he has been reduced.
It is not, like the dialects and <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">patois</hi></foreign> of our own
country, of France, Germany, Italy, a form of speech probably
<pb id="aughey427" n="427"/>
coeval with the language, and which had originally
as good a chance of developing into the standard one. It
is a mere corruption of the master's language, the fruit of
estrangement and neglect.</p>
          <p>Such, then, is southern slavery, as it now stands
thoroughly revealed to the world—a system which, aiming
at treating black men as brutes, not only succeeds in
making them such, but generally makes two brutes for
one—the white and the black. Mr. Aughey, after an
experience of eleven years in eight different slave states,
declares that he has “never yet seen any example of
slavery” that he did not “deem sinful.” He “cannot do
otherwise than pronounce it an unmitigated curse” to
white and black alike.</p>
          <p>There is but one touch to add to the above picture.
Bad as it was in itself, slavery was getting worse. South
Carolina—the acknowledged pioneer of secession, which
tried thirty years ago, by means of “nullification,” to
throw off the control of the Federal authority; which was
the first to declare actual secession, the first to fire upon
the Federal flag, the first to reduce a Federal fort by force
of arms—is a state which, as one of the luminaries of
secession, the Hon. L. W. Spratt, has declared, fairly
exhibits “the normal nature of the institution” in a
population where the slaves outnumber the freemen by
120,000. Yet in this state the Freedmen's Inquiry
Commissioners emphatically declare slavery “has been
darkening in its shades of inhumanity from year to year.” They
found “conclusive evidence that half a century since
<pb id="aughey428" n="428"/>
its phase was much milder than now. It is the uniform
testimony of emancipated freedmen from this state,
above the age of sixty, that in their youth slavery was a
merciful and considerate system compared with what it
has been for thirty years past. These old men are bright
and intelligent compared with the younger field hands, in
many of whom a stolid, sullen despondency attests the
stupefying influence of slave-driving under its more
recent phase.”</p>
          <p>And what is true of South Carolina is true of all the
South. Within the last quarter of a century especially,
slavery, from a mere practice, has grown into a system
and a creed. Its economic powers have been calculated
to the last figure. It has reckoned exactly what work
could be got out of a man at every species of labor—how
many years he should “last” at cotton-growing, how
many at rice-growing, how many at sugar-growing, etc.;
the relative advantages of driving him—<hi rend="italics">i.e.</hi>, killing him off
quick—or husbanding his strength, have been discussed; and food,
clothing, shelter, have been regulated with reference to
the data obtained. On the other hand—since by one of the
most inflexible, most awful, yet most salutary, rules of
God's government, those who “set up their idols in their
heart, and put the stumbling-block of their iniquity
before their face,” when they inquire of the Lord, shall
always be answered “according to the multitude of their
idols,” so the South, proclaiming the evil thing slavery to
be good, has thought to find its consecration even in
that Book which is a
<pb id="aughey429" n="429"/>
message to all mankind of deliverance from every shape
of bondage; and it has hardened itself in this
faith, and its priests and prophets have been deceived
of the Lord to speak lies in its ears, to prophesy unto
it the smooth things which it loved, till at last, in its
devilish pride, unable to brook the very contact of
freedom, it turned away as from an accursed thing,
and would fain set up its own model republic, based,
said its vice president, “upon the great truth that the
negro is not equal to the white man; that slavery,
subordination to the superior race, is his natural and
normal condition.”</p>
          <p>And then were seen upon the walls of slavery's palace
fingers of a man's hand, writing <hi rend="italics">“Mene, mene, Tekel * *”</hi>
Then struck for the Southern slave an hour such as his friends afar off had
scarcely hoped to see, but which, with blind God-sent
instinct, he seems himself to have been long waiting for.
From the moment that the secession flag was raised,
slavery, as all see now, was doomed.</p>
          <p>And while we may admire the gallantry with which
the southern slave-holders have carried on the contest
with the North; and may do full justice to the purity of the
motives which led a Stonewall Jackson into the thick
of so many a fight, we must remember that the heroic
defense of Vicksburg or Sumter no more
palliates southern slavery than did the heroic defense
of Jerusalem by the Jews palliate the crucifixion of our Lord.</p>

          <head>MEMORIAL SERVICE.</head>
          <p>Rev. J. H. Aughey, Commander of Geo. Hunter Post,
No. 145, G. A. R., will deliver the annual sermon
preceding memorial day, on Sunday, May 14th, at 10:30
A. M. in the Presbyterian church. Geo. Hunter Post will
attend in a body and members of Co. A, 7th Regt., are
requested to meet at the Hall at 10 o'clock to march to the
church to attend service.</p>
          <p>The following prayer was offered before the sermon:</p>
          <p>Almighty God, humbly we come before Thee, our
Creator, Preserver, Guide, and Protector. We thank Thee
for our lives, for the mercy that has kept us until this
hour; for Thy guidance in our marches by day and by
night; for Thy constant care in the hour of danger, and
for the preservation of our national
<pb id="aughey433" n="433"/>
integrity and unity. We thank Thee that so many of us
have been permitted by Thy providence to assemble here
this day to worship Thee, and to meet our former
companions in arms and to rejoice with them that war's
deadly blast has blown by and that gentle peace has
returned, and that Thou didst grant the victory to those
who contended for human rights and national integrity
and for the subversion of rebellion by the re-establishment
of constitutional law and national
supremacy. Be graciously near to our comrades who
suffer from disease or wounds and to the widows and
orphans of those who fell in our holy cause. In all
distress comfort them, and give us willing hearts and
ready hands to supply their needs. Grant that the memory
of our noble dead, who so freely gave their lives for the
land they loved, may dwell ever in our hearts. God bless
our country, Bless all its loyal defenders and well
wishers. Ever subvert rebellion and all traitorous designs
against the land we love the best. Keep our names on the
roll of Thy servants, and at last receive us into that better
country, where there is fullness of joy, and at Thy right
hand pleasures forevermore, where Thou art the Supreme
Commander. We ask all in the name of Jesus Christ, our
Lord, Amen!</p>
          <p>The following is the sermon of Rev. J H. Aughey at
the Presbyterian church, Farmington, Ill. Geo. Hunter
Post and Co. A, Militia, attended <foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">en masse</hi></foreign>:</p>
          <p>“And the soldiers likewise demanded of Him, saying,
and what shall we do?” Luke iii. 14. The
<pb id="aughey434" n="434"/>
word of the Lord came to John the Baptist in the
wilderness and he came into all the country about Jordan
preaching the baptism of repentance for the remission
of sins. His words were in demonstration of the Spirit and
in power. The Jewish church was asleep, vital piety was
well-nigh extinct. They were resting in forms. Though
strict in the observance of ceremonial law, they knew
nothing experimentally of true repentance, a turning from
sin unto God. Supreme love of God and equal love of their
fellow men formed no part of their creed. John the Baptist
announced himself as the forerunner of the Messiah
whom the Jews were now expecting. His strange aspect,
coarse apparel, manner of life, startling doctrine, intense
earnestness, and his unflagging zeal, attracted universal
attention. Multitudes flocked to his ministry and heard
him enunciate truths to which they had been strangers.
Many were convinced and convicted, and professing
repentance were baptized. Seeing the Scribes and
Pharisees in attendance upon his ministry, whose traits of
character were hypocrisy, falsehood, and avarice, he
exclaimed, Oh! generation of vipers, who hath warned you
to flee from the wrath to come. Plain, pungent preaching,
but presenting a true description of their character.
He then instructs them in duty. Bring forth fruits meet
for repentance. The people then wished to learn their
duty, and he enjoins charity. The man that has clothing
and food must impart to him that is destitute. When the
tax-gatherers made the
<pb id="aughey435" n="435"/>
inquiry, what must we do, he informed them that they
must exact no more than that which is appointed them.
The sin of fraud or extortion was the one to which they
were addicted and they needed special instruction on this
point. Then came the soldiers and made the inquiry of the
text, and what shall we do? They had professed
repentance and desired baptism, and they wished to learn
what were the fruits meet for repentance in their case.
Repentance includes faith and true faith includes
repentance. When the convicted sinner comes to the
minister or Christian layman for instruction, saying, men
and brethren what must we do? The answer must
invariably be given, believe on the Lord Jesus Christ and
thou shalt be saved. God, the proprietor of salvation, has
the right to ordain the condition upon which he will
bestow it. He has done this, making no other condition
than that of simple faith. Faith comes without money and
without merit, and appropriates all the blessings of the
everlasting covenant. Faith honors God, it takes Him at
His word. It believes in the sincerity of his offer and
accepts His mercy. Faith realizes the inability of paying the purchase
price of salvation, and rejoices that it is freely
offered. Were it otherwise it would be impossible
to the sons of men. Nor does faith plume itself on
its own merit, for it recognizes the fact that it is
merely a receptive grace and he who exercises it is
no more deserving than the beggar who accepts the
alms of the beneficent. Faith is not a simple reception
<pb id="aughey436" n="436"/>
of testimony concerning Christ. It is a grace which
is the gift of God. It is a new operative vital principle in the soul.
It works by love. It is divinely energetic. Faith is a depending, self-emptying,
self-denying grace, and casts every crown before the throne.
Unbelief is a habit of the mind, formed in opposition to
the instincts of man's moral nature, and is a sin against
the soul. It is a sin against the remedy, and by its very
nature precludes salvation. Faith is a belief of the
precepts and implicit trust in the promises. Faith in Jesus
Christ is a saving grace, whereby we receive and rest on
Him alone for salvation as He is offered to us in the
gospel. The soul is the life of the body, faith is the life
of the soul, and Jesus Christ is the life of faith. God is
good and wise and faithful and true. He is omnipresent
and omnipotent. We may implicitly trust in one
possessing all these attributes. We would be verily guilty
of a great sin to do otherwise. A commander in the army
who was good, wise, brave, and always sought to
promote the best interests of the soldiers in his command,
deserved the obedience and esteem of them all, and the
soldier who was guilty of insubordination deserved
punishment to the extent of his demerit. Those who
disobey the King of Kings, much more deserve
punishment.</p>
          <p>John the Baptist said to the soldiers, do violence to
no man, neither accuse any falsely, and be content with
your wages. What glorious fruits would follow
obedience to these injunctions. Discipline is
<pb id="aughey437" n="437"/>
essentially necessary. A regiment of well disciplined
soldiers will put to flight twenty thousand undisciplined
men. Without discipline an army is a mere rabble of little
worth when confronting an enemy. In order to proper
discipline, the recruit must study military tactics and
attend drill regularly. The Christian soldier must to this
end study the Bible. There he learns all about the wiles
and stratagems of his enemies and how to circumvent
them. He learns what is duty on the march and in the
camp. He learns all about the necessary armor and how to
secure it. He learns the use of the sandals, the breastplate,
the helmet, the girdle, the shield, and the sword. He in this
way becomes a good soldier of Jesus Christ. He learns not
to entangle himself with the affairs of this life, that he may
please Him who has called him to be a soldier.</p>
          <p>The remembrance of past perils and hardships forge
indissoluble bonds of friendship. Together you followed
Sherman to the sea. Together you stormed and carried
the heights of Lookout Mountain and gained a glorious
victory on Mission Ridge. Side by side you entered Fort
Fisher and placed the starry banner upon its ramparts,
deemed impregnable by its defenders. Animated by the
same spirit you turned the tide of battle at Five Forks, and
grandly assaulted and captured the Malakoffs and
Redans that formed the frowning battlements of
Petersburg. Together standing upon the <sic corr="summit">sumit</sic> of Round
Top you repelled the fierce onset of Lee's veterans and
made
<pb id="aughey438" n="438"/>
the field of Gettysburg grandly historic. Facing the
grape and canister and screaming shell and bursting
bomb, the leaden rain and iron hail, you followed the
starry banner in company on many a well fought field
till victory perched upon your standards, until your
country's liberty and integrity were preserved intact
beyond the shadow of a doubt, the possibility of a
peradventure, then you marched home arm in arm to
receive the plaudits and honors accorded by your
grateful countrymen. These hallowed recollections
and associations should burnish brightly friendship's
golden chain, and preserve intact and inviolable the
amity of the years that tried men's souls. Do not
make your comrade an offender for a word. Without
due reflection in an unguarded moment he may
have said something that gave offense. Think of
Champion Hill, and Black River Bridge, and Jackson,
and Vicksburg, where he faced the glittering
bayonet, and where he stood shoulder to shoulder
with the bravest of the brave, facing death with unblanched
cheek and without the tremor of a nerve,
caring not what became of himself so that the cause
which lay nearest his heart might triumph. Think
of his heroism and patriotism <hi rend="italics">and forgive</hi>. The
soldier of the civil war should do nothing that would
tarnish his well merited fame. He deserves well of
his countrymen. When the tocsin sounded the alarm,
when his imperiled country called her sons to arms,
he left home with all its ties and delightful environment,
and devoted health and life, yea, all his
<pb id="aughey439" n="439"/>
personal interests to her service and to do her high
behest. Republics are not always grateful. When
a boy, I remember that the place of honor was always
accorded to the surviving veterans of the Revolutionary
war. And a portion of every address upon
all public occasions was devoted to a recital of their
patriotic deeds. Now the graves of our deceased comrades
are decked with flowers by fair hands,
prompted by loving hearts. In coming years, ere the
departure to their Celestial home of the final corps
of the Grand Army of the Republic and of the
mighty host of loyal heroes who participated in the
war for the Union, the post of honor will be assigned
them whenever and wherever their venerated presence
is recognized in public assemblies. Were there present
here to-day a hero who had fought at Bunker Hill
and Germantown, or at Brandywine and Saratoga
and Yorktown, one who had witnessed the surrender
of Burgoyne and Cornwallis, you would be so engrossed
in contemplating this distinguished visitor
and in admiration of his heroic services in the dark days
of the Revolution that the services of the
hour would pass by unheeded. And at the close you
would crowd up and grasp him by the hand and
assure him of your deep gratitude for his inestimable
services in the achievement of our country's
independence. This honor will be accorded you, my
comrades, in coming years—even now you are receiving
the earnest of it, the first fruits of that greater
harvest which our surviving comrades will reap in
<pb id="aughey440" n="440"/>
the near future. The heroes of Chickamauga and
Antietam and Corinth and the Wilderness, and Tupelo
and Iuka, and a hundred other well fought fields, will be
held in honorable and everlasting remembrance by their
grateful fellow countrymen. Do nothing to forfeit the
respect and esteem in which you are deservedly held, or
to abate a jot of the meed of honor which is your due, so
that in coming years the marble monument which marks
your sleeping dust with deep cut letters may record but
truth when it recounts your virtues and speaks to
posterity of your sacrifices and perils in the subversion
of the rebellion which with treasonable hands sought the
overthrow of the Republic in the interests of a slave-holding
oligarchy. Comrades, you have not escaped
unscathed from the perils of camp life and the shock of
battle. Many bear honorable scars. Many carry crutch or
cane to support their tottering frames as they walk our
streets intent upon the pursuits and avocations by which
they procure their daily bread. 'Tis rare to find one who
does not suffer from some lesion as the result of his war
experience. But few murmur or complain of the pain they
endure. With unrepining fortitude they walk about our
streets and only those who are intimately acquainted
with them know that many of them are physical wrecks,
by maladies engendered in the service fast approaching
the vital part, the citadel of life, to still forever its
throbbing. More than half the survivors of the war have
crossed death's dark river and have entered upon their
<pb id="aughey441" n="441"/>
eternal destination, and we are following fast. During the
war four hundred thousand loyal men in camp, in prison,
and on the battle field, gave up their lives
to attest their love for the starry banner and the
principles it represents.</p>

Let us all so live that clad in the regulation uniform, the
conqueror's robe which has been washed white in the
blood of the Lamb, we may be accepted in that day and be
welcomed to the Grand Army above, the sacramental host
of God's elect—where we will forever praise Him who as the
Captain of our salvation, secured for us the inheritance
and who, giving us grace to conquer, if we prove faithful
unto death will bestow upon us a crown of life. A soldier
true to his country from patriotic motives has a title to
nobility more honorable than that conferred by royal
prerogative, but a soldier who is not only true to his
country but also true to his God—a loyal soldier of the
cross, is still more worthy of honor.</p>

          <p>There were devout soldiers in the days of our
Savior and His Apostles. Cornelius and the devout
soldier who journeyed from Joppa to Cesarea with a message
to Peter deserve honorable mention. Col. Gardiner, Gen. Havelock,
and Gen. Gordon, of the British army, were brave officers and
sincere Christians. In America our own Washington, Admiral
Foote, Commodore Stockton, and Gens. Howard and Fisk,
as well as many subalterns in the service, prove that high Christian
character is not incompatible with the soldier's profession. Let us
never forget that our great national destiny must be woven out of the
fibers of individual character and achievement. The life of the nation
is the life of its citizens.</p>
          <p>Let us see to it that though our days are but a hand-breadth, the nation's
recurring centennials of magnificent progress shall take no dimness nor
weakness from that strand which our little life has worked into it. The
soldiers said to John, “and what shall we do, that is, what shall we do
to escape condemnation, and bear fruit unto eternal life?”
Your first duty is to believe on the Lord Jesus Christ. Commit
all your interests for time and eternity unto Him. This Paul did,
and thus confidently affirms: “I know whom I have believed,
and am persuaded that he is able to keep that which I have committed
unto him against that day.” Are you ignorant? He is the All-wise God.
Are you weak? He is strong. Are you sinful? He was holy, harmless,
undefiled, and separate from sinners—the sinless one. Are you
<pb id="aughey443" n="443"/>
destitute of all things? In Him all fullness dwells.
Seek first the kingdom of God and His righteousness,
and all these things shall be added unto you. No
good thing will He withhold from them that walk
uprightly. Trust in the Lord and do good, so shalt
thou dwell in the land and verily thou shalt be fed.
Loving trust and trusting love is the essence of true
religion. Jehovah calls for volunteers. He wants
you to come and be mustered in as recruits in the
grand army of the church militant. He does not
wish you to be spiritual guerrillas, serving as suits
your own individual whim, under no recognized commander,
and liable to be cut off in detail or captured
and hanged as spies, or mere hangers on, receiving
neither pay nor honor. Enlist in the army of King
Immanuel. Fight the good fight of faith. Lay
hold upon eternal life. War a good warfare. Endure
hardness as becometh good soldiers. March
with unfaltering steps under the blood-stained banner
of the Cross toward glory, immortality, and
eternal life. We promise you wages. It may be,
while the conflict lasts, a fierce and agonizing
contest, and during life there is no discharge in this war,
but death you will receive your discharge, or rather
you will be translated from the church militant on
earth to the church triumphant in glory. Then you will
have a palace home by the crystal sea, a kingdom
and a crown will be given you as eternal in its
duration as the throne of God, and throughout the
ceaseless cycles of eternity you will sing the victor's
<pb id="aughey444" n="444"/>
song, and rejoice with your companions in glory, and
so be forever with the Lord. And now unto the
King eternal, immortal, invisible, the only true God,
be glory and honor, and dominion and power forever.
Amen.</p>

          <head>FROM MEMORIAL DAY ADDRESS BY REV. T. C. EVANS,
FARMINGTON, ILL.</head>
          <p>The urgent call of our country. The Union was not saved
by sentiment. Our nation cannot live on gush. Hard work,
faithful service is now demanded. At present I will not
speak of the two-horned moral monster now growing fat
beneath our flag. I mean Mormonism, with its bigamy and
polygamy. Just now I will not speak of that fiery, fatal,
infernal fiend which flourishes under the American ægis. I
mean the liquor traffic, with its long trail of slimy sins. Of
one crime I must now speak. Silence in this presence would
be sin. The crime is that of <hi rend="italics">tampering with the ballot-box.</hi>
It is the father of all evils to our land. It is moral treason. It
is Brutus sneaking with a concealed dagger to bury the
blade in the heart of the Nation. What is the ballot-box? It
is the heart and lungs of the Republic. It is the force that
sends the blood through the arteries of the Nation. It is
also the organ that cleanses the blood in the body politic.
The man or the gang that corrupts the ballot-box poisons
the blood of America. Can we allow that? No, never and be
worthy of the name of American. If our courts of justice
forget themselves so far as to permit the heart of justice
and the neck of franchise to be crushed under the heels of
legal technicality and judicial disagreement, the soldiers
must come to the rescue. Members of the Grand Army of
the Republic, keep your bayonets
<pb id="aughey446" n="446"/>
bright, keep your cannon clean, keep your powder
dry, keep your trust in God,  and when called on
smite to the ground the traitor at the voting poll,
even him that tampers with the ballot-box. If the
safety of Troy depended upon the preservation of the
statue of Pallas, so much more does the preservation
of the right of suffrage and the purity of the
ballot inure to the safety of the Republic. Hence
every president who will not as commander in chief
of the army protect every legal voter in casting his
ballot is recreant both to his oath and duty, and in
that case should be called to account for cowardice or
abetment.</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“There is a weapon surer set</l>
            <l>And better than the bayonet,</l>
            <l>A weapon that comes down as still</l>
            <l>As snow-flakes fall upon the sod,</l>
            <l>Yet executes a freeman's will</l>
            <l>As lightning does the will of God;</l>
            <l>Nor from its force nor bolts nor locks</l>
            <l>Can shield them—'tis the ballot-box.”</l>

          <head>THE UNITED STATES IN 1984.</head>
          <p>“This is a bad world,” President Dwight, of Yale,
used to say to his Senior class; “but, gentlemen, it
is a good world to do good in.”</p>
          <p>We were reminded of the president's remark on
reading the calculations of another clergyman, Mr.
F. B. Lincke, one of Queen Victoria's chaplains, who
has been ciphering out the destiny of the English-speaking
world. After doing a number of hard sums,
he comes to the conclusion that, one hundred years
from now, there will be nearly as many people speaking
the English language as there are now inhabitants
of the earth.</p>
          <p>He figures it up thus: Great Britain and Ireland,
seventy millions; South Africa, sixteen millions
Australia, forty-eight millions; Canada, sixty-four
millions; the United States, eight hundred millions;
total, nine hundred and ninety-eight millions.</p>
          <p>Having arrived at this enormous result, Mr.
Lincke enters upon conjectures as to the kind of
people those thousand millions are likely to be. He
has remarked, in reading the history of the past, that
<hi rend="italics">the dream of the philosopher comes true</hi>, and he thinks,
therefore, that what the best men and women are
now striving for with pen, tongue, and hand, will be
realized in and by that future multitude.</p>
          <p>They will all be in some degree educated. There
will be no class deaf to the wisdom of the age, blind
to its art, insensible to its aspiration. There will be
<pb id="aughey463" n="463"/>
no estates too large to be a good to the owners, and,
as a rule, the farmer will be the owner of the acres
he tills  “Landlordism,” so far as the naked land
is concerned, will not exist. The largest class will
be farmers, living on their own land, and holding no
more of it than they can utilize.</p>
          <p>The nations will live in peace through free-trade and
courts of arbitration, knowing no rivalry apart
from the generous strife to excel in the arts and the
virtues. Instead of contending on the field of battle
for vulgar and odious mastery, the nations will, as
Victor Hugo has it, give one another rendezvous at
International Expositions—the “true fields of battle”
for civilized men.</p>
          <p>There will be, of course, no such thing as rank or
caste, but every honest man will stand in all
companies the equal brother of the rest, whether he be
scavenger or statesman.</p>
          <p>Are these but the idle thoughts of an optimist?
That depends upon <hi rend="italics">us</hi>, who have the honor to inhabit
the English-speaking world at the present time. It
depends much upon the youngest of us who will live
in the dawn of that greater day, and some of whom
will be known as all but contemporaries of the thousand
millions who will speak our language in 1984.</p>

          <head>THE ENGLISH OR AMERICAN LANGUAGE.</head>
          <bibl>[From the Grammatical Guide.]</bibl>
          <p>The American language will be in the near future
the universal language. It is the commercial language
of the globe. It is the vernacular of Great Britain and
Ireland, and the United States, the two most enlightened,
powerful, and influential nations on the earth.
The infant Empires of Australia and New Zealand
speak it. The Republic of Liberia and the British
African Colonies will give the language to Africa<corr>.</corr>
Great Britain and her Colonial possessions comprise
one-fourth of the earth's inhabitants; the language
of the mother country is rapidly becoming the
language of her Colonies. All the countries speaking
this language are radiating centers whence emanate
the beams of lingual light which will ere long illume
the whole planet. Every year half a million Germans
and French are exchanging their language for
ours. Every idea that enters the mind, every shade
of meaning, every variety and contrariety of thought
and opinion, may be expressed with clearness, force,
and elegance in the language of America.</p>
          <p>The poet, the statesman, the divine, cannot find
amid earth's clashing tongues a better vehicle of
thought. Poverty of expression results only from
ignorance of the language, or from poverty of thought.</p>
          <p>The genius of Shakespeare, the sublime imagination
of Milton, the ennobling thoughts and grand
conceptions of the minor stars in the constellation of
<pb id="aughey465" n="465"/>
English literature, all found the amplest expression
in the Anglo-Saxon tongue. Bryant, Longfellow,
Whittier, Prescott, Bancroft, Fenimore Cooper, and
all the bright luminaries which shine in the galaxy
of American literature, found the utmost felicity of
expression in their own vernacular. The power of
speech is a great blessing conferred upon the human
race. The ability to hold intercourse with each other
by means of a language so full, so expressive, and so
forcible, is one of the greatest temporal blessings
which God has bestowed upon the American speaking
nations. It is our bounden duty to guard our
language from everything that militates against its
purity, from provincialisms, vulgarisms, slang, and
flash phrases which are insidiously creeping into the
colloquial dialect of the people. Unless we do this 
our language will soon undergo serious deterioration.
The pure in heart and life will sedulously cultivate
purity of speech. Nothing better indicates mental
and moral worth than a chaste and pure conversational
style. In order to form this style, study diligently
the writings of our standard authors, whose
works have stood the test of time and are still popular.
Make their style your own. Reject the ephemeral
trash, the mushroom literature of the day, which
panders to a depraved taste. Read it, and it will
vitiate and enervate your style. In order to cultivate
the greatest purity of expression and to form a
vigorous and chaste style, be a diligent student of the
Bible. Its sublime conceptions, its ennobling themes,
<pb id="aughey466" n="466"/>
its pure morality, its simple, chaste, vigorous, and
classic style, its wide range of subjects, will bestow
upon those who study it diligently a liberal education,
even though not conversant with any other volume,
while he who is versed in all human lore, and is ignorant
of the sacred Scriptures, cannot compete with
him who has made them a study. The greatest
statesmen and most distinguished authors, both English
and American, read the Bible daily. One object
they had in view was to improve their style, to acquire
fluency and felicity of expression. Shakespeare
was a student of the Bible, as his writings prove.
Milton made it a daily study, John Quincy Adams,
“the old man eloquent,” was well versed in its
sublime lore. Webster affirmed that he was more
indebted for his style to the Bible than to any other
volume. Make the Bible a daily study; become
familiar with its modes of thought and expression,
and your style will be free from redundancy,
meretricious adornment, slang, and vulgarity. It will be
correct, forcible, expressive. Every section of our
country has localisms, provincialisms, and incongruities
of speech peculiar to it. These should be carefully
avoided.</p>

        <div2 type="subchapter">
          <head>DUTY OF CHRISTIAN MINISTERS AND PEOPLE.</head>
          <p>The passage of Scripture—“My kingdom is not
of this world” (John xviii. 36)—is cited of late by
political speakers, and by religious and secular
papers, to show that ministers must keep hands and
<pb id="aughey467" n="467"/>
tongues off the politics of the day. There never
was a greater mistake and one leading to more
disastrous results to this or any other nation. This
Scripture is Christ's answer to Pilate's question:
“Art thou the king of the Jews?”  “Art thou a
<sic>a </sic>king?”  “Thou sayest that I am a king.”  “To
this end was I born, and for this cause came I into
the world, that I should bear witness to the truth.
Every one that is of the truth heareth my voice.”
Thus Christ confesses that he is king, but not of the
order of Pilate or kings of this world. His kingdom
is spiritual and eternal and sways a sceptre of
universal dominion.  “He does his pleasure in the
armies of heaven and amongst the inhabitants of this
world, there being none to stay his hand or say,
what doest thou?”  “My kingdom,” says Christ, “is
not of this world.” It is not of the same nature—it
is spiritual, holy, just, good, and from heaven. The
kingdoms of this world are from below, “out of the
sea and of the earth.” The kingdom of Christ is
“within men” in the kingdoms of this world, and
is the “salt of the earth,” “the light of the world.”
He came to bear witness to the truth, that is to
authoritatively declare and enjoin upon men the
will of God as the infallible rule of faith and practice,
in the church and state. There is no power but
of him. “By me,” he says, “kings rule and princes
decree justice. By me princes rule and nobles; yea,
all the judges of the earth.”</p>
          <p>It is impossible to separate religion and politics,
<pb id="aughey468" n="468"/>
that is the morals of civil government. God has
married them, and “what God has joined together
let not man put asunder.” Religion is the chief
corner-stone of this Republic. All our monuments,
histories, orators, and ministers bear witness to that.
Bishop McIlvaine says: “The Christian religion is
recognized as the religion of this nation.” Webster
says: “There is nothing we look for with more
certainty than this principle, that Christianity is a
part of the law of the land.” Jesus Christ the great
King and Head of the church, and “commander and
leader of the nations” of the earth, is ascended to
heaven to intercede for men, but he has left behind
him the ministers of the gospel and people of God as
the spiritual leaders and commanders of the people.
This great king says to his ministers: “Ye shall be
witnesses of me in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, and
to the uttermost parts of the earth.” Ministers
must in Christ's stead authoritatively declare his
will. When governments among men become unjust
and tyrannize over the people, or when they set
in motion for the sake of gain, or spoils of office,
some infernal machine that deprives the citizens of
his natural, inherent, God-given rights—life, liberty,
and happiness—then the ministers of the gospel as
“solemn legates of the skies,” must “thunder and
lighten” every Sabbath, as John Adams says the
ministers of Philadelphia did in 1774, or Rev.
Jacob Trout on the eve of the battle of Brandywine.
He cried “Soldiers, I look around upon your familiar
<figure id="ill30" entity="aughey468"><p>ALEXANDER KNEELING AT THE SHRINE OF ACHILLES. Page 480.</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey469" n="469"/>
faces with strange interest. To-morrow morning we
go forth to battle. Need I tell you that your
unworthy minister will march with you, invoking the
divine blessing of God's aid in the fight? Need I
exhort you to fight the good fight—to fight for your
homes, and your wives and your children?”</p>
          <p>Says Dr. Spring: “That great event in the history
of the world, the American Revolution, never
would have been achieved without the influence of
the pulpit.”  “The Puritan preachers,” says Lossing,
“promulgated the doctrine of civil liberty. By
degrees their pulpits became the tribune of the people,
and on all occasions the Puritan ministers were the
bold asserters of that freedom which the American
Revolution established.” The ministers of the
Revolution were partisans, hateful partisans in the
parlance of to-day. Says Thatcher, in his Military
Journal, May, 1775: “The clergymen of New
England are almost without exception advocates of
Whig principles; there are few instances only of the
separation of a minister from his people in consequence
of a disagreement in political sentiment. The
Tories censure in a very illiberal manner the preacher
who speaks boldly for the liberties of the people,”
etc. The tyranny of England was the overshadowing
curse of that day.</p>
          <p>What is the duty of the hour? Let the 3,575,000
Christian voters, headed by their ministers, look
out from among all the people the kind of men that
God wants to rule over men under him—“Able men,
<pb id="aughey470" n="470"/>
such as fear God, men of truth, hating covetousness”;
and walk up to the polls and elect them. The
Christian element in this land has the balance of
power, and woe unto them if they fail to use it
properly. Where are the great nations of antiquity?
How did they fall? By their own hands as national
suicides. How shall we stay this nation on its course
to ruin? Strike down the drink traffic, Sabbath-breaking
by great monopolies, and divide the public
lands among their rightful owners.</p>

Gen. Sherman, fired the public property belonging
to the Confederacy, which he could not remove,
lest it should fall into the hands of the approaching
Federal army. The buildings in which this property
was stored, while burning, communicated the fire to
the city. Upon the arrival of Gen. Sherman and the
surrender of the city to him, he made almost superhuman
efforts to save it from destruction, and all of
the city that escaped owed its preservation to his
clemency.”</p>
          <p>Messrs. Witherspoon and Knox had no doubt that
after Gen. Sherman's arrival some of his troops aided
<pb id="aughey471" n="471"/>
in promoting the conflagration, assisted by liberated
Unionist prisoners. In confirmation of their statement
they narrated this incident:</p>
          <p>“In 1861, Mr. Lemuel Lorimer strongly animadverted
upon the secession of South Carolina, and declared
himself to be an unconditional Unionist. Soon
a mob, led by Gen. Adams, ex-governor of S. C., and
other prominent citizens of Columbia, seized the
unfortunate Unionist, tied him to a post, and whipped
him severely, after which they put upon him a coat
of tar and feathers. Some one proposed to set him
on fire. This was opposed by some, as be might
rush into a store or some building and start a
conflagration. At this moment a northern bound train
entered the depot. Gen. Adams suggested that it
would be well to send him North, among congenial
spirits, and thus have all their enemies in front.
This suggestion was approved by the majority. Mr.
Lorimer was unceremoniously hustled aboard the
train. Some now proposed to shoot him, and drew
their revolvers for this purpose, since their victim
refused to recant. Fearing that the lives of others
might be endangered, they refrained from shooting.
They then ordered a negro to go to him and collect
the fare. Mr. Lorimer said, ‘Put your hand in my
pocket and take the money, my hands are besmeared
and tied together, so that it is impossible for me to
comply with their demand.’ The colored man, at the
instigation of the crowd, withdrew Mr. Lorimer's
pocket-book, took from it ten dollars, and returned
<pb id="aughey472" n="472"/>
it. The train then started North, bearing this defenseless
victim of Confederate wrath, who was indeed
in a pitiable plight, but thankful to escape with life.</p>
          <p>“When Gen. Sherman entered Columbia, Mr. Lorimer
was an officer in his army. Mr. Lorimer's first
enquiry after entering this doomed city was for Gen.
Adams. He learned that he was not living. The
others who had maltreated him were all put to death
as soon as found. Not one was spared of those whom
he remembered as guilty of the flagrant outrage upon
his person. A life atoned for every lash he had
received. A number of Unionists were incarcerated in
prison in Columbia. They were under sentence of
death. These the Federal army released. In their
wrath they did not spare the burning city, but aided
in its destruction. Mr. Lorimer, after destroying
those who had so horribly abused him for his loyal
sentiments, burnt their dwellings, and this aided
materially in extending the conflagration.”</p>

          <head>MEMORIAL DAY—THE ADDRESS DELIVERED AT
CHARITON, IOWA, BY REV. W. F. BARTHOLOMEW.</head>
          <p>
            <hi rend="italics">Soldiers and Fellow Citizens:</hi>
          </p>
          <p>Toward the close of the war of the rebellion, the
graves of some soldiers were visited by a few patriotic
Christian ladies, by whom they were strewed
with sweet spring flowers. It was a simple act,
suggested by a womanly impulse, and they little thought
they were doing a thing which would so soon become
a national observance. Within a few years the custom
had become so widespread, that, in 1863, John
A. Logan issued an order from the head-quarters of
the Grand Army of the Republic, setting apart the
30th of May as a day to be thus observed throughout
the nation, in honor of its dead. The order was
soon ratified by many of the state legislatures, and
by congress for the District of Columbia, making
the day a legal holiday. In the spontaneous and
widespread popularity of this Memorial Day, I see
what is to me, full of hopefulness for the nation. I
see a necessity for the sentiments which these
commemorations express, and which they tend to
cultivate. I am aware that there are those among us who
affect contempt for what they choose to call “mere
sentiment.” But I insist that sentiment, so far from
being a useless thing, is as important to us as railroads
or mines or arms. The enthusiasms of the
world are begotten, not by syllogisms, nor by
statistics, but by what these people call sentiment.
<pb id="aughey474" n="474"/>
These sentiments are what make patriotism practical,
the raising of armies and navies possible. Without
them we should be but selfish individuals, and the
state would be impossible. Edward Everett, pleading
for the completion of Bunker Hill monument,
said, “I am asked, ‘What good will this monument
do?’ And I ask, What good does anything do?
What is good? I say that generous and patriotic
sentiments, sentiments which prepare us to serve our
country, are good—good, humanly speaking, of the
highest order. It is good to have them, good to
commemorate them, good to encourage them.”  A
country that may one day need citizens who would die for
it, had better encourage the spirit of her who was
willing to break the precious alabaster box of
spikenard, for the sake of a sentiment, than foster the
spirit of her practical-minded critic, who so soon sold
his Master for the price of a slave. The decoration
of these graves then, I understand to be not merely
a beautiful ceremony, but also an educator in the
truest elements of American citizenship.</p>
          <p>The impulse that called forth this observance was
not a new impulse, nor one peculiar to the American
people, but an impulse as old as the heart of man.
All civilized nations have in their own ways done
honor to their illustrious dead. The early Egyptians
embalmed their bodies and entombed them in costly
sarcophagi, and with them the records of their glory.
The early Greeks, and other ancient peoples, exalted
their heroes, and worshiped them as gods. Many of
<pb id="aughey475" n="475"/>
them they associated with the stars of night, where
some of the most brilliant constellations yet bear their
names. The Greeks and Romans raised monumental
pillars, and covered them with the names of those
who lost their lives in battle. One of these monumental
records has come down to our day, containing
the names of the men who fell at Potidæa. We find
in ancient Athens memorial rites very similar to our
own. They reach as far back as the battle of Marathon.
Their burial place was the Keramikus—the most
charming suburb of Athens—which stood on the
intersection of the great thoroughfares from east, south,
and west. Here they buried their soldiers who had
been brought home at the public expense; and here
they met annually to do them honor with offerings
of flowers and orations of eulogy, much as we do
today. Two of these funeral orations have come down
to us—one from, Lysias, and one from Pericles.
That you may see how much the Greek heart and
thought was like our own, I wish to quote a few
sentences from the oration of Pericles. He says,
“Before I praise the dead, I should like to point out
by what principles of action we rose to power, and
under what institutions and through what manner of
life our nation became great.” And in eulogy of the
dead, he says, “Their loftiest praise has been already
spoken; for in magnifying the city I have magnified
them, and men like them, whose virtues made her
glorious. They ran away from the world of dishonor;
but on the battle field their feet stood fast.
<pb id="aughey476" n="476"/>
And in an instant, at the height of their fortune,
they passed away from the scene, not of their fear,
but of their glory.” These words are as fit to be
spoken here to-day, as in Athens twenty-five centuries
ago.</p>
          <p>Of all peoples, we can least afford to be unmindful
of our nation's dead. It is therefore most fitting that
here, amid the vernal glories of the opening year, we
should turn aside from the rushing current of events,
and from the thronging cares which our prosperity
has brought upon us, and from our hearts do honor
to the men whose death made this prosperity
possible. It is not enough that their heroic deeds are
recorded in books of history.
<q direct="unspecified"><lg type="verse"><l>“For though, their names were graven on the sky,</l><l>To be forever read by every eye,”</l></lg></q>
still the affection of a grateful, loving people would
seek in some such way as this to give suitable
expression to the patriotic devotion it enkindles. No
words of mine can fitly speak the eulogy demanded
by this hour. And if eulogy were the whole duty
of this occasion, it would seem to me more fitting
that we should stand with bated breath and uncovered
heads, about these graves, which appeal to us
with a mute eloquence, more impressive far than
speech.</p>
          <p>But the observance of this day is not for the good or
pleasure of those whose graves we have decorated with
flowers. They are careless of the offerings we bring.
They are heedless to the praises we utter above them.
<pb id="aughey477" n="477"/>
These ceremonies are not for their sakes, but for our
own. The dead clamor not for our recognition, but
we cannot afford to withhold it. When a nation
becomes negligent of its dead, that nation will soon be
neglected by its living. When a people cease to
glory in their past, there will probably be little
worthy of glory in their future.</p>
          <p>It is the purpose of this observance, not only to
express patriotic gratitude and devotion, but also to
quicken and intensify them. The palace walls at
Versailles are hung with paintings representing all
that is glorious and heroic in French history. One
has said of them, “If I were emperor of the French,
before I sent my soldiers to battle, I would march
them through these galleries, and I think I should
thus make them invincible.” We stand in thought
to-day before the heroism of the war. Let me point out
some ways in which this occasion may be made to
quicken and strengthen the patriotic sentiments of
our people.</p>
          <p>This memorial service revives memories of the
war. Twenty-three years have passed since the close
of the war; so it has almost become an event of a
past generation. These years have been too full of
exciting events to allow men to live much in the
past. A look backward to the close of the war
reveals to us the wonderful progress this nation has
made in a quarter of a century. It would not be in
place here to dwell upon the details of this progress;
but these have been years of activity, and not of
<pb id="aughey478" n="478"/>
reflection on the past. Besides, those reminders of the
war, at first so numerous, the maimed and crippled
soldiers upon our streets, have become less and less
frequent, as these enfeebled veterans have dropped
into their graves before their time. The parents who
sent sons to the war, are dead, or decrepit with age.
The girls whose hearts went to the front with the
“brave boys,” are elderly matrons now, and the
soldier's baby now has children of his own. A few
among us to-day will cross these years by one leap
of thought, and, neglectful of all the years have been
or brought to them, will live over again the days
from '61 to '65—the enlistment, the drill, the excitement
of battle, the monotony of camp, and all the
experiences of war which none can picture but he who
has had them. These will come back to the soldier
to-day as he stands by the graves of his comrades.
Others will remember the loneliness when the boys
had gone, the waiting for news, the suspense after
battle, the reading long lists of names of killed and
wounded, in search of one name, the anxiety for the
boys in the hospital, or worse, in some southern
prison. How these memories rush in upon us to-day
—the waiting for news, the ebb and flow of feeling
they brought, the peril of the situation, and the fears
as to the outcome. Let us open wide the windows
of our souls, and give these memories free play; and
we shall be all the better for them.</p>
          <p>But this observance is not only fruitful in tender
memories, but is potent also as an instructor. A new
<pb id="aughey479" n="479"/>
generation has come to manhood and citizenship since
the war. A large majority of our people have no
personal knowledge or recollection of its events.
Among these are not less than two million voters.
Very soon all the men who defended the nation, in
its years of peril, will have dropped out of public
life. Already the places of trust and power are
passing into the hands of men who have paid no
price for the nation's life. It has been thought that
frequent times of peril are necessary to prevent the
decay of patriotism. Rather let us keep our people
so familiar with our past perils, that patriotism shall
not die. A written history has never been found
sufficient for any people. The Hebrews were required,
at each returning season, with sprinkled blood,
and staff in hand, to eat the hasty meal of bitter
herbs, and unleavened bread, thus re-enacting the
scenes of that historic night when their fathers escaped
from Egyptian bondage. Jesus provided for the
writing of the Gospels, yet at the last hour he instituted
a simple feast, saying, “Do this in remembrance
of me.” So the church and the state have found a
necessity for these memorial occasions in the fact that
most people learn history in no other way. When
Israel was commanded to keep the Passover, this was
assigned as one of its uses: “When your children
shall say unto you, ‘what mean ye by this service?’
then ye shall say, ‘It is the sacrifice of the Lord's
Passover, who passed over the houses of the children
of Israel in Egypt, when He smote the first-born and
<pb id="aughey480" n="480"/>
delivered our houses.’ ” Men are ever debtors to the
past, for those inspirations which make great futures.
As the eager Elisha, gazing after the receding chariot,
caught the mantle of the ascending prophet; so by
studiously regarding the past, we become heir to its
spirit, and emulous of its achievement. Alexander
the Great was fascinated by Homer's Iliad. When a
boy, he slept with it under his pillow. When a
young man he crossed the Ægean, and kneeling at
the shrine of his illustrious ancestor, Achilles, he
there gathered, we are told, his inspiration for his
tour of Eastern conquest. So let America, year by
year, gather her young men about the graves of her
heroic dead, and there teach them the virtues that
inspired their fathers in her time of peril. Tell them
that 500,000 lives laid down, and as many more cut
short by wounds and ill health, was the price paid
for their peace and prosperity. Tell them of Shiloh 
and Vicksburg, of Gettysburg and the Wilderness,
of Libby and Andersonville. If you would have
men willing to die for their country in the future,
you must let them see that the nation appreciates and
honors those who have died for her in the past.</p>
          <p>Let us learn here in the presence of these graves
how closely, and how necessarily, death and life are
bound up together. There is no life that springs not
forth from the darkness of death. Even these flowers,
with which, as emblems of immortality, we have
decorated these graves, were gathered from the
sepulcher of last year's glory—this is the law of nature.
<pb id="aughey481" n="481"/>
The chariot wheels of civilization have ever been
lubricated with human blood; and gory battle fields
have ever been the waymarks of human progress—
this is the law of civilization. Enter a yet higher
realm. You hear him who is above all, say, “The
hour is come that the Son of man shall be glorified.”
But how is he to be glorified? “Except a corn of
wheat fall into the ground, and die, it abideth alone;
but if it die it bringeth forth much fruit.” No truth
is more historic than that of vicarious sacrifice—of
some suffering, and dying, that others may live and
be happy. “No man liveth unto himself, and no man
dieth unto himself.”</p>
          <p>Let us learn, then, as another lesson of this hour,
that unselfishness, and generous public spirit are the
conditions and measure of our usefulness—that,
being such debtors to the past, we have no right to live
selfish lives—that he who does not contribute to the
common weal, as he has received from it, goes to his
grave a defaulter in trusts more sacred than funds
and stocks. The debt we owe to the past, we are to
pay to the future. Already, hands are stretched out
to us, authorized to receive God's per cent on the
blessings we enjoy.</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Not to ourselves are we living;</l>
            <l>Not to ourselves do we die.</l>
            <l>Freely receiving and giving,</l>
            <l>Soul after soul marches by.</l>
            <l>Parts of one mighty procession,</l>
            <l>Stretching from Eden's first dawn,</l>
            <pb id="aughey482" n="482"/>
            <l>On through long curves of progression,</l>
            <l>'Til in the future 'tis gone—</l>
            <l>Gone from earth's ken, past heart-beat and breath</l>
            <l>Into the life that is miscalled death.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>No memorial service for the dead can be sincerely
observed which does not more deeply impress us with
the sacredness of the trusts they have left to our
keeping. True honor to the dead soldier is closely
bound up with conscientious fidelity to his surviving
comrades. They are among us maimed, crippled,
sightless, bearing all sorts of disabilities as the result
of their service in the war. As they drop into their
graves from these disabilities, we deem them worthy
of like honor to those who died in battle. Far more
pleasing to them shall be the tokens of recognition
and reward that are ministered to them while they are
living, than honors when they are dead. It has
been said that “Westminster Abbey and monumental
Greenwood are the world's attempt to atone by 
honors to the dead, for wrongs to the living.” Let
not Decoration Day come into this condemnation.
There are those participating in these ceremonies who
will live into a generation which shall regard with
peculiar reverence the surviving soldier of the war
of the rebellion. Are they worthy of less honor
because not now objects of curiosity? All honor then
to these brave veterans who are still among us, as
connecting links between the present and the past;
and as one by one they go to join their comrades in
the “silent land,” may men arise to take their places,
<pb id="aughey483" n="483"/>
who will be as brave and true to the future as they have
been to the past.</p>
          <p>But our heroic dead have bequeathed to us a trust
more sacred still—more sacred to us than their memories
or their comrades, as it was more sacred to them
than their lives. If these dead soldiers could speak
to us from their graves, I think they would say,
“We are not so careful that you should perpetuate our
names, as that you shall guard the nation's honor
for which we fought. We are not so much concerned
that you should cherish our memories, as that you
shall cherish the principles for which we laid down
our lives.” There is cause for rejoicing in that the
bitterness and animosity engendered by the war is so
rapidly disappearing, and that we seem to be
approaching a national unity, never yet realized in the
history of this country. Yet this very fact imperils
the principles which were at issue during the war.
I honor the bravery of the men who fought against
us. I believe most of them were honest in their
convictions. Yet we must remember that neither
honesty in embracing convictions, nor bravery in
defending them, can make men's convictions right, or
their principles true. Passions cool, prejudices
change with situation, men die, and are forgotten;
but truths and principles are apart from all these,
and do not die or change. A man's honesty may be
sufficient apology for his espousal of a cause, but it
does not make that cause right or excusable.</p>
          <p>The American people need to remember that the
<pb id="aughey484" n="484"/>
Trojans resisted a siege of ten years, and then fell
before the stratagem of the wooden horse. It has
been said that “Peace hath its victories, not less
renowned than war.” It has also its emergencies not
less perilous, and its defeats not less disastrous. Let
us beware, lest the scheming politician, in his selfish
lust for place and gain, shall deceive us into a
surrender of that which an armed host was unable to
wrest from us. A nation, so valiant upon the battle
field should stand invincible against every foe—upon
the moral and political field as well as on the fields
of war.</p>
          <p>I do not forget that the spirit and sentiments for
which I am now pleading are so well guarded and
emphasized by the two distinguished societies under
whose auspices we have met to-day—the Grand Army
of the Republic and the Woman's Relief Corps.
The honorable place which public opinion has
accorded these societies shows how widely the popular
heart responds to these sentiments. I only ask the
perpetuity of these conditions, and we shall thus
render permanent the fruits of the war.</p>
          <p>At the close of the war, when the armies of the
rebellion had surrendered, it was well known that
the surrender did not carry with it the feeling of
disloyalty among the southern people. At that moment
a vexing problem presented itself to thoughtful men
—how can a people so divided in their convictions,
convictions intensified by the sacrifices of war, ever
again become so united in heart as to be in fact one
<pb id="aughey485" n="485"/>
people? We now stand far enough from the war to
foresee the solution of this problem. One evening,
while the two armies were facing each other across
the Rappahannock, the military bands on each side
of the river were rendering their favorite national
airs. When the Confederate bands played “Dixie,”
the southern soldiers cheered. Then the Union
bands played “Hail Columbia,” and the Union army
cheered. After the bands had thus answered each
other back and forth, some band began playing
“Home Sweet Home.” As soon as the tune was
detected, all the bands joined, and when it was
finished both armies together set up a shout that made
the valleys ring. This is a picture of the way in
which this problem is being solved. Not by accusation,
reply, and rejoinder, but by the timely on-coming
of issues and enterprises, apart from the matters
in dispute, and of common interest to both sections
of the country. With the return of peace came a
time of unparalleled activity.</p>
          <p> Vast and fertile domains invited settlement; great
commercial and manufacturing enterprises sprang
into existence; marvelous inventions with surprising
rapidity revolutionized the mechanical agencies of
the country. A new generation has come to the
front identified with these new conditions, rather
than with the old. In this I find both explanation
and prophecy of the fast approaching unification of
the two, once hostile sections of this country. You
have but to recur to history, to be reminded how
<pb id="aughey486" n="486"/>
differently other conditions might have affected us.
You know how strifes of far less moment have
protracted their bitterness through centuries. You
know how the petty feuds between the Scottish clans
were passed as cherished heirlooms from one
generation to another. When I consider the character of
the issues which divided the North and South, and
produced the war, the long period through which
they were matured and strengthened, and the tenacity
with which they were fought over, it is not so surprising
to me that there have been some displays of the
old-time bitterness, since the war, as that there have
been so few of them. I find cause for rejoicing and
confidence in the fact that twenty-three years have
done so much to cool the passions and unite the hearts
of the old combatants.</p>
          <p>If we turn away from this observance with a
higher appreciation of what this nation has cost, and
hence, of what it is worth, with a deeper sense of our
indebtedness to the past, and so of our responsibility
to the future, and with a truer purpose to act well
our part, this day will not have been spent in vain.</p>

          <p>The following memorial sermon was delivered by
Rev. W. F. Slocum, pastor of the Bethany Baptist
church, of Wooster, on Sunday morning, May 30,
1886, on which occasion Given Post, No. 133, G. A.
R., and Hancock Camp, No. 100, Sons of Veterans,
were present in a body:</p>
          <p>Luke xvi. 7: “And how much owest thou?”</p>
          <div3 type="subchapter">
            <head>THE DEBT OF THE LIVING TO THE DEAD.</head>
            <p>For the most part I shall confine my remarks to
that subject made so significant by the return of this
season of the year, viz.—“The debt we owe to the
departed heroes of our country.”</p>
            <p>The relation of the living to the dead is one of
large and various meaning. We are the heirs of all
the generations gone. We inherit their works, their
examples, as we do their names and dwelling-places. 
We are their successors. We are here
to reap that which we have not sown; other men
have had conflicts and labors and we are entered
into their labors. They prepared for us largely
the conditions and pursuits of the lives we are
enjoying to-day. We are their pupils. They teach
us grand lessons of both humility and of courage;
for we learn of them both how small and how
great we are. Lying in the dust with which our
own is soon to be mingled, they rebuke our pride;
yet they save us from a feeling of nothingness and
<pb id="aughey488" n="488"/>
from brutish views of life by reminding us of the
dignity, the indestructible worth, and the undying
power of every good and earnest deed. From the
heavenly heights they send us down sweet messages
of cheer, as we toil along the journey of our brief
day.</p>
            <lg type="verse">
              <l>“Mortal,” they softly say, “peace to thy heart!</l>
              <l>We, too, yes, mortal, have been as thou art;</l>
              <l>Hope-lifted, doubt-depressed, seeing in part.</l>
              <l>Tried, troubled, tempted, sustained as thou art.”</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This relation signifies obligation to them. We
are their debtors; and that not only in an account
that cannot be paid, but also in duties that we can
render. It is to perform one of these duties that
you are now gathered here, and will visit the silent
city of the dead to-morrow.</p>
            <p>Our obligations to those whose graves we shall
to-morrow visit and crown with garlands of honor is
peculiar. It arises from the fact that they voluntarily
laid down their lives in the public cause. It
appeals to us all as citizens and as patriots. They
died for us, and their dying was the cost of benefits
we live to partake. It requires us to guard their
names from oblivion, and to make the story of
their sacrifice, as a power in the world, perpetual.
And while the whole nation is sacredly bound to do
this, it is especially fitting that you, their comrades,
should be foremost in the work. For in all especial
manner you were in fellowship with these heroes;
yes, and are in fellowship with them still. To you
<pb id="aughey489" n="489"/>
they will always be what they cannot be to any who
were not permitted to share with them as you did,
the days, and scenes and experiences that made you
comrades. You feel that the glorious fraternity of
the camp, the march, the battle, the trenches, the
vigils that wearied out the stars, is not one that can
be dissolved by death, and that those of your own
companions in war who have halted and lain down
in the bivouac no earthly trumpet can disturb, are
yet of you, and so forevermore will be!</p>
            <p>But appropriate as is the tribute of tender and
sacred recollections, which we are to pay their
memory now, it is by no means the only tribute they
claim at our hearts and hands as the most precious.
It does not discharge our full obligations. There is
something far more binding upon us than this or any
similar act of fidelity. If we would truly honor
these illustrious dead we must gird up our loins in a
strong purpose to see to it that their work for the
world and humanity does follow them; else we are
not worthy to call them our saviours, still less to
survive them. Though year after year, for all the
future, we strew their graves with flowers; though
we carve their names in the imperishable stone;
though immortal words embalm their deeds, all will
be hollow and empty and insufficient unless we take
up their fallen mantle to wear it sacredly—a high
and solemn trust—till we, too, go the way of all the
earth. The tremendous facts that surround every
life are enough to make it earnest, but here an
<pb id="aughey490" n="490"/>
especial inspiration, one of the strongest that can be
sent upon man, is given to stir us to noble intensity
in action. It is the inspiration which comes from
the thought that these men and comrades—the most
beloved sons of a great republic—poured their blood
on liberty's altar as an atonement for transgressions
against humanity, and that a nation might be saved.
The Spartan band of Leonidas at the Pass of Thermopylæ
were not more heroic and self-sacrificing;
Curtius, who leaped into the yawning gulf to save
with his own life his nation's life, was not more
daring. Do we not owe them, therefore, the homage
we so willingly render to-day, and much more
beside. They were not only patriotic and brave and
daring, but they were martyrs also. The supporters
of a religion gave their lives for a principle.
These martyrs of patriotism gave their lives for an
idea. It was the grand idea of American nationality
that inspired them to sacrifice, and transformed
them from peaceful citizens into patriotic heroes.
Their language to us to-day is, “Hear us, ye living
comrades, who so lately pressed our hands! and you
neighbors, friends and citizens of this great
Republic! We died while the blood was leaping in the
pulses of our prime. It is due us that in you our hope
shall be fulfilled. We suffered; let your steps never
falter in the face of trial. We laid our young heads
down; we gave our lives; give yours freely,
wholly, purely, to the defence of that which is noble,
worthy, and right. You owe it to us and also to
<pb id="aughey491" n="491"/>
yourselves, and to your God, to complete the work
which we have begun. Bending from the heavens
above as they plead with us to-day to be faithful and
good citizens, to be just, yet merciful; to put aside
all hatred and uncharitableness, to guard our
liberties with holy zeal, and always to remember at how
great a cost the nation kept its liberty.</p>
            <p>Ignoble, thrice ignoble, shall we be if we are found
to care for ease, fearful of hardship. We shall
dishonor their memories if we prove faithless to their
example. Let us then dedicate ourselves to the
unfinished work they have thus far so nobly carried
on. Let us honor their memories by an increased
devotion to the cause for which they gave the last
full measure of devotion. Let us highly resolve
that the dead shall not have died in vain.</p>
            <p>And know this, that if the spirit which moves us
To strew the hero's grave with floral offerings is as
perishable as the flowers themselves, the offerings
will prove of little permanent value to the living or
the dead. The memorial service of any year will be a
most shameless, wanton mockery, if our souls are not
filled with that high and holy resolve which
inspired them. The dead, with stout hearts, fought
with patriotic zeal while in life against their country's
foes—against the enemies of liberty and humanity.</p>
            <p>I repeat, we shall dishonor their memories if we
prove faithless to their example.</p>
            <p>While their lives ebbed out on the bloody field of
<pb id="aughey492" n="492"/>
battle, or they died more slowly of wounds, want, or
disease in hospital or prison, their country remained
a great beacon light of liberty—the last hope of
freedom to the oppressed.</p>
            <p>We chant the story of their greatness by singing
to the world of the deeds accomplished, successes
gained, and the results obtained through their
personal sacrifices.</p>
            <p>But for the uncounted number of the dead and
their living comrades, the government of the people,
by the people, and for the people, would have
perished from the earth. The great Webster said: “No
age will come in which the American Revolution will
appear less than it is—one of the greatest events in
human history.” The second war for freedom when
measured by the principles at issue, the numbers
engaged, the battles fought, the blood spilled, the lives
lost, the supreme moral grandeur of the final
triumph, and the glory incident to the results attained,
strips all semblance of prophecy from the statement
that no age will come in which the recent great American
Rebellion will appear less than it is—the great
event in human history.</p>
            <p>There are before me men (and women, too) who
have seen rebellion face to face—have seen it in
its power and might; have witnessed it in its first
blush of defiance and hope; have seen it in exultation
of temporary success and joy; have seen its sullen
perseverance and strength; have seen it in
desperation and despair; have seen it in its final
<pb id="aughey493" n="493"/>
overthrow and destruction. Yea, they have beheld
more—they have seen the black national crime of
human slavery, the prime cause of the rebellion,
wiped out forever and rendered no longer possible
under the mantle of our free constitutional
government. They have witnessed both civilization and
christianity move forward and ascend higher. The
rebellion was not all an evil if we garner well and
preserve the good fruits born of the victories won
both on the field of battle and in the forum of legislation.</p>
            <p>But for the Rebellion and its defeats we should still
have a country, one-half of which would be teeming
with millions of God's people wearing the yoke and
galling fetters of slavery under the name of
constitutional liberty. But for the Rebellion, liberty to
these millions would still be a lying mockery.</p>
            <p>But for the Rebellion, there would have been a
dominant part of the citizens of our Republic who
would have continued to disobey the divine
command: “In the sweat of thy face shalt thou eat
bread;” and they would be yet engaged in eating
bread earned by the sweat of the face of their
unfortunate and still untutored black brethren.</p>
            <p>But for the Rebellion, civilization and christianity
would have stood still in at least one-half of the
territory of this Union. But for the complete
overthrow of the Rebellion, <hi rend="italics">two flags</hi> would have floated
over the inhabitants of a divided country, and at
least one new nation would have been in being, having
<pb id="aughey494" n="494"/>
for its primal object the preservation and
perpetuation of human slavery.</p>
            <p>Truly may it be said:</p>
            <lg type="verse">
              <l>“O, not in vain our martyrs sighed</l>
              <l>And not in vain our heroes died.”</l>
            </lg>
            <p>Keeping in view the importance and sublimity of
the recent great struggle, as viewed in the light of
the present, let us assume to plant ourselves in the
afternoon of the next century, and observe, not so
much the events as the results of the war. In doing
this we must assume that reasonable progress in
refinement, the arts, and christian civilization will
continue.</p>
            <p>The historian of that day, in the light of such
progress, will accurately measure the effect of the
triumphs, and justly judge of the deeds done and the
men who participated in them.</p>
            <p>Then the true distinction between patriotism and
disloyalty will be made; then those who have believed
or now believe in or excuse human slavery will be
properly classified; then those who fought against
slavery and for universal constitutional liberty will
be awarded the true patriot's place.</p>
            <p>While it may be for this generation to forgive
those who assailed the free institution of a government
of the people, it will be for him to portray the
truth of history and honor those who unfurled their
banners in the cause of liberty.</p>
            <p>Then will the Union dead be honored as those
who fought and died to preserve their country a
<pb id="aughey495" n="495"/>
“beacon of liberty” to all mankind. Then lisping
infants will be taught to chant the story of their
fame. Then will be depicted in glowing colors the
long suffering, lofty purposes, heroic bearing, and
noble spirit of those who fell doing battle in freedom's
cause.</p>
            <lg type="verse">
              <l>“That cause in which we waved the sword on high,</l>
              <l>And swore with her to live, for her to die.”</l>
            </lg>
            <p>This is not a fitting occasion to utter words of
reproach of the living or the dead; nor is it proper to
ignore the broad distinction between the patriot and
traitor. The misguided dead who then fell fighting
for disunion and slavery may be spoken of tenderly;
also the living who fought in the same cause, who
when Appomattox came, in good faith accepted the
verdict rendered. Mercy and charity demand this
much but no more. A tribute to bravery alone is idle
and empty. Heroic deeds of bravery and daring, to
be commended, must be coupled with patriotism, love
of country, or some achievements in the interest of
humanity. Men who merit honor and commemoration
when dead, achieve success and perform deeds
of valor and renown in a good and holy cause.</p>
            <p>Devotion to sound principle and good works in
peace or war commands the approbation of the wise
and good. Those who fought and fell for national
integrity and freedom and equality of all men before
the law will be loved and adored through all time.</p>
            <p>Had the French Marshal Moreau fallen at Hohenlinden
at the head of a French army, and not at
<pb id="aughey496" n="496"/>
Dresden, fighting with the combined despotisms of
his country's enemies against France and for her
dismemberment, he would have had a nation of people
to honor and adore his name and perpetuate his fame.
Had Arnold fallen at Saratoga and been spared his
fall at West Point, his bravery and renown would
have been placed alongside of Warren and other
distinguished patriot dead of the war of the Revolution.</p>
            <p>Had Jefferson Davis fallen at Buena Vista he
would have been spared a traitor's fame and the
humiliation of Irwinsville, and his name would have
been registered among the lovers of his country.
Had Robert E. Lee paid the penalty of devotion to
his country at Mexico's capital he would have been
remembered in future years as one who never deserted
his country's flag in the hours of her greatest peril.”</p>
            <p>In our late war there was a distinction between
the living who fought for and those who fought
against the Union, and death does not obliterate it.
He who sought the Nation's ruin is not equal in our
hearts with him who staked all in her defense.</p>
            <p>We have spoken thus of the dead, their achievements,
their honor, their true glory, and rendered to
them a full meed of praise, in order that with garlands
of love and devotion we may crown their labors
and draw new inspiration from their life and heroic
death.</p>
            <p>The history of all nations teaches us that frequent
recurrence to the principles which animated their
<pb id="aughey497" n="497"/>
patriots in times of peril is essential to the preservation
and perpetuation of the results of their grand
achievements. We, the living, are called upon by the
same high obligation to preserve and perpetuate the
results of these achievements as were the dead in their
time called upon for their accomplishment.</p>
            <p>When danger threatens we should imitate their
high example.</p>
            <p>Imbued with their patriotism, their love of
Constitutional liberty and the spirit of nationality, let us
transmit these qualities to our posterity.</p>
            <p>Memory with averted face turns sadly back to a
hundred battle fields, and as I recall (as best one can
who took no active part therein) how the dead came
trooping back with gory locks and faces marble white,
to reinspire our hearts with courage for the doing of
the right. How the curtains of their low green tents
open outward, heedless of Whittier's sweet verse,
and surrender up their precious charge! I see them
now, their immortal raiment on, and mingling in our
prayers and tears; they bid you keep alive in your
hearts no malice and hatred toward the erring, but
unfailing faith in the power of truth to prevail. As
they were true and faithful in the day of sacrifice,
they bid you to be true and faithful in the day of a
new consecration. As they died, so they ask us to
live, that the continent may bloom with an ampler
freedom, and the age unfold a higher civilization.</p>
            <p>Let us one and all heed the voices that speak to us
to-day from more than human lips! Soon the flowers
<pb id="aughey498" n="498"/>
that you will scatter on the hero-brother's grave
will fade and mingle with the sod they cover, their
beauty and fragrance lost to sight and sense. Soon
the sun will gild new scenes, another “Decoration
Day” with all its sweet recollections will have gone.
Its story told, and its sacred page securely clasped
forever.</p>
            <p>As the work of love and devotion closes with the
morrow's sun, and we turn again for another year to
the common duties of life with renewed pledges and
devotion to our country filling our hearts, let us
remember that our Nation, though proud and mighty
among the nations of the world, is the only truly free
Republic to which the oppressed of all lands turn their
eyes, and also to remember that to perpetuate this
love and devotion to freedom is our great calling.</p>
            <p>In the discharge of this duty you will be called
upon to enter other battle fields than those where duty
called in 1861. Fields where new dangers are to be
faced and few worldly inspirations to urge you to
victory. Battle fields where the soldier fights
single-handed, alone, in the dark, with an invisible enemy,
an enemy whose strength he has not measured, but fears
it may be greater than his own. Such battles are
most dreadful.</p>
            <p>Battles where blood is shed are but comparatively
rare occurrences in the world's history, but these
bloodless battles, in which hearts struggle and break,
or else, sustained by an unfaltering trust in the
Great Commander, gain victories, are a continuous
<pb id="aughey499" n="499"/>
succession. Every day sees such battles. Never a
night falls in which myriads are not drawn out in
contest. Without are fightings, within are fears.</p>
            <p>The character of the enemies to be met on these
new battle fields is known to you all. The world,
the flesh, and the devil, the fascinations and allurements
that lie about us, float in the atmosphere, lurk in the
darkness, gleam in the sunshine, “the world”; the
impulses, passions, and habits that dwell in the flesh;
the wicked thoughts, the false reasoning, the empty
hopes that are put into the mind by the father of lies
and of devils—these are the desperate enemies which
one has to meet.</p>
            <p>There is no such thing as going on toward heaven and
God without meeting them. Diabolians, they watch
the entrances to the King's highway. They dog the
steps of the King's servants. They shoot their arrows,
sometimes at random, sometimes well aimed, at those
who are struggling upward.</p>
            <p>Face to face here to-day I know that every earnest
soul wants to learn how to conquer these enemies,
and you ask me, if I know anything about it, to tell
you; for you have had your struggles, and are still
having them.</p>
            <p>Where is the armory in which I can find the
weapons to overcome these giants?</p>
            <p>When David was going out to meet Goliath of
Gath, Saul, the king, put on him his own helmet and
coat of mail and girded his great sword upon the
boy's thigh, but the shepherd lad said, “I cannot go
<pb id="aughey500" n="500"/>
with these.” He went without them, saying to the
boastful giant, “I come to thee in the name of the
Lord of Hosts, this day will the Lord deliver thee
into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine
head from thee.” And he did it.</p>
            <p>Victor Hugo, after describing the battle of Waterloo,
makes this comment upon Wellington's victory:
“Was it possible that Napoleon should win this
battle? We answer no? Why? Because of Wellington?
Blucher? No! Because of God—Napoleon
had been impeached before the Infinite and his fall
was decreed. He vexed God.” This the reply of
faith to that sneer of self-confidence, “God favors the
heaviest battalion,” and it is more than that. It is Paul's
declaration over again, “Thanks be unto God which
giveth us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ.”</p>
            <p>In this thrilling sentence we find the answer to
your soul's anxious question. God can give, and has
given, the victory to those who give themselves to
Him and who put their trust in him. Believe it
and take therefrom the comfort and encouragement
you need!</p>
            <p>The graves of our dead heroes remind us that there
is an end to our mortal life. Then are we summoned
to bring the treasures we have harvested and lay them
at the Great Commander's feet. Every talent must
be surrendered up, and the increase we have made,
and out of the ground of sloth and sin must we dig
every napkin wherein we have foolishly hid away any
gift. With saddened countenance the dissipated

<pb id="aughey501" n="501"/>
prodigal will wander back from his husks and swine,
and from his plenteous acres the faithful husbandman
will go laden with bountiful sheaves.</p>
            <p>No one will then sorrow that he manfully walked
The path of duty, though he trod with torn and bloody
feet.</p>
            <p>Be ours the way, thorny as it may be, that leads
us to an immortal crown. Be ours the way, though
it leads straight through Gethsemane's garden, and
past Calvary's Cross, that gives us the Great Commander's
plaudit—“Well done!” To-day, men and
women who seek the Eternal City, behold a lofty
pile, which covers many a rod of earth, and lifts its
lofty dome high in air, beneath whose glittering cross
worshipers reverently bow their heads and offer up
their silent prayers of old; mighty genius, gathering
the stone from the quarry, and fitting them into form,
wrought out its beauteous proportions, and treading
the city's busy streets he caught the models wherewith
to fresco the fabric's towering walls. Changing
the beggar into a giant, and the flower-girl into an
angel, his brush fastened them forever on dome and
ceiling; and there they stand, their radiant beauty
grateful to eyes that wander from every quarter of
the habitable earth. And there that venerable pile,
caught up from neighboring fields, will remain, to
astonish and delight as generations come and go. But
above and about us towers a national character (a
nobler Vatican or St. Peter's than Raphael's brush
could paint or Angelo's genius plan), lifting high its
<pb id="aughey502" n="502"/>
mighty dome and spreading wide its arches, the
creatures of no one time or age. In the building of this
we each have a part, a duty to perform. Out of the
common events of our common lives, out of the
conflicting passions and emotions God puts into human
hearts, out of the thoughts and desires He puts in
human brains, what pictures may we not paint,
beautiful evermore in the sight of man, and grateful
to the eye of Him who paints the meadow with its
loveliness, and inspires the genius who uses the brush
and the chisel?</p>
            <p>Long centuries ago in that city made holy by the
feet of Him who brought glad tidings, there arose, as
if by magic, the temple built by the Danite widow's
skillful son. Away off on Lebanon's shaded sides
the rough woodman swung his ax. Along Joppa's
wild castles the raftsman plied his heavy oar. In
deep caverns the mystic craftsman squared his huge
blocks of stone, and up the rugged pathway sweating
oxen bore the trophies of the Hebrew Mecca. So in
solemn silence the temple daily grew until the fame
thereof spread around the world. In this way goes
on the Nation's life. Your character and mine, the
work we do in our several places, the lives we live in
lofty mountain air or by lowly river, the characters
we form out of the wood or stone, are all but parts
in the great mosaic of our country's temple wall.
Oh, let us then seek to build into that structure
the material that shall outlast the ages, knowing
that this is the debt we owe those who purchased
<pb id="aughey503" n="503"/>
with their lives the blessings we as citizens to-day
enjoy.</p>

          <p>DEAR SIR—Yours of recent date was received in
due course of mail. I am glad to hear from you.
I was at a soldiers' reunion two years ago, and while
there met our old friend and fellow-prisoner,
Alexander Spear, of Ellisville, Fulton Co., Ill. I was
very glad to meet him, as we had not met before
since we were paroled. I have forgotten whether I
told you what General Jordan said to me when he
came into prison the morning of your escape. He
came up to me as I stood on the floor. He said,
“How did that preacher get away? What do you
know about his escape?” I did as the rest of the
prisoners did. I denied knowing anything about
your escape, either as to the time of it, or the
<pb id="aughey504" n="504"/>
manner by which it was effected. He said, “God
Almighty helped him get away, for no living white
man could.” After studying a minute he said, “Did
you render him any aid in liberating him from the
chain?” I replied, “I am not God Almighty.”
He then rejoined the officers. They sent out two
companies of cavalry with blood-hounds, with strict
orders to leave you wherever they found you.</p>
          <p>Please present my kind regards to your wife and
family. I think of you and your wife often. You,
as you were standing in the center of Tupelo prison,
declaring that you will run past the guards and take
the risk of making your escape, or die in the attempt,
which you said you would prefer to the certainty
of death on the scaffold in a few days; and
her, overwhelmed with sorrow at your prolonged
absence. I am now very busy at work for the city.</p>
          <p>How terrible is war. As my mind reverts to the
past, I almost feel like saying with Cowper—</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Arms through the vanity and brainless rage</l>
            <l>Of those that bear them, in whatever cause,</l>
            <l>Seem most at variance with all moral good,</l>
            <l>And incompatible with all serious thought.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>An offensive war is always wrong. A war in defense
of country and liberty alone is justifiable.
Please answer at your earliest convenience.</p>

          <trailer>P. S.—Howell Trogdon, our fellow-prisoner at
Tupelo, wrote me that when you were pastor of the
Fairmount church in Saint Louis, Mo., he lived near
you, and saw you almost every day. Trogdon held
the guard, seated on the threshold of our prison, in
conversation while you made your final escape.

          <head>THE PURITY OF THE BALLOT.</head>
          <p>The revelations which have been made in the
course of the last two weeks in the tally-sheet-forgery
trials at Indianapolis and Columbus, in addition to
the disclosures which startled the country as they
were brought out in the trial of similar cases in
Chicago not very long since, should arouse a public
sentiment that will no longer tolerate such iniquities.
Too long have the American people permitted the
great crime of tampering with the ballot box to go
unpunished. Treason has been pronounced the
highest offense that can be committed against a
government; its aim is, not to cripple or embarrass the
ruling power, but to overthrow it; the traitor strikes
at the very life of the government. In a republic
like our own, where the will of the people
constitutionally expressed is the supreme law, he who by
force or fraud sets aside and defeats that will is guilty
of this very crime. He has substituted creatures of

execute our laws, instead of those whom the sovereign
power had selected. The penalty attached to
treason in every civilized country is death; and if
there be no other way of effectually preventing all
tampering with the ballot, this crime should be similarly
punished.</p>
          <p>If this seems to any one too severe a penalty, let
him reflect upon the peril in which such criminals
might involve our country. Suppose that in the
presidential election next November, it should be
clearly established that the successful candidate
owed that success to fraud in the returns, or violence
in preventing a free ballot, is it to be supposed that
the defrauded party would quietly submit to a
palpable outrage upon their rights? On the contrary
there is every reason to fear that we might be once
more embroiled in the horrors of internal strife, not
sectional but partisan in its character. Surely the
miscreants who for their own vile purposes would
coolly occasion the crisis that might lead to such a
calamity, should themselves be put beyond the power
of ever committing such a crime again.</p>

It came with a Bay of Fundy sweep and speed!
Nay, more marvelous than that. It was akin

tropic country. Just at the outbreak of treason,
there was, as you know, a strange stillness in the air,
heavy and oppressive. The sea was listless. The
beaches were bare. It seemed as though mammon
worship had paralyzed manhood. And then the volcanic
moment came, the rumble, the roar, the upheaval
of the very bed of the sea under the flame of
the country's maddened heart. And the billow rose
—the moral billow—along the line of a continent,
and it rolled from that calm ocean, dark, massive,
sublime, till its edge whitened with sacred wrath,
and the track of its tremendous dash is marked by
the broken forts, the flying hosts, the submerged

republic will never care to tempt the anger of that
sleeping deep.</p>

          <head>FACTS FOR THE CHURCH TO THINK OVER.—BY
RICHARD H. ALLEN, D. D., PITTSBURG, PA.</head>
          <p><hi rend="italics">First.</hi>—The sad and helpless condition of the
freedmen, growing as it did out of slavery, lies at our
door. The negroes in God's providence we brought
to our country, and we enslaved them. American
slavery was instituted and created by the American
government and sanctioned by the American Church,
at the very time, too, that we were persuading
ourselves and proclaiming to other nations of the earth
that all men by nature “are free and equal.” In
God's providence they were brought here, and when
they asked for bread we gave them a stone, and when
they asked for fish we gave them a scorpion.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Second.</hi>—Their illiteracy lies at our door. By
law we closed every avenue of intellectual
improvement. The man who dared to teach them to read
was liable to imprisonment, fines, or stripes. We
thus legalized illiteracy.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Third.</hi>—The want of a true morality, their want of
virtue and low estimate of the sacredness of the
marriage tie, lie at our door. We gave them in marriage,
but there was not a legal marriage among them—
not a marriage recognized as legal by Church or state;
and yet with these loose marriages we took them into
the Church and admitted them to the Lord's table.
For all this God will hold us responsible, and before
it is too late let us right the wrong as far as we can.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Fourth.</hi>—The negro is one of our most improvable
<pb id="aughey509" n="509"/>
races. In the face of a wretched race-prejudice they
are making their way to prosperity, intellectually
and physically. In the state of Georgia alone they
own 583,000 acres of land. They are paying taxes
on $91,000,000 worth of property, and are printing
and publishing 109 newspapers.</p>
          <p>Remember that the negro is a man, with a man's
instincts, a man's passions and powers. He has
shown and maintained his manhood on eighty-three
battle-fields, which were stained with his blood in
our great civil war. Help him to assert his manhood
still further, if by worthy behavior he can win a
place or position of honor and trust. Do not turn
away from him because God has been pleased to give
him a darker skin than yours. Give him a brother's
hand, and bid him God-speed in his efforts for a higher
and nobler life. He is a man, and we beg you give
him a man's chance, and he will take care of himself,
and he will help you take care of the Church and
the nation.</p>

          <head>THE KU-KLUX.—THE STORY OF CAPTAIN ROBERT
W. BOONE.</head>
          <p>Facts about the Ku-Klux and their outrageous
doings startle us most when they come to us in the
shape of a personal narrative. When a reliable man
can say, “I have seen these things,” and can give
every incident of events that have only been outlined
in the newspapers, his evidence becomes interesting
to the people.</p>
          <p>Perhaps no man is better qualified to speak of the
secret societies of the South, their nature, their aims,
and their doings than Captain Robert W. Boone, now
in this city. This will appear if we glance at his
career, certainly one of the most remarkable shaped
by the war and by the events which followed in the
South.</p>
          <p>Capt. Boone is a native of North Carolina, and a
great-grandson of Daniel Boone. He was about
fifteen years of age when the Carolinas seceded, and
he made his mark by tearing down a rebel flag
which had been raised by his brother, a captain in
the Confederate service. Encouraged by his mother,
he stood firm in his course as a Union man, left the
state, made his way to Kentucky, and in a few weeks
entered the secret service of the United States army
—a department that became so famous and so useful
in the army operations in Kentucky and Tennessee.</p>
          <p>The old Boone instinct made this boy a good scout,
a good pilot, and a good spy. So efficient was he
that after the siege of Knoxville he was made captain,
<pb id="aughey511" n="511"/>
with head-quarters at Knoxville. He operated with
his organization or command in East Tennessee,
Western North Carolina, Northern Georgia, and
South Carolina.</p>
          <p>He was captured seven times, and was sentenced
to be shot at Salisbury, N. C., in 1862. He scaled
the walls of the prison, however, and though shot
through the body, escaped. In 1863 he was captured
by Wheeler, and was sentenced to be hung at Ashville,
N. C. Again he escaped.</p>
          <p>During these eight years of service he belonged to
eight different Confederate regiments, serving a part
of the time as a private, and part of the time as a
commissioned officer, and gaining much valuable
information. He, of course, had many adventures, and
came out with many wounds. He was known then
as Charlie Davis, and hundreds of Union officers,
piloted by him to the Union lines, rescued by his
command from rebel guards or prisons, have good
cause to remember him with grateful feelings.</p>
          <p>After the war Capt. Davis (Boone) came North,
but went to South Carolina in 1869 to organize the
detective force of the state. It becoming evident
that there was a secret organization of rebel
sympathizers, against which the legitimate government
could make little headway, Capt. Boone disappeared
from South Carolina and appeared in Georgia as a
cotton buyer from North Carolina, rebel in sympathy,
and violent in his talk against the tyranny of the
Federal government. He joined the order then
<pb id="aughey512" n="512"/>
known as the White Brotherhood, whose declared
object was the protection of the widows and orphans
of deceased rebel soldiers, and whose platform
included the banding together of all sympathizers of
the Lost Cause for the advancement of personal and
political interest. The society, which it was said had
organized in Washington, numbered at that time
834,000 members, including all the rebel sympathizers
in the South—merchants, lawyers, farmers, traders,
mechanics. Hostility to negroes showed itself in
violence and outrage, and even the leaders of the
organization admitted that in this way only could
they intimidate the blacks. Possessing himself of
all the signs, passwords, etc., Capt. Boone returned
to South Carolina to put the denials of such an
organization in that state to the test. He traveled
extensively, was recognized everywhere as a member of
the order, and saw all their plans and aims from
behind the scenes. The society adopted the name
Ku-Klux to frighten the negroes, and the reckless
men of the order perpetrated outrages that were never
mentioned in print. During the years of '69 and
'70, ninety-three cold blooded murders were
perpetrated in South Carolina alone. Hundreds of negroes
and many white men were brutally whipped and
otherwise abused. At Lawrence court-house, eighteen
men were killed in one day, and the struggle at
Newberry was what would have been a wholesale
slaughter of Union men, had not Captain Boone
managed to have troops put in an opportune
<pb id="aughey513" n="513"/>
appearance. In all his observations he collected facts,
names, dates. He thoroughly understood the animus
of the order, and understood their mode of action.
Finally, when his report to the state officers had
caused action, the signs and passwords of the order
were changed, and suspicion being directed against
himself, his usefulness ceased.</p>
          <p>His statements made under oath before the
investigating committee at Washington and substantiated
by the records and by the circumstances of the many
cases, and by the testimony of others eminently hostile
to him, is a strange chapter in the history of the
Southern States. The whole thing in a nutshell is,
that the outrages have not been exaggerated, but on
the contrary that not one-half have been reported,
and, that when reported many of the acts lost something
of their brutality because of the absence of the
particulars that could not be made public in a newspaper.</p>
          <p>The Government did not act in the Ku-Klux
business a moment too soon. The Government
would have been criminal had it delayed longer. The
Government acted with the facts as learned by scores
of men like Captain Boone, and as coming in the
stories of thousands of persecuted citizens, before its
officers, not trusting alone to the excited narrative of
refugees. And the time will come when all good
men, both North and South, will commend this action
of the Government as one of its best deeds.</p>

Crimes against the purity of elections are of the most

Miscarriage of justice in a case touching the purity of

          <head>DARK HOURS.—BY HORACE GREELEY.</head>
          <p>When Washington retreated, eighty-six years ago,
with the small remnant of his thrice defeated army,
from New York through New Jersey to seek refuge
from his victorious pursuers behind the Delaware in
Pennsylvania, many of his followers, doubtless,
murmured at a dispensation of Providence to them so
inscrutable. Was not the cause of American
Independence just? Was it not that of Universal
Freedom—of the inalienable Rights of Man? If so, why
should reverses fall thick and heavy upon it? Why
should its brave defenders lie sleeping on the battlefields
they had illustrated by their valor and fertilized
by their blood? Why should they languish in
miserable hospitals or pine in pestilent prisons, hopeless
and heartbroken? How could things have gone
worse if the Universe were an accident, and blind
Electricity or Gravitation were the only God?</p>
          <p>Rash, hasty judgment! A fly feeling the first frost
of Autumn, might pass such a one on the benignity
evinced in the structure and laws of the Solar System.</p>
          <p>Looking back from this distance, with the eighty-six
years' experience to guide us, we can easily see
that the disasters wherewith our forefathers opened
their Revolutionary struggle was essential to the
development of the most heroic phase of their
character—their constancy under circumstances of intense
discouragement. Had it been decreed that they
should triumph from the outset—that the battle of
<pb id="aughey519" n="519"/>
Long
 Island should result in a “Continental victory,”
leading to the capture or dispersion of Gen. Howe's
army and the consequent recognition of our Independence
before the close of that year, who believes
that we should have become the people that we are?
Who does not see that our early reverses were as
beneficent as our ultimate successes—Long Island as
Saratoga, Brandywine as Yorktown?</p>
          <p>I attended on Saturday evening a meeting at
Cooper Institute, called and addressed by refugees
from several of the states now in Rebellion against
the Union. The speakers, four in number, were
from Texas, Tennessee, Florida, and Mississippi
respectively, but several others of the revolted States
were represented in the call and on the platform.
Col. Hamilton, of Texas, has repeatedly been heard
in our city, and always speaks clearly and forcibly.
Mr. Boynton, from Florida, spoke at considerable
length, and laid bare the nature and impulse of
the Rebellion. Mr. Carter, from East Tennessee,
portrayed the persecutions, the distresses, the
disappointed hopes, the heart sickness, of the loyal,
Union-loving majority in that afflicted region, and
pathetically asked if they must bear forever as they have
borne for the last fifteen months, under the iron heel
of their cruel enemies, who rob and murder them at
will, thrusting them into dungeons on suspicion that
they are traitors, and dragging them away by
thousands to fight the battles of an abhorred, detested
treason. But the most effective speech of all was
<pb id="aughey520" n="520"/>
that of Rev. Mr. Aughey,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1">*</ref> a Presbyterian clergyman
of Northern birth, late a pastor in Northern
Mississippi, and an earnest, open, decided opponent
of the Rebellion from the outset. Arrested as a
traitor to the treason whereto he had never actively
nor passively adhered, and which he therefore could
not betray, he was heavily manacled and thrust into
a crowded, filthy prison, whence his companions were
taken out day by day to be shot, and their bodies
thrown naked into a ditch as the punishment of their
patriotism. Mr. Aughey himself, as a more
determined and influential Unionist, was reserved for
conspicuous hanging, but escaped before the
fulfillment of that amiable intention. Traveling in the
opposite direction from that in which he would
naturally be sought, wearing on his ankles the heavy
iron fetters which he had not been enabled to remove,
he was obliged to evade the blood-hounds that are
usually kept for the hunting of slaves, but now
employed for tracking white Unionists, taking care to
leave none of his garments in the prison, as from
these the scent might be taken; traveling only by
night, and then very slowly because of the galling
circlets of his ankles; living mainly on green corn
plucked from the field and eaten raw, since to raise
a smoke would have been to advertise his location
to watchful, unrelenting foes; he finally discovered
himself at a venture to a farmer who proved a Unionist,
<note id="note1" n="1" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1">* Pronounced
Awhay. This we learn by inquiry from the man

<pb id="aughey521" n="521"/>
and by whom he was conveyed on horseback
several miles in the right direction, and thus enabled
to evade the Rebel pickets and find refuge under the
protecting folds of the Flag of Freedom. Mr.
Aughey relates that while skulking through forests
and corn fields on his way out of the house of
bondage, he was sometimes impelled by thirst—the
country being at that time intensely parched by
<sic corr="drought">drouth</sic>—to approach a dwelling and ask for water;
and if, on drawing near, a <hi rend="italics">slave</hi> appeared at the door
or was seen through a window, he instinctively
shrank back unobserved into the friendly shade, to
bear his sufferings as he might. If, indeed, he could
have found a habitation peopled <hi rend="italics">only</hi> by blacks, he
might have freely claimed its hospitality, but a
slave-holding family was inevitably a den of malignant
treason. Mr. Aughey's conclusion from all he had
seen and heard is, that the number of those who have
been murdered in the South for their loyalty—some
of them black, but by far the greater portion white
—is really appalling. We frequently hear from our
democratic orators and journalists of “the South”
requiring this or that for her security, and of what
will or will not satisfy “the South,” meaning always
by “the South” the traitors who have taken that
section by the throat and compelled it to speak as
they bid, or remain silent. Nobody would imagine,
from hearing or reading a speech of Horatio Seymour
or Fernando Wood, that there was anybody at the
South but traitors, unless it be the black dependents
<pb id="aughey522" n="522"/>
and devoted satellites of these traitors. The white
Unionists of the South are entirely ignored by those
oracles or are assumed to be shivering with anxiety
lest Slavery be rudely broken in the attempt to
preserve the Union. But those Unionists come among
us—they appeal to our sympathies and invoke our
interposition to save their families and neighbors
from their cruel oppressors—and neither whisper a
a word of anxiety that Slavery should be saved from
impending destruction. On the contrary, they recognize
in that fiend the cause of all their woes, the destroyer
of our Nation's peace, and hope that the arm
outstretched for their deliverance will hurl it into
utter ruin. None of these Southern martyrs to their
loyalty are seen consorting with our Northern champions
of the South—they do not seek the platforms
whence Seymour harangues on the great mischiefs of
Radicalism, or Brooks in silvery periods paints the
horrors of Abolition. That undiscoverable negro
who hates and flees from the Yankee hordes who
come to tear him from the protection and kindness
of “Massa,” is not more rare than the Southern
Unionist who having braved death and suffered
martyrdom for his loyalty now comes North to entreat
us to put down the Great Rebellion so gingerly 
as to leave Slavery strong as ever. The champions
of “the Union as it was, the Constitution as it is,
and the Negroes as they were,” are confined to the
anti-Republicans of the Free States.</p>
          <p>Yet the hour is a dark one. Paralysis brooding
<pb id="aughey523" n="523"/>
over our armies; disaster impending in our overtaxed
finances; the people disgusted by delays, wearied out
by disappointments, and sinking under heavy burdens
that seem to be borne in vain, and thus giving
triumph in some of the Free States to the natural
allies and lifelong servitors of the now openly
traitorous Slave Power—all this would be appalling if
the universe were a weltering chaos and the heavens
without a God. But the darkest  hour barely precedes
the dawn, and the coldest days of  winter just
anticipate the first premonitions of spring. At length
our armies are embodied and ready for action; the
removal of Buell is a foretaste of like changes in every
department whose delay and immobility are chronic;
and the ominous silence of our augmented fleets
preludes the opening roar of cannonades and the fierce
din of battle. Be patient yet a little longer, O loyal
Millions! and your long-suffering shall be rewarded
by the trumpet-notes of Victory, ushering in a long,
bright era of Peace based on Justice and Universal
Freedom!</p>

          <head>BATTLE OF CORINTH.</head>
          <p>Generals Price and Van Dorn, having been
defeated at Iuka, Miss., by Gen. Rosecrans, resolved
to avenge themselves of their adversary by his utter
annihilation at Corinth. But they reckoned without
their host. On Oct. 1st, 2d and 3d, 1862, the sanguinary
battle of Corinth was fought. The Confederates,
although outnumbering the Nationals more
than two to one, suffered an overwhelming defeat,
losing in killed, officers and men, one thousand four
hundred and twenty three. Their wounded amounted
to nearly six thousand. They lost in prisoners, in
the battle and subsequent pursuit, two thousand two
hundred and forty-eight. Fourteen stand of colors,
two pieces of artillery, three thousand three hundred
stand of arms, four thousand five hundred rounds of
ammunition, together with a large quantity of
accoutrements, fell into the hands of the victors. Thus
Rust, Price, Villipigue, Van Dorn, and Lovell were
beaten with heavy loss by a force one half their
number. These rebels, however, fought like brave
men, long and well. Loyal history must accord to
the rebel the acknowledgment of the bravery which
he displayed, while it abhors his treason. The defeated
rebel army returned to Tupelo, broken and dispirited,
to recuperate and re-organize for another attempt to
defeat the patriot army. General Hackleman fell
in this battle, lamented by the whole army. General
Oglesby was severely (and at the time thought to be
<pb id="aughey525" n="525"/>
fatally) wounded. And many brave and loyal men
surrendered life in defence of their country's imperiled
integrity on this bloody field.</p>

          <head>BATTLE OF TUPELO.</head>
          <p>The battle of Tupelo was one of the most important
battles of the civil war fought in the Southwest.</p>
          <p>Gen. W. T. Sherman was attempting to reach the
strategic stronghold of Atlanta. Between Chattanooga
and Atlanta he must drive before him or destroy
the efficient and disciplined army of that able
commander, Gen. Jo. Johnston, who, carrying out
the Fabian policy, endeavored to delay his adversary
till he could throw upon his line of communication a
cavalry force sufficient to sever it, and thus cut him
off from his base of supplies. This would make a
retreat compulsory. Between Nashville and the point
where Sherman was slowly driving the Confederate
army, by flanking its positions successively, there
was but a single track railroad upon which supplies
might be brought. Wheeler, with a considerable
force of cavalry, was endeavoring to destroy this road,
confident of success as soon as he could be reinforced
by Forrest, Chalmers, Rhoddy, Kirby, Smith, and
Baxter, who were in Tupelo. To avoid this disastrous
result, Sherman directed Gen. Washburn to send
Gen. S. D. Sturgis with a large force to attack
Forrest. The Rebels, learning that this force was
approaching, moved out to meet it. A battle ensued,
June 10th, 1864, at Tishomingo Creek, near Guntown.
<pb id="aughey526" n="526"/>
Sturgis proved incompetent. He suffered Forrest
and Kirby Smith to succeed by a well executed
flank movement in reaching the rear of his army,
where his wagons were parked, and in destroying
or capturing all his supplies, including the caissons
containing his ammunition. A retreat was ordered,
which soon became a pitiable and disastrous rout.
<foreign lang="fre"><hi rend="italics">Sauve qui peut</hi></foreign> became the watchword, as,
panic-stricken and helpless because of the loss of their
commissariat and ammunition, they fled before the
cruel and victorious rebel hordes, who shot down
without mercy or compunction all whom they overtook.
The pursuit of this dispersed army, these
scattered fugitives, was continued as long as any
remained alive. Guerrillas with blood-hounds joined
in the hunt. As a squad of these panting fugitives
passed through Ripley, the women from their
windows and doors shot them as they passed along.
A young soldier begged a young lady who was
seated on a veranda to give him a glass of water,
as he was perishing from thirst. She walked into
the house, brought a glass of water, and while this
young patriot was drinking she drew a pistol and
immediately shot him. Thus perished Ralph Erskine,
of near Golconda, Pope Co., Ill. Two thousand
two hundred perished thus cruelly at the hands
of their merciless fellow countrymen. This savage
and protracted pursuit occupied time which Sherman
was improving in making progress towards
Atlanta, which he was destined to reach if his
<pb id="aughey527" n="527"/>
communication with his base of supplies could be kept
open. The persistency with which the Rebels
followed up their success exhausted them, and time
was required for recuperation. At this juncture Gen.
A. J. Smith arrived at Memphis from Red River,
with the troops of the Army of the Tennessee, which
Gen. Sherman had sent to reinforce Banks, whom
they rendered very efficient service. Smith was
directed by Sherman immediately to move upon the
Confederates at Tupelo. This he did, Gen. Grant
says, with the promptness and effect which has
characterized his whole military career. On the 14th of
July, 1864, he met the enemy at Tupelo, and gained
a glorious victory, whipping the enemy badly and
routing him completely, after three days' hard
fighting, yet losing few compared with the loss of the
enemy. He thus contributed materially to the grand
success achieved by Sherman, who was, by the utter
overthrow of the rebel cavalry commanders at
Tupelo, enabled to keep open communication with
his depot of supplies at Nashville, and thus the
defeat of Sturgis and the decisive victory of Smith
rendered possible the capture of Atlanta, and all
the victories that followed in its train.</p>
          <p>When Gen. A. J. Smith had accomplished the
object of his expedition, he returned to Memphis,
remembering to chastise the rebels and guerrillas by
the way who had so atrociously maltreated Sturgis'
defeated troops in their disastrous retreat. The
inglorious defeat of Sturgis and the decisive victory
<pb id="aughey528" n="528"/>
of Smith both inured to the salvation of Sherman,
the declarative glory of God, and the utter subversion
of rebellion. In the battle of Tupelo, including
Guntown or Tishomingo Creek, the Federals lost
in killed, wounded, and captured, more than eleven
thousand men, but the results achieved more than
compensated this loss.</p>
          <p>The battle of Tupelo stands in the same relation
to the capture of Atlanta, and the triumphant march
of Sherman to the sea, that the battle of Oriskany
does to the capture of Burgoyne. <hi rend="italics">Vide</hi> Official

          <head>FROM “THE AMERICAN CONFLICT”—BY HORACE
GREELEY.</head>
          <p>Before the opening of 1861, a perfect reign of terror
had been established throughout the Gulf States.
A secret order, known as “Knights of the Golden
Circle,” or as “Knights of the Columbian Star,”
succeeding that known six or seven years earlier as
the “Order of the Lone Star,” having for its ostensible
object the acquisition of Cuba, Mexico, and
Central America, and the establishment of Slavery in
the latter two, but really operating in the interest of
disunion, had spread its network of lodges, grips,
passwords, and alluring mysteries all over the South,
and had ramifications even in some of the cities of
adjoining Free States. Other clubs, more or less
<pb id="aughey529" n="529"/>
secret, were known as “The Precipitators,” “Vigilance
Committees,” “Minute Men,” and by kindred
designations; but all of them were sworn to fidelity
to Southern Rights; while their members were
gradually prepared and ripened, wherever any ripening
was needed, for the task of treason. Whoever ventured
to condemn and repudiate Secession as the true
and sovereign remedy for Southern wrongs, in any
neighborhood where Slavery was dominant, was
thenceforth a marked man, to be stigmatized and
hunted down as a Lincolnite, Submissionist, or
Abolitionist.</p>
          <p>One refugee planter from Alabama, himself a
slaveholder, but of Northern birth, who barely escaped
a violent death, because of an intercepted letter from a
relative in Connecticut, urging him to free his slaves
and return to the North as he had promised, stated
that “he had himself been obliged to join the
 ‘Minute Men’ of his neighborhood for safety, and had
thus been compelled to assist in hanging six men of
Northern birth because of their Union sentiments,
and he personally knew that not less than <hi rend="italics">one
hundred</hi> men had been hung in his section of the state
and in the adjoining section of Georgia during the
six weeks which preceded his escape in December,
1860.” This gentleman made his statement to Mr.
O. J. Victor, author of “The History of the Southern
Rebellion,” who knew him well and vouches
for his integrity. (See his Vol. I., p. 134.) See to
the same effect the testimony of Hon. A. J. Hamilton,

of Texas, Rev. Mr. Aughey, of Mississippi, and

          <p>Southern <hi rend="italics">unanimity</hi> (in certain localities) for
Secession was such as violence and terror have often
produced in favor of the most universally detested men

because the victims would not conceal and deny their

          <head>THE GLORIOUS FOURTH.</head>
          <p>There is something more than sentiment in our
annual celebration of the Fourth of July. It is the
nation's birthday. John Adams was right when,
on the adoption of the Declaration of Independence,
he declared that posterity would celebrate the event
with noisy enthusiasm. It is a prophecy well
fulfilled, and well it is that it is well fulfilled, even
though it include that diabolical nuisance, the Chinese
fire-cracker.</p>
          <p>Like all other celebrations, it helps to keep alive
in us an appreciation of what we celebrate. It tends
to fan the flame of our patriotism, and to awaken a
sense of personal responsibility. Liberty can not be
perpetuated, any more than it can be achieved, without
virtue, honor, love of country, love of kind, and
love of God. Despotism may dwell in darkness,
and cultivate ignorance and corruption; but liberty
must have the light, and demands intelligence and
purity.</p>
          <p>Grand men were those fathers of our country!
Theirs was a daring, a patience, an endurance that
has had few parallels in the whole course of human
history. A few weak colonists were struggling
against the foremost military power in the world—
an infant in the arms of, and struggling against, its
mother. But it was a case in which the mother more
than half suspected she was wrong, and where the
child, knowing it was right, appealed to men for the
<pb id="aughey532" n="532"/>
justice of their cause, and to God for the help which
He alone could give. “A decent respect for the
opinions of mankind,” and trust in God as the
All-wise Ruler of nations, makes a good foundation on
which to build a new and great nation. But this
was a case of building far better than they knew.
The foundation was better. The building was larger.
It is true that God is not recognized by name in the
Constitution, but this is more because He had been
recognized to that extent that further recognition did
not seem necessary, rather than that there was any
lack of faith and trust. To fail to name God even
in fit time and place, does not justify an implication
of atheism in one whose whole life is grounded in a
settled consistent faith in Him.</p>
          <p>Who can imagine in what different channels
history would have ran had trust in God, as a factor,
been wanting. Fighting to break the yoke of the
oppressor, they achieved liberty—liberty in its
highest sense, “freedom to worship God.” When that
yoke was broken, though they had not fought for
any particular form of government, nor in the interest
of any one to govern, the whole machinery of a
new form of government was ordained, and rulers
elected, and not another drop of blood shed. History
furnishes no parallel. The revolution in France came
later, they had us to pattern after. But men who
had lost faith in religion, even to the point of being
atheists, could have no “decent respect for the opinions
of mankind,” and so were in no condition to
<figure id="ill33" entity="aughey532"><p>WHILE THE YOUNG PATRIOT WAS DRINKING SHE DREW A PISTOL AND IMMEDIATELY SHOT HIM. Page 526.</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey533" n="533"/>
pattern. The horror of their revolution is unspeakable,
and the sun of their republic set in blood, and
was succeeded by a night of merciless, brutal despotism;
while ours is even now ascending the heavens,
lacking much yet of having reached the zenith.</p>
          <p>Little did those men know, who won so much for
us, the significance of their work. Little did they
realize of the great extent of the country whose
dedication to freedom they were making possible. For
the vast domain secured by the Louisiana and Alaska
purchases has followed a line of destiny predetermined
by them. Little did they dream how soon
this country, then mostly an unexplored wilderness,
would become the home of nearly a hundred millions
of the most prosperous and happy people on the face
of the earth; nor how, by forces as yet unharnessed,
this wilderness would so soon be made to bud and
blossom as the rose. Their ship of state was stronger
than they knew. There may have been fascinations,
but there was little in the history of republics to
justify confidence to make another experiment in that
line. But a master-hand laid her keel, and made
all her ribs of steel. Her trustworthiness has been
most fully shown in storm and in action. Furiously
attacked, but gallantly defended, in 1812-14, when
the storm cloud had passed, it was plain that “Our
flag was still there.”</p>
          <p>In 1860-64, in a rebellion that would have cost any
other nation under heaven its life, “a government by
the people” was found sufficiently strong not only to
<pb id="aughey534" n="534"/>
protect and maintain its own integrity, but to eliminate
from the body politic the vile cancer of slavery
which had caused the trouble. To conduct both sides
of the greatest war in the history of the world, and
come out of it on the side of the government, so
consciously strong as not to demand, by way of penalty,
one drop of rebel blood, is an exhibition both of
power and patience unparalleled. After more than a
hundred years, we begin to have the right to celebrate.
We have no mushroom government. It is a great
fact, and a great power. It has come to stay. In it
our fathers gave us a vast inheritance. But it is one
that implies vast responsibility and care on our part.
It would be an easy thing in this case for the children
to waste their patrimony. Fourths of July, with all
their noise and fun, readings of the Declaration, and
speeches both green and dry, will not prevent it.</p>
          <p>The men who, for “freedom to worship God,”
landed on a rock, and braved the rigors of a New
England winter, and won their living from its sterile soil,
are not represented in men who desecrate Sabbaths,
ridicule worship, and have “no God,” nor can these
degenerate sons appreciate, much less maintain, the
institutions, civil and religious, that have been handed
down to them. But for the religious, we could not
have had the civil; and you can not now take the
former away, and keep the latter standing. We shall
have “glorious Fourths of July,” just so long and no
longer than we are true to the traditions of our
fathers, and to Christianity, which underlies and
permeates our government.</p>

          <head>FRATERNAL RELATIONS.</head>
          <p>In the year of grace 1882 the Southern General
Assembly made this palinodial deliverance: “In
order to remove all difficulties in the way of that full
and formal correspondence, which, on out part, we
are prepared to accept, we adopt the following minute,
to-wit: That, while receding from no principle,
we do hereby declare our regret for, and withdrawal
of, all expressions of our Assembly which may be
regarded as reflecting upon, or offensive to, the General
Assembly of the Presbyterian church in the
United States of America.”</p>
          <p>The Northern General Assembly responded by
recalling the epithets, heretics, schismatics, and
blasphemers, which a former Assembly in the fiery days
of civil war had applied to their Southern brethren.
This prepared the way for the establishment of
fraternal correspondence, which was then inaugurated,
and which has been continued till the present day
with increasing interest, thus burnishing brighter
and brighter the golden chain of friendship—</p>

          <p>We do not look upon the present movement against
the saloon as a passing wave of excitement, as a
temporary ebullition of public feeling on the liquor
question. It is too strong and deep for that. It is a
movement that has come to stay, to grow, and to
succeed. It has taken hold of the hearts and minds
of the people as no movement of the kind ever did
before. The country is at last awakening to a full
and true realization of the fearful wrongs and abuses
which are the inevitable accompaniments of the drink
traffic. We have seen the beginning of the end.
The handwriting is upon the wall—the saloon must
go. That edict will not be repealed. It may not be
in this decade; it may not be in the next; but as
surely as God reigns the day is coming, and that
soon, when this land, from East to West, from North
to South, will be ever free from the curse of the
legalized rum traffic. This is a large hope, but it is ours,
and we rejoice in it. It has its basis upon no illusory
dream, but upon a sure and strong conviction,
which nothing can shake. And having this hope,
we are not greatly troubled about such things as
vetoes and decisions of the courts. These things
may retard the onward movement for a brief season,
but they cannot stop it. The rum traffic is doomed
to die.</p>

          <p>We may not sell anything which tends to impair
health; such is eminently all that liquid fire, commonly
called drams or spirituous liquors. It is true, these
may have a place in medicine, they may be of use in
some bodily disorder (although there would rarely be
occasion for them, were it not for the unskillfulness
of the practitioner); therefore, such as prepare and sell
them for this end only, may keep themselves clear;
but who are they? Do you know ten such distillers
in England? Then excuse these; but all who sell
them in the common way, to any that will buy, are
prisoners general. They murder her majesty's
subjects by wholesale; neither does their eye pity nor
spare; they drive them to hell like sheep; and what
is their gain? Is it not the blood of these men?
Who, then, would envy their large estates and
sumptuous palaces? A curse is in the midst of them; the
curse of God cleaves to the stones, the timber, the
furniture of them; the curse of God is in their gardens,
their walks, their groves; a fire that burns to
the nethermost hell. Blood, blood is there! The
foundation, the floor, the roof, are stained with blood;
and canst thou hope, O thou man of blood, though
thou art clothed in purple and fine linen, and farest
sumptuously every day, canst thou hope to deliver
down thy fields of blood to the third generation?
Not so; for there is a God in Heaven, therefore thy
name shall be rooted out, like as those whom thou
hast destroyed, body and soul; thy memorial shall

          <head>UNRESTRITCTED IMMIGRATION.</head>
          <p>In his Oration at Gettysburg, July 3, 1888, in the
presence and in the hearing of that great multitude of
ex-Union and ex-Confederate soldiers, Mr. George
William Curtis truly said, in reference to unrestricted
immigration:</p>
          <p>“Let us beware then how we recklessly water our
life-blood. Webster said at Bunker Hill, just as the
vast immigration was beginning, ‘We are placed at
the head of representative and popular governments.’
We shall be recreant to the duty of that headship if
we permit the fundamental conditions of national
repose, of the security of personal rights, of good laws,
and of just administration, to be imperiled by the
ignorant, lawless, idle, and dangerous overflow of all
other countries. We are the occupants and guardians
of this country, and with a kindly heart and hospitable
hand toward all the world, we must prescribe the
conditions upon which the world shall come here.”</p>
          <p>Another issue to be met is to secure the absolute
purity of the ballot box; that every one entitled to
vote should be permitted to do so without molestation,
and that his vote should be counted as it was intended
to be. Without these two securities, the maintenance
of the republican form of government is impossible.
On this issue Mr. Curtis, in the same oration,
was explicit and forcible. He said:</p>
          <p>“Akin to this [the matter of immigration] is the
problem of the suffrage. Subject to the constitutional
guarantee of a republican form of government, and of
<pb id="aughey539" n="539"/>
no discrimination against race or color, the regulation
of the suffrage is wisely left to the States. But the
action of every state upon subjects of a common interest
necessarily affects the Union. The suffrage is the
mainspring, the heart of our common life, and whatever
affects it injuriously, touches the national sensorium,
and the whole country thrills. No community
politically founded upon the legal equality of
the suffrage can habitually disregard that equality
without moral deterioration, growing indifference to
the authority of law, and destruction of the
democratic-republican principle. If ignorance and
semi-barbarous dominance be fatal to civilized communities,
not less so is constant and deliberate defiance of law.
In a national union of states where fair elections are
assumed, systematic fraud, or violence, or suppression
of votes, in the event of a closely contested poll, would
inevitably destroy the conviction that the apparent
result represented the will of the legal voters, and
that result would be challenged amid violent disorder.
It is not enough that a national election be fair,
it must be the national conviction that it is fair.”</p>

          <p>The state, having its origin in divine institution,
and therefore the creature of God, existing for moral
ends, and conversant about moral objects, possessed
of a moral character, and having moral responsibilities
to and reckonings with God, ought, as a state, to
have a religious character and life of its own and in
suitable forms to give expression to these. This is
peculiarly incumbent upon the state, as such, because
the state assumes to exercise dominion over its
subjects, their property, their persons, and their lives;
and it is monstrous that a power vested in men should,
in that august and dreadful name, assume such
prerogatives, and yet not expressly acknowledge its own
subjection to the Majesty in the heavens, and to the
divine law as the supreme standard by which it is
obliged to conform in all its acts and functions.—</p>

          <head>THE OCTOROON, THOMAS GRIMKE.</head>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“With peaceful mind thy path of duty run;</l>
            <l>God nothing does, nor suffers to be done,</l>
            <l>But what thou wouldst thyself, if thou couldst see</l>
            <l>Through all events of things as well as he.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Thomas Grimké was one of those who were guarding
my house when attacked, as recorded on page 62
of this volume. In the summer of 1853 I traveled
by stage from Holly Springs, Miss., to Grenada, in
the same state. In order to better observe the
scenery through which we were passing, I asked and
obtained permission to ride with the driver. A
planter who resided near Grenada sat on one side of
the driver, and I was invited to be seated between
them. Behind us, on the stage, lay a manacled
slave. Agony was depicted upon his countenance.
It seemed to be the pangs of bitter disappointment
rather than of pain, though his position was apparently
a very uneasy one. Both hands and feet were
fettered. I found the planter, Dr. Bailie Peyton, a
very loquacious gentleman. After we had established
an acquaintance I said casually, casting a backward
glance, “Is this your boy?” (Male slaves are called
boys until they are forty or forty-five years old, after
which they are called uncle.)</p>
          <p>“Yes,” said the doctor, “and he's a troublesome
one.”</p>
          <p>“What has he done?”</p>
          <p>“This makes ten times that he has run away, and
it has cost me five hundred dollars to catch him. I
<pb id="aughey542" n="542"/>
have sworn to give him one thousand lashes, well
laid on, in four installments, when  I get him home.”</p>
          <p>“Why, that will kill him, won't it?”</p>
          <p>“I don't care if it does.”</p>
          <p>“Why, he's worth fifteen hundred dollars.”</p>
          <p>“Fifteen hundred! I wouldn't take any man's
three thousand for him. He's a splendid overseer,
and he has no bad habits except running away.”</p>
          <p>“Doctor, what induces him to run away.”</p>
          <p>“Well, parson, ain't you a parson?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir.”</p>
          <p>“Well, pardon me for making use of some pretty
strong expletives in your presence. Thinking of the
trouble and expense Le Roy has put me to is very
provoking. Parson, I think he has some high notions
about freedom. My aunt, Annetta Peyton,
took quite a fancy to Le Roy, and, being a religious
old maid, she took it into her head (her heart
she always said) to violate our state laws, and teach him
to read and write. It's a whim of hers that he looks
like the Peytons, and isn't any common nigger.
This is what it ends in. Since her death he has been
continually running away.”</p>
          <p>“Where did you find him this time?”</p>
          <p>“Near Bowling Green, Ky. He was heading
straight for Canada. I hired Derrick Louray, with
his famous nigger dogs, and Barley Bird, with his
imported Cuban blood-hounds. I hired them when
his track was fresh, and they were out a month, and
hunted all over Grenada, Yalobusba, and Panola
<pb id="aughey543" n="543"/>
counties. They scoured the country a whole month,
and came back wofully crestfallen. They both
swore that it was the first time they had failed to
bring back the nigger dead or alive. After this, this
slave will work with a ball and chain attached to his
ankle, and under a vigilant overseer; that is, if he
stands the thousand lashes.”</p>
          <p>“Doctor, it would be merciful to remit a part of
the penalty.”</p>
          <p>“Why, parson, would you want me to swear to
a lie? I've sworn to give him a thousand, well laid
on, and he'll get them, if he dies at the post.”</p>
          <p>“Some oaths are more honored in the breach than
in the observance.”</p>
          <p>“Parson, you may rest assured this one will not
be honored in the breach, and I may order the overseer
to carry one for every ten, so that there will not
be any mistake about the thousand.”</p>
          <p>“He seems to be as white as either you or I?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, he's an octoroon. I think that accounts for
his remarkable success in evading the hounds, and
getting so far north. I think he passed himself off
for a white man, and with his glib tongue imposed
upon the white people, and got lodging, and so
traveled north. He was working in Bowling Green as
a white porter in a grocery. His employer saw a
description of him as a runaway slave in the
<hi rend="italics">Memphis Eagle and Enquirer</hi>, and his suspicion being
aroused, in order to secure the reward, he wrote me.</p>
          <p>“As soon as I received his letter I went up post-haste,
<pb id="aughey544" n="544"/>
and sure enough found that it was Le Roy.
His story was that he was a stevedore, lived in
Mobile, Alabama, and was on his way to visit friends
in Cincinnati, Ohio, and having lost his pocket-book
at the hands of a pick-pocket he was compelled to
work awhile to make up the loss. I'm thinking that
it will be some considerable time before he visits his
friends in Cincinnati. I have no doubt that every
fugitive slave has friends in Cincinnati. I'll whip
the story out of him when I get him home, and find
out if any villain knowingly helped him on his way
toward the polar star. And if any one did, woe to
him. His abolition carcass will soon be filled with
more lead than it can easily tote. I bought a wife
for him that he took a fancy to, of Senator Washington,
my neighbor. She, like himself, is an octoroon.
However, I sold her last year to General
Jo. Jefferson, of Grenada. I hated to sell her from
her husband, but the General wanted a woman.
He's a lustful old fellow, and I got a cool $3,000
for her. My stars! how mad <sic corr="Le Roy">Leroy</sic> was. He acted
as though he wanted to kill somebody for awhile,
and then I feared he'd commit suicide by slow
starvation. He has never been the same man since.
If I did get a pretty good price for the girl, I came
near losing Le Roy by it, and so did not make much
in the long run. The boy became discontented, and
my other niggers seemed to sympathize with him,
and I overheard them saying that I would never
have any luck. Things did go wrong. I think
<pb id="aughey545" n="545"/>
they tried to make their prophecies come true. The
cotton crop turned out poorly, and corn was almost
a failure. Some of my best working mules were
killed by buffalo gnats in the Taccaleeche swamp.</p>
          <p>“I tied Le Roy up and gave him two hundred
lashes on the bare back, thinking I would whip the
sulks out of him. Then he ran away, and it has
cost fearfully to hire hounds and to go all the way
up to Bowling Green, Ky., after him, and to pay
the large reward I offered for his recovery. A general
gloom has settled down upon my family, and
upon the whole plantation. I have had the devil to
pay all around. I sometimes wish that I had not
sold Dilsie, but she was my property and I had the
right to dispose of her to whomever I chose. Had
I known what was to follow from the meanness and
superstition of my hands, as a matter of policy I
should have declined the $3,000 and kept Dilsie.
Dilsie had a baby, blue-eyed and light-haired. She
called her Minnie. She is three years old. I sold
her last week to Major Madison, of Grenada, for
$500. Girl babies that are white and pretty bring
a fearful price in this neck of woods. She will bring
the Major $3,000 if he wishes to sell her when she
is fourteen years old.”</p>
          <p>“Fourteen, Doctor, that is quite a high price for
one so young.”</p>
          <p>“Parson, I have known them to be used at
twelve.”</p>
          <p>“But is it quite right to traffic in female virtue?”</p>
          <pb id="aughey546" n="546"/>
          <p>“A slave has no rights that a white man is bound
to respect. This is the view of the South, and it
is the doctrine of the Bible, too. I heard Parson
Angus Johnson, of Water Valley, preach a sermon
on the duties of slaves. He told us that it was
their duty to obey in all things their masters, and
that if in chastising a slave his master killed him,
according to the Bible he ought not to be punished,
because he is his money. Oh! he gave us some
mighty good doctrine.</p>
          <p>“I am not a Christian, far from it, but I have
some respect for a religion that teaches such
wholesome doctrine, and I will help support any minister
that preaches like Parson Johnson. I did once order
my overseer to give a girl a hundred lashes. She
was <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">enciente</hi></foreign> and the fright and pain brought on
premature labor, and she died the next day. I felt very
bad. If I had been a murderer I could not have
felt worse for awhile. But as providence would
have it, though I seldom attend church, I went
the next Sabbath. I wanted to hear what hope there
was in the gospel for such a great sinner as I felt
myself to be. There was a burden on my soul that
I felt I must get rid of or die. When I heard the
parson say that God had ordained slavery, and that
slaves must obey their masters, in all things, I felt
better, and when he said the Bible tells us if a man
smite his servant or his maid with a rod and he die
under his hand, he shall not be punished, for he is
his money, I received that as a special message from
<pb id="aughey547" n="547"/>
heaven addressed to myself. My conscience was
quieted and I returned home a happier man. Parson
Johnson had heard of Dinah's death and the cause of
it, and he preached a special sermon to fit the case. I
do not remember the text, but I think it was the usual
text against the abolitionists, ‘Cursed be Canaan, a
servant of servants shall he be for ever and ever, amen;
and whosoever findeth him shall enslave him.’ Dinah
was worth $1,500. She was a good field hand. The
loss of the money I can stand. The thought that I
was a murderer was killing me, but the gospel, as
dispensed by Parson Johnson, healed that trouble, as
the parson said, there is a balm in Gilead to heal the
wounded and troubled conscience. He further said
that Christ and his apostles approved the slavery that
existed in their day, when the power of life and death
was vested in the master, and that they required slaves
to be obedient, not only to the good and gentle, but
also to the froward. When beaten they were to take
it patiently, they were not even to answer again or
to talk back. All power, according to the Bible, was
vested in the master; submission in all things was
the duty of the slave. The parson said the abolitionists
of the North said, for we don't allow any in the
South, by way of argument against slavery, that
some of our slaves were white and that many of them
were our own children. In Christ's day, he replied,
all the slaves were of the same color as their masters
and many of them were their master's children, and
Christ and his apostles did not disapprove it for that
<pb id="aughey548" n="548"/>
reason. Ah! my friend, the parson is a powerful
preacher. He preaches the gospel that suits me. I
subscribed $100 to his salary the next day. Before
he left my house—for he dined with me that day—I
gave him a present of fifty dollars in gold, and
assured him he should never be destitute of a true
friend while I lived. He preaches a gospel that
makes a man feel good and happy from the bottom of
his heart; he feels like thanking God for such a gospel.
If our slaves had this gospel preached to them,
and they would receive it, they would be far less
discontented.”</p>
          <p>At this moment the wheels of a heavily laden wagon
collided with the wheels of our coach. We soon after
reached a relay house, when the driver discovered
that one of the wheels of the coach was injured by
the collision and needed repair. This occasioned a
delay of two hours. The passengers sauntered hither
and yonder at will. Le Roy was carried into the
yard in the rear of the relay house and laid upon a
<sic corr="plot">plat</sic> of ground near the palings.</p>
          <p>After the lapse of an hour I approached him.
From my look of compassion and from my
conversation with his master, he was led to hope that I
might be a friend to him in this hour of sorest need.
As I drew near he said:</p>
          <p>“Master, for the love of God bring me some
water.”</p>
          <p>I supplied his urgent need from a pump hard by.
His next question:</p>

          </p>
          <pb id="aughey549" n="549"/>
          <p>“Master, where was you born?”</p>
          <p>“In New Hartford, near Utica, N. Y.”</p>
          <p>“Is that in the North?”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>“Master, I'm in great distress.”</p>
          <p>“Do you suffer much pain?”</p>
          <p>“Some in body, but more in mind.”</p>
          <p>“What troubles your mind?”</p>
          <p>“Unless I can get away before master gets me
home he will murder me, for there's murder in his
eye and in his heart.”</p>
          <p>Agony was depicted upon his countenance, and his
voice quivered with emotion. I left him, and walked
to and fro in a grove of Norway spruce a short
distance from the hotel. I reflected thus: This man
has a wife and child, though bereft of them for the
present. I have no family. He is doomed to a
cruel death, for he cannot survive a thousand lashes
laid on by one who is prompted by wrath and hatred
and malice. Is it my duty to risk my life to save
his? These passages occurred to my mind:
“Remember those that are in bonds as bound with
them,” and “He that saveth his life shall lose it.”
My duty in the premises seemed plain. I returned
and said:</p>
          <p>“Le Roy, what can I do to save you?”</p>
          <p>“Master, you can get me a file. My wrists are
larger than my hands. I can slip the handcuffs off
at any time, and having a file I can soon rid my
ankles of the chain, and I can without much difficulty
travel with the bands on my ankles.”</p>
          <pb id="aughey550" n="550"/>
          <p>“If I help you at the risk of my life will you
betray me?”</p>
          <p>“Never, so help me God.<corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>“If you are overtaken and caught by the hounds
can they compel you by whipping to tell who helped
you?”</p>
          <p>“I will die at the post before I would tell on you
or any one who helps me.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I will run the awful risk. I will get you
a file and will assist you all I can.”</p>
          <p>“When we reach Grenada it will be night. Master
will lodge at the Grenada House till morning.
You can get the file at a hardware store in the city,
and pass it to me in some way<corr>.</corr> I will be on the
lookout.”</p>
          <p>I left Le Roy to his meditations. When we
entered the coach I noticed Le Roy's face beaming
with a new-born hope. We reached Grenada at
seven o'clock. After supper I visited a hardware
store and made a few purchases, and managed to
secrete a file on my person. I feared to purchase one.
At another store I purchased a ball of twine. Dr.
Peyton and I registered together, and at his request
were assigned to the same room. Le Roy was
carried by two stalwart colored servants to an
unfurnished room in the second story, the Doctor and I
accompanying them. The Doctor locked the door
and put the key in his pocket. I obtained reluctant
leave of the Doctor to procure some corn bread and
meat for Le Roy. I went to the kitchen and bought
<pb id="aughey551" n="551"/>
the food from one of the servants. I asked the
Doctor to accompany me to the room. He handed
me the key, saying that he must visit the barber. I
procured a lamp, and going to Le Roy's dark,
dismal, little room, gave him the food, together with
the file and twine.</p>
          <p>I told him I dared not purchase a rope, and knew
not how he could descend from the window of his
room to the ground, as the twine was not strong
enough to bear his weight. He replied:</p>
          <p>“My wife is at General Jefferson's. Call there.
She will answer the bell. Tell her to bring a rope
and come under the window of this room with it at
midnight, that I will let down the twine, she can tie
the rope to it, and I can get down in that way.”</p>
          <p>I called at General Jefferson's at nine o'clock. An
octoroon came to the door. Said I:</p>
          <p>“What is your name?”</p>
          <p>She replied, “Dilsie.”</p>
          <p>“Do you know Dr. Peyton's Le Roy?”</p>
          <p>“He is my husband.”</p>
          <p>I gave her her husband's message. She promised
compliance. I had told Le Roy that if he could
reach Ripley, Miss., to inquire for Mr. Faulkner,
who would render him all possible aid, and would
send me any information he might have for me. I
returned to the hotel at half past ten. I asked Dr.
Peyton to visit Le Roy to see that he was still there.
We did so, and found him as we had left him. The
Doctor assured him that he would get the city
<pb id="aughey552" n="552"/>
whipper to give him the first installment of the
thousand lashes bright and early in the morning,
before starting for home. Le Roy said:</p>
          <p>“Master, please be merciful.”</p>
          <p>“You do not deserve mercy,” rejoined the Doctor.</p>
          <p>We then returned to our room and retired. We
did not wake till half past seven in the morning.
As we were dressing we heard a great tumult in the
hotel. Presently the landlord knocked loudly at our
door. Upon being admitted he said:</p>
          <p>“Doctor, your nigger absconded in the night, a
rope, apparently a bed-rope, hangs dangling from the
window of his roam, the only clew as yet as to the
manner of his escape. Who furnished the rope or
aided him in getting rid of his irons is as yet a
mystery. I have given the alarm in the city and the
authorities are on the alert and your slave will
doubtless soon be brought in.”</p>
          <p>The doctor lost all control of his temper and swore
terribly. He started a messenger off for Barley Bird,
and his imported Cuban blood-hounds, ordering him
to make all possible haste. He declared with a terrible
oath that when caught he would tie Le Roy up
by the thumbs and administer the thousand lashes at
once. He closely scrutinized the room and the yard
below. He secured the rope by which the descent
had been made. He found the door of the room
locked as when he had left it. An air of impenetrable
mystery surrounded the whole affair. The servants
at the hotel professed profound ignorance of the
<pb id="aughey553" n="553"/>
matter. The night had been very dark. It was the
dark of the moon and lowering clouds had obscured
the starlight. One of the guests reported that having
occasion to go out near midnight he encountered
a colored woman not far from the ground underneath
the window whence Le Roy had escaped. He asked
her who she was and what she was doing out there at
so late an hour. She replied that she was a
chambermaid and that she was waiting upon the sick lady
in room No. 30, and that she was out in her service.
The servants were all required to put in an appearance
in the dining-room, but the investigation elicited
no information. Barley Bird arrived with his hounds
but could not get them to scent Le Roy's track. Many
colored persons had visited the yard, and when the
hounds found a track it would terminate on the steps
or lead into the kitchen or dining-room. All Grenada
was on the <foreign lang="spa"><hi rend="italics">qui vive</hi></foreign>. After a few visits to the bar the
doctor became furious and reckless. He offered $500
for the arrest of the fugitive. Soon eight companies,
each with a pack of blood-bounds, were scouring the
country near and far in search of the fugitive, each
bent on securing the reward. They visited General
Jefferson's mansion, but the general positively
declared that Dilsie had not left his premises during
the night, of this he was absolutely certain. A
thorough search was instituted. At fifteen minutes of
twelve Dilsie had quietly and unperceived slipped out
of the house, leaving the general asleep, and in half
an hour she had accomplished the dangerous task.
<pb id="aughey554" n="554"/>
She secreted Le Roy in the chicken-coop, in a box
underneath a lot of straw on which two hens were
incubating, one at each end of the box. It was a
difficult feat to get under the straw without disturbing
the fowls, but it was nevertheless accomplished by
the dexterous aid of this devoted woman. The baying
of the hounds and the shouting and yelling of
the infuriated pursuers made the general's premises a
perfect pandemonium for the space of two hours.
They were loth to leave the place, and remained till
every recess and crevice capable of sheltering a
human being had been examined. Descrying
the chicken-coop they sent a colored boy into it, and bade
him toss up the straw in the box, but the disturbed
hens pecked and squawked furiously. The boy thrust
his arm down into the straw, when one of the hens
pecked him in the eye, causing him to beat a hasty
retreat. The crowd ordered him to return to the
search. He did so, thrusting his arm down at various
points, but apparently made no discovery. He
came out declaring:</p>
          <p>“Dat box am empty ob eberyting but straw an'
fitin' hens.”</p>
          <p>His hand had come in contact with the face and
limbs of Le Roy. He certainly knew that the fugitive
was in that box, but young as he was be kept
his own counsel. He was a quadroon twelve years
old, and a special favorite of Dilsie's. That same
evening he approached Dilsie and quietly said:</p>
          <p>“Dilsie, you's been good to me, an' I b'leve dat
<pb id="aughey555" n="555"/>
it's right to do good to dem what duz good to you, so
I saved yer husband's life fer you.”</p>
          <p>Dilsie looked up in alarm and said, “Why, Sarnem,
what do you mean?”</p>
          <p>“Oh,” said he, “I node Roy was in dat box in de
chicken-coop, 'cause why, I feeled um, but duz yer
tink ize gwine ter tell an' let dem dogs kill um?
No, sur, I'd dide fust. I give Roy's ear a good pull
to let him no I node he wuz dar, an' needn't be
afeard ob me a tellin'. Now, Aunt Dilsie, give me a
cooky.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, you shall have a dozen.”</p>
          <p>“O, glory! duz you mean it?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I do, and I'll trust you to help me to save
Roy”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I will, you may 'pend on me.”</p>
          <p>It is only necessary to say further that Le Roy was
concealed for a month on the general's premises, till
the search for him was abandoned. He then made
his way to Ripley, was received by friends who
informed him of my whereabouts. He visited me. I
advanced him money, and passing himself for a white
man (he was white) he purchased some land near
Tuscumbia, Alabama. With great difficulty and risk
I succeeded in abducting his wife and child. On his
land he lived happily with them, securing the respect
of his neighbors and the esteem of his brethren in
the church, of which himself and wife became members.
When I removed to Choctaw county he sold
out his farm, and purchasing a few acres of land in
<pb id="aughey556" n="556"/>
this county, he located near me. He now lives near
Los Angeles, California. He has become wealthy,
and he has given his children a good education. He
has six children, three boys and three girls. One of
his sons (named for me) is a lawyer, one a physician.
One daughter, Minnie, is married. Her husband is
a state senator. Le Roy was a half brother of Dr.
Bailie Peyton. His mother, though white, was a
slave and the mistress of the doctor's father. Such
is slavery in itself. Is it any wonder that Thomas
Grimké expressed a willingness to serve me to the
extent of his ability and at the risk of his life. Le
Roy assumed this name by my direction to conceal
his identity. He intends, if his life is spared, to
visit me next spring. The above episode is true, except
a change of names in some instances.</p>

          <head>MASSACRE OF TEXAN UNIONISTS.</head>
          <p>From the time when Twiggs betrayed Texas into
the hands of the Confederates, the loyal people of that
state suffered intensely from the cruelties of the
insurgents. In Western Texas, where there were few
slave-holders, and consequently more patriotism, the
Union element was very strong and pertinacious,
and the inhabitants were both hated and feared by
the banditti of the conspirators, who moved over the
country with fire and rope, to destroy property and
strangle loyal citizens. The sufferings of the Texas
<pb id="aughey557" n="557"/>
loyalists were intensified early in the summer of
1862, after the reverses of the Confederates in
Tennessee, when Texas was placed under martial law.
The country was scoured by guerrilla bands, who
committed the most atrocious crimes, robbing and
murdering all who were suspected of being friends of
their country. Great numbers of the loyalists attempted
to flee from the state to Mexico, singly and
in small parties. The earlier fugitives escaped, but
a greater portion were captured by the guerrillas and
murdered. One of the organs of the conspirators
<hi rend="italics">(San Antonio Herald)</hi> said exultingly, “Their bones
are bleaching on the soil of every county from Red
River to the Rio Grande, and in the counties of Wise
and Denton their bodies are suspended by scores
from the Black Jacks.”</p>
          <p>A notable and representative instance of the treatment
received by the Texan loyalists at the hands of
their oppressors is found in the narrative of an attempt
of about sixty of them, mostly young Germans belonging
to the best families in western Texas, to leave the
country. They collected at Fredericksburg, on the
frontier, intending to make their way to New Orleans
by way of Mexico, and join the national army. On
the night of the ninth of August they encamped on
the edge of a cedar brake, on the Neuces river, about
forty miles from the Rio Grande. They had moved
with such secrecy that they scarcely felt any apprehension
of danger from the guerrillas who were scouring
the country, with orders to kill all Unionists. But
<pb id="aughey558" n="558"/>
they were betrayed and a leader named Duff (see page
343 of Tupelo) sent over one hundred men to
surprise and destroy them. At near daylight they
approached the camp, and captured one of the party.
His life was offered him as a reward, if he would
lead them to the camp of his companions. He refused
and was hanged. The guerrillas then fell upon
the patriots, who were sleeping. A desperate struggle
ensued, and at length, opposed by overwhelming
numbers and superior weapons, the Unionists were
conquered, but not till two-thirds of their number
were killed or wounded. The survivors fled toward
the Rio Grande. Some escaped, and others were
captured, tortured, and hung. The wounded already
in the hands of the insurgents were murdered in the
most barbarous manner, by bullets, bayonets,
bowie-knives, and hanging. Some who were actually
dying were dragged to trees and hung by the fiends.
The commander of the butchers, Lieutenant Lilley,
afterward boasted that he killed several of the
wounded with his own hands, emptying two revolvers
in shooting them. The lives of forty of the sixty
young men were sacrificed, at an expense to the
murderers of eight killed and fourteen wounded in the
battle. When the banner of the Republic gave
protection to the loyalists of Texas, three years later,
measures were taken to collect the remains of the
slain, and bury them. This was accomplished, and
a fine monument was erected to their memory.—</p>

          <head>THE PURITY OF THE BALLOT.</head>
          <p>From republican platform, 1888:</p>
          <p>“We re-affirm our unswerving devotion to the national
constitution and to the indissoluble union of the states;
to the autonomy reserved to the states under the
constitution; to the personal rights and liberties
of citizens in all the states and territories in the Union,
and especially to the supreme and sovereign right
of every lawful citizen, rich or poor, native or foreign
born, white or black, to cast one free ballot in public
elections and to have that ballot duly counted. We
hold the free and honest popular ballot and the just
and equal representation of all the people to be the
foundation of our republican government, and demand
effective legislation to secure the integrity and purity
of elections, which are the fountains of all public authority.
We charge that the present administration and the democratic
majority in congress owe their existence to the suppression of
the ballot by a criminal nullification of the constitution
and laws of the United States.”</p>
          <p>From democratic platform, 1888:</p>
          <p>“Chief among its principles of party faith are the
maintenance of an indissoluble union of free and indestructible
states, now about to enter upon its second century of unexampled
progress and renown, devotion to a plan of government regulated by a
written constitution strictly specifying every granted
<pb id="aughey560" n="560"/>
power and expressly reserving to the states or people
the entire ungranted residue of power; the
encouragement of a jealous popular vigilance, directed to
all who have been chosen for brief terms to enact and
execute the laws, and are charged with the duty of
preserving peace, ensuring equality, and establishing
justice.”</p>

          <head>DISTINCTIVE PRINCIPLES.</head>
          <p>In the volume entitled “Distinctive Principles of
the Southern Presbyterian Church,” published by
the committee of publication, the General Assembly
declare:</p>
          <p>“Although the existence of slavery has terminated,
yet it is necessary to hold as an article of faith the
belief that slavery or the holding of human beings
as chattels is a dogma in accord with scriptural truth,
and inasmuch as this doctrine has lost nothing of
its importance as a question of social morality and
scriptural truth, and since the contrary opinion is
unscriptural and fanatical, and is one of the most
pernicious heresies of modern times, its countenance
by any church is a just cause of separation from it
(I. Tim. vi. 1-5). We have surely said enough to
warn our people away from this insidious error as
from a fatal shore.” Thus we see that a belief in
the divine right of the slave-holder to defraud his
fellow-man of his inalienable right to the enjoyment
of that inestimable boon, liberty, is made a term of
communion by the Southern church, and is enunciated
as one of the distinctive principles of that organization.</p>
          <p>The address of 1861, found in the same volume,
declares, “As to the endless declaration about human
rights, we have only to say that human rights are not
a fixed but fluctuating quantity. They should be
graduated according to the capacity and culture of
<pb id="aughey564" n="564"/>
the individual.” This dogma enunciated in defense
of human bondage by the Southern General Assembly
would reduce to chattel slavery all the illiterates
in the Southern States, both white and black, mulattoes,
quadroons, and octoroons. It would also justify
the assumption by the North of many rights
denied by this standard to their less capable and less
cultured Southern brethren. This boomerang dogma
would confer the right upon the North to hold in vassalage
the majority of the Southern people. The
Southern church denounce views hostile to slavery as a
corruption of the word of God, and as “the intuitions of
an infidel philosophy,” and declare that they will not
“break communion with Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, etc,
who have gone to heaven from a slave-holding country
and a slave-holding church.” How they differ
from John Bunyan, who says: “That a saint might
keep a seraglio because Solomon had one, lie because
the godly mid-wives of Egypt lied, and defraud because
Jacob defrauded, practice concubinage and be
guilty of slave-holding because Abraham had a
concubine and held slaves, is an opinion not fit to be
with any allowance in the world.” Thomas Jefferson
and our patriotic ancestors held a very different
view as to human rights, as expressed in the Declaration
of Independence: “We hold these truths to be
self-evident, that all men are created equal and are
endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable
rights, among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit
of happiness.” Henry Clay said, “I am no friend
<figure id="ill36" entity="aughey564"><p>MOVED OVER THE COUNTRY WITH FIRE AND ROPE. Page 556.</p></figure>
<figure id="ill37" entity="aughey565"><p>HOW THE DARKIES SHOUTED. Page 562.</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey565" n="565"/>
to slavery,” and by his will manumitted his slaves.
General Washington said, “I wish from my soul
that the legislature of this state (Virginia) could see
the policy of a gradual abolition of slavery. It
might prevent much future mischief.” Lawrence
Sterne said, with truth, “Disguise thyself as thou
wilt, still, slavery, said I, still thou art a bitter
draught.”</p>
          <p>Another distinctive principle enunciated by the
Southern General Assembly is, “The relation of the
church of Christ to civil governments is not one <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de
jure</hi></foreign> but <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de facto</hi></foreign>. Whether right or wrong, the
attitude of the church toward them is the same. As
long as they stand and are acknowledged, obedience
is to be enjoined as a duty, factious resistance
condemned as a sin.” If all Southern Christians had
scrupulously adhered to this rule they would have
been guiltless of complicity in precipitating the most
unnecessary, cruel, and wicked rebellion known in
the history of the world. But, alas, they did not.
Southern Presbyterians aided and abetted the
rebellion from its incipiency to its culmination. They
fanned the sparks of civil strife till they blazed out
in lambent flames, enveloping the sacred edifice of
our country's liberties, which were only extinguished
by the loyal Christians and patriots of the country,
North and South, with the sacrifice of a mighty host
of heroic martyrs, and by the destruction of the
incendiaries who desired to destroy the temple of
freedom and erect upon its ruins a fane whose cornerstone
<pb id="aughey566" n="566"/>
was to be human bondage. The Northern church
does not believe in any dubious loyalty. They do
not believe in enjoining upon those under their
jurisdiction obedience to God or the devil, whichever for
the time holds governmental control. “They recognize
the powers that be, which are ordained of God,”
as the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de jure</hi></foreign> government that rules in righteousness,
and not the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de facto</hi></foreign> government that may gain a
temporary control while attempting to overthrow the
ordinance of heaven. An intelligent obedience is
enjoined, which will sustain the righteous cause and
subvert the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de facto</hi></foreign> usurpation in the interests of
slavery and its father, the devil.</p>
          <p>The Southern General Assembly, after a long
dissertation on the divinity of slavery, and a declaration
that a contrary view held by any other church
is unscriptural and fanatical, one of the most pernicious
heresies of modern times, and is a just cause of
separation from it, makes this astounding
announcement: “We would have it distinctly understood
that in our ecclesiastical capacity we are neither the
friends nor foes of slavery. We have no right as a
church, to enjoin it as a duty or condemn it as a sin.”
And yet those who seek communion with them must
believe in slavery <hi rend="italics">per se</hi> or be rejected. <hi rend="italics">Slavery per se!</hi>
Well, I have seen slavery <hi rend="italics">per se</hi>, if it has ever had
any existence in that form. I have seen it in eight
slave states, and during eleven years in the <hi rend="italics">ante
bellum</hi> days—the palmy days of slavery—among a
professedly Christian people. I have seen the tears

and heard the groans of its victims as they bled
under the lash of their cruel oppressors. I have heard
their supplications ascending to heaven for deliverance,
and if this was slavery <hi rend="italics">per se</hi> I would, if its
fate had been left to my judgment, have consigned it
to the lowest hell. Ah! there never was a utopian
<hi rend="italics">slavery per se</hi> so sinless and so free from horror,
barbarity, and cruelty, and so righteous and humane, as
to meet the approval of heaven.</p>
          <p>Would any Southern church or presbytery dare at
this late day, in this the millennial dawn, ask an
applicant for admission to one of their presbyteries
or churches, Do you believe in slavery <hi rend="italics">per se</hi>? Do
you believe that the relation of the church to the
state is a <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de facto</hi></foreign> and not a <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de jure</hi></foreign> relation? Although
their General Assembly proclaims these views as
“distinctive principles,” and the first virtually as
a term of communion, yet none of the churches under
its jurisdiction would so insult the common sense
of the applicant or stultify themselves as to ask these
questions. Many of their presbyteries and synods virtually
declared the Confederate government the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de jure</hi></foreign>
government, and the General Assembly having review
and control, took no exception to the records.
Notwithstanding those offensive “distinctive principles,”
the custom of the Southern churches and presbyteries
is to receive applicants from other bodies upon the
face of their credentials. Must the foul corpse of
slavery <hi rend="italics">per se</hi> and the putrid cadaver of the defunct
<foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">de facto</hi></foreign> Southern Confederacy be held up in all their
<pb id="aughey568" n="568"/>
distorted deformity and ghastly hideousness by the
spiritual bourbons of the southern church in every
General Assembly before the startled gaze of those
who come to them bearing the olive branch of peace
and unity, with the cry, “<hi rend="italics">Do you believe in these
dogmas?</hi> DO YOU BELIEVE IN THESE DOGMAS? for
these are the shibboleths by which we test your
spirituality and your fidelity to Christ's crown and
kingdom? If you do not believe in these dogmas, away
with you! we know you to be fanatical and most
perniciously heretical, and we will not leave for yours
the communion of Abraham, Samson, Solomon, etc.,
who went to heaven from a slave-holding (and
polygamous) country, and church.” After the few
surviving custodians of these offensive remains are buried
with them, none will be found willing to resurrect
and parade before the church and the world that
which is the bar sinister upon the southern escutcheon,
and then reunion in all its fullness and blessedness
will be speedily accomplished, and the reunited
church will enter upon a mission more noble than
the conservation of issues dead, and damned by the
united voice of Christendom.</p>

          <head>THE LAW OF REVIVALS.</head>
          <p>Have we a reasonable hope of a revival, if we look
for it, and pray for it, and work for it according to
God's plan and in his way? Law is that which is
set, <hi rend="italics">laid</hi>, or fixed—the regular method or sequence by
which certain phenomena or effects follow certain
conditions or causes—the uniform methods or relations
according to which material and mental forces
act in producing effects. God is the author of all
law, whether written or unwritten, whether physical
<pb id="aughey570" n="570"/>
or  spiritual. Law is the established mode of divine
operation, whether in nature or grace. As Hooker
says, “Her seat is the bosom of God, her voice
the harmony of the world.” Dr. Chalmers says,
“Present the Deity with the same conditions, and he is
certain to act in the same way.” We know that
everything in the universe is under law. God is a
God of law and order, and does not act capriciously
or arbitrarily. Has he any law governing the
phenomena which we call revivals? If so, has he made
known this law? Have we any agency in producing
them? or do they occur as the cyclone, the
earthquake, or revival of nature in the spring, without
any agency of ours? If so, then we have no responsibility
in the matter. We cannot hasten the coming
on of the spring; God revives nature when he pleases.
We simply wait his pleasure, and then co-operate
with him by preparing the soil and putting in the
seed. But is this true in a spiritual revival? Have
we nothing to do in bringing about a revival in the
church? Are we to wait for God to come and revive
his work? No one will say this but a fatalist. We
must find out the conditions upon which be promises
to revive his work, and comply with them, if we
expect his blessing. As the elder Edwards says,
“Whenever God is about to bestow any great
blessing upon a people, he sets them to praying for it.”
True revivals are not <hi rend="italics">got up</hi>—they are <hi rend="italics">got down.</hi>
“O! Lord, revive thy work.” This prayer begins
to be offered from the <hi rend="italics">heart</hi> by some Christian in a
<pb id="aughey571" n="571"/>
church before every true revival. “It is time to seek
the <hi rend="italics">Lord till he come</hi>.” “If my people who
are called by my name will humble themselves and pray,
and seek my face, and turn from their wicked ways,
then will I hear from heaven, and will forgive their
sins and will heal their land.” Here is God's law of
revival clearly set forth. It never fails when honestly
complied with on the part of his children.</p>

          <p>Sermon preached by Rev. John H. Aughey in the
Presbyterian Church of French Camp, Miss., in the year
1860 and repeated in Nazareth Church, Attala county,
Miss.</p>
          <p>The text is recorded in Romans xiii. 1: “Let every soul
be subject unto the high powers, for there is no power
but of God. The powers that be are ordained of God.”</p>
          <p>Loyalty to the government is obedience to God, for
God has commanded it. Governments were ordained by
the Almighty for wise and beneficent purposes. Without
government there would be anarchy, and a more awful
state of society could not exist than for every man to do
that which seems right in his own eyes. There would be
no protection for life and property. Men would be
governed by the principle that might makes right, and the
weak would be wholly at the mercy of the strong. Society
could not long exist in this chaotic state. Its foundations
would be overthrown speedily, and barbarism of the
rudest form would supplant civilization. Governments are
ordained by God to be a terror to evil doers and for the
praise or approval and protection of them that do well.
This is done in the providence of God by the agency
<pb id="aughey576" n="576"/>
of man. Though nations are established by man,
instrumentally it is done by the determinate counsel and
foreknowledge of God, who determines the times before
appointed and the bounds of their habitation, and has
made all their inhabitants of one blood. Jacob, when
dying, revealed by the spirit of prophesy the precise
locality of the inheritance of each tribe and its territorial
limits, hundreds of years before it entered upon its
possession in the land of promise, even though the
inheritance after the conquest of Canaan fell to each tribe
by lot. God imbues man with the wisdom to perceive the
necessity and desirableness of authority to restrain the
vicious and lawless element found in every society. This
authority is conferred upon certain individuals by a vote
of the people, who thus become magistrates, and in this
way government is established. The preamble to the
constitution of our country clearly states the objects for
which our government exists and for which our
constitution was framed, ordained, and established. “We,
the people of the United States, in order to form a more
perfect union, establish justice, insure domestic
tranquillity, provide for the common defence, promote the
general welfare, and secure the blessings of liberty to
ourselves and our posterity, do ordain and establish this
constitution.” Our government has not been negligent of
duty. All the above ends have been accomplished. All the
duties enumerated have been performed, and a degree of
prosperity unparalleled in the history of nations has been
secured.</p>
          <pb id="aughey577" n="577"/>
          <p>The late presidential election was conducted under a
strict observance of all the forms of the constitution. It
was participated in by all the states—even belligerent
South Carolina held an election without protest, and sent
the returns to Washington. Should we repudiate a result
to which by voting we have made ourselves parties?
Should we make this fair, peaceful, and constitutional
election a pretext for subverting the traditions of the
past, the fame of our illustrious ancestors, the respect of
other nations, the glory of the present, the hope of the
future, the destiny ordained by heaven for our nation of
being an asylum for the oppressed and a perpetual
bulwark of defence against encroachments upon human
liberty and the rights of man? I speak for myself. I for
one, so help me God, will never become a party to the
subversion of all the interests dear to every patriotic
heart—interests that are linked indissolubly with our
national unity and integrity.</p>
          <p>Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, of South Carolina, in
the legislature of his state, in 1788, during the debates on
the adoption of the constitution, said: “This admirable
manifesto, the Declaration of Independence, sufficiently
refutes the doctrine of the individual sovereignty and
independence of the several states. In no part of it are
the several states mentioned by name, as if it was
intended to impress the maxim upon America that our
freedom and independence arose from our union, and
that without it we never could be free and independent.
Let us
<pb id="aughey578" n="578"/>
consider all attempts to weaken this union by
maintaining that each state is separately and
individually independent as a species of political heresy
which can never benefit us, but may bring on us the
most serious distresses.”</p>
          <p>If the Declaration of Independence refutes state
sovereignty in the ultra sense, much more the
constitution, which vests all the attributes of
sovereignty in the national government, and which does
this, not by the act of the individual state, but by that of
the people of the United States. The constitution was
submitted for adoption not to the legislatures of the
several states, but to the people in convention assembled.
It was unavoidable that the people should act by
states since that was the only mode of combined action
in their power. A constitution thus adopted is paramount
and of perpetual obligation. There can be no withdrawal
except by the inalienable right of revolution, and this
should not be resorted to for light and transient causes.</p>
          <p>The question was debated in the convention whether
the federal or national plan should be adopted. Mr.
Randolph said a national government alone properly
constituted will answer the purpose. This question was
discussed several days. When brought to a vote, the
national plan was adopted. The issue was clearly stated
so that no misapprehension should exist. The
constitution was sent with instructions that the people
were required to ratify it “in toto, unconditionally, and
forever.” And thus it
<pb id="aughey579" n="579"/>
was ratified. Those who advocate secession tell us that
the states that constituted our government were free,
sovereign, and independent nationalities, and as such
have a right to withdraw from the government at will.
Free, sovereign, and independent individuals constituted
the state governments and by parity of reasoning have a
right to consult their own interest or pleasure and to
withdraw at will from the state government which they
created. West Virginians and East <sic corr="Tennesseans">Tennesseeans</sic> threaten
to do this if those states should secede. This right you
deny them with acerbity. A government thus bound
together with a rope of sand without cohesion in its parts,
whose laws may be nullified and whose authority may be
renounced at any time by the free, sovereign, and
independent individuals or states composing it, is
inefficient and powerless for good, the sport of caprice,
unworthy of respect, wholly at the mercy of demagogues,
the scorn, derision, and contempt of stable governments,
without credit, a mere shadow without substance, the
tennis ball of politicians, a bubble ready to burst at any
moment. So feeble that slavery or the protective measures
devised to promote domestic industry could demolish it,
the object of threat and menace by the communist and the
nihilist. When Israel was rent in twain it was of the Lord
to punish their idolatry. If they should return unto the
Lord he promises, in Ezekiel xxxvii. 22, to make them one
nation in the land. The evil of being two nations,
belligerent and envious of each
<pb id="aughey580" n="580"/>
other, was great, as their history after their division
conclusively proves. If there should be fifty sovereign
and independent nations within the area embraced by the
United States of America, with clashing interests and
standing armies and navies upon a war footing, and
ruinous customs and duties, and a host of officials and
oppressive taxation, we would sigh in anguish of soul for
the government we had in our wantonness, folly, and
wickedness overthrown.</p>
          <p>I believe in state sovereignty. I believe also in national
supremacy. The constitution of the United States is the
bond of Federal union. It was framed by our fathers with
a wisdom akin to inspiration. It is a charter of liberty to be
construed liberally so as to carry out all the beneficent
objects of the good and wise government which its
framers designed to establish. The government of the
United States is a national government, with general
powers, supreme within the limit of those powers, and
with a Federal court selected as the sole final tribunal to
pass upon the limits and extent of those powers.</p>
          <p>The states are the agents of the people for local
purposes precisely as the general government is the
agent of the people for national purposes. State rights as
distinguished from national authority has been a
dangerous and disturbing element in American politics.
To the people at large both state and nation are
convenient agencies for the exercise of distinct and
separate powers to promote the common good. To the
individual citizen they are the guardians
<figure id="ill38" entity="aughey581"><p>HE RAN AT THE FIRST FIRE. Page 589.</p></figure>
<pb id="aughey581" n="581"/>
of distinct and separate rights and privileges, for
which we owe allegiance and duty.</p>
          <p>Their functions pertain to different spheres and in their
exercise there is no conflict and needs be none. Let us
love our state with an ardent love and our sister states
with an equal love, for we are all children of our common
parent, the government of the United States. Our sister
states are not so many foreign nations with whom we
have no relation, except through a temporary league
subject to dissolution at will, but we as states are all
integral parts of a great nation bound together by
indissoluble ties. Let us ever pray that no weapon formed
against her shall prosper. Perish the hand that would with
parricidal intent aim a blow at our national unity and
integrity. Our country by its physical features seems to
be fitted for but one nation. What ceaseless trouble
would be caused by having the sources of our rivers in
one country and their months in another, and in their
courses passing through a dozen or more foreign nations,
with diverse interests and hostile inhabitants. We are all
descended from a common parentage; we all speak the
same language; we are all believers in the Christian
religion; we all believe in a republican form of
government; we are all willing to sacrifice our lives if
necessary to preserve our inalienable rights of life and
liberty. We have really no conflicting interests, the
statements of some of our astute politicians to the
contrary notwithstanding. In revealing to you the whole
counsel of God and
<pb id="aughey582" n="582"/>
thus acquitting my conscience I declare it to be my firm
conviction that you should vote against secession, and if
necessary fight against all those miscreants who would
subvert the government of our nation, under whose
beneficent sway we have so greatly prospered. Our
progress in all that constitutes true greatness and
material prosperity are unparalleled in the history of
nations. Why with malice prepense should we play the
fool by destroying the source of all our political
blessings. Secession and treason are convertible terms.
Let us not be guilty of rebellion against the ordinance of
God, the powers that be, and thus bring upon us the
wrath of an offended and sin-avenging Jehovah, who will
not lightly pass over so great a crime. We as a nation
may be under the wrath of an offended God because of
our national sins unrepented of, but God, who is long
suffering and of tender compassion does not ordinarily
destroy a nation within the first century of its existence.
Even though its sins are heinous, a longer probation is
accorded. He may punish us, but I trust not with so
terrible and disastrous a punishment as the destruction of
our government, which is the palladium of our liberty and
prosperity, and the preservation of whose integrity is so
dear to the heart of every loyal citizen and true patriot
and friend of good government. All should regard the
Union as inviolable and perpetual, and that all grievances
must be redressed within the Union, by remedies which
respect its integrity.</p>
          <pb id="aughey583" n="583"/>
          <p>If there is a difference of opinion as to the
constitutionality of a Federal law the supreme court of
the United States determines the question. This right is
not accorded to any state.</p>
          <p>South Carolina has usurped the prerogative of the
supreme court. Her act is unconstitutional and void, and
may result in a bloody fratricidal civil war. This will
doubtless be the result if she should persist in her
wayward and wicked course. This tiny state has declared
secession to be constitutional, and without consulting
her sister states or waiting longer for co operation, may
enact a secession ordinance. She does not realize the
enormity of her folly.</p>
          <p>What will the government do if she secedes? It may be
pertinent to quote Sec. 2, Art. 6 of the constitution of the
United States: “This constitution and the laws of the
United States and the laws which may be made in
pursuance thereof, and all treaties made or which shall be
made under the authority of the United States, shall be
the supreme law of the land, and the judges in every state
shall be bound thereby, anything in the constitution or
laws of any state to the contrary notwithstanding.”</p>
          <p>Supremely silly and superlatively wicked South
Carolina! Let us not imitate her folly and thus become
partaker of her sin and consequent punishment if she
should carry to a logical conclusion this initiatory act of
treason and rebellion against the nation and her own true
interests.</p>
          <p>This is the language of Virginia uttered when she
<pb id="aughey584" n="584"/>
gave her adhesion to the general government: “The
powers granted under the constitution being derived
from the <hi rend="italics">people</hi> of the United States may be resumed by
them whenever the same shall be perverted to their injury
or oppression.”</p>
          <p>This makes it clearly evident that Virginia understood
that separate state secession was inadmissible.</p>
          <p>The question is pertinent, has the general government
perverted its powers to the injury or oppression of the
southern people? Many seem to think that the general
government was established solely to conserve,
perpetuate, and extend the institution of human slavery.
Jefferson Davis formulates this idea in a speech delivered
by him in Jackson, Miss., Sept. 3d, 1858: “If an
abolitionist be chosen president you will have presented
to you the question whether you will permit the
government to pass into the hands of your avowed and
implacable enemies. I will state my supposition to be that
such a result would be a species of revolution by which
the purposes of the government would be destroyed and
the observances of its mere forms entitled to no respect.
In that event in such manner as should be most expedient
I should deem it your duty to provide for your safety
outside of the union from those who have already shown
the will and would have acquired the power to deprive
you of your birthright and reduce you to worse than
the colonial dependence of your fathers.”</p>
          <p>No more bitter denunciations of slavery were ever
<pb id="aughey585" n="585"/>
heard than those uttered by Thomas Jefferson and
Mason and other southern statesmen at the very time of
the formation of the constitution of the United States. It
was Thomas Jefferson who introduced a resolution into
the continental congress to the effect that after the year
1800 no slavery should exist in any of the western
territories nor on any soil not included within the
established and ancient limits of the states themselves.</p>
          <p>Slavery at this time was regarded as an inherited exotic,
a legacy from the mother country, which conferred no
benefit sufficient to compensate for its reproach and its
disadvantages and as an institution which it would be
necessary to tolerate but for a short time, as it was
believed to be on the way to ultimate extinction. The word
slave does not occur in the constitution of the United
States, and the question is debatable whether the
constitution of our country is a pro-slavery document.
Slavery is the apple of discord dropped in the halls of
legislation which threatens to let loose upon our country
greater evils than were emitted from Pandora's box. The
majority of our people have no personal interest in this
matter. We are not slave owners. It is not a question
between the North and the South but between the slave-holder
and the abolitionist. The border states are in
greater danger of losing slaves by their proximity to the
free states, yet they are far less easily excited upon this
subject and far less revolutionary in spirit. Let us profit
by their example, and preserve
<pb id="aughey586" n="586"/>
our dignity which is wofully compromised by
threats, undue excitement, and the display of a mercurial
temperament.</p>
          <p>It is thought by many in the South that the church's
mission is to foster the interests of our peculiar
institution, and they advocate separation from the
church in the free labor states because of their hostility
to slavery. In 1818 our whole church, North and South,
were a unit in the condemnation of human slavery. It is
we that have changed, not they.</p>
          <p>General Washington, after enumerating the
inestimable blessings that flow from the National Union,
declares: “These considerations speak a persuasive
language to every reflecting and virtuous mind, and
exhibit the Union as a primary object of patriotic desire.
This government, the offspring of our own choice,
uninfluenced and unawed; adopted upon full
investigation and mature deliberation; completely free in
its principles, in the distribution of its powers; uniting
security with energy, and containing within itself a
provision for its own amendment—has a just claim to your
confidence and support. Respect for its authority,
compliance with its laws, acquiescence in its measures,
are duties enjoined by the fundamental maxims of true
liberty. The very idea of the power and the right of the
people to establish government presupposes the duty of
every individual to obey the established government.</p>
          <p>“The constitution, till changed by an explicit and
authentic act of the whole people, is sacredly obligatory
upon all.”</p>
          <pb id="aughey587" n="587"/>
          <p>Let us remember these words of the revered
Washington.</p>
          <p>Let us not, in the interests of an exotic institution
engrafted upon the body politic by a despotic king while
we were in colonial vassalage, basely attempt to subvert
this fair fabric, this temple of liberty erected by our
venerated fathers, at infinite cost, to secure for
themselves and posterity a permanent refuge from
oppression, together with all the inestimable blessings
resulting from the possession of those inalienable human
rights—life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

          <p>Upon the hurricane deck of one of our gunboats an
elderly darkey, with a very philosophical and

apparently plunged into a state of profound meditation.

          <head>THE SOUTHERN PRESBYTERIAN'S POSSIBLE
DILEMMA.</head>
          <p>The Southern Church enjoins obedience to the de
facto government upon all under its jurisdiction. If this is
not accorded, the offender becomes obnoxious to
ecclesiastical censure, even though his conscience, his
judgment, and the true principles of patriotism and
religion impel him to sustain the de jure government
existing by divine right and engaged in the righteous
endeavor to subvert the de facto usurpation. The
Southern General Assembly, after the war, at one of its
sessions, recalled all deliverances enacted during the war
that might be construed as offensive to the Northern
Assembly, or that might be regarded as having a political
bearing, yet, in their volume entitled Distinctive Principles
of the Southern Church, published with the sanction of
their General Assembly, they are spreading broadcast all
those offensive and political deliverances. They should,
in the interests of peace and consistency recall the
“<sic corr="Distinctive">Destinctive</sic> Principles,” as they embody much that is
offensive and political.</p>

          <head>IS ANOTHER CIVIL WAR IMMINENT?</head>
          <p>We learn by the Atlanta <hi rend="italics">Constitution</hi> of Oct. 28, 1888,
that Mr. Henry W. Grady, of Atlanta, Ga., addressed
twenty thousand applauding people in Dallas, Texas, Oct.
27, 1888. He thus alluded to Gen. Sherman: “Just now
Gen. Sherman has said, and I honor him as a general: ‘The
negro must be allowed to vote, and his vote must be
counted, otherwise, as sure as there is a God in heaven,
you will have another war, more cruel than the last, when
the torch and dagger will take the place of the muskets of
well ordered battalions. Should the negro strike that blow
in seeming justice there will be millions to assist them.’
And this general took Johnston's sword in surrender! He
looked upon the thin and ragged battalions in gray, that
for four years had held his teeming and heroic legions at
bay. Facing them, he read their courage in their depleted
ranks. When he found it in his heart to taunt these heroes
with this threat, why, careless as he was twenty years ago
with fire, he is even now more careless with his words,” etc.</p>
          <pb id="aughey594" n="594"/>
          <p>Again Mr. Grady says: “Many wise men hold that the
white vote of the South should divide, the color line be
beaten down, and the Southern States ranged on
economic or moral questions, as interest or belief
demands. I am compelled to dissent from this view. The
worst thing, in my opinion, that could happen is, that the
white people of the South should stand in opposing
factions. Consider such a status. If the negroes were
skillfully led, and leaders would not be lacking, it would
give them the balance of power—a thing not to be
considered. The hope of the South is in the clear and
unmistakable domination of the white race through the
integrity of its own vote. The supremacy of the white race
of the South must be maintained forever, because the
white race is the superior race, and the domination of the
negro race resisted at all points and at all hazards.” From
the above it is plain that Mr. Grady favors debarring the
negro from the exercise of his constitutional right to vote
and have his vote counted. He also holds that but one
party should be tolerated in the South. These views are to
be carried out “at all points and at all hazards.” General
Sherman is right, and civil war is inevitable in the near
future, and it will be a holy and justifiable war upon the
part of those who resist these intolerable aggressions
upon the civil rights of American citizens. Nothing can
prevent a sanguinary civil contest except a change of
views upon the part of the dominant party in the
Southern States. The present willful, wayward, wicked
advocacy
<pb id="aughey595" n="595"/>
of the nullification of an explicit article in the
constitution of the United States will most certainly bring
upon you, Mr. Grady, and the Southern people (if they
foolishly approve your views and give them a practical
bearing) the horrors of an internecine war, more
disastrous than the one evoked by demagogues in the
futile attempt to subvert the republic in the interests of
slavery, and many of your dupes will, in all probability,
expiate their offense upon the gallows. If, in the <hi rend="italics">ante
bellum</hi> days, the Southern people had hanged a few of
the blatant oratorical advocates of nullification and
secession, the late civil war would never have occurred.
Let them now beware of demagogues who are advising
them to attempt, or rather, continue, the nullification of
express articles in the constitution of the United States,
lest they precipitate a desolating revolution and rebellion.
Those who sow the wind will reap the whirlwind,
cyclone, and tempest.</p>
          <p>The suppression of the colored vote (and that of the
scalawags) by fraud, intimidation, and violence, of which
some of the Southern people are guilty, and which you,
Mr. Grady, approve and advise, is nullification of and
rebellion against Federal laws, and those guilty of it
ought to meet the doom of traitors speedily, ere they
involve our beloved country in the horrors of another
civil and fratricidal war. The Southern people followed the
advice of Yancey, to their sorrow. Let them beware of
Grady, or a worse fate may befall them.</p>

          <p><hi rend="italics">Dear Friend:</hi> I have read thy thrilling narrative of thy sufferings
and dangers in the midst of slave-holding rebels, and of thy heroic endurance
and faithfulness to the Union and Liberty. Nothing but the wicked
system of Slavery could have turned the people of the Southwest into
such monsters of cruelty. I thank thee sincerely for the book, and hope
it will be read in all parts of the Union. With all good wishes for thy
welfare,</p>

          <p><hi rend="italics">Dear Sir:</hi> I have read with great interest your volume, “Tupelo.”
It is a thrilling record, and an important contribution to the history of the
period whose sad scenes and sins it recounts. It bears the marks of
truthfulness in its details, and the vividness of a record of personal experiences,
which none can question. I thank God that your life was rescued
amid so many perils, and I hail you as one of the honored defenders of
freedom and right—and I congratulate you that you have lived to see the
end of the conflict. Many of your persecutors have already gone to
appear before the Judge of quick and dead. May those who survive and
read your book be inspired with true repentance. I can offer the prayer
for them, “Father, forgive them, for they knew not what they did.”
May your life of usefulness be prolonged for our common Master, until
North and South shall know the bliss of “loving one another with a pure
heart fervently.”</p>

          <p>I am pleased to learn that you are about to issue another edition of
“Tupelo.” As a supplement to the history of the opening scenes of the
Great Civil War, it has no equal, and no history of that great strife is
complete without it. What the historian sees only from a long distance, is
here recounted by an eye-witness, and while the bitterness of that great
struggle has been assuaged by years, the lessons that it teaches, written in
tears and blood, will ever live as mile-posts in the nation's history. As a key
to such history, “Tupelo” has no equal. From a literary standpoint, its fine
sentiment, pure diction, keen wit and stern vindication of right regardless
of consequences, entitles not only it, but also its author, to a prominent
niche in the temple of modern literary fame.</p>

          <p>I read with intense interest the account of your personal experiences
given in your book, “Tupelo.” It is part of a chapter of history which must
not be forgotten, for it shows the way in which a desperate minority
terrorized whole states into secession, when they would not have gone of
their own impartial motion. It is a vivid and indeed a lurid tale, and is the
testimony of one who was right in the cyclone.</p>

          <p>I have read “Tupelo,” by Rev. John H. Aughey, with great interest. I
take pleasure in commending it as instructive and fascinating in the highest
degree. I have learned much from its perusal. Its style is terse, vigorous,
chaste and pure, and the book is replete with information which all who read
it will highly prize. The writer's personal narrative of his imprisonment and
escapes is one of the most thrilling and touching ever written. It borders
upon the miraculous, yet, its veracity is beyond question. The interest of
this work, as a history of the greatest event of all time—the Civil War in
America—will increase with the lapse of years. I feel sure that “Tupelo” will
be read by our people with unabated interest as long as they retain their
admiration and esteem for the patriotic and heroic defenders of our nation's
liberty and integrity.</p>

          <byline>By BENSON J. LOSSING, the Historian:</byline>
          <p>I have read “Tupelo” with the intense interest that I perused the ”Iron
Furnace” when it appeared a quarter of a century ago, as one of the most
thrilling chapters in the history of martyrs. We may forgive the shallow
politicians who arrogantly assumed the role of statesmen, and for selfish
ends and with false pretense plunged millions of their fellow citizens into the
fiery furnace of the most destructive civil war recorded in history; but we
must not forget (the good of posterity demands that it should not be
forgotten) the important lesson that Divine Justice is sure to avenge the
transgressions of its laws and maxims. The logical tendency towards
barbarism and savagism of any system of human slavery—the forcible robbery
of a fellow-being of his dearest birthright, liberty —is most conspicuously
illustrated by your narrative; and the senseless boast of the abettors of the
slave system, who rebelled against law and justice in 1861, that it promoted
a higher and more refined type of civilization, would be absurdly more
criminal were it not so intimately akin to events so profoundly tragical. The
leaders in that unrighteous rebellion could not implore a more merciful
dispensation than utter forgetfulness of their names by posterity. Your book
has a positive and important mission, not to keep alive animosities but to
give living testimony to the truth uttered by John Wesley, that the slavery
of the human body and mind, which distinguishes all slave systems, is the
“sum of all villainies.” I have a vivid remembrance of your address which
you gave at Poughkeepsie, on the Hudson, soon after your escape from the
Confederate dominions. I introduced you to the audience, my then fellow-townsmen
and women. The noble Clara Barton was there at the same time.
What changes our dear country has witnessed since.</p>
