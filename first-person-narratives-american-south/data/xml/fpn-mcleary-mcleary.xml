        <head>The Experience of a Young Private<lb/>
Confederate Soldier</head>
        <p>I AM requested by the Daughters of the Confederacy
to write a part of my experience as a Con-
federate soldier of the Civil War. When the
war began I was not old enough to know what to
be mad about, hence I did not get into my fight-clothes 
until the first of July, 1863. I will not try to tell of all
the Yankees I killed; but I can safely say, as “Bill
Arp” did when he got back home: “Well, I killed as
many of them as they did of me.”</p>
        <p>We lived near town (Humboldt), and while the Yankees were
stationed there some of them were at our house almost every
day. In fact, we had a guard who stayed with us three or four
months. He was a great protection to us. He and I and many
others played checks a great deal. I beat all I played with except
one, a Captain Young.</p>
        <p>After they left Humboldt I joined Bennett's company of
cavalry. We soon raised a battalion, and afterwards we were
consolidated with the Twelfth Tennessee Regiment, and after
Hood's Middle Tennessee raid we were consolidated with
Forrest's old regiment, and in May, 1865, we surrendered at
Gainesville, Ala., as that regiment.</p>
        <p>I was eight days on the road coming home. The last night I
camped out was at Old Denmark, Tenn. The last “grub” issued to
us was some meat at Macon, Miss. Brother Sam left Rock
Island (Ill.) Prison at the same time I left Gainesville, Ala. He
got home the 19th of May, 1865, and I got home the next day, the
20th. When in sight of home I fired my pistol six times to let them
know I was coming.</p>
        <pb id="mcleary6" n="6"/>
        <p>I shall never forget the joy it gave to see my mother and all the
family running to meet me. But O, so sad to think one was
missing who had prayed so faithfully that his boys might get back
home all right! Father died the 17th of February, 1864. He had
been back from Rock Island only a day or so, where he had been
to see Brother Sam.</p>

        </p>
        <p>Well, I will not try to tell of the hard times we had, for that is
pretty well known by all who have read of the Civil War; but
I will tell of some of the funny things that happened,
which kept us in good spirits.</p>
        <p>The worst fright I got during the war was on a steamboat
which we had just captured on the Cumberland River,
five or six miles below Nashville. Our regiment was
sent to blockade the river when Hood's army arrived
and be, an to take their places. When we got in sight of the
river we saw a transport boat coming down from Nashville.
We at once left our horses and ran for the river to stop
that boat. We had a fine time capturing all kinds of
boats on the Tennessee River a month or
so before, and we were now very hungry and ready
for the good things to eat that those boats carried; but in running
over those rocks and vines I sprained my ankle so badly I did not
see how I could live much longer. After the boat ran by, Col. D
C. Kelley came back to me, sent for my horse, and they put me
on him. I rode to a house near by, got my ankle fixed up, and
while I was there another boat ran by; but we had two cannons
ready, for the third one, and it surrendered. I rode to where it
landed. Colonel Kelley was sending the boys back up the river, to
be ready for the next boat coming. It was then getting dark, and he told 
<pb id="mcleary7" n="7"/>
me as I was crippled to get on the boat and stop the boys from 
getting on from a willow tree that leaned against the stern wheel,
while he and a detail were getting the horses and mules off to land
by the gangplank. The boat moved from the tree, so I was not
needed to guard there any longer. I then got up the steps on the
upper deck to see what I could find that I needed. I soon
discovered on a bed in one of the little cabins a bundle as big as a
washtub, the outside of which was a new United States blanket.
<figure entity="mcleary7">
<p>A. C. M'LEARY AND BETTIE JANE<lb/>IN 1876</p>
</figure>
I had it under one arm, on the outside promenade in the
dark, and when the fellow got his canteens filled with whisky
he ran in and out of those rooms looking for his bundle. After he left
I got back to the wheel and pitched my goods to the bank. Directly 
another boat came down and surrendered. It, too, was loaded
with Yankee stock, and it was brought up by the side of the one
I was on.  The detail soon got them on the first boat, and then to land.
There was a dim light at the end of the boat, but it was as dark as a
dungeon down my way. I was watching the proceedings, when one
of the men took a new Yankee McClellan saddle from a horse and put it by
the engine of the boat I was on. Now my old saddle was ruining
my horse's back, and I felt I had as much right to that saddle as
he had - at least I tried to get my conscience to help me see it
that way - so I got that old crippled foot in motion and started
for the saddle, using my gun to help me along, keeping one eye on
the fellow, with the other trying to locate the saddle, feeling all the
time that the old devil might get me if I took the saddle. All at
once I struck my toes against the back of a mule that had been
shot down as the boat came down the river; but he was still very
<pb id="mcleary8" n="8"/>
much alive, and when my toes struck him I fell across him with
my face all mixed up with his feet and legs, and you never heard
such a racket as he made kicking the side of the boat. I think I
scared him nearly as badly as he did me. I soon caught on that the
old troy didn't have me, and crawled over and got the saddle and
threw it to land with my big bundle. I thought I had enough plunder
and went to land with the horses. I soon changed the old saddle
for the new put the bundle on the corner of a fence, and managed
to get in the saddle from the fence. Then I got my stock of goods
up before me and went to our horse holders' camp. I had not been
gone from the river ten minutes when three gunboats come down
from Nashville and recaptured our two boats and shelled the
woods nearly all night. Some of the boys had gotten full of booze,
and every time a shell came close to us they would yell as loud as
they could, then pile brush on the fire and make a light, so the
Yankees knew where to aim their cannons. They kept us
prohibition fellows between a shy and a wild all-night.</p>
        <p>Well, yes; that bundle in the United States blanket was two
oilcloths and a big, hairy cloak, cape, or talma - never knew
exactly what. It was big enough for a three-hundred pounder, had
no sleeves, only places for the arms to go through, and it was
better suited to fit a sea lion than a man; but it was warm, and I
looked more like an Eskimo than a Confederate soldier with it on.
Yes, we had a rough old time. General Forrest kept us in the
saddle most of the time, day and night, in all kinds of bad
weather; but we were a jolly set, and would sometimes joke or
play pranks on each other while the fight was going on. We all
had sweethearts back at home, and many of us married them
after the war was over.</p>
        <p>We had all kinds of men in our command - preachers,
gamblers, lawyers, doctors, farmers, and also poets. The first day
of April, 1864, we had a chance to send letters and April fools back
to Tennessee. One young fellow of our company got so carried
away he wrote out the following and sent it to “the girl he left
behind,” but put no name to it.</p>

          <p>I sent my girl a paper cut full of hearts and other things, also
one of my biscuits. I still have the paper, but nine years after we
were married she set her trunk out to sun, and a dog got the
biscuit out and ate it. A Confederate in Arkansas wanted to
know if it killed the dog. I told him I thought it gave him the
hydrophobia, at least he died afterwards.</p>
          <p>I was badly wounded, in my new hat, in a fight near Somerville,
Tenn., Christmas week of 1863. A new hat was a rarity to a
Confederate soldier in those times. In writing to me a Yankee
who was in the fight wanted to know why I did not pick up
another, as there were plenty lying around when they left there.</p>
          <p>When on a march some of us, in passing an old barn or gin,
would begin looking and pointing at it as though we saw
something wonderful, then every one back behind, in passing,
would try to see what was so attractive.</p>
          <p>There was one thing that could be said of the private
Confederate soldiers that could not be said of any other set of
soldiers. While they had great respect for the officer they were
under and would fight and obey orders when called on, the officer
knew, or would soon learn, that he must not get too bossy, for the
privates thought they were as good as Mr. Captain or Lieutenant,
and if they got too big and bossy they would be thrown up in
blankets or something worse.</p>
          <p>They would often throw each other up, and if a negro came
<pb id="mcleary10" n="10"/>
in camp he had to behave very well or up he would go. I
remember one Sunday evening we were camped on a big
plantation in Alabama and a great many of the negroes came into
our camp, and we had some fun throwing them up. We would
place two or three United States blankets together and as many
hands as could take hold all around, and when our man was put
on we would swing up and down, then some one would call out
“One, two, three ;” and when three was called, up he would go,
ten or twelve feet high. One negro grabbed the edge of the
blanket as three was called, and he flew to one side and fell on a
stump and was hurt pretty badly. It was not long before his old
“marster” came over to “cuss out” the whole command. One of
the colonels met him and they had some pretty hot words. The
colonel told him to keep his d- negroes out of the camp, and they
would not be thrown up. The boys heard the racket and had their
blankets ready; and when the old fellow, who was very heavy
and fat, started for home, some one gave the signal, and they
soon had him making ascensions, and every fellow was yelling as
loud as he could.</p>
          <p>I believe the meanest thing I did during the war, unless it was
taking the bundle and saddle from those fellows on the boat, was
the way I treated a negro named George, who had been raised in
Weakley County, Tenn., and was sold and sent to Alabama a
short while before the war began. We had struck camp near
where he lived on one of those big plantations. Our cooking
utensils had not arrived, so Isham Wade and I took a sack of meal
there to get some bread cooked. The lady of
the house told us to make ourselves at home in the office in the
yard, and she would put the negro woman to cooking our bread.
George found out we were from West Tennessee, and he enjoyed
being with us, asking many questions about old Tennessee. I told
him that if he could see Bell's brigade passing he might see some
of the people he once knew in Weakley County. A few days
later, on Sunday, our brigade passed through the big woods lot; but
before my company got near I saw George and several other
negroes at the gate watching. George was trying hard to find
some of his old Tennessee friends so I told the boys we would
have some fun when we got through the gate. I kept my head
turned until I got inside
<pb id="mcleary11" n="11"/>
and had the big fence between us, then turned and cried: “Hello,
George!” Over the fence he came like a deer, running up the line,
wanting to know, “Who dat know me, who dat know me?” Of
course every one in the company knew George, and was glad to
see him, but no one would stop to shake hands or talk with him;
and the last I saw of him he looked bewildered. I afterwards felt
sorry for him, and wished I had stopped and explained to him how
it was.</p>
          <p>While waiting for our paroles to be fixed up, we were into all
kinds of mischief, so glad the war was over and we had not been
killed, and that we would soon be at home with our loved ones.</p>
          <p>We are all proud of the crosses of honor given us by our dear
Daughters. I wear mine when traveling among strangers; and
while in Memphis some time back, waiting for my train to start
for Arkansas, a fine-looking old ex-Federal soldier, whose home
was in Baltimore, Md., took hold of my cross and said: “My
friend, did you not know that these railroads won't allow a fellow
to ride on their train with one of those things on?” I told him that I
did not, but I was under General Forrest during the war, and he
taught us to go where and when we pleased. An Arkansas man
heard my answer, and came up laughing, and we had a jolly good
time until I had to leave.</p>
          <p>To what I have just written I will add an article of mine that
was published in the <hi rend="italics">Confederate Veteran</hi> in May, 1894, and in
connection with it I will explain a little more, as I have been
asked to so do many times.</p>

          <p>I was a private in Company G. 12th Tennessee Cavalry, under
Forrest. The greater part of our company were boys from
sixteen to twenty, and we were a jolly set. German Tucker took a
Confederate cracker to show to some ladies living near camp,
and they wanted to know how we ever got them to pieces. He
told him that we put one corner of the cracker in the mouth,
placed the chin on a stump, and got some one to hit us on top of
the head with a maul. Bill Combs, when discussing the crackers
as an article of food, said: “I can get full of the ‘dad gum’ things,
but can't get enough.”</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="text" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <p>Late one night we were cooking rations for one of our Middle
Tennessee raids. Two of the boys, one in the 14th Tennessee
<pb id="mcleary12" n="12"/>
Regiment, on another hill, and one of my company, were “jawing”
at each other, when the Fourteenth man yelled out: “You go to h-.”
Our man answered: “There's no way of getting there now; the
Yankees have burned the bridges.” Fourteenth answered: “They
did a good thing for you then.”</p>
          <p>While on that raid we marched and fought for days and nights
in succession. Late one dark night we were on the march; it was
raining, and we were all wet, cold, tired, sleepy, and hungry. We
were bunched up in a creek bottom waiting for those in front to
cross the stream. Not a word was being spoken. Old sore-backed
horses were trying to rub their riders off against some other
horse. We knew we would have fighting to do as soon as day
broke, and we had the blues. All at once Joe Leggett said: “Boys,
I have become reckless; I've got so I don't care for nothing. I had
just as soon be at home now as to be here.”</p>
          <p>The effect was magical. While the skill and bravery of our
generals and the fighting qualities of our soldiers could not have
been excelled, if it had not been for those jolly spirits to animate
others the war would have come to a close much sooner.</p>
          <p>I was a good rider, and when at myself could mount a horse as
quickly as an Indian. But I had sprained my left ankle so severely
I could not stand on it to put the other foot in the stirrup. Six or
eight of us were on guard; I was a volunteer. We were at an old
brick house on the bank of the Cumberland River five or six miles
below Nashville. Our horses were over the hill out of the range
of the gunboats three or four hundred yards from us. The first
thing we knew our boys were running the Yankees (our boys in
front) down the Charlotte Pike, below us. As they passed they
sent R. B. Bledsoe, one of our company, to tell us to get away if
we could. The rest of the guards left me at once. Bledsoe saw me
and ran his horse some two hundred yards to where I was,
jumped from the saddle, threw me the reins, and was gone like a
flash, hoping to get to my horse and then make his escape.</p>
          <p>I must tell of the uneasy ride this same old ankle caused me to
take. When we got back to the Tennessee River, our time came
to cross the pontoon bridge about midnight, and it was very dark.
General Cheatham was there to see that everything started 
<pb id="mcleary13" n="13"/>
on the bridge in proper order. Orders were to dismount and lead
across, but there was no walking for me, so I kept my seat and
was on the bridge when General Cheatham railed out: “Why in
the - don't you dismount?” “I have a sprained ankle, General, and
can't walk.” “All right, if you've a mind to risk it, I will.” When a
boy I rode bucking mules, jumping horses, young steers, and a
railroad train with wheels jumping the ties, but all this was
pleasure compared with that pontoon ride. The river was bank
full, the bridge in a swing, jumping up and down. My eyes being
up above the rest, the lights on the bank in front blinded me like a
bat. It seemed to be the widest river in the world. </p>
          <p>Bledsoe gave me his horse, expecting to reach my horse in time
to get away; but my horse was two or three hundred yards from
where he left me, both horses were badly frightened at the noise
of the battle and by their company's leaving them, so we both
were in a bad fix. The horses were jumping around in all
directions; and had I got a chance at the stirrup, I could not have
borne a pound on my sprained ankle nor could I stand on it to
raise the other foot from the ground. I saw a short log near by and
managed to get on it, and as old Tuck came by I fell across the
saddle like a sack of meal, then kicked and pawed the air until I
got straight in the saddle. While those circus performances were
going on, old Tuck was carrying me in a lope right toward the
Yankees, who were about one hundred and fifty yards from me
on the Charlotte Pike. I don't think any of them saw me until we
were flying through the woods getting away from there, and at
that time it was a perfect waste of Uncle Sam's ammunition to try
to get their bullets to overtake old Tuck and me. In plunging over
the big rocks in a creek at the foot of the big hill we had just
passed over, the bits came out of old Tuck's mouth, and I had only
the halter rein to guide with; but the woods were open, the ground
level, so we made good time for a mile or so down the river. I
then turned out to the pike and found our horse holders. As I
passed in sight of poor Bob he was cutting some tall capers trying
to get to the side of my horse to mount him. But I knew his doom
was sealed, for the Yankees were coming to him in a run, and I
thought sure they would get him and my horse too; but Bob knew
I would not like it if he let
<pb id="mcleary14" n="14"/>
those Yankees get Charley, so he turned him loose. He ran
through the Yankee lines and never stopped until he got with his
own people. Colonel Outlaw, of Kentucky, saw him coming from
the Yankees and took him in, his old horse having played out on
the run. My clothes in the saddlebags proved to him the he was
not a Yankee horse, if he did have on a Yankee saddle.</p>
          <p>Poor Bob! I was sorry that he got captured in saving me, but
the sorrow was most overcome when I found they did not get
my dear Charley. Bob was taken to Camp Chase, Ohio and kept
there until the war was over. To pay him back for his kindness I
let him have one of my first cousins for a wife.</p>
          <p>Well, I could tell of a young private belonging to our company
who on Christmas morning, 1863, got an order from General
Forrest to do a certain thing. He did not obey, but in an instant he
gave the General orders, and he obeyed very nicely. But the
people have heard those old infantry fellows tell such “golley
whoppers,” and not knowing the difference, might think
cavalryman would tell them, too, sometimes.</p>
          <p>The marshal at Humboldt some time ago wanted to know of
me how to get rid of the little creepers a tramp had left in the
calaboose. I told him I did not know anything about such things,
that I belonged to the cavalry and we were all gentlemen, and I
would advise him to see Bill McCall, Nelse Cresap, Knox
Gillespie, R. J. W. Matthews, and several others who belonged
to the infantry.</p>
          <p>We all had our hard times and fun then, and can joke each
other now; but we must not forget that our old comrades have
been dropping off fast lately, and we too must soon cross over
the river. So let us all try to be ready when the Lord calls us.</p>
          <p>I have written this more for the children than the older people.
They like to hear the funny part of the war better than the
horrors.</p>
          <p>I never got my horse from Colonel Outlaw until the army got
back into Mississippi. We then got furloughs to come home for
a few days, so I brought old Tuck home to Bob's mother. The
Colonel said he would give my horse up if I would swap him the
new pants I had in the saddlebags for his old pair, and I gladly
made the trade. I guess he was the only colonel during 
<pb id="mcleary15" n="15"/>
the war that wore knee pants. He was very tall and I was
short, but he wore cavalry boots that came above his knees.</p>
          <p>I gave his old pants and the Eskimo cloak to Ben, our negro man,
who stayed at home and helped my mother take care of the
children after father died. He was the father of Jim and Calvin
McLeary and an uncle of the well-known Henry McLeary, of
Humboldt. My mother gave Ben a horse when the war was over.
He lived several years after the war, and we all have a good feeling
now for any of Ben's relations.</p>
          <p>In November, 1864, when we were capturing all of those boats
on the Tennessee River, our regiment was ordered to charge
three black, nasty-looking gunboats out in the middle of the river.
I never knew why such an order was given unless we were to fill
their portholes so full of bullets that they could not use their big
guns on us while our artillery was being brought up and put in
place; but they had the drop on us, and used it by tearing up the
bank and filling the air full of dirt before we got within fifty yards
of the river.</p>
          <p>In September, 1864, we made a raid into North Alabama and
Middle Tennessee, fording the Tennessee River at Colbert
Shoals. Before we started on that raid six or eight men were
selected from each regiment as the infirmary corps for that raid,
and I was one of the crowd detailed for that business. We
captured Athens, Ala., Sulphur Trestle, and chased the Yankees
on to Pulaski. When we arrived, our brigade was placed on a
hillside east of town in an old field, and we got orders to lie flat on
the ground while the Yankee artillery on the edge of the town and
the sharpshooters with their long-range guns were picking at us
from the windows of the houses. I never wanted to see a hole in
the ground so much in my life. The cannon balls and shells would
sometimes hit the ground in front of us and bounce over, and
maybe the next one would pass over us and hit the ground behind.
The bullets were also spatting around us. I placed all the rocks I
could reach in front of my head and shoulders, and when I got my
little fort made I heard a cannon ball as it struck our line; then the
word passed down the line for the infirmary corps to come at
once. I got up and went about one hundred yards up the line and
found Captain Shaw, of Haywood County, with a place as big as
my hand knocked from
<pb id="mcleary16" n="16"/>
the side of his hip. The same shot also burst an elbow and a knee
of another man to pieces, and knocked from another man's hands
his gun, which he never saw afterwards.</p>
          <p>We had no litters on which to carry the dead and wounded, so
we often had a hard job taking them off of the field to where the
ambulances could get them. </p>
          <p>As I told of the worst fright I got during the war, I will now tell
of the most sudden change in my feelings that I experienced.
When I went to the big brick house on the Charlotte Pike to get
my ankle fixed up, I rode in at the front gate and around to the
back porch and called for a chair and something to relieve my
suffering. Several negroes were lolling around in the back yard,
and there was a Yankee soldier staying there as a guard. The
people seemed not to care to do anything for me, but I called for
vinegar, brown paper, and strips of cloth, and fixed it up as best I
could and pulled my sock over the whole business. Then hearing
guns down on the river, told one of the negroes to bring me my
horse quick. He look at me with a silly grin and did not move. I
raised my gun and told him to bring me my horse, or I would throw
him flat of his back. He soon got a move on him for the horse; but
just the I heard a knocking on a door behind me, and when I
looked around the door was partly open and I could see a hand
beckoning me to come in. I told the negro to let the horse alone
a while, and into the parlor I went. A Confederate soldier told me
to take a seat at the center table, and said: “I see you are as mad as
h- at the way my people have treated you, and I can't blame you;
but you must take into consideration that we are here for only a
short time, and there are those negroes and the Yankee guard
ready to report everything they do for the Confederates when we
are gone, and it may cause them to be burned out and robbed of
everything.” I told him I knew how it was around Humboldt when
the Yankees were stationed there; the people had to use
deception in many ways. He said he had been gone from home
three years, and had just got home the night before. His people
were expecting him to drop in, and had everything good to eat and
drink ready for him. He then went to pulling out bureau drawers
and began setting out boiled ham, loaf bread, all kind of cakes,
pies, and good drinks. Do 
<pb id="mcleary17" n="17"/>
you think I told him: “No, I thank you; I wouldn't choose any?” If
you do, you think very wrong. I ate until I felt full up to my chin,
and thanked him and bade him good-by. I never saw a man I
liked so well on such short acquaintance as I did that fellow.</p>
          <p>Had that Yankee guard been as clever and as accommodating
as the one that stayed with us, he would have helped me fix up
my ankle. Our pet Yankee was a fine workman, and while with
us he made me a double-seated sleigh and other things for the
family. He and I were hunting wild turkeys below Humboldt
when General Forrest captured the place in December, 1862. The
magazine was burned, and it sounded like a battle up there. I
heard him calling for me to come quick; and thinking he had
found the turkeys, I went in a run, and when I asked what was
the matter he said: “I saw a flock of coons flying over, and I
thought I would call you. Let us get out for home; there is
something the matter in town.” So we left at once, and learned
what was the matter when we got home.</p>
          <p>Now, as some want to know about General Forrest's obeying
the young private's orders, I will tell. In December, 1863, we made
a raid into West Tennessee from Mississippi. We had gathered
up a great many recruits and were trying to get South with them
where they could be armed; but the Yankees were determined
that this time Forrest should not get out of West Tennessee, so
they were bringing troops from every direction to cut us off. We
had to cross Hatchie River at Estanaula, on a small ferryboat.
The river was almost bank full, the water running swiftly and the
boat was pulled across by a rope stretched from bank to bank.
The poor, weak horses were put on the boat and the best ones were
pushed into the water. Their owners would hold to them from
the boat until they passed the middle of the river and then turn
them loose, as they could then swim to the landing place without
being carried downstream. Our battalion was the last to cross. It
was Christmas morning, 1863. I knew my horse would have to take
to the water, so I took my saddle and blankets off and put them in
a little dugout. The other boys did the same. I paddled across
with two loads, threw them out on the bank, and had gone back
after another load. Everything was done in a rush.
<pb id="mcleary18" n="18"/>
We could hear the guns of the fight that was going on by those
who had crossed before us. General Forrest came to where I
stopped the little canoe and asked me if I could carry him across
in that thing. I told him I could if it did not turn over, and he then
stepped in and squatted down with his back to me. He was a
large, heavy man, and when I turned the little craft around it was
in a quiver; but we made it all right until we reached the middle
of the river. When the ferryboat passed us and all the horses
were turned loose, the big waves from the boat I thought would
knock us over, and every horse looked like he wanted to get to
our dugout. The General said: “Bear downstream; bear
downstream.” I told him to take up that paddle and knock them in
the head. He did as I told him, and we got to land all right. I had to
bear upstream with all the power I had to keep from being
carried downstream by the swift current. We all got across the
river. It was then a fight every day and night until we got back
into Mississippi. Instead of any of us being captured in getting
out of West Tennessee, we captured several of the Yankees and
took them out with us. Our battalion captured twelve near
Collierville, we ran through a gap in their lines with them, and
never stopped until we got near Como, Miss. It then turned
suddenly cold, and we struck camp in negro houses, barns,
stables, and any shelter we could get, and it seemed that we and
the Yankee prisoners would freeze. The next day was the cold
New Year's day of 1864. When it was learned at Washington, D.
C., that General Forrest had got back into Mississippi from West
Tennessee, the authorities removed General Hulburt from the
command of the Federals in that section and put in General
Washburn. And when General Forrest made the raid into
Memphis, General Washburn, to save himself, had to jump from
his bed through a window and escape down a dark alley. But our
boys got his uniform and boots.</p>
          <p>It was reported that when General Hulburt heard of it said:
“There it is again. They removed me because I couldn't keep
Forrest out of West Tennessee, and there is Washburn, who
can't keep him out of his bedroom.” But General Forrest was
kind enough to send his things back to him.</p>
          <p>In June, 1864, a few days after the hard-fought battle of
Brice's Crossroads, our brigade, or our division, was sent from
<pb id="mcleary19" n="19"/>
Mississippi across Alabama on a rapid march to meet a raid of
Yankee cavalry that was coming down into Northern Georgia. I
was sick before we started, but I kept with the command until we
got to Montevallo, Ala. We stopped one evening and night to rest
our horses at Tuscaloosa, and several of the boys made for the
Black Warrior River to have a fine time bathing and swimming.
W. T. Gleeson, of our company, a little, short, heavy-set fellow,
could not swim a lick, but he was flopping around in the edge of
the water. He had a great desire to go out in the middle of the
river and back like the good swimmers were doing. One fellow on
a big black horse rode in to take a swim to the middle of the river
and back, and as he passed Bill thought, “Now is my time,” and
grabbed the horse by the tail. Everything went finely for Bill until
the fellow made the turn to come back. The horse then let down
three different times trying to reach the bottom with his hind feet,
each time taking Bill under like a fishing cork. He knew it would
never do to turn loose. They got him out on the bank and rolled
and churned him around for quite a while before he could breathe;
and when he opened his eyes and they saw he was not going to
die, some one said: “Bill's eyes look as red as a terrapin's.” From
then on he went by the name of “Terrapin.”</p>
          <p>That night we all had a free invitation to go to the theater, one
of the attractions of which was the noted negro musician Blind
Tom. But I was sick and could not take in those pleasures. When
we got to Montevallo, I was left there with eight or ten others.
Some were sick and the horses of some had played out. We
struck our little camp in a cedar thicket near the depot. It rained
nearly every day, and our little hog shelters did not keep us dry. I
rode out one evening to see the rolling mills, where they were
rolling out rods and bars of iron of all sizes.</p>
          <p>While out I hitched my horse and went into an old field and
picked a few dewberries. Finding a good shade, I lay down on a
big flat rock and was soon studying my condition. I could feel
that I would soon be down with some hard spell of sickness,
and I was a long way from mother, sisters, and other friends: and
If I had any kinsfolk in the State of Alabama, I did not know it.
My command had gone on and left me in a strange land and
among strangers, and O how blue I did feel! I had
<pb id="mcleary20" n="20"/>
been reared by praying parents and taught when in trouble to take
it to the Lord in prayer, and I did so there on that rock. Next
morning when I awoke I was so deeply impressed to get up from
that pallet and go to the depot to meet the train coming from the
South that I did as I felt I was commanded to do. I took a seat on
a box on the platform, and when the train ran up it was loaded
with soldiers and other people. I was not expecting to see any
one I had ever seen before, but when it stopped a man from a
window asked: “What is the matter with you, Andy?” I told him I
did not know; that I had been sick for quite a while, and I
believed I would soon be down with a hard spell of something. The
command had left nine or ten of us there to do as best we could
for ourselves. He said: “You are going to die if you stay here.” I
told him I supposed so. He then said: “You have some kinsfolk
living thirty-five miles below here - your cousin Nannie Dungan,
who married Perry McGee, a well-to-do man. They are living
near Dixie Station; your cousin Mat Dungan is there waiting on
her brother Hall. He was shot through an arm in a battle a short
time ago. Get your officer to go to the provost marshal here and
get you a pass or ten days' leave of absence - anything to get
away from here - and take the first train going South, stop off at
Dixie Station, get out at McGee's, and you will be cared for as
well as if you were at home.” He said he was right from there, so
I reported to Jerry Johnson, one of my company, and a neighbor
boy, who was also sick, the good news I had received. The
sergeant got us the ten days' leave of absence, and we left next day for Dixie Station. I was too sick to walk, so I lay in the shade of the little box depot until Jerry walked one mile and a half and got a horse and buggy
and came after me. I went to bed as soon as I got there and was
in bed four or five weeks with typhoid fever.</p>
          <p>The man on the train that gave me the delightful information
was my old friend W. I. McFarland, of Humboldt, who was a
lieutenant in our regiment. I believed then and I believe now that I
was guided by the good Lord to meet that train. When I was
able to walk a little, our command had gone back into
Mississippi. We believed that if we were with it we would get
letters from home, so we left sooner than we should, but we 
<pb id="mcleary21" n="21"/>
made it all right. I had just got to feel like I could eat up
Alabama. We stayed the first night at the Wayside Home in
Selma, the next night in Meridian, Miss. When our train stopped
at Uniontown, Ala., we saw an old negro with a basketful of
boiled corn, which he said was not for sale, but was for the sick
soldiers on the train. I told him we were the sickest two he ever
saw, so we took two apiece. When we looked around, the car
was full of the best-looking ladies I ever saw, and each had a
plate, dish, or something good to eat for the soldiers that were on
the train. I was told they did that every day. They piled things
around Jerry and me as long as there was any place to put them;
and when the train whistled to start, one pretty girl ran to our
window with a stand of little pear preserves with the stems to
them, and asked if we could take them. I told her I thought we
could. We were like two old turkeys picking corn out of a pan,
and as the train moved off we handed her the empty stand and
bade them good-by with many thanks. I may forget other places,
but I shall always remember Uniontown, Ala. We still had our
haversacks nearly full of good things to eat that Cousin Mat and
Cousin Nannie had fixed up for us before we left. Cousin Nannie
is dead, but Cousin Mat is now living in Humboldt, the wife of M.
B. Permenter.</p>
          <p>When we left Meridian we came up the Mobile and Ohio road
to Egypt Station, where we found our command ready to start on
the Memphis raid. Jerry and I were sent to a farmhouse a few
miles out in the country, where there were several pretty girls
and plenty of “grub” to eat. I improved rapidly and was able to
meet the command at West Point, Miss., after they came back
from Memphis.</p>
          <p>Jerry was never able for service any more. Of all the pretty
girls I saw outside of Tennessee, none of them could shine in my
eyes like my little black-eyed girl back at home. While I liked all
of the girls then, even now, as old as I am, I have no great hatred
toward any of them. She is the only one I ever loved. She was
only a few days old when her grandmother told me to look at that
girl, she should be my wife some day; and we grew up with that
understanding.</p>
          <p>With all that I have written, it is only a small part of my
<pb id="mcleary22" n="22"/>
 experience in the Civil War. I did not try to keep a diary, as some
did, and I have tried to write everything truthfully, though I may
have made some mistakes as to dates, etc.; but it is all as I
remember. I have written it more to give the young people an
insight into what we young private soldiers went through in both
good and bad times.</p>
