        <head>LIFE IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY</head>
        <head>BEING PERSONAL EXPERIENCES OF A PRIVATE SOLDIER 
IN THE CONFEDERATE ARMY</head>
        <p>The following account of my experiences as a
private soldier in the Confederate Army during the
great war of 1861-'65 records only the ordinary career
of an ordinary Confederate soldier. It does not treat of
campaigns, army maneuvers, or plans of battles, but
only of the daily life of a common soldier, and of such
things as fell under his limited observation.</p>
        <p>Early in April, 1861, immediately after the battle of
Fort Sumter, I joined the Palmetto Guards, Capt.
George B. Cuthbert, of the Seventeenth Regiment
South Carolina Militia. Very soon after, the company
divided, and one half under Captain Cuthbert left
Charleston, and joined the Second South Carolina
Volunteers in Virginia. The other half, to which I
belonged, under Capt. George L. Buist, remained in
Charleston. Early in the fall Captain Buist's company
was ordered to Coosawhatchie, and given charge of
four howitzers; and thenceforth for three years, until
December, 1864, it served as field artillery. I did not
go with my company, as at that time I was a clerk in
the Charleston post-office, and
<pb id="ford8" n="8"/>
really exempt from all service. On April 2, 1862,
however, then being about eighteen years of age, I
resigned my clerkship, and joining the company at
Coosawhatchie, with the rest of the men enlisted in
the Confederate service “for three years or the war.”</p>
        <p>About May 1st the company was ordered to Battery
Island at the mouth of the Stono River, where with
another company, the “Gist Guards,” Capt. Chichester,
we were put under the command of Major C. K.
Huger, and placed in charge of four 24-pounder
smooth-bore guns in the battery commanding the river,
our own four howitzers being parked in the rear.
Cole's Island, next below, and at the immediate
entrance of the river, was garrisoned by Lucas'
battalion of Regulars, and the Twenty-fourth Regiment
South Carolina Volunteers, Col. C. H. Stevens. An
examination of a map of this locality will show that
Cole's Island was the key to Charleston; and this
question has given rise to considerable acrimonious
discussion. But whatever the merits of the case may
have been, the facts are, that under the strange fear of
the Federal gunboats that obtained on the South
Carolina coast at that period, it was believed that our
positions on Cole's and Battery Islands could not be
held against an attack from the gunboats, which then
were off the mouth of the river; and the islands were
evacuated. On the 18th the Federals sent a couple of
small boats into the mouth of the river to reconnoiter,
but they were soon driven back by our pickets. On the
next day, and
<pb id="ford9" n="9"/>
day after, all the guns were removed from both islands
to Fort Pemberton, higher up the Stono River—a
very strong earth fort that had been built in preparation
for this move. A day or two after, while our men were
still on Battery Island, but Cole's Island having been
deserted, several Federal gunboats entered the river,
shelling the woods and empty batteries as they
advanced. On their approach we set fire to the
barracks and then withdrew across the causeway to
James Island. We had to make haste across this
causeway, because it was within easy range of the
enemy, who soon began to rake it with shells.</p>
        <p>This was my first experience with shell fire, and I
soon learned that at long range, to men in the field, if
the shells did not explode it was more alarming than
dangerous. But being quite fresh I thought it
unbecoming to appear concerned, and although at first,
after crossing the causeway, I had stood wisely behind
a friendly oak tree for protection, after the first shell or
two I stepped aside and stood in the open, foolishly
thinking that this was more soldierly. I had not yet
learned that a soldier's common sense should prompt
him to make use of what protection there may be at
hand and to avoid exposing himself unnecessarily. But
only when duty calls, to throw precaution aside and
face whatever there is. While we were standing on
the James Island side of the causeway a time-fuse
shell fell near us, and one of our men, a new recruit,
ran up to it, and stood over
<pb id="ford10" n="10"/>
it with the exclamation, “How the thing does hiss!” Happily
the fuse failed and the shell did not explode. When I saw the
fortunate termination of the affair I could not resist calling
out, “Surely the Lord protects drunken men and fools.”</p>
        <p>Our company fell back from here to a plantation about a
mile inland, where we made our camp. I was a very
enthusiastic, energetic youngster, and in pitching our
large Sibley tent worked with such energy that I attracted
the attention of one of our men, Mr. H. Gourdin Young, who
jokingly said, “Ford, you are a splendid worker. If you were
a negro, I would buy you.” He was very much my senior.</p>
        <p>After remaining here for about two months, our men
doing some picket duty, we were transferred to Fort
Pemberton, a very strong earthwork of 16 guns, on the
Stono River, and garrisoned by Lucas' battalion of
Regulars, in which my brother was a lieutenant. Here we
remained for about three months.</p>
        <p>Frequently the Federal gunboats would ascend the river,
and there would be interchanges of shots between them and
the fort. On one of these occasions an amusing incident
occurred. Lieutenant Webb, of our company, had just got a
new negro man servant, who was inexperienced in warfare.
One afternoon, as a few shells were being thrown at the fort
from the gunboats, he was very much scared, saying, “Dem
people trow dem t'ings about yere so careless, dey won't
mind until dey hu't somebody.” Just then
<pb id="ford11" n="11"/>
a shell passed over the fort, and exploding in the
rear, a piece cut off a leg of Lieutenant Webb's 
horse. “Dere now ; w'at I tell you!” exclaimed Sam. 
“Dey done kill Mass Ben's horse.”</p>
        <p>During the early period of the war a great many of the
private soldiers in the Confederate Army had their own
negro servants in the field with them, who waited on their
masters, cleaned their horses, cooked their meals, etc.
Attached to our company there were probably twenty-five
such servants. This system continued during the first year
or two of the war, on the Carolina coast, but later on, as the
service got harder and rations became scarcer, these negro
servants were gradually sent back home, and the men did
their own work, cooking, etc. As a rule, these negroes liked
the life exceedingly. The work exacted of them was
necessarily very light. They were never under fire, unless
they chose to go there of their own accord, which some of
them did, keeping close to their masters. And they spent
much of their time foraging around the <sic corr="neighboring">neghboring</sic>
country. Although often on the picket lines, night as well as
day, with their masters, I never heard of an instance where
one of these army servants deserted to the enemy.</p>
        <p>At this period of the war the Confederate Government
allowed each soldier a certain sum yearly for his uniform,
and each company decided for itself what its own uniform
should be. In consequence, “uniform” was really an
inappropriate term to apply
<pb id="ford12" n="12"/>
to the dress of various organizations. At first our
company was uniformed in gray woolen frock coats,
and trousers of the same material, with blue caps; next
we had gray cotton coats and trousers with gray cloth
hats; then very dark brown coats with blue trousers
furnished by the government, and gray felt hats; and
finally the gray round jacket, also furnished by the
government, which assumed to provide also the hats,
shoes, and underclothing. The shoes, when we could
get them, were heavy English brogans, very hard on
our feet, but durable. It was in the summer of 1862
that we received our first allowance for uniforms, and
our quartermaster applied to a tailor in Charleston to
furnish them, but there was considerable delay in
getting them, and the tailor wrote that goods were then
scarce on account of the moonlight nights, but that in
about a fortnight, when the moon waned, they would
be in greater supply, and the uniforms could be
furnished at $2 more per man than the government
allowed. So in due time we each supplemented the
government's allowance and got new uniforms of very
inferior, half cotton gray stuff, which served us for the
rest of the year. Afterwards the government tried to
furnish the men gratuitously with the best it could, and
we did the best we could with what we got.</p>
        <p>In July our command was removed to Charleston,
under orders to go to Virginia. These orders were
countermanded in a few days owing to aggressive
movements of the Federals on the South Carolina
<pb id="ford13" n="13"/>
coast. The remainder of the summer and the fall were
spent in Charleston encamped for most of the time at
the Washington race course, doing duty on
the lines of breastworks thrown up across the neck just
above Magnolia Cemetery. These breastworks were
built to keep any enemy out of the city, but the nearest
enemy on land at that period was on Folley Island; in
Tennessee to the west; and Virginia to the North. And
when Sherman did come within 50 miles of Charleston
nearly three years later our troops were too much
occupied in getting away to think of these
breastworks. The battalion then consisted of three
companies, each armed with four 8-inch howitzers,
and all under the command of Maj. Charles Alston,
Jr., Capt. Buist having been promoted to major, and
assigned to duty near Savannah.</p>
        <p>While encamped on the race course I witnessed the
military execution of a deserter. The man belonged to
one of the regiments doing duty about Charleston, and
had been taken in the act of trying to desert to the
enemy; tried by court martial and condemned to death.
On the day fixed for the execution, some of the troops
in Charleston were marched up to the race course,
and so formed as to make three sides of a square.
Immediately after followed a wagon, with the coffin,
and seated on it, the man with his hands tied, and
under guard; the whole preceded by a band playing
the dead march; and followed by the detail of twelve
men selected by lot to shoot him. Half the rifles were
loaded with balls
<pb id="ford14" n="14"/>
and half with blank cartridges, but none of the detail
knew how his own was loaded. As the procession
halted the coffin was placed on the ground and the
deserter had his hands untied, and knelt in front of it
facing the twelve men who were to do the shooting,
and were drawn up about thirty feet in front of him. At
the word of command “aim,” the man, seemingly in
desperation, jerked open his shirt and bared his breast
to the bullets. Instantly at the command “fire” the detail
fired, and the man fell over dead on his coffin. It was
the most terrible sight I ever saw, far more dreadful
than anything I ever witnessed in battle, and it seemed
a sad thing that a really brave man should be so
sacrificed; but such is one of the necessities of war,
and it is necessary to deter others from playing the role
of traitor.</p>
        <p>At this time the Federal gunboats were very
annoying in Stono River, coming as high up as possible
daily, and shelling our pickets, and it was determined to
make a diversion. Therefore, in January, 1863, our
battery with Capt. Smith's and other troops were sent
over to John's Island, and ambushed at Legare's point
place to cooperate with two companies of Lucas'
battalion and some other troops on James Island. The
design was to capture the <hi rend="italics">Isaac P. Smith</hi>. This vessel
was an iron screw steamer of 453 tons, and carried
eight 8-inch navy guns, or sixty-four pounders, and a 7-inch
thirty-pounder Parrott 
<pb id="ford15" n="15"/>
gun. She was commanded at the time by Capt. F.
S. Conover; and her crew consisted of 11 officers and
105 men.</p>
        <p>The affair was completely successful. The gunboat
in her daily ascent was taken by surprise, and after a
short fight at only 75 or 100 yards distance, as she ran
trying to escape, had her steam drum torn by a shell,
and had to surrender. She had twenty-three men killed
and wounded, while we lost one man killed. My
howitzer was at a sharp bend in the river, and as the
gunboat ran past, her stern was directly about 100
yards in front of the gun I served. It put one 8-inch
schrapnel shell into her stern port, and I learned
afterwards that the shell knocked a gun off its
trunnions and killed or wounded eight men. A prize
crew was put on board immediately and the vessel
towed by a tug up the river, and later on to the city.
While the prisoners were being landed, the U. S. S.
<hi rend="italics">Commodore McDonough</hi> steamed up the river and
opened fire on us, but a few well-directed shots from
our batteries soon made her desist and drop back
down the river. At nightfall, our command returned to
Charleston.</p>
        <p>Our 8-inch howitzers were soon after exchanged
for four twelve-pounder Napoleon guns, and the
battery ordered back to James Island. Here in March
we took part in a land affair near Grimball's place on
the Stono.</p>
        <p>Our battery was encamped about a mile from the
river, and at daybreak one morning we were aroused
<pb id="ford16" n="16"/>
and hurried down the road toward Grimball's plantation.
Just before we were about to emerge from the woods into a
field, the musketry firing going on rapidly on our left front,
and a few shells from the gunboats falling into the woods,
we were halted, and told that just in front was a field
reaching to the river, and as soon as we passed out of the
woods the order “battery by right into line” would be given.
Well, we started at a rapid trot. I was driver of the lead
horses of gun No. 2, and as we passed out of the woods, in
obedience to the command I swung to the right, gun No. 3
swung to my right, and No. 4 to right of No. 3, while
No. 1 kept straight on down the road, and we all went
forward now at a run into battery.</p>
        <p>We galloped down to the edge of the marsh along the
river, and swinging into battery our guns opened on the U.
S. S. <hi rend="italics">Pawnee</hi> out in the river, the other two gunboats being
farther down, and around a bend of the river. We were
engaged for about twenty minutes, when the <hi rend="italics">Pawnee</hi>
dropped down the river, and the musketry fire on our left
gradually ceased.</p>
        <p>It seems that the Federals had advanced on the island
with a force of about 2,000 men, supported by three
gunboats. They had been met, and after sharp fighting, had
been driven back by Col. Gaillard's Twenty-fifth Regiment
South Carolina Volunteers, the Marion Artillery,—a light
battery,—and a
<pb id="ford17" n="17"/>
Georgia regiment, while our battery engaged the <hi rend="italics">Pawnee</hi>.
The Confederate loss was 27 men killed and wounded, and
the Federal, 45.</p>
        <p>The artillery was under the command of Lieut. Col.
Delaware Kemper, who sat on his horse by our battery during
the scrimmage. After the affair was over he remarked to our
captain, “Captain Webb, you have a splendid set of young
fellows there, but they need practice. They could not hit
John's Island if they had it for a target.” As to our
marksmanship, he was mistaken, however, for we did put
several shells into the <hi rend="italics">Pawnee</hi>, and she had to go to Port
Royal for repairs.</p>
        <p>In this affair, being a driver, my position while the guns
were in action was standing by my horses about 100 feet in
the rear of my gun; and it was trying to have to stand there
quietly, inactive, and take the shells and few rifle balls that
passed by. It would have been much more agreeable to be
actively engaged about the gun.</p>
        <p>Only a few moments after we had got into action, our
little company dog, a half-breed fox-terrier, “Boykee,”
who always stuck to the guns, and seemed to enjoy the
excitement, was struck in the neck by a piece of shell,
directly in front of where I was standing, and ran screaming
to the rear. This wound was not a serious one, and he
soon recovered from it. He was afterwards ignominiously
killed by a snake in Florida.</p>
        <pb id="ford18" n="18"/>
        <p>In July, 1863, were developed the disastrous results of
the evacuation of Cole's Island in May the year before. As
soon as we left that island and Battery Island the Federals
occupied them, and used them as bases for operations
against Charleston. From there they occupied Folley Island,
a densely wooded island where their operations could easily
be concealed. They advanced to the north end of this island,
to Light House Inlet, and under the concealment of the
shrubbery built formidable batteries, which at daybreak one
morning were unmasked, and under a heavy fire from their
guns, an infantry assault in boats was made upon our small
force on the southern end of Morris' Island. After a severe
fight the Federals got a firm foothold upon this island,
which for the next two months or so was the scene of some
of the most sanguinary fighting of the war.</p>
        <p>Immediately after this surprise by the Federals a
detachment of our company was placed in charge of Battery
Haskell, on James Island, directly opposite Morris' Island.
The celebrated siege of Battery Wagner then began, and we
used to watch the fighting at about three-quarters of a mile
distance. The terrible bombardment and assault of July 18
was one of the sights of the war. At daylight the
bombardment of the fort began, and continued without a
minute's cessation all day. Occasionally as many as four
shells were observed in the air at the same time. The fort
itself was enveloped in a dense black pall of
<pb id="ford19" n="19"/>
smoke from bursting shells, and at times was completely
hidden. As the afternoon wore on the bombardment
increased in intensity, and it seemed as if the very
foundations of our part of the world were being torn to
pieces. The garrison was kept in the bomb-proof, and not a
shot was fired in reply. At dusk the bombardment suddenly
ceased, and almost immediately the guns of the Confederates
in Fort Sumter, trained on the beach in front of Wagner,
opened. Almost simultaneously we saw a mass of blue spring
up apparently from the earth, and advance on Wagner, and
then the rattle of musketry. As the dusk deepened into
darkness the rapid flashes of musketry looked at that
distance like vast masses of fireflies, over a morass. We saw
that it was an infantry assault, and a desperate hand-to-hand
fight it was. But the result was very disastrous to the
Federals, who were repulsed with a loss of upwards of 2,000
men.</p>
        <p>In August was begun the bombardment of Charleston,
which was continued steadily for a year and a half. On the
night of the 21st, at 10.45 o'clock, General Beauregard
received an unsigned note, brought to our pickets,
purporting to be from General Gilmore, demanding the
evacuation and surrender of Morris' Island and Fort Sumter
under penalty of the bombardment of the city within four
hours after the note had been sent by him. Two hours and
three-quarters after this note had reached General
Beauregard's hands, at 1.30 o'clock on the morning of the
<pb id="ford20" n="20"/>
22d, the Federal battery in the marsh on the edge of the
creek separating Morris from James Island, opened fire,
and threw a number of shells into the city. At about 9
o'clock on the morning of the 22d, seven and a quarter
hours after the bombardment had begun, General Gilmore
sent a properly signed note making the same demands. This
note was immediately answered by General Beauregard with
an emphatic refusal, and some severe remarks as to his
firing upon a city full of women and children before he had
given them reasonable time to escape. As may be imagined,
the terror of the women and children in Charleston that
night was extreme when it was realized that the city was
being bombarded. The distance in a direct line from the
Swamp Angel Battery, as it was called, to the city was about
5 miles, and it had not been thought that any gun could shoot
that far. At first only percussion shells were used, but later
on, in 1864, time-fuse shells were also used, and were much
more dangerous, as they nearly always exploded. Battery
Haskell, at which our company was stationed, was nearly in
line between the Swamp Angel and the city, and constantly
we watched the shells, city-bound, passing over our heads
high in the air. At night, when fuse shells were used, they
looked like slow meteors.</p>
        <p>Frequently, when the tide was high, some of the Federal
gunboats came into the inlet in front of Battery Haskell, and
about half a mile off, and threw a number of shells into it.
But no harm was done,
<pb id="ford21" n="21"/>
as we could easily see the shells coming, and dodged them.
We were very seldom allowed to reply. After the shelling
was over, and the gunboat had hauled off, it was my habit to
go about and pick up the shells, generally about sixty-
pounders, and store them under my cot in my tent until I
could find time to unscrew the fuse plugs and pour out all of
the powder. As soon as I had gathered a wagon load I would
carry them to Charleston and sell them at the arsenal. This
was such a period of violence and bloodshed that the fearful
risk of explosion did not concern me, and what I am equally
surprised at now, after the lapse of many years, is that my
officers allowed such a thing to be done in the battery, or in
fact at all.</p>
        <p>Here I witnessed an occurrence that, according to
the law of chances, would not happen once in a thousand
times. In the battery was a dry well, about six
or eight feet deep, and one afternoon, while our
friend the gunboat was throwing the usual shells at
us, and we were dodging them, I remarked to a comrade
that “that old well would be a good place to get
into.” The remark had scarcely been made before a
shell dropped into that well as accurately as possible.
It was simply one of those remarkable occurrences
that happen in real life, but which writers dare not
put in fiction.</p>
        <p>The picket line on James Island in this vicinity, together
with Battery Haskell, was then under the command of Maj.
Edward Manigault, an officer of
<pb id="ford22" n="22"/>
very exceptional ability. During this summer our shortness
of rations began, and continued rather to intensify until the
end. For one period of about two months it consisted of only
one small loaf of baker's bread and a gill of sorghum syrup
daily. For that time we had not a particle of either fresh or
salt meat. If we had not been where we could obtain plenty of
fish, we would have suffered seriously. The quartermaster's
department was as badly crippled as the commissary's and
most of us could get no new shoes, and several of our men
were actually barefooted in consequence; but it being
summer, and on a sandy coast, there was not as much
suffering as might have been otherwise. Scurvy, fever, and
other ailments were very general and several deaths
resulted. The battery was on a strip of land separated from
the main land of James Island by a marsh and small creek,
over which was a causeway and bridge. This causeway was
watched from the Federal gunboats, and every time even one
man would go across it he would be saluted with a shell or
two. On one occasion I was ordered to drive several sick
men to the city in an ambulance, and as we struck the
causeway a gunboat sent the customary shells at us. The
sick men were nervous, and one of the men called out, “For
God's sake, Ford, put down the curtains!”</p>
        <p>Toward the fall of 1863, after the evacuation of Morris
Island by the Confederate troops, our company was
withdrawn, and returned to the old camping ground at
Heyward's place near Wappoo Cut.</p>
        <pb id="ford23" n="23"/>
        <p>As it seemed that we would remain here all winter, as we
really did, I obtained permission to build a log cabin for
myself and my mess. One day, as I was building the
chimney, I saw Maj. Edward Manigault and his brother,
Gen. Arthur Manigault, who was spending the day with
him, walking toward me to inspect the guns parked near
by. As they approached I jumped down off the scaffolding
and saluted them. They returned the salute, and then the
Major said: “We have been admiring your chimney, Mr.
Ford. It is as well built as if a mason had done the work.”
The old man, whenever on the few occasions he spoke to
me, strange to say, always addressed me, a private soldier,
as “Mr.” Ford. I never could account for it, unless it was
that he knew all about me and my people. He had been a
West Pointer, but had resigned from the U. S. Army a good
many years before. Thus he was a strict disciplinarian, and
on that account at that time not popular with the men; but I
always liked him, and approved of his discipline. Later on,
as the service became more exacting, and really active, the
men became devoted to him, as they realized his ability as
an officer.</p>
        <p>On December 23 our company, then having four 24-pounder Parrott guns,
started off for John's Island, where
an attempt was to be made to capture a small body of
Federals that were near Legareville, and also to sink or
capture a Federal gunboat that was off that place. Our
company was to have been
<pb id="ford24" n="24"/>
supported by a Virginia regiment. On Christmas day at
daylight we opened fire from our masked battery upon the
two gunboats, for there were two on hand instead of one,
but the infantry remained in the background, and failed to
attack the Federals near Legareville as designed, and we had
to bear the whole brunt of the fight. It was a sharp affair, and
we soon had to get out of it as best we could, with the loss
of several men and a half dozen horses.</p>
        <p>In this affair I had a very narrow escape, and another
man lost his life in my stead. I had been lead driver on gun
No. 2, and when we started on this expedition I was
transferred to cannoneer's duty, and young Heyward
Ancrum given my horses. Well, in the fight a shell from the
U. S. S. <hi rend="italics">Marblehead</hi> 
passed entirely through the bodies of
both of my horses, and took off Ancrum's leg at the knee.
He fell among the struggling, dying horses, but was pulled
out, and died soon after. He was certainly killed in my place.</p>
        <p>It was about this time that I saw that celebrated torpedo
submarine boat, the <hi rend="italics">Hundley</hi>, the first 
submarine boat ever
built. As I was standing on the bank of the Stono River, I
saw the boat passing along the river, where her builder, H. L.
Hundley, had brought her for practice. I watched her as she
disappeared around a bend of the river, and little thought of
the fearful tragedy that was immediately to ensue. She made
an experimental dive, stuck
<pb id="ford25" n="25"/>
her nose in the mud, and drowned her entire crew. Her
career was such an eventful one that I record what I
recollect of it.</p>
        <p>She was built in Mobile by Hundley, and brought on to
Charleston in 1863. She was of iron, about 20 feet long, 4 feet
wide, and 5 feet deep—in fact, not far from round, as I have
seen it stated; and equipped with two fins, by which she
could be raised or lowered in the water. The intention of her
builder was that she should dive under an enemy's vessel,
with a torpedo in tow, which would be dragged against the
vessel, and exploded while the <hi rend="italics">Hundley</hi>, or 
<hi rend="italics">“Fish,”</hi> as some
called her, rose on the other side. She was worked by a hand
propeller, and equipped with water tanks, which could be
filled or emptied at pleasure, and thus regulate her sinking or
rising. The first experiment with her was made in Mobile
Bay, and she went down all right with her crew of seven
men, but did not come up, and every man died, asphyxiated,
as no provision had been made for storing a supply of air.</p>
        <p>As soon as she was raised, she was brought to
Charleston, and a few days after her acceptance by General
Beauregard, Lieutenant Payne, of the Confederate Navy,
volunteered with a crew of six men to man her and attack
the Federal fleet off Charleston. While he had her at Fort
Johnson, on James Island, and was making preparations for
the attack, one night as she was lying at the wharf the swell
of a passing steamer filled her, and she went to the
<pb id="ford26" n="26"/>
bottom, carrying with her and drowning the six men.
Lieutenant Payne happened to be near an open manhole at
the moment, and thus he alone escaped. Notwithstanding
the evidently fatal characteristics of this boat, as soon as
she was raised another crew of six men volunteered under
Payne and took charge of her. But only a week afterwards
an exactly similar accident happened while she was
alongside the wharf at Fort Sumter, and only Payne and two
of his men escaped.</p>
        <p>H. L. Hundley, her builder in Mobile, now believed that
the crews did not understand how to manage the 
<hi rend="italics">“Fish,”</hi>
and came on to Charleston to see if he could not show how
it should be done. A Lieutenant Dixon, of Alabama, had
made several successful experiments with the boat in Mobile
Bay, and he also came on, and was put in charge, with a
volunteer crew, and made several successful dives in the
harbor. But one day, the day on which I saw the boat,
Hundley himself took it into Stono River to practice her
crew. She went down all right, but did not come up, and
when she was searched for, found and raised to the surface,
all of her crew were dead, asphyxiated as others had been.</p>
        <p>After the boat was brought up to Charleston, several
successful experiments were made with her, until she
attempted to dive under the Confederate receiving ship
<hi rend="italics">Indian Chief</hi>, when she got 
entangled with an anchor
chain and went to the bottom, and
<pb id="ford27" n="27"/>
remained there until she was raised with every one of her
crew dead, as were their predecessors.</p>
        <p>No sooner had she been raised than a number of men
begged to be allowed to give her another trial, and
Lieutenant Dixon was given permission to use her in an
attack on the U. S. S. <hi rend="italics">Housatonic</hi>, a new gunboat that
lay off Beach Inlet on the bar, on the condition that she
should not be used as a submarine vessel, but only on the
surface with a <sic corr="spare">spar</sic> torpedo. On February 17, 1864,
Lieutenant Dixon, with a crew of six men, made their way
with the boat through the creeks behind Sullivan's Island to
the inlet. The night was not very dark, and the 
<hi rend="italics">Housatonic</hi>
easily could be perceived lying at anchor, unmindful of
danger. The <hi rend="italics">“Fish”</hi> went 
direct for her victim, and her
torpedo striking the side tore a tremendous hole in the
<hi rend="italics">Housatonic</hi>, which sank to the bottom in about four
minutes. But as the water was not very deep her masts
remained above water, and all of the crew, except four or
five saved themselves by climbing and clinging to them. But
the <hi rend="italics">“Fish”</hi> was not seen again. 
From some unknown cause
she again sank, and all her crew perished. Several years
after the war, when the government was clearing the wrecks
and obstructions out of Charleston harbor, the divers
visited the scene of this attack, and on the sandy bottom of
the sea found the hulk of the <hi rend="italics">Housatonic</hi>, and alongside
of her the shell of the <hi rend="italics">“Fish.”</hi> 
Within the latter were the
skeletons of her devoted crew.</p>
        <pb id="ford28" n="28"/>
        <p>This submarine torpedo boat must not be confused with
the surface ones, called “Davids,” that were first built and
used at Charleston in the fall of 1863. These “Davids” were
cigar-shaped crafts about 30 feet long, and propelled by
miniature steam engines; and they each carried a torpedo at
the end of a spar in the bow. There were several of them at
Charleston and points along the coast.</p>
        <p>In March, 1864, I had the only violent illness I had during
my service, until at the end, a year later, and being given a
thirty-day furlough went up to Sumter, where I had some
near relatives. Here I stayed a couple of weeks, and then
went over to Aiken, where my parents and sisters resided.
Although the distance from Sumter to Aiken was only about
135 miles, the railway trains took seventeen hours to make
the distance. It is hard to realize now the delays and
discomforts of travel in the South in 1864. With worn-out
tracks and roadbeds, dilapidated engines and cars, it is
remarkable that the railway trains were able to run at all. On
this occasion, which was typical of travel then, I left Sumter
at 10 o'clock p. m., and just before reaching Kingsville the
engine ran off the track from a worn-out rail. Two hours or
more were spent in prying it back. Then shortly after the
train stopped in a piece of woodland, and the fireman and
train hands took their axes and spent an hour cutting wood
and putting it on the tender. So it was full daylight when we
reached Kingsville.
<pb id="ford29" n="29"/>
From there all went well until after passing Branchville the
engine broke one of its connecting rods, and we had to wait
until another engine could be got from Branchville. Some
miles farther up the road the train again stopped, and the
hands went into the woods and cut wood for the engine.
Finally, at about four o'clock in the afternoon I arrived at
Aiken. Here I remained for a fortnight, and then joined my
command, which had just been ordered to Florida.</p>
        <p>Early in the spring the Federals made an advance into
Florida from Jacksonville, and a number of troops were sent
from South Carolina to oppose them. Among them was our
battery of artillery. We reached the section of the State
threatened the day after the battle of Olustee, or Ocean
Pond, and were then ordered back to Madison, where we
encamped, and during our stay there of a couple of weeks
were most hospitably treated by the ladies of the town.</p>
        <p>This battle of Olustee was a very severe fight, and a
bloody one, in which the Federals under General Seymour
were routed by the Confederates under Gen. Pat. Finnigan
and Gen. A. H. Colquitt. In this battle the Federal loss was
about 1,900 men and the Confederate about 1,000. The
obstinacy of the struggle may be appreciated when it is
observed that, out of the total of 11,000 men engaged, the
casualties amounted to 2,900, nearly 27 per cent. As I have
said, our battery reached the scene after
<pb id="ford30" n="30"/>
the battle, so we made no stay near Olustee, but retired to
Madison. The wounded were all cared for at the wayside
hospitals, and the dead white men of both sides buried; but
the dead negroes were left where they fell. There had been
several regiments of negroes in the Federal force, who as
usual had been put into the front lines, and thus received
the full effect of the Confederate fire. The field was dotted
everywhere with dead negroes, who with the dead horses
here and there soon created an intolerable stench,
perceptible for half a mile or more. The hogs which roamed
at large over the country were soon attracted to the spot
and tore many of the bodies to pieces, feeding upon them.
This field of death, enlivened by numbers of hogs grunting
and squealing over their hideous meal, was one of the most
repulsive sights I ever saw.</p>
        <p>About the beginning of March our battery was ordered
to Baldwin, about 9 miles from Jacksonville. Here we
remained for nearly a month, and strange to say had a very
uncomfortable time as far as food was concerned. The
surrounding country was barren, swampy, and very thinly
settled, so there was very little private foraging to be done
and we had to suffer from the very scant rations served out
by the commissary.</p>
        <p>This department was in a very disorganized condition,
probably because of the sudden massing of troops at an
unexpected point; but the fact was that our men seldom got
enough of even the coarsest
<pb id="ford31" n="31"/>
food. Our battery horses were supplied with corn and
forage, and on several occasions after going twenty-four
hours without any food I made use of some opportunity to
steal the horses' corn, and parched that for a meal.</p>
        <p>The bacon served out occasionally was of the most
emphatic character, and very animated, but when fried and
eaten with eyes shut, and nostrils closed, did no harm.
Once in a while some of the men would go into the swamp
and still-hunt wild hogs, and we would get some fresh pork.
This hunting was against orders, and the officers tried their
best to stop it, and occasionally some man would be caught
at it and punished, but the men were really too much in
need of food to remain quiet when game could be had.
These hogs had once had recognized owners, but since
that section of country had been deserted, had run wild,
and lived in the swamp. It was by no means easy to shoot
them, as they were very wary, and however quiet the hunter
might remain behind his brush blind would often detect his
presence by their sense of smell, and could not be decoyed
within range.</p>
        <p>My company was soon ordered back to South Carolina,
and our route lay over the Albany and Gulf Railroad, now
the Atlantic Coast Line, from Quitman to Savannah. This
road, like all others in the South, was in a terribly
dilapidated condition—rails and trestles decayed, and rolling-stock
worn out. The engine that drew our train, containing
<pb id="ford32" n="32"/>
only our battery, was unable to do the work, and
several times when we reached the easy grades on that
generally very level road, the men would be compelled to
get off and assist the engine by pushing the train up the
incline. When the train was got up to the top of the grade it
would go down the other side by its own impetus, and on
level stretches the engine got along fairly well. We made the
distance of 170 miles in about sixteen hours, a little over ten
miles an hour—fairly good speed in the South in 1864.</p>
        <p>Our battery was stopped at Green Pond, on the Savannah
and Charleston Railroad, and we spent the summer of 1864
doing picket duty at Combahee Point, and along the
Ashepoo River.</p>
        <p>At Combahee Point we were stationed on Mr. Andrew
Burnett's plantation. The camp was located on the edge of
the abandoned rice field, while the picket post was in front
on some breastworks on the river's edge. The old rice fields
were more or less overflowed, the banks having been
broken for two years or more, and in them were numerous
alligators, some of considerable size. At night the noises
made by these amphibians, and the raccoons in the adjacent
marsh, would have been interesting to a naturalist, but were
annoying to us. But the most serious disturbers of our
peace were the mosquitoes. These were of such size and
venom and
<pb id="ford33" n="33"/>
in such numbers as to cause real suffering, and necessitate
the use of unusual schemes to protect ourselves against
their attacks.</p>
        <p>Accounts of these mosquitoes must seem incredible to
any one who has never spent a midsummer's night in the
rice fields; and very few white people have done this since
the war. During the day the comparatively few that were
about could be driven off by tobacco smoke and other
means, but when night fell, and the myriads came up from
the fields and marsh, then the situation became serious.
When we were on sentry duty, walking post, many of us
wore thick woolen gloves to protect our hands; and over
our heads and necks frames made of thin hoops covered
with mosquito netting. And when we wanted to retire to our
small “A” tents, we had to make smudge fires in them first,
and then crawl in on our hands and knees, and keep our
faces near the ground to breathe, until finally we got asleep.
And, moreover, we dared not let our faces or hands touch
the sides of the tent, for immediately the mighty insects
would thrust their <sic corr="proboscises">probosces</sic> through the canvas and get
us. I feel dubious about the advisability of recording such a
statement, but as I am stating only facts as I experienced
them, this must go on record.</p>
        <p>In this rice field section our men suffered greatly from
fever, and there were several deaths. I was the only man in
the company of 70 who persisted
<pb id="ford34" n="34"/>
in taking three grains of quinine daily, and one other of our
men and I were the only two who did not have a touch of
fever.</p>
        <p>While on duty here, early one morning four negro men
came to our picket bringing two Federal officers, and turned
them over to us. Upon inquiry it seemed that these two
officers, one of them a Captain Strong of the Regular Army,
and the other a Volunteer lieutenant, had been captured in
Virginia, and were on their way to prison in Georgia, but had
escaped from the cars on the Savannah and Charleston
Railroad, and had tried to make their way to the Federal
fleet, but were simply starved out, until they had to appeal
to the negroes for help, and they promptly brought them in
to us. I was detailed as one of the men to guard and carry
them to Green Pond, about 15 miles off, and deliver them to
the authorities. On the way we stopped for a moment at Mr.
Benjamin Rhett's plantation, who, as soon as he learned
what was up came to the wagon and with the consent of the
sergeant in command, invited the officers into his house.
There, as soon as they had made some ablutions, he carried
them in to breakfast, and entertained them for an hour; at
the same time sending breakfast and genuine coffee out to
us. Captain Strong spoke to me very pleasantly, and said
that he was a graduate of West Point; and learning that I
was from Charleston, inquired about several people there
whom I knew, among others of Col. Sam. Ferguson, who he
said had been a classmate
<pb id="ford35" n="35"/>
of his at the Academy, and who I told him was at that
time with the army in the West. I recollect that he was
interested at hearing of him. He seemed also quite struck
with the youthfulness of our men, and remarked on it.</p>
        <p>Late in the fall our battery was removed to a point on the
Charleston and Savannah Railroad, south of Green Pond,
and put in charge of a battery there, as the Federals had
advanced up from Port Royal, with the evident intention of
attempting to seize the railroad. It seems that this really was
the aim of the movement, conducted under the command of
Gen. Guy V. Henry. And this movement was suggested by
General Sherman, who, when he determined upon his march
through Georgia, stated to the government at Washington
that he expected to reach Savannah about the end of
December, and suggested that the railway between
Charleston and Savannah be destroyed before he got there.
The Federals made several advances, but never could get
nearer than about half a mile of the railroad, and in their
efforts to do so were defeated and driven back in two or
three affairs, notably in a serious fight at Tulafinny, in
which the cadets of the South Carolina Military Academy,
mere boys, were engaged.</p>
        <p>In these infantry affairs we had no part, as they occurred
at some distance from our position. Our company at the
time was serving as heavy artillerists, and, as I have said,
had charge of a battery commanding the railroad. The
Federals had, however,
<pb id="ford36" n="36"/>
established a battery of field pieces about 700 yards in
our front, and there were frequent artillery duels, but
without serious injury, certainly to our side. There was a
short section of the railway track in an open piece of
country, of which the enemy got the range, and every time a
train passed in the daytime they would open on it with their
guns. When the engineers approached this section they put
on all the speed attainable, which was not very much at
best, with the dilapidated engines they then had, and there
was considerable interesting excitement in being on a flat
car and running the gauntlet in this way. I do not think,
however, that a train was ever hit.</p>
        <p>About December the field pieces were taken away from
our company and Capt. Porcher Smith's, and both were
turned into infantry, and armed with old-fashioned Belgian
rifles, probably the most antiquated and worthless guns
ever put into a modern soldier's hands. But they were all our
government had. These rifles could not send a ball beyond
200 yards, and at much shorter range their aim was entirely
unreliable. This our men felt hard to stand, as they knew
that at this period the Federal soldiers were being generally
armed with breech-loading Springfield rifles, weapons which
thirty years later were reckoned very formidable. We soon
after were ordered back to James Island, where with Captain
Smith's company we were again under the command of Maj.
Edward Manigault. We were at once
<pb id="ford37" n="37"/>
put on very arduous picket duty along the lines on the
southwestern part of the island. The weather at this time I
well recollect was unusually cold and wet, and with an
insufficiency of food and clothing, our sufferings were
severe. Men had got very scarce then, and the same relay
had to be kept on picket week after week without relief, and
the men would often have to stand guard on the outposts
eight or ten hours on a stretch.</p>
        <p>On one occasion while another man and I were on sentry
duty on the lines in the rifle-pits, at the break of day we saw
the two Federal sentries on the other side of the intervening
marsh desert their posts, and unarmed walk quickly toward
us. When they got within about ten paces we halted them,
and called our officer. As soon as he came up we turned
them over to him. I always had a loathing for a deserter, and
said to the men, “If I had my way I would have you given
thirty-nine lashes each and sent back under flag of truce to
your command, so you could be shot as you deserve.” One
of them twiggled his fingers on his nose and replied, “Ah,
but you hav'n't got no say in the matter.”</p>
        <p>While on duty on these outpost lines, the Federals
frequently shelled us from their gunboats in Stono River.
We did not mind the Parrott shells, but the shells from the
Cohorn mortars on a mortar schooner were very trying.
They would fall, apparently from the sky, and there was no
dodging them. But fortunately none of them fell directly in
the rifle-pits,
<pb id="ford38" n="38"/>
but all exploded harmlessly in the field. All old soldiers
know that mortar shells take a very mean advantage of a
man.</p>
        <p>One of the outposts on these lines which was manned
only at night was out in the marsh, and I had it one night,
and it was about the most disagreeable night I ever had on
picket. I was placed on the post at dark, with orders to keep
in the marsh, at the edge of the tide as it went down, and to
come in at the first daylight. I was all the time up to my
insteps in mud, by myself, with the rain falling all night. I
stood out in that marsh from dark until daylight, in the
drenching rain, for about ten hours. Like most of the men, I
had no oilskin, or any protection against the weather, and of
course was thoroughly drenched early in the night, and the
steady rain all night kept me saturated. The best I could do
was to try to keep my ammunition and gun-lock dry. It was
certainly the worst night I ever spent.</p>
        <p>On February 10, 1865, we had our first serious infantry
fight, as infantry. We were doing picket duty at this time on
the lines near Grimball's causeway, with our right extending
to Stono River. At about daylight that morning the Federals
began to shell our lines from four gunboats and a mortar
schooner, whose masts we could see over the trees; and
soon after we could see a large force of their infantry
assembling on Legare's plantation on the other side of the
flat and marsh in front of our lines.
<pb id="ford39" n="39"/>
Our entire force along this part of the lines consisted of 52
men of our company and 40 men of the Second South
Carolina Artillery and about 20 cavalry, together with 7
officers—all told, 119 men. Just before the Federal infantry
advanced, a section of artillery took position at about 600
yards in front of us, and shelled our line, but did no damage.
The Federal infantry engaged, as I learned a few months
afterwards from one of their officers, were the Fifty-fourth
and One Hundred and Forty-fourth New York, white; and
the Thirty-second, Thirty-third, and Fifty-fifth U. S. negro
troops, altogether about 1,500 men, and one section of
artillery. We were assaulted directly in front, but held our
ground until the enemy were within 30 feet of our line; in
fact, some of their men were actually into our trenches, and
having hand-to-hand fights with our men. So close had they
got that I had ceased firing, and had just fixed my bayonet,
and braced myself for a hand-to-hand fight, when Major
Manigault, who was standing only a few paces to my right
in rear of the line, gave the order to retreat. To this moment
not a man had flinched, but at the order to retreat we broke
for the rear, a few of the men reloading, turning, and firing
back as they retreated. We halted at a ditch about 300 yards
in the rear, where we found the battalion of cadets of the
South Carolina Military Academy, and a company of the
Second Regiment South Carolina Artillery, altogether about
185 men. We who had come out of
<pb id="ford40" n="40"/>
the affair, feeling strong with this support, were
anxious to return and try to drive back the Federals,
but we had no such orders. And probably
it was well we did not do so; for about 700 of the
enemy were white men, and, as I afterwards learned,
more than half of them Irish; and for about 267
men to tackle in open fight nearly three times their
number, of that class of men, was too serious an
undertaking to be attempted. Of course as to the
800 negroes the odds would not have been counted.</p>
        <p>In this affair, of the 119 Confederates engaged,
we lost 2 officers, of whom one was the gallant
Major Manigault, severely wounded, and 37 men.
The Federals lost 88. Our loss, as is shown, was
about 33 per cent<sic corr="no punctuation required">.</sic> 
of our force engaged, and this
large mortality shows the heavy fire to which we
were subjected. General Schimmelpfennig was in
general command of the affair, but the assault was
led by Colonel Bennett, who, mounted upon a sorrel
horse, was a mark for several shots from our
wretched rifles, but escaped unhurt.</p>
        <p>The point where I was, just about the center of our line, at
the causeway, was assaulted by a regiment of negro troops;
and as they got near to us I distinctly heard their officers
cursing them. I heard one officer say, “Keep in line there,
you damned scoundrels!” and another, “Go on, you damned
rascals, or I'll chop you down!” I saw the line waver badly
when it got to within fifty yards of us, and on this occasion
at least it did not look
<pb id="ford41" n="41"/>
to me as if the negroes had the spirit to “fight nobly.” I
know it is a catch phrase elsewhere that the colored troops
fought nobly, but I testify to what I saw and heard.</p>
        <p>As to these negro troops, there was a sequel, nearly a
year later. When I was peaceably in my office in Charleston
one of my family's former slaves, “Taffy” by name, came in
to see me. In former times he had been a waiter “in the
house,” and was about my own age; but in 1860, in the
settlement of an estate, he with his parents, aunt, and
brother were sold to Mr. John Ashe, and put on his
plantation near Port Royal. Of course, when the Federals
overran that section they took in all these “contrabands,”
as they were called, and Taffy became a soldier, and was in
one of the regiments that assaulted us. In reply to a
question from me, he foolishly said he “liked it.” I only
replied, “Well, I'm sorry I didn't kill you as you deserved,
that's all I have to say.” He only grinned.</p>
        <p>On February 17, James Island was evacuated by the
Confederates. Captain Matthews's company, formerly
artillery but now infantry, was added to our two, and the
battalion known as Manigault's, or the Eighteenth South
Carolina Battalion. Major Manigault being wounded, and a
prisoner, Capt. B. C. Webb, of Company A, was in
command. Our line of march was through St. Andrew's
Parish, across the bridge at Bee's Ferry, and along the old
State road past Otranto across Goose Creek bridge,
<pb id="ford42" n="42"/>
which was burned as soon as the last troops had crossed.
Our men had started on this march with as much baggage as
they thought they could carry, but they soon threw aside
their impedimenta, and each settled down to his one blanket
and such clothes as he actually wore. This march across the
Carolinas was a very hard one. Our feet soon became
blistered and sore, and many of us had no shoes, but
trudged along in the cold and mud barefooted as best we
could. As I have already said, this was a cold winter, and it
seemed to us that it rained and froze constantly. Not a
particle of shelter did we have day or night. We would
march all day, often in more or less rain, and at nightfall halt,
and bivouac in the bushes, with every particle of food or
clothing saturated. Within a few minutes after a halt, even
under a steady rain, fires would be burning and quickly
extend through the bivouac. If a civilian should attempt to
kindle a fire with soaked wood under a steady rain, he would
find his patience sorely tried, but the soldiers seemed to
have no trouble.</p>
        <p>After the fires were kindled we had to wait for the arrival
of the commissary wagons; and it was not uncommon for a
detail of men to be sent back in the night to help push the
wagons through the mud; weary, footsore, hungry, in the
dark, up to the knees in mud, heaving on the wheels of a
stalled wagon! It was often late at night before the wagons
were got up and rations could be obtained.</p>
        <pb id="ford43" n="43"/>
        <p>The men, of course, had to take turns in the use of the
two or three frying-pans carried for each company, and
when worn down by marching from early dawn until dark it
was disheartening to have to wait one's turn, which often
did not come until eleven o'clock at night. Frequently the
men, rather than wait for the frying-pan, would fry their
scraps of bacon on the coals, and make the cornmeal into
dough, which they would wrap around the ends of their
ramrods and toast in the fire. When the rations were drawn
they consisted of only seven ounces of bacon and one pint
of cornmeal to the man per day; and on several occasions
even these could not be had, and the men went to sleep
supper-less, and with nothing to eat during the next day. The
commissary department of the corps seemed to be unequal
to the occasion, but this fact is not surprising when the
rapidity of the march and desolation of the country are
considered. Nevertheless, on several occasions the writer's
command passed forty hours without receiving any rations,
and once fifty hours, so that we were glad of an opportunity
to beg at any farm-house for an ear of corn with which to
alleviate our hunger.</p>
        <p>All along the line of march large numbers of men were
constantly deserting. Nightly, under cover of darkness,
many would sneak from their bivouacs and go off, not to
the enemy, but to their homes. But those of our men who
remained were in good spirits.</p>
        <pb id="ford4" n="44"/>
        <p>The most influential cause of desertions was the news
that reached the men of the great suffering of their wives
and children at home, caused by the devastations of
Sherman's army. Wherever this army passed from Atlanta to
Savannah, and from Savannah through Columbia, Camden,
and Cheraw, into North Carolina, a tract of country 30 miles
wide was devastated. Farm-houses, barns, mills, etc., were
all burned. Farm animals, poultry, etc<corr>.</corr>, were all ruthlessly
killed, and the women and children left to starve. This was
most especially the case in South Carolina, where Sherman
burned every town in his path—Walterboro, Barnwell,
Midway, Bamberg, Blackville, Williston, Orangeburg,
Columbia, Camden, and Cheraw. His cavalry leader, General
Kilpatrick, attempted to burn Aiken, but was quickly beaten
off by General Wheeler. When the men learned of the
suffering of their women at home, many of them not
unnaturally deserted, and went to their aid.</p>
        <p>This terrible strain on the integrity of the men was the
cause of a pitiable execution that took place on the line of
march one day. A sergeant in the First Regiment Regulars,
upon being reproved by his lieutenant for justifying and
advising the desertion of the men, in a fit of temper
attempted to shoot this officer. The line was immediately
halted, the man was carried before a drum-head court
martial, tried, and condemned to be shot on the spot. He
was led out, tied with his back against a tree,
<pb id="ford45" n="45"/>
and shot to death. It was an awful sight. I recollect that
while awaiting death, the chaplain spoke to him, and offered
to pray with him. His only reply was, “Preacher, I never
listened to you in Fort Sumter, and I won't listen to you
now.”</p>
        <p>All of the Confederate troops in South Carolina were
under the command of Lieut.-Gen. T. J. Hardee, one of the
ablest corps commanders in the Confederate service. He
was nicknamed by the men, “Old Reliable.” Our battalion,
known also as the Eighteenth, with Major Bonneau's
Georgia battalion, the battalion of Citadel Cadets, and the
Second Regiment South Carolina Heavy Artillery
constituted Brig.-Gen. Stephen Elliott's brigade, which, with
Col. Alfred Rhett's brigade, constituted Maj.-Gen.
Taliaferro's division. About March 1 we reached Cheraw,
which we left two days after. As we left the town Sherman's
army pressed us closely, and my recollection is that there
was a sharp cavalry skirmish at the bridge, which we burned
as soon as our troops had got across. I think Gen. M. C.
Butler was the last man to cross, and galloped across it
while it was actually in flames. At the State line the Citadel
Cadets left us, and returned to South Carolina.</p>
        <p>The route of the army lay through Fayetteville, N. C.,
where we crossed the Cape Fear River about a week later.
After our men had crossed the bridge I was detailed from
my company as one of a number to guard it, until all the
wagons, etc., and the last
<pb id="ford46" n="46"/>
of the cavalry had got across and it was burned, and when
the bridge had been burned, one of the cavalrymen let me
ride a led horse until I caught up with my command some
distance in front. I remember his telling me of a very
remarkable scrimmage that had just occurred on the other
side in Fayetteville. It seems that before all of our wagons
had got across the bridge, and our own cavalry had
come up, a troop of about 70 Federal cavalry rode into the
town to cut our wagons, etc., off from the bridge. General
Hampton, with two of his staff officers and four couriers, in
all only seven men, instantly dashed themselves against the
Federals, and in a hand-to-hand fight killed eleven of them,
captured as many more, and ran the rest out of town, and all
without the loss of a single man. A very remarkable affair. I
also heard that Hampton had caught a spy, who would be
hanged when the army halted. I never heard anything more
about it, as I had other things much more personal to engage
my attention, and presumed he was strung up according to
military usage.</p>
        <p>But it seems that the man was not hanged. Wells,
in “Hampton and His Cavalry in '64,” gives the particulars of
this wonderful affair, and states that the spy's name was
David Day, and that he was turned over to some junior
reserves for safe keeping and escaped. And there was an
interesting sequel.</p>
        <p>Thirty-one years after this fight, Hampton then being
United States Railway Commissioner, and in
<pb id="ford47" n="47"/>
Denver, Colorado, a stranger called upon him and explained
that he was the David Day, the spy captured
in the affair, dressed in Confederate uniform. Hampton
congratulated him and said he was “glad the hanging did not
come off.” “So am I,” replied the other, laughing.</p>
        <p>At Fayetteville a few of the men of our company,
I among them, procured Enfield rifles in place of the old
Belgians we had, and also got ammunition to suit. The
Enfield was a muzzle loader, but really one of the best guns
of the day of its kind, and fairly accurate at 600 yards.
About half of the company, however, had only the
worthless Belgians to the end.</p>
        <p>We were now so closely pursued by Sherman that on
March 16 General Hardee, having about 6,000 men,
determined to make a stand near Averysboro,
between the Cape Fear and Black Rivers, where at
daylight Taliaferro's division was attacked full in front by
the Fourteenth and Twentieth Corps
of the Federal Army, and Kilpatrick's cavalry, altogether
about 20,000 men, General Sherman being personally on the
field. The fighting was stubborn, at very close quarters,
along the entire line. Twenty men, of whom I was one, were
detailed from Elliott's brigade and attached to the left of
Colonel Butler's First Regular Infantry, of Rhett's brigade,
and there I served through the fight. We held our position
in the open woods without protection for about three
hours, and repulsed repeated assaults, until
<sic corr="48">
<pb id="ford48" n="4"/>
</sic>
the left of the line, resting on a swamp along the Black River,
which had been thought to be impassable, was turned by a
heavy force of Federals, which had made their way through
the swamp. This force, I afterwards learned, was Colonel
Jones's regiment of Indiana cavalry, fighting as infantry, and
armed with Spencer magazine carbines. Our whole force
then fell back about 400 yards to a line of breastworks
manned by McLaws's skeleton division, and which the
Federals later in the day unsuccessfully assaulted. The
Confederate loss in this battle was 500, and the next day
some of Kilpatrick's cavalrymen, who had just been
captured, told me that the Federal loss had been about
2,500. The Confederate forces engaged in this fight were
Rhett's and Elliott's brigades, two artillery companies, and
McLaws's division; and it was not the intention of General
Hardee that Taliaferro's division should make such a
stubborn stand-up fight. It was the intention that they
should engage only as skirmishers, bring on the fight, and
then fall back gradually into the breastworks, where the real
fighting was to have been done. But Elliott's and Rhett's
men had previously done only garrison and artillery duty on
the coast, and this was their first experience in infantry
fighting in the open, and they knew no better than to stand
up and fight it out. Sherman in his report to the U. S. War
Department of this affair expressed his surprise at the
tenacity with which our men held their ground.</p>
        <pb id="ford49" n="49"/>
        <p>It was on this occasion that Col. Alfred Rhett was
captured. It seems that a Captain Theo. F. Northrop, of a
regiment of New York cavalry, was scouting with a few men
at early dawn on the morning of the battle, and just in front
of our lines came unexpectedly upon Generals Hampton and
Taliaferro, with a group of aids. He and his men promptly
made themselves invisible, and withdrew, and a few
moments after Colonel Rhett rode up on them. He put his
pistol in Colonel Rhett's face and said, “You must come with
me.” Colonel Rhett replied, “Who the hell are you?” and
drew his pistol to fight. Instantly the men with Captain
Northrop put their carbines to Colonel Rhett's head, and he,
seeing how the case stood, gave up, and was carried to
General Slocum, who sent him to General Sherman's
headquarters. Captain Northrop has stated to me that
Colonel Rhett told him that when first accosted he thought
he was dealing with one of General Wheeler's men, and he
would have shot him for his insolence. And he was always
satisfied that if Colonel Rhett had realized at the very first
that they were the enemy he met, he would have fought and
tried to get away, although he would have probably been
killed in the attempt.</p>
        <p>Captain Northrop took Colonel Rhett's sword and pistol.
The sword was lost some years ago in a railway train, but
he has the pistol still, with Colonel Rhett's name engraved
on it.</p>
        <pb id="ford50" n="50"/>
        <p>The fight took place in a piece of pine forest, and there
were many trees that afforded protection to the men on both
sides. The lines were very close together, so close that I
could at times clearly observe the faces of the Federal
soldiers opposite. At one time I was protected by a good
pine tree and felt quite comfortable as the bullets thwacked
against the other side of it; but within a few feet, to my left,
was an old stump-hole full of dry leaves, and the bullets
striking in those leaves made a terrible racket. I stood the
racket as long as I could, but finally could stand it no
longer, and contrary to common sense abandoned my
friendly tree and stepped a few paces to the right, away from
that noisy stump-hole. There I stood unprotected in the
open, but not many minutes before I was struck full in the
middle of my body and knocked down to a sitting posture.
My blanket was rolled in a tight roll, not over three inches
thick, and being of course on my left shoulder, and across
my body downwards to the right, had saved my life. The
ball had passed through the roll, and striking a button on
my jacket had stopped, and as I dropped it fell down,
flattened out of all shape. I lay on the ground for a few
moments, paralyzed by the blow, and I recollect hearing a
comrade, who received a bullet through the brain only a few
moments afterwards, call out, “Ford's killed.” I gathered
myself back into a sitting posture and replied, “No, I'm not. I
think I'm all right.” But the pain was intense,
<pb id="ford51" n="51"/>
as every boy knows who in a boxing bout gets a lick in “the
short wind.” In a few moments I was back again on my feet,
and resumed my place in line, although suffering
considerable pain and nausea. For some time after I carried
on my body a black and blue spot the size of a dollar.</p>
        <p>I recollect noticing the conspicuous coolness of Maj.
Thos. Huguenin, of the First Infantry. During the hardest of
the fighting he walked slowly immediately behind the line in
which I was, smoking his pipe as calmly as if he had been at
home.</p>
        <p>Here an incident occurred that showed how, under the
most serious condition, with death and imminent danger all
around, a soldier's mind is often diverted by the most trivial
thing. It is a strange phase of the mind which I have heard
old soldiers, who have seen much hard fighting, comment
upon. During the sharpest of the fighting, a hog started
from the swamp on my left and ran squealing and terrified
directly down the front of our line, presenting quite a
ludicrous spectacle, and I heard a number of men, as he
passed along the line, whoop at him and call out, “Go it,
piggy!” “Save your bacon, piggy!” etc. But piggy had not
got more than a hundred feet past me when he turned a
somersault, kicked a moment or two, and lay still. He had
evidently stopped a bullet.</p>
        <p>An incident showing the same phase of mind was told
me by a member of the Fourteenth South Carolina
Volunteers, as occurring during the great
<pb id="ford52" n="52"/>
battle of Gettysburg. As Kershaw's brigade, on the second
day, was advancing to the assault of Little Round Top, a
company of the Fourteenth was among those thrown
forward as skirmishers, and as they advanced across the
field toward the Federals, they came to a large patch of ripe
blackberries. The men with one accord immediately turned
their attention to the ripe fruit which was in great abundance
on every side, and, stooping down, kept picking, and eating
berries, as they went slowly forward, actually into action.
And so much was their attention distracted by the
blackberries that they were actually within 50 yards of the
enemy's advanced line before they realized their position,
when they rushed forward with a yell, and got possession of
a slightly elevated roadway, which they held until the main
line came up.</p>
        <p>During the assault on the breastworks, Capt. S. Porcher
Smith, who was standing just behind me, was shot through
the face and fell. The litter-bearers picked him up, and as
they were carrying him to the rear, one of them was shot and
fell, and Captain Smith rolled headlong out of the litter. I
well remember this incident.</p>
        <p>We held our position until about midnight, when we fell
back to a place called Elevation. This night's march was a
very trying one. The road was terribly cut up by the
wagons and artillery, and as the rains had been frequent it
seemed as if the clay mud was knee deep. We floundered
<pb id="ford53" n="53"/>
along for about six hours, and at daylight on the 17th halted
and were given some rations. Most of us had not had a
morsel of food since the night of the 15th. It happened in
this way. On the night of the 15th we cooked our cornmeal
and bacon and ate our supper, saving half for the next day.
At the early break of day on the 16th, as I was warming my
bacon and corn pone in a frying-pan before eating some of
it, the Federals attacked us, and we had to fall into line
instantly. So I had to leave the frying-pan with all my food
as it was on the fire and go through that day's hardship, and
until the next day at Elevation, without any food whatever.
It had been General Hardee's intention to give us two or
three days' rest at Elevation, but it having been ascertained
that the Federal army was pushing toward Goldsboro, Gen.
Jos. E. Johnston, then only recently put in command of the
Confederate troops in North Carolina, ordered General
Hardee to hurry forward and intercept Sherman near
Bentonville. So about 3 o'clock on the morning of the 19th
we were aroused and hurried on toward Bentonville, where
we arrived a little before three in the afternoon, having made
the 20 miles in rather less than 12 hours.</p>
        <p>It was on the march this day that an amusing incident
occurred. I had not owned a pair of socks since I left James
Island a month before, and my shoes were in such tattered
condition that I could keep uppers and soles together only
by tying them
<pb id="ford54" n="54"/>
with several leather strings, but most of my toes stuck out
very conspicuously. I had read of the importance that great
generals attached to the good condition of infantry soldiers'
feet, and hence the aphorism, “A marching man is no
stronger than his feet,” and I determined to keep mine in
good condition if possible. I knew that frequent bathing
prevented blistering; therefore, every night before going to
sleep, and often on the march during the day I would bathe
my feet, so that they were never blistered, and I kept well up
with my company in marching. On this day as we crossed a
little stream, according to my custom I stepped aside, and
pulling off my shoes soaked my feet in the running water.
General Hardee and his staff rode by at the moment. He
checked his horse and called sternly to me, “You there, sir!
What are you doing straggling from your command? I
suppose you are one of those men who behaved so badly at
Averysboro.” (A few men had been guilty of misconduct
there.) I sprang to my feet, and saluting him said, “Excuse
me, General, but you are speaking to the wrong man, sir. I
have never misbehaved, and never straggled. I am only
bathing my feet to prevent them from blistering. There is my
company right ahead there, sir, and I always keep up with
it.” My injured tone and evident sincerity struck the old
man, and he saluted me with the words, “I beg your pardon,
sir,” and rode on. He was a courtly and knightly soldier, and
a great favorite with the men.</p>
        <pb id="ford55" n="55"/>
        <p>We reached Bentonville at about 3 o'clock p. m., only a
short time after the battle had begun, and as we marched
hurriedly along the road in the direction of the firing we
passed a number of wounded men coming to the rear; and
then several operating tables on both sides of the road,
some with wounded men stretched on them with the
surgeons at work, and all of them with several bloody
amputated legs and arms thrown alongside on the grass.
The sight was temporarily depressing, as it foreshadowed
what we had to expect. But we hurried on, and our division
halted for a few moments on the ground from which the
Federals had just been repulsed, and there were quite a
number of their dead and wounded lying about. One of the
Federal wounded, a lieutenant, begged us for some water,
and I stepped from the line and gave him a drink from my
canteen. Others begged me likewise, and in a few moments
my canteen was empty. I knew that this might result
seriously to me, in case I should need the water badly for
myself, but I could not refuse a wounded man's appeal even
if he was my enemy; and one of our men, a thrifty fellow,
who always managed to have things, produced a little flask
of whiskey, and gave a good drink to a Federal who had his
leg badly crushed. The blue-coat raised his eyes to Heaven
with, “Thank God, Johnnie; it may come around that I may
be able to do you a kindness, and I'll never forget this drink
of liquor.” We were not allowed to remain
<pb id="ford56" n="56"/>
long relieving the suffering, but soon were called to
“attention,” and received orders to create it, by an
attack upon the enemy from our extreme right. At this
moment Maj. A. Burnett Rhett, of the artillery, rode along
the line and called out that news had been received that
France had recognized the Confederacy and would send
warships to open our ports immediately. The men cheered,
few of us realizing that the end was so near. We were
blinded by our patriotism. There was Lee with his 30,000
men that moment surrounded by Grant with his 150,000.
Here was Johnston with his 14,000 trying to keep at bay
Sherman with his 70,000, with the knowledge that Schofield
was only two days off with 40,000 more. And this was about
all there was to the Confederacy; and they talked of
recognition! Oh, the pity of it!</p>
        <p>As we stood in line ready to advance my next comrade
remarked, “Well, boys, one out of every three of us will
drop to-day. I wonder who it will be?” This had been about
our proportion in our two previous infantry engagements,
and it was not far short of the same here, for out of the
twenty-one men the company carried into the fight five were
left on the field. At the word the line advanced through a
very thick black jack-oak woods full of briars, and then
double-quicked. We ran right over the Federal picket line
and captured or shot every one of the pickets. One picket
was in the act of eating his dinner, and as we ran upon him he
<pb id="ford57" n="57"/>
dropped his tin bucket, which, strange to say, had
rice and peas boiled together. Our lieutenant
grabbed it up, and carried it, with the spoon still in the
porridge, in his left hand in the charge. We went through
the bushes yelling and at a run until we struck a worm rail
fence on the edge of an old field. I sprang up on the fence
to get over, but when on top could see no enemy, and so
called out to the men, a number of whom were likewise
immediately on the fence. Just at this moment the officers
called to us to come back , as a mistake had been made. Our
division had not gone far enough
to our right. The line was again formed in the thick bushes,
and we went about two hundred yards or so farther to the
right, and during this movement the lieutenant ate the
captured porridge, and gave me the empty tin bucket and
spoon. I attached the bucket to my waist belt, and kept it for
about a month, when in an amusing encounter with Gen.
Sam Cooper, of which I will tell farther on, it got crushed.
The spoon I have kept to the present time.</p>
        <p>Our line was soon again halted just on the inside edge of
the dense woods, and concealed by the brush,
and I could see on the other side of the field, about 300
yards distant, twelve pieces of artillery glistening
in the sun, and behind them a dense mass of blue
infantry evidently expecting our attack, and ready for us.</p>
        <p>As we stood there for a few minutes and saw the work
cut out for us, one of our men, one of the few
<pb id="ford58" n="58"/>
who had been of age in 1860, said in a plaintive tone, “If the
Lord will only see me safe through this job, I'll register an
oath never to vote for secession again as long as I live.”</p>
        <p>At the word “forward” our brigade left the cover of the
woods at the double-quick, and the men reopened with their
yells.</p>
        <p>As all veterans of the great war know, in a charge the
Confederates did not preserve their alignment, as the
Federals did. They usually went at a run, every man more or
less for himself. There was also an inexplicable difference
between the battle cries of the Federal and Confederate
soldiers. In the assaults of the Federals the cries were
regular, like “Hurrah! Hurrah! Hurrah!” simply cheers,
lacking stirring life. But the Confederate cries were yells of
an intensely nervous description; every man for himself
yelling “Yai, Yai, Yi, Yai, Yi!” They were simply fierce shrieks
made from each man's throat individually, and which cannot
be described, and cannot be reproduced except under the
excitement of an assault in actual battle. I do not know any
reason for this marked difference unless it was in the more
pronounced individuality of the average Confederate
soldier.</p>
        <p>As soon as our line charged out into the open field the
Federal artillery opened on us with grape shot, and the
infantry with their rifles. My eyes were in a moment filled
with sand dashed up by the grape which struck around. I
wiped them with
<pb id="ford59" n="59"/>
my hand, and keeping them closed as much as I could, kept
on at a run until I suddenly realized that I was practically
alone. When I looked back I saw that the brigade, after
getting about half way across the field, had stopped and
was in confusion. In a moment it broke and went back in a
clear panic. It is needless to say I followed. Our line was
reformed in the woods, and I am glad to say of my own
company, and I think Captain Matthews's, they both rallied
at the word to a man. Every man was in place except those
who had fallen. This was more than could be said for some
of the other commands of the brigade, some of whose men
never rallied, but went straight on home from the field, and
were never heard of again.</p>
        <p>Our line was again moved forward to the position from
which we had first driven the Federal pickets, and our
company was sent to the edge of the woods from which we
had made the last charge, and deployed as pickets, two men
at each post. It was now about dark, and, while the Federal
infantry had ceased firing, the wretched pieces of artillery
never let up on us and kept throwing grape shot, and
occasional shells into the woods where they knew we were,
making a terrible racket through the tree-tops, tearing off
branches, etc. At about eight o'clock that night our
lieutenant came running along the line calling for “Ford.”
As soon as he came to my post he told me that he had
brought another man to take my place and that I was relieved,
<pb id="ford60" n="60"/>
and at 12 o'clock must go directly to the rear and get
some rations that were expected, and cook them for the
company. I begged to be let off, but it was no go. He said he
knew I could cook, and must go. So I laid down where I was,
with instructions to my comrade to awake me at 12 o'clock,
and in an instant was sound asleep, oblivious to the shells,
etc., that the enemy kept meanly crashing through the trees
and brush, and worse still to the groans and cries of the
wounded that still lay in the field in front where they had
fallen. After dark the occasional screams of some wounded
horses lying in our rear were particularly distressing. Early
in the afternoon Halsey's battery of flying artillery, attached
to Hampton's cavalry, had held a gap in the line, until the
arrival of our division, and in advancing I saw probably a
dozen horses lying dead or wounded where the battery had
been. To this day I recall the piteous expressions of two or
three of these wounded horses, as they raised their heads in
their suffering and looked at us as we passed between them.
They were perfectly quiet, but it was only after dark that in
their loneliness they uttered any sounds.</p>
        <p>About midnight our picket line was withdrawn and the
whole division moved off in Egyptian darkness somewhere,
I never did know exactly where, or really care either, for at
that moment I was suffering from fever which afterwards
developed into a serious illness. At daylight in a cold rain
<pb id="ford61" n="61"/>
we halted somewhere in the woods on the edge of another
field, and threw up breastworks, as we were threatened with
an attack, which, however, was not made. On the afternoon
of the 21st we were hurriedly ordered to hasten across to
the extreme left of Johnston's army to support the troops
there who were severely pressed by the Federals. I was now
so sick that I was ordered to the rear, but begged off, and a
comrade offered to carry my gun for me, so I kept up. When
we reached the place our line was formed with our company
on the extreme left resting on the edge of Mill Creek. I was
really so ill that I could not stand in line for any length of
time, and requested permission of my lieutenant to lie down
in ranks, so as to be in place when the assault came. He
ordered me to the rear, but I succeeded in begging off
again, and lay down in line. I was asleep instantly. The next
thing I knew I was being dragged by the feet, and heard
some one say, “What are you going to do with that dead
man?” “Going to throw him in the creek,” was the reply. I
opened my eyes and said, “I am not dead, but only sick.
What is the matter? Where are our men?” Looking around I
saw that it was early dawn, and the place was deserted
except by two of our cavalry videttes, one of whom said, “If
you have life enough left you had better skedaddle, for the
Yanks will be here in five minutes.
<pb id="ford62" n="62"/>
We are the last of the cavalry.” I picked myself up, and got
across Mill Creek bridge just as the Federal troops began to
appear.</p>
        <p>I believe I was the last infantryman to get across it, and it
was the only bridge across the creek. As I went across I
noticed a lot of Wheeler's cavalry on the north bank of the
creek, evidently to hold the bridge, and I could see the
Federals in the distance, just on the top of the hill on the
south side. I suspected what was coming, and, as I had
received no invitation to an early morning entertainment,
kept on my way. The road on the north side of the bridge
inclined sharply to the left, so I was soon out of the line of
fire, but heard the scrimmage as the Federals assaulted
Wheeler's men and endeavored to capture the bridge. They
were repulsed, but not before three of their color-bearers
had fallen within fifty feet of the Confederate line.</p>
        <p>It seemed that Johnston's army had retreated during the
night, and in the darkness my comrades had overlooked me
asleep on the ground. At about noon I caught up with my
command where it had halted about two miles from the
creek. In this battle of Bentonville, Johnston with only 14,100
men, all told, fought Sherman with about 40,000 the first day,
and 70,000 the second. The Confederate losses were 2,400
and the Federal 4,000.</p>
        <p>I had become so ill now that I could hold out no longer,
and reported to the surgeon, and at eight o'clock on the
morning of the 23rd was driven in
<pb id="ford63" n="63"/>
an ambulance to a railway station and put with a lot of sick
and wounded men on a train for Greensboro. I had had
nothing to eat since about noon the day before, and when
we got to Raleigh I got off and went to a near-by little
cottage, where I saw a woman at the door, and told her that I
was really very sick, and very hungry, and begged her for
something to eat. I had not a cent of money. She told me
pathetically that she had fed nearly all she had to the
soldiers, but had a potato pie, and if I could eat that I would
be welcome to it. I took it gratefully and it was the nicest
potato pie I ever saw, before or since. We reached
Greensboro at dark, making about 90 miles run in ten hours,
very good for the speed of railway trains at that time. At
Greensboro the court-house was used as the hospital, all the
benches, desks, etc., being removed. We had no mattresses
nor bedding of any kind, and about 200 of us were laid off in
rows on the floor, with only our own blankets that we
brought with us. After looking over the accommodations I
selected the platform inside of the rail, where the judge's
desk used to be, for my place, and went out into the street
and begged an armful of hay from a wagon, and with two
bricks for a pillow made my bed. Here I lay for about three
weeks with fever, and at times really very ill. Three times a
day the ladies of the town came and brought us food, and
were devoted in their attentions. I got to be very weak, and
on April 14th I told the surgeon
<pb id="ford64" n="64"/>
that I was certainly getting worse, and believed I would die
if I stayed where I was. His cold reply was, “I believe you
will.” I then asked to be allowed to go home. He said, “You
will die before you have been out of the hospital twenty-four
hours,” to which I replied, “It is all the same with me. I
would as lieve die in the bushes as here. Only let me make
the attempt.” Thereupon he gave me my furlough, and at
daylight the next morning I put my blanket around me and
walked right out into a drizzly rain. The railroad was torn up
between Greensboro and Salisbury, so I walked along the
track, and the next day reached High Point, and at that place
met one of my comrades, who was in the hospital there. He
smuggled me in and gave me a night's lodging under his
blanket, and shared his scanty supper with me. The next day
I struck out again, and after three or four more days walking
reached Salisbury, about thirty miles farther, where I again
found another comrade in the hospital at that place. With
the exception of the night I had spent at High Point, it was
my habit, when night overtook me, to step aside into the
bushes and sleep until morning. What food I got was only
what I begged at the farmhouses on the way.</p>
        <p>At the Yadkin River I found that the bridge had not been
burned. It seems that the Federal General Stoneman had
been raiding that section of country and had attempted to
burn this bridge, but had been driven off by a Confederate
force under General
<pb id="ford65" n="65"/>
Pettus, and some cavalry. Just as I approached it, President
Jefferson Davis, with quite a party, came riding by. He was
sitting gracefully erect on his horse, and courteously
returned our salutes. This was the one occasion on which I
saw the President.</p>
        <p>We were quite a large number of men along the roadside,
and one of the President's party, a captain, rode up to my
group and asked if we were willing to go on across the
Mississippi and continue the war there? Many of us, I
among them, volunteered to go, but we heard nothing more
of it. It seems that this really was Mr. Davis's plan, and he
was so much set on it, that as late as April 25 he suggested
to General Johnston that instead of surrendering to General
Sherman, he should disband his infantry, with instructions
to them to rendezvous at some appointed place across the
Mississippi, and to bring off his cavalry and all his horses
and light pieces of artillery. As is well known, General
Johnston fully realized the absolute hopelessness of the
struggle and deliberately disobeyed his instructions, and
surrendered to General Sherman the next day. When one
looks back upon the condition of things then as they must
have been known to the highest Confederate authorities, it
seems almost incredible that such an impracticable idea as
continuing the war across the Mississippi could have been
entertained for a moment.</p>
        <p>At Salisbury a comrade, who had been also for three
years my messmate and chum, joined me, and we traveled
from there as far as Chester, S. C.,
<pb id="ford66" n="66"/>
where our ways parted. Strange to say, it seemed to me that
I began to improve from the moment I left the hospital. I had
a strong fever on me, but was bent on getting home. At
Salisbury an amusing event occurred. This was about April
19. Lee's army had been surrendered ten days before, and
the first lot of his men, probably 300 or so, now came along,
and learning that there was a Confederate storehouse here
with supplies of food and clothing, determined to help
themselves. I joined the crowd to get my share. The
warehouse was guarded by about a dozen boys of the home
guard, who protested violently; but they were just swept
one side, and the door was broken open, and every man
helped himself to what he wanted or needed. I got a handful
of Confederate money, a pair of shoes, some flour and
bacon, a pair of socks, and a small roll of jeans. This roll of
cloth I carried clear home across my shoulders, and when I
reached Aiken, in May, exchanged it with the baker for one
hundred bread tickets, which provided our family with bread
for the rest of the summer.</p>
        <p>The railway for a short distance from Salisbury was
intact, and here we discovered an engine and two box-cars
waiting for President Davis and the Confederate Cabinet.
The crowd of soldiers determined to seize this train, and we
told the engineer that he must either carry us as far as he
could, and then come back for the President, or we would
put him off and take the train ourselves. He yielded to force,
and carried us about 20 miles. We then got
<pb id="ford67" n="67"/>
off, and he went back. This led to an amusing experience a
couple of days later. There was another section of torn-up
track, and then another place where another engine and one
box-car were in waiting again for the President and Cabinet.
The crowd had dwindled down very much now, so
comparatively only a few of us were on hand. These, I
among them, at once clambered up on top of the car, and sat
there. Presently I saw Gen. Sam Cooper approaching with a
squad of about a dozen boys, home guards as they were
called. He halted them within a dozen paces of the car, and
then gave the orders, “ready, aim,” and we had a dozen old
muskets pointed at us. Then shaking his finger at us he said,
“You scoundrels, you are the men who stole that train day
before yesterday. If you do not drop off that car I'll blow
you to hell.” We dropped. In jumping down, my tin bucket,
captured at Bentonville, was crushed against the side of the
car. The spoon was in my haversack, and I have it still—1904.
I thought to myself, however, “Old cock, I'll get even with
you. I have a scheme you don't know about.” Going off a
few steps I said to my chum, “Just let's wait here until the
Cabinet arrives. I bet that we two at least will get back on
that car.” We lounged around for an hour or two, and
presently the wagons appeared with the Cabinet. I knew that
Mrs. Geo. A. Trenholm, the wife of the Confederate
Secretary of the Treasury, was along, and being a
Charlestonian, who knew my family, I felt sure that when I
made myself known she would
<pb id="ford68" n="68"/>
help me. True enough, as soon as I made myself known to
her she spoke to General Cooper, and four of us were given
permission to ride on top of the car, one at each corner, with
our legs dangling over, for the top of the car in the middle
was smashed in. Mrs. Trenholm also kindly gave me a half
loaf of bread and the half of a chicken.</p>
        <p>We jolted along in this way over the good section of the
road, until we came to the next break, when we got off, and
after tendering our thanks plodded along on foot again.</p>
        <p>Gen. Sam'l S. Cooper was Adjutant-General of the
Confederate Army, and the senior in rank of Gen. Robert E.
Lee, and was a Pennsylvanian. He ranked Lee in the
Confederate service; and in the Federal Army before the
war he also ranked the great Confederate commander, he
having been Adjutant-General of the United States Army.</p>
        <p>At Chester I parted with my companions, as our routes
diverged. I walked from that town to Newberry, where I met
one of my comrades, whose family lived there. He took me
to his house, and I stayed there two days. Upon my
departure he saw that my haversack was well filled with
provisions.</p>
        <p>The railway was intact from Newberry to Abbeville, so I
got a lift that far.</p>
        <p>While making my way through the country I was always
treated with much hospitality by all the people along my
route. There was only one exception. This was in Chester
County, when one day, with my haversack empty, and
hunger calling impatiently,
<pb id="ford69" n="69"/>
I stopped at a farm-house and asked for some food,
offering to pay for it. The respectable-looking man whom I
addressed asked me what kind of money I had. I said, “Only
Confederate money.” He replied, “I won't take anything
except gold or silver and have no food to give away,” and
shut the door in my face. I inquired of some negroes, as I
walked off, and was told he was a very well-to-do man, and a
preacher!</p>
        <p>In striking contrast was the treatment by a poor farmer's
wife the same day. I stopped at a small farm-house by the
roadside, and in response to my call a woman opened the
house door, and looking out cautiously asked who I was. I
replied, “I am a Confederate soldier trying to get home. I am
sick, and want something to eat.” She called out, “You got
smallpox?” “No,” I said. Again she asked, “You got the
measles?” “No, I've got only fever, and only want to rest;
and if you have anything to spare, something to eat.” She
then told me to come into the house, and showing me into
the back porch, spread a comfort on the floor with a pillow,
and said, “My husband got back from the army just
yesterday, and went to town this morning. I am sorry, but
there's not a scrap of meat in the house, only some veal
which he killed this morning. Now you just lie down and
take a rest while I cook you some veal, and corn bread.” I
laid down, and was soon asleep. After a while the good
woman aroused me, and led the way to the table, where she
had prepared some veal chops and corn bread for me, which
I ate
<pb id="ford70" n="70"/>
with relish. She refused to receive any pay, as she
said she “could not receive pay from a soldier.”
So giving her my warm thanks I resumed my route
toward Newberry.</p>
        <p>At Abbeville I went into a drug store and invested
$30 in a toothbrush.</p>
        <p>I had chosen this route to avoid the section devastated
by Sherman. From Abbeville my route lay
through Washington and Augusta, Ga., to Aiken,
where my family were, and which I reached early
in May. When passing through Augusta I went to
the quartermaster's department and drew my pay,
amounting to $156. This was the first pay I had
received for a year, and of course it was absolutely
worthless, but upon my arrival at Aiken I found a
man who accepted $50 of it for a bottle of very
crude corn whiskey. The remainder of this pay is
still in my desk.</p>
        <p>On April 26, 1865, General Johnston's army was
surrendered to General Sherman near Durham Station,
N. C., thus putting an end to the war within
the limits of their respective commands. At that
time General Johnston had 26,000 men on his roll,
as many of the remnants of the Army of the Tennessee
and others from Wilmington had joined his
command. Of these, 2,000 had no arms of any kind.
General Sherman had 110,000 men effective. Johnston's
army had consumed their last rations when
it was surrendered, and General Sherman, when
informed of its condition, ordered 250,000 rations
immediately distributed, or about ten days' rations
<pb id="ford71" n="71"/>
to each Confederate soldier. General Johnston in
his “Narrative” says that if this had not been done
great suffering would have ensued.</p>
        <p>The great war was at an end, and the following
figures show the fearful odds we fought against.</p>
        <p>During the four years the United States put about
3,000,000 men in the field, of whom 720,000 were
foreigners. They lost in killed, in battle, and from
disease, 366,000, or about 12 per cent.</p>
        <p>The Confederate States had only about 625,000
men, all told, from first to last. Of these there were
killed in battle, and died from disease, 349,000, or
about 56 per cent.</p>
        <p>At the close the United States had 1,050,000
men in active service, and the Confederate States
139,000. We were fighting odds of over 7 to 1.</p>
        <p>The day after my arrival at home the first Federal
troops arrived from Charleston to garrison the town
of Aiken. They were a company of negroes, commanded
by a German captain, who spoke very broken
English. I soon learned that it was a part of the
force that had assaulted us on James Island and
from the officers I heard their side of the affair.
This was the beginning of that era of reconstruction
which, for eleven years, was a course of negro domination,
corruption, robbery, and outrages; and
which steadily increased in intensity until in 1876
it was overthrown by the general uprising of the
white people. But this is another subject.</p>

            <p>“An African Morgan—a citizen whose name we shall not
mention, although many readers know and will recognize
the case—was surprised some days ago by the entrance of a
good servant, who was supposed to be, if living at all, in
Yankee hands at Knoxville. This servant went cheerfully, of
course, or he would not have been sent, to wait on ‘Young
Massa,’ who is under Brigadier-General Jenkins, in
Longstreet's corps.</p>
            <p>“In the retreat from Knoxville, 
he was accidentally
wounded, and necessarily left behind.</p>
            <p>“When taken 
to Knoxville, he was questioned by General
Foster, well known for his connection as engineer with Fort
Sumter, which has done more than he desired or expected
for the defense of Charleston.</p>
            <p>“Being asked his 
master's name, the man replied, when
General Foster condescendingly said: ‘Oh, yes; I knew him
when I was at Sumter. You know that you are now free and
have no master.’ We

<p>Marion Johnstone Porcher</p>
</figure>
<pb id="ford73" n="73"/>need not report the further conversation, or the
conduct of the servant. Suffice it to say he did not—like
some of our gossiping friends in uniform—talk to
everybody about his intention, but at the first
promising opportunity he took French leave of Yankee
friends and freedom in Knoxville, and not knowing
then where to find or reach his ‘Young Master,’ he
struck, according to his best information, for the ‘Old
Master’ and the ‘home place.’</p>
            <p>“He was compelled to walk over one hundred and
fifty miles, and in great part over the route travelled
lately by General Morgan, and succeeded in reaching
a railroad, which gave him a lift toward this city.</p>
            <p>“We would have more such cases if opportunities
could be found.”</p>

          <p>This Kent was not of blood royal, as his name
might indicate; he came of a dusky African brood, but
his loyalty and faithfulness would have done credit to
any race. How he got his name I do not know, but it
was a relief to the ear after those his mother had
chosen for his brothers—“Cully” and “Hackless.”
Whether the latter was intended for Hercules, neither
Martha, their mother, nor any one else knew.</p>
          <p>Kent was the flower of his flock as regarded his
appearance, being tall and slender, with shiny black
skin and unusually high features for a negro. He
seemed to justify his mother's boast that she was
<pb id="ford74" n="74"/>
“no low-blooded negro, but was of a good family in Africa.”
And she really had some foundation for this unusual pride
among her race, for our grandmother, who died at a great
age many years ago, was fond of telling among the
incidents of her childhood, that once when a shipload of
Africans was brought to her native city for sale, her
husband went to purchase some for his plantation, and
among several he brought back “Katura,” Martha's
ancestress. After the usual process of shutting them up
until they could be induced to wear clothes, she, with the
others, was sent up to the plantation. When they arrived there
and began to mingle with the other negroes, one of those
that had been bought some time before, at the sight of
“Katura,” rushed forward and prostrated herself at her feet
with every mark of affection and respect. She could speak
English and explained to the astonished onlookers that this
was a princess in her country, who had been sold by her
uncle to the slave-traders. It seemed a barbaric romance.
Katura, however, took kindly to civilization, and soon settled
herself in her new position with no undue repining. In time
she was comforted by a partner, and brought into the world
numerous progeny, who were noted for their integrity and
fidelity unto the fifth generation, which brings us to that of
Kent.</p>
          <p>When the great war broke out, and all the men and
youths were joining the army, our hearts were heavy,
and we felt full of sad forebodings at Otranto, our
<pb id="ford75" n="75"/>
country home, where parting and sorrow had never come.
We were a large band of girls, with one young brother, the
idol of our hearts, and the apple of our parents' eyes. Like
everybody in those days, we were very patriotic, but when it
dawned upon us that Harry must shoulder his rifle and go
to Virginia we felt that love of country cost us dear. Harry
completed his sixteenth year the April after the secession
of South Carolina, and as there was no doubt that his
college days were over, as he would not study, we were not
surprised when the day after his birthday, he galloped up
the avenue, dashed into the room where we were sitting,
upsetting a chair, and exclaimed:</p>
          <p>“How soon can you get me ready, girls? I joined the
Hampton Legion this morning, and we are off to Virginia,
—Hurrah!”</p>
          <p>“Hush, Harry!” exclaimed our eldest sister; “pick up
that chair; don't you see mother is faint?”</p>
          <p>“No, it is past,” murmured our mother, trying to smile,
as we all turned to her. “God bless and keep you, my boy. I
expected you to enlist; you could not do otherwise, and
now,” stifling a sigh, “I must think of your outfit, and you
must take a servant too. I wonder which will be best.”</p>
          <p>“A private with a servant seems an anomaly,”
laughingly said Harry. “But I believe several of the boys
have men, and anything to ease your mind, mother dear.”
<pb id="ford76" n="76"/>
“Our minds must learn to do without ease, as well as our
bodies, I fear, in the days that lie before us,” she answered,
stroking his curly head as he knelt by her chair; “but we
must act, and not think now.”</p>
          <p>The days that followed were busy ones. The difficulty
was not what was needed, but what could be carried. It was
an exciting novelty to pack a knapsack, and its small
capacity was a constant check to our zeal. Harry's constant
reminder, “I will have to march with that on my back,
nobody knows how far,” brought a pang to our hearts. It
was decided that he should take a “body-servant”—the
old-fashioned Southern rendering of the French term
“valet.” After much deliberation and, I fear, heart
burning among the servants, for in this, as in other
instances, the post of danger was also that of honor,
Kent was selected, much to his own and his mother's 
gratification.</p>
          <p>The day appointed for the company to which Harry
belonged to join the Legion in Virginia came all too soon.
He shouldered his knapsack, and tore himself from us,
followed by his colored attendant, with whom we all shook
hands and whom we urged to “take care of Mas' Harry.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Missus,” he responded, looking preternaturally
solemn.</p>
          <p>Of course Harry left a great gap behind him, but
we tried to excel each other in efforts at cheerfulness,
and bright prognostications as to his future career as
a soldier. We succeeded only tolerably in these
<pb id="ford77" n="77"/>
laudable efforts, when Martha waddled in—she was our
cook, and a decided character in her way. I believe, next to
our mother, she thought herself of first importance among
the feminine part of the household. She gave a keen glance
at our mother, whom she idolized.</p>
          <p>“Well, Missus,” she said, dropping a little curtsy, “I
come to see how you gettin' on. You all looks pretty blue,
but I 'clare to gracious there's no 'casion to fret. Nuttin'
gwine to hu't Mas' Harry w'en Kent gone to tak' care ov
him. Missus, you dunno how smart dat boy is; an' I jus' tell
him, ‘Mas’ Harry tinks he's a man and a soger, but you
know he ain't nuttin' but a baby, an' a ma-baby at dat.' An' I
jus' tell him he need not to come home if he let anyt'ing
hu't Mas' Harry. So don't you fret, Missus.”</p>
          <p>“But how could Kent prevent Harry's being wounded or
hurt, Martha?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Now, Miss Sallie, don't you go for to talk nonsense,”
responded the old woman. “An' your ma always says w'ere
dere is a will dere is a way. Well, dat's what I tells Kent,
an' I tells Affy, de gal he's courtin', it's no use for she to
fret, fur 'less Kent brings Mas' Harry back safe, dere
won't be no weddin' fur him.”</p>
          <p>“Oh,” I said, “he is courting, is he? That is why he
looked so serious when he left.”</p>
          <p>“It looks so, Missy. He tell me to look sharp at her, an'
see if she notice anybody while he is gone.
<pb id="ford78" n="78"/>
An' I will—an' let her know, too, if she do,” she muttered
as she left the room.</p>
          <p>Harry saw much active service, was in many
battles, and fortunately escaped with only one wound.
He told us in his letters of Kent's faithful following,
and attendance on long marches, and after a battle he
always found him looking anxiously for him, with
something to eat as nice as he could get. Indeed, he was
a wonderful provider, but Harry was by no means sure
that Kent could have made good his claim to many of
the eatables he set before him, for his conscience
was an elastic one as to the rights of property in food.
So long as he got what he wanted for Harry, he
stopped neither to buy, beg nor borrow, but helped
himself. His kindness of heart, ready wit, and
readiness to lend a helping hand to any one in
need made him a general favorite in the company,
where he was noted for the care he took of his young
master.</p>
          <p>The years of the war sped on, and brought
privations and sorrows which each year seemed to
intensify. Our home was no longer the bright place it
used to be, for we had lost many friends, and
self-denial was the order of the day. We were very
busy, too, and that helped to keep us cheerful.</p>
          <p>There were new accomplishments to acquire. We
learned, and taught our maids, to card and spin the
home-grown wool, and when that did not suffice for
the extraordinary demand we had supernumerary wool
mattresses ripped up; the ticking was considered
<pb id="ford79" n="79"/>
to make handsome frocks for the servants, and
the wool when dyed and woven made excellent
homespun suits for ourselves, that were not to be
despised for durability and warmth. There was quite a
rivalry as to who could make the prettiest dyes for our
dresses, but after a time black was most worn. Then
we had our old light kid gloves to ink over carefully, so
that we might not go barehanded to church. We
thought those gloves a great success when we first
dyed them, but when we came to wear them, the ink
never seemed to dry, and would soak through, and
dye our hands most uncomfortably. Our greatest
achievement after all, I think, was the piles of socks
we knitted by the lightwood blaze at night. Our
old-fashioned butler always placed a candle—a tallow
one, or still worse, a home-made myrtle wax one—upon
the table, but we considered it an extravagance to light
it unless there was something urgent to read. I am
surprised now that we did not mind the heat of the
blaze more in summer, but I do not remember our
thinking of it. There was one great spasm of patriotism
when every worsted curtain in the house was cut into
soldiers' shirts. Some of these were of brilliant colors
and patterns, and I cannot but think might have
served as targets for bullets. We even undressed the
piano and converted its cover into a blanket for a
soldier. We were chagrined afterwards to hear from
some of our friends who had done the same thing, that
the latest advice from the field was that the soldiers
<pb id="ford80" n="80"/>
found the garments, so improvised, very unsatisfactory,
and begged the ladies not to sacrifice their belongings so
recklessly.</p>
          <p>There were no plum puddings or mince pies in
those days, according to the accepted recipes, but we
made Confederate fruit cake with dried peaches and
apples instead of raisins and currants, with sorghum
for sugar; and potato pones and puddings were very
frequent, and both dishes had the merit of a little
going a long way, especially after the supply of
ginger gave out.</p>
          <p>We never had any use for the potato, peas, groundnut, or
any sort of mock coffee, but we drank orange leaf, or sage
tea in preference to any other homemade beverage. We
managed to keep a little store of genuine tea for medicine,
and when our mother pronounced any of us ill enough to
need a little coddling, what a treat it was! The invalid never
would consent to partake, unless it was a family tea party.
What enjoyment those occasions gave!</p>
          <p>In the latter part of '63 we were distressed to hear from
Harry that he was ill in the hospital in Tennessee. He
wrote: “I think we are falling back. Kent is ill with
pneumonia, and the worst of it is that if we fall back I have
no means of transportation for him; it will be hard to have
to leave him.”</p>
          <p>Dire was the distress that letter brought us. We waited
anxiously for further news. Harry brought
<pb id="ford81" n="81"/>
it himself. He had been ill, and was sent home on furlough.
He looked worn, and very unlike the bright boy who had
left us.</p>
          <p>“What of Kent?” we asked.</p>
          <p>“I had to leave him,” he said. 
“I could not help it. We
were falling back rapidly. Many were left in the hospitals,
and are now prisoners. It was only through my captain
being such a friend of father's, and stirring himself to get
me a place in an ambulance, that I was not left. I dragged
myself to see the good fellow, although I could scarcely
walk. He was very sick, and distressed to part with me. I
told him the enemy would be in town that night, and he
would be free. He said, ‘Mas' Harry, that is nothing to me;
if you don't see me home, you will know I am dead. Tell
Missus, and Ma, and Affy so.’”</p>
          <p>Martha was given the message, but our conscientious
mother added: “But, Martha, if you do not see him you need
not be sure he is not living; but you must not count too
much on seeing him, for if he gets well he will doubtless be
tempted to stay, and try a new experience.”</p>
          <p>The old woman twirled the corners of her apron, as she
said sadly: “Missus, it is five generations since my fam'ly
come from Africa, and Mausser's from France; we's been
togedder since dat time, an' been fait'ful togedder; for once
w'en times was hard wid Mausser, he mout hab sold us,
but he didn't. He kep' us all togedder, an' you tink Kent
such a
<pb id="ford82" n="82"/>
fool as not to know dat, an' be happy 'mong strangers? He
got to work w'erebber he is, an' nobody gwine to consider
him like you all. No, ma'am, if he alive I'm lookin' for him,
w'atever it seems like to you, ma'am.” And she bobbed her
curtsy and walked off, leaving her mistress feeling quite
small.</p>
          <p>Harry remained with us for some weeks. It was pleasant
to see his enjoyment of home fare, even in its pruned
condition. Everything seemed luxurious after the camp life;
but he did not linger after he was well enough to return to
the army. There still was no news of Kent. Harry refused to
take another servant in his place, although urged to do so.
“No,” he said, “I could not find 
any one to fill Kent's place;
and it is a demoralizing life. I do not know if even he could
stand the restraints of civilization again.”</p>
          <p>Several months passed after Harry's departure, and we
had given up any idea we might have had of hearing any
more of Kent. Martha mourned him as dead, and induced
her preacher to preach his funeral, she and Affy attending
as chief mourners. Affy in a black cotton dress of
Martha's which swallowed her up, and Martha with her
very black face muffled in a square of black alpaca, from
which, as she peered out, her teeth and eyeballs looked
dazzlingly white.</p>
          <p>One freezing night in December, as we were trying to summon
resolution to leave the warm chimney
<pb id="ford83" n="83"/>
corner and go to bed, we were startled by a rap at the door.
Everything was startling in those days. Our father opened
it, and the light fell on a tall figure clad in a United States
uniform, surmounted by Kent's smiling countenance.</p>
          <p>“Why, where do you come from?” we exclaimed.</p>
          <p>“Well, I tole Mas' Harry if de Lord spare my life I'd come
home, an' here I is, sir, and Missus, an' mighty proud,” he
added, as my mother extended her hand to him, and said:</p>
          <p>“You are a faithful fellow. Your mother knew you better
than I did.”</p>
          <p>We soon dismissed our returned wanderer to his
rest. Martha's and Affy's delight may be imagined, and the
speed with which they doffed their mourning was
marvelous. The next morning we were anxious to have
Kent's adventures, which he was pleased to narrate. His
comfortable attire looked very spick and span beside the
faded garments of those around, and his excellent shoes
were a source of undisguised envy to his fellow-servants.</p>
          <p>“Well, Miss Sallie,” he said, when I remarked on his
appearance, “I thought I'd better get myself the best I
could while I was w'ere dey was plenty, as I
could give ole Maussa one nigger less to clothe. You see,
ma'am, w'en Mas' Harry an' our people lef,' I felt pretty bad.
That night, sure'nuf, as Mas' Harry tole me, the Yankees
came booming into town, an' it wasn't long befo' all our
mens, who was in the hospitable, was took prisoners; but
they seemed very kind to
<pb id="ford84" n="84"/>
them. W'ile they was sick they give them everything. It was
a cur'ous t'ing, w'en General Foster come through w'ere I
was, he noticed me, and asked me w'at I was doin' there, an'
I tole him how I had been wid my young Maussa, an' w'en I
tole him w'ere I come from an' Mas' Harry's name, ‘Oh,’ say
he, ‘I know his father well. I was stationed at Fort Moultrie
befo' de war, an' I have eaten many a good dinner at the old
Colonel's.’ I tole him, ‘Yes, sir, Maussa had the bes' of
everything, an' my ma was a splendid cook.’ So then he say:
‘If you come from them you knows your business, an' w'en
you are well, I will take you into my service. You is free
now, you know.’ So they kep' me in the hospitable, an' give
me nice things to make me well,
an' w'en the hospitable discharged me, de General
took me an' was rale kind. I had good greenback
wages and plenty of everything, an' not much to do,
an' rale coffee, as much as I wanted, too; but somehow
I couldn't diskiver to be settled. I had been in
de Soudern army so long, w'en they talked of beatin'
it, it made me oneasy, an' w'en I studied on Mas'
Harry back in de army wid nobody—for I know he
wouldn't take nobody in my place—an' wid not
'nuf of even corn bread an' bacon, widout me to
perwide,” he added, with a grin, “I jest kep' studyin',
but I never said nuttin', an' every day dey tole me
how lucky I was to be free. I jes' made up my
mind, an' I got the General to let me draw all de clo's
I could, an' a overcoat an' shoes an' blankets on my
<pb id="ford85" n="85"/>
wages, an' den I ask him for a month's wages in
advance, an' he seem a little surprised, but he was
very kind, an' he give it to me; so w'en I got everything
I could, one night I waited on the General fust
rate, w'en he was goin' to bed, an' fixed everything
very nice, an' he said I was a rale good servant an' a
treasure of a boy; but I jest took my things an'
watched my chance, an' jest slipped off in the dark,
an' dodged about until I got out of their lines an'
into our'n. I had to walk a hundred miles befo' I
got to our regiment. An', Mis', they jest gave me
three cheers w'en I tole them how I come back; an'
I took de liberty to bring a bottle of whiskey, an' I
treated Mas' Harry's ole mess. Dey tole me he had
jine another regiment. I had to walk a good piece
more to de cyars; but one of our officers give me a
letter to the conductors on de cyars, so I jest come
through without payin' a cent. An' mighty glad I is
to git home,” he added, drawing a long sigh of relief.</p>
          <p>“But did you not feel bad at robbing the kind officer who
employed you?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Well, Missy,” he answered, “seems like Mas' Harry has
the bes' right to me, an' he was robbin' Mas' Harry ob me.”
And, turning to our mother, he said: “Please, ma'am, I would
like a week at home to marry Affy, an' den can't I find Mas'
Harry?”</p>
          <p>It is needless to add that Kent's wedding was as festive
as it could be made. It was a holiday on the
plantation, and dancing was kept up to the sound of
<pb id="ford86" n="86"/>
the rhythmic stick beating, from morning until night. The
bride was proud, happy and dusky in white muslin; the
groom a marvel in his attire, and with all the airs of a
traveled man.</p>
          <p>After the surrender Kent followed his young master
home, and he and Affy settled on a pretty part of the
plantation, declaring that they would live “faithful
togedder” for the remainder of their lives.</p>

          <head>ROSE BLANKETS</head>
          <p>In the busy rush of to-day it is sometimes a relaxation to
pause for a moment and let memory carry us back, far back,
to the peaceful, uneventful days before the Civil War. Life
seemed to go slower then. We had no cables to tell us, and
often harrow us, each morning with the events all over the
world of the preceding day. And (inestimable boon) our
only ideas of war were time-mellowed Revolutionary
anecdotes. There was in these days no more beautiful place
in all the luxuriant low country contiguous to Charleston
than Hickory Hill. The plantation consisted of rice fields
which bordered Goose Creek on both sides. The massive
brick dwelling, built in Colonial days by the pioneer of the
family which still dwelt there, stood beyond the rice fields in view of
the creek; venerable moss-crowned live-oaks stood
sentinels around. The approach was through an avenue of
similar trees, whose branches formed a beautiful arch over
the luxuriant sward beneath. These trees were the
admiration and pride of the countryside.</p>
          <pb id="ford88" n="88"/>
          <p>Years had only added beauty to the rugged old house, for
ivy and climbing rose vines had dressed its walls and
framed many of its windows. In the springtime it was a
veritable bower. At the time of which I write it was a
“maidens' bower.” From my earliest recollections three
unmarried sisters, Miss Martha, Miss Joanna and Miss
Mary, composed the family. My parents lived on an
adjoining plantation, and although our dwelling houses
were some distance apart, there was a short cut along the
rice field banks, and a happy child was I when any pretext
afforded an excuse for a visit to the ladies. Their
individuality had a great charm even to my childish mind.
When I first remember them they must have all been past
their sixtieth birthdays, and were counted ladies of the old
school. Miss Martha was the eldest. She took life very
seriously, was very tall and thin, was the housekeeper and
head, besides being considered “the clever woman of the
family.” She could be very tragic on the smallest
provocation. Her drop of good Scotch blood made her hold
her head very high, and also made her a rigid
Presbyterian. When she was not hemming a pocket
handkerchief she usually had one of Scott's novels in her
hands. Miss Joanna, the second sister, who was as genial
as her sister was severe, used to say she “did not know
what Martha would have done if Scott had never written; he
had really diversified her life by his novels.”</p>
          <pb id="ford89" n="89"/>
          <p>Miss Joanna had the cheeriest old face imaginable,
bright blue eyes, rosy cheeks, with high cheek bones, her
gray hair waved becomingly, and she always wore a
lavender ribbon in her cap. She was the social one of the
sisters; that is, she performed the social duties. Miss Mary,
the youngest, was at sixty the spoiled darling, having been
considered the best looking, and delicate in her youth. All
the airs of a beauty, and the privileges of an invalid still
clung to her. Indeed, her very white skin and black eyes
were very impressive. Her sisters always gave her the
tenderest consideration and never failed to be affected by
her gentle melancholy and pathetic sighs. They were all
much given to charity, but Miss Mary was more lavish than
wise. Whole families of beggars, not only preyed upon her,
but tyrannized. There was a tradition that Miss Mary had
been rescued in her youth from a runaway carriage by a
lover who was anxious to marry her; she had inclined to
him, but had been deterred by the fear of parting from Miss
Joanna, who usually directed her affairs, and sometimes
made up her mind for her.</p>
          <p>The sisters were accounted quite wealthy. They owned a
handsome residence in the neighboring city of Charleston,
where they betook themselves when fear of country fever
drove them from their beloved country home. The yearly
exodus was a great trial to Miss Martha, who was supposed
to manage the plantation. The neighbors said the negro
foreman,
<pb id="ford90" n="90"/>
Boston, managed the place and the ladies also. They would
never employ a white overseer, as they said “a hireling
could not make allowance for the negroes as they did.”
Indeed, their negroes were a terrible care to them; they
had large retinues of house servants, both in the city and
country, both having a sinecure during their absence.</p>
          <p>Miss Martha frequently complained that she was “hard
worked in finding something for the servants to do.” The
young ones grew up so rapidly, and to put certain families
to field work was not to be contemplated.</p>
          <p>That the ladies did not suffer more from their reckless
management was providential. They had the affection of all
their servants, but the women were lazy and the men great
inebriates. Their idol, and coachman, Billy, was a terrible
case. Their lives were often in peril when he was on the
box. After some hair-breadth escape Billy would be
summoned before the trio and Miss Martha would say
tragically, “Billy, you will be the death of us.” “Fore de
Laud, Missis, I wouldn't hurt a hair of yore heads,” would
be his rejoinder. That he did not was not his fault, but his
good fortune, for on one occasion, having been sent to meet
Miss Martha and Miss Mary at one of the wharves, he was
so far gone that he drove carriage and pair over them,
knocking them down as they approached to get into the
carriage. Miraculously they escaped with only bruises.
Their black silk dresses were kept as
<pb id="ford91" n="91"/>
curiosities, as the iron shod hoofs of the horses had
left their impress in several places. On another
occasion, having met them at the theater with the
carriage, he drove them several miles up the road
toward their country home at 11 o'clock at night
before they could induce him to turn. These
episodes, combined with the very apparent fact that
their friends had ceased to borrow their carriage,
which they enjoyed lending as much as using, sealed
Billy's fate. To soften his downfall, they told him
he could give Cuffie, his successor on the box, some
“hints on driving,” and they would be glad to fill his
molasses jug when it was empty, and if he must
drink, to take molasses and water. He could employ
himself by sweeping the yard. Billy never said
what he drank, but died shortly after of delirium
tremens.</p>
          <p>Joe and Romeo, the butler and his assistant, were
quite as harassing. Romeo's besetting sin was
indolence. He had been known to shed tears at the
prospect of one of the little tea parties in which the
old ladies delighted. On these occasions their guests
were their contemporaries, “the girls,” of whom
there were a great many in maiden state in the quiet
old city. The handsome rooms were always lit by
candles in tall silver candlesticks. Miss Martha
would never consent to the introduction of gas,
which the more progressive Miss Joanna advocated.</p>
          <pb id="ford92" n="92"/>
          <p>“No,” decided Miss Martha, “candles are much
more lady-like.” What would she have thought of
electric lights?</p>
          <p>On these occasions Joe handed a waiter with tea, Romeo
followed with delicate cakes, and then bread and butter,
while a boy followed in the rear with a tray “to catch the
cups” as they were emptied. Ice cream followed at “last bell
ring,” ten in summer and nine in winter, when the party
broke up. Any more substantial refreshment would have
been deemed “very unrefined” by the whole assembly.</p>
          <p>There was a rumor that on one of these occasions both
Joe and Romeo had been very unsteady as they handed
their waiters. Dire was their mistresses' mortification. Miss
Martha always seemed to feel responsible when her
servants misbehaved. She would exclaim, “A single woman
has great need of strength of mind.” Miss Mary's unfailing
rejoinder would be, “Thank God, you have it, sister.” One
evening Joe brought especial obloquy upon himself. He
must have shared Billy's molasses jug, for he had not drawn
the tea as directed.</p>
          <p>Miss Martha, in consideration for some of “the girls”
who were growing feeble, always accompanied Joe on his
rounds. As he paused before a guest she would hold a lump
suspended in the sugar tongs as she would say, “Green tea
and black; dear, which will you have?” On this occasion Joe
took advantage of her deafness to mumble, “Both made in de
<pb id="ford93" n="93"/>
same pot.” The guests were quite diverted, but did not
enlighten Miss Martha as to Joe's confession, and their
progress continued until they reached Miss Mary. When
she overheard Joe's assertion, she looked at him with mild
indignation, but only said, “Sister, you had better sit down.
I will explain later my asking you to do so.” Miss Mary's
suggestion of any course of action to Miss Martha seemed
to call for explanation.</p>
          <p>The next morning, when she told of the duet she had
interrupted, Joe was summoned. Miss Martha told him he
had brought disgrace upon them and would further bring
their gray hairs in sorrow to the grave. He of course
expressed great penitence, and was vociferous in promises
of amendment. His mistresses tried to feel faith. Miss Mary,
however, had to take a great deal of orange-leaf tea before
her nerves recovered the shock. Kindly Miss Joanna said
privately, she had known nothing of what was occurring,
but she was glad the girls had something to amuse them;
she had thought them very merry, and though Joe had failed
in his demeanor he had shown a wonderful regard for truth.
Had the ladies and many of their generation lived to see
emancipation they would have parted with many “an old
man of the sea.”</p>
          <p>One April morning I set out to take a bunch of May roses
over the rice field banks to Hickory Hill. These roses were
especial favorites with the sisters, and I was pleased to
have the earliest blossoms to
<pb id="ford94" n="94"/>
carry. Miss Joanna kept a rose jar. Miss Martha was famous
for the rose water she distilled. I only expected to see Miss
Martha, for I knew Miss Mary had been drooping, and Miss
Joanna had taken her to visit a friend, who, although long
past her youth, had recently married a Northern gentleman,
with whom she lived on her beautiful plantation near the
city.</p>
          <p>Miss Joanna and her sister had left only the day before,
so I was surprised to see the carriage at the door and Cilla,
the maid, removing their shawls and trappings. “Why,
Cilla!” I exclaimed, “are the ladies back already?” “Yes,
missy,” she replied, grinning and dropping a curtsy, “Miss
Joanna an' Miss May, an' Miss Burton had a kine uv
upsettin', an' so we come home.” Wondering what was
amiss, I hastened in. I paused as I entered the sitting-room,
for I saw the ladies were much perturbed (small excitements
were very usual with them, but their demeanor betokened
something serious); Miss Martha sat very erect, with her
most judicial aspect, the needle with which she was sewing
suspended. “Come in, child,” she said as she saw me; “if my
sisters make fools of themselves you may as well know it as
the rest of the world.”</p>
          <p>Miss Mary and Miss Joanna sat with their bonnets on.
Miss Mary with the air of a culprit, Miss Joanna decidedly
ruffled, and her cheeks redder than usual. She said: “Don't
jump too quickly to conclusions, sister; it does seem queer
for us to return
<pb id="ford95" n="95"/>
so hastily, but when I tell you about it quietly, you will, I am
sure, see that we were not entirely to blame. You know
Caroline's husband is rather abrupt in his manner.”</p>
          <p>“He has no Southern suavity,” interrupted Miss Mary.</p>
          <p>“The evening we got there I was feeling rather dull, and
he really made me nervous by shouting in my ear several
times, ‘Cheer up, Miss Mary.’ I jumped every time.”</p>
          <p>“He no doubt meant it kindly,” said Miss Joanna, “but I
dare say it prepared you for what followed.”</p>
          <p>“We had a pleasant evening on the whole, although I
thought Mr. Burton did express his Northern views of
slavery a little more than was called for, especially as he did
not seem to object to Caroline's owning a great many. She
was in high feather and seemed delighted to see us. At bed-time
she accompanied us to our room, where there was a
bright fire, and Cilla awaiting us. After Caroline left us Cilla
begged leave to go to a dance at the negro quarter; she said
it was in her honor, and she seemed in haste to be gone. So I
promised to do what Mary would need and sent her off.
After I was undressed I was standing by the fire brushing
my hair. I saw Mary fumbling about the bed and asked her if
she was ready for me to tuck her in. Instead of answering,
she came, as I thought, mysteriously up to me and
whispered, ‘Negro.’</p>
          <pb id="ford96" n="96"/>
          <p>“Of course I thought there was a man under the bed. I
remembered our watches, Mary's diamond pin, and how far
we were from Caroline and Mr. Burton; for we were in the
company wing. I screamed for help as loud as I could; the
more noise I made the more distressed Mary seemed.
Caroline and Mr. Burton came running, in most
indescribable costumes,” the old lady continued, with a
look of amused restrospection. “There stood Mary in her
bed-gown and curl-papers; I in my wrapper, and Mary
staring at me as if she thought me crazy.</p>
          <p>“ ‘What is the matter?’ they both exclaimed.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Oh,’ I said, ‘Mary says there is a negro under the bed.’</p>
          <p>“We'll soon have the rascal out,” said Mr. Burton,
poking under the bed with a big stick.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Oh,’ said Mary, ‘I never said anything of the kind,
Joanna. I meant,’ she said, turning as red as a beet, ‘that
there were not rose blankets on the bed, but blankets
without the rose embroidered on them, and I call those
negro blankets. Joanna made such a noise I could not
explain what I meant,’ and she burst into tears. Mr. Burton
bounced out of the room, muttering something. Caroline
was very angry. She said that if she had had any idea that
we girls could behave in such a way she would never have
invited us to visit her. She had wished to give her husband
an agreeable impression of Southern ladies, but she did not
like to think what his impression must be; and as to rose
blankets, we never could
<pb id="ford97" n="97"/>
understand when things were out of date. Those were
beautiful new blankets, bought in New York when
refurnishing their guest-room. And in fact she was so
angry,” concluded Miss Joanna, “that I do not like to
remember all she said.”</p>
          <p>“But I must tell you, sister,” put in Miss Mary, “she said
she knew I was always a fool, but she had thought Joanna
had a little sense, and I agree with her, Joanna, that you
ought not to have made such a noise. I never felt worse in
my life than when you began to scream. And I never slept a
wink all night, as you know. Now, Sister Martha, which do
you think the most to blame?”</p>
          <p>“I cannot say,” said Miss Martha, “but I know I will
never go to visit any friend with either of you. I don't
wonder Caroline was angry, and what an impression you
have made on her husband.”</p>
          <p>“Oh,” said Miss Joanna, “we know he was furious. We
had a most unpleasant time at breakfast the next morning. I
tried to make a joke of the whole episode, but failed. They
were too angry; so as Mary was feeling so shaken, and had
taken all her orange-leaf water with no benefit to her nerves,
I thought we had better come home; and I am delighted to
be here; and too thankful neither of you are married,” she
continued, with a return of her genial smile. “For I nearly
exhausted myself trying to mollify Mr. Burton.”</p>
          <pb id="ford98" n="98"/>
          <p>“Yes,” said Miss Mary, “with no success. I do not envy
Caroline her new acquisition, and I am sure rose blankets
are the best.”</p>
          <p>Such were the agitations and events of these tranquil
lives. Their days glided by in peace and kindly
ministrations. They were fortunate in following each other
in quick succession to the old Scotch churchyard where
their fathers slept in the “City by the Sea.”</p>

                  <p>I have not written to you for some time, as we have been
moving about a good deal, and have had some interesting
and funny experiences. Last
summer we were tired of refugeeing, and decided to go back
to Charleston, and lived in a house on Mary street, as we
thought well out of shell range; our own residence on South
Bay being in the grass, and glass-strewed district.
Our family consists only of my mother,
sister and myself, our mankind being in
service, as you know, except father, who is in the home
guard. My mother spent most of her time visiting the
hospitals and devising comforts for the soldiers; my sister
and I knit socks, and rejoiced when some of our soldier
relatives could snatch a breathing-space from arduous
duties at Sumter or on the islands to visit us and partake of
the best we could bestow on them.</p>
                  <pb id="ford100" n="100"/>
                  <p>The sound of the shells with their sharp, rasping, hissing
sound before they exploded was familiar, the interest being
to venture into range sometimes and discover the last place
hit. There was a method in Gilmore's management of his
“Swamp Angel.” We always noticed the shells came quicker
at church time on Sunday, and at ten to eleven at night. To
add to our troubles, yellow fever broke out this year, the
only time during the war. It was not a violent epidemic, but
there were some deaths. We thought we were immune, but
in September my sister took it.</p>
                  <p>One evening early in September my sister was better and
a friend of mine (whose house we faced in their rear) begged
me to come to tea. I went over at dusk, and with her and
another guest were enjoying a cup of real tea and a bit of
toast—quite a feast, when there was a tremendous explosion
apparently just at hand. We all sat quiet, tea cups in hand.
The negro boy rushed in, rolling his eyes, with the
announcement that the opposite house in Aiken's row was
struck, and they were moving out. The lady and her
daughter were both ill with fever, and both died shortly in
consequence of the fright and removal.</p>
                  <p>In quick succession several houses in Aiken's row were
struck. As I look back now it seems strange to me that we
all sat quietly in the drawing-room waiting our turn to be
hit. The man servant returning at intervals to report that
another of the houses was hit. I welcomed my father, when
at
<pb id="ford101" n="101"/>
nine, he came for me. Nothing ever overcame his sense of
humor. He brought a large cotton umbrella, which, he said, he
had brought to please my mother, as a shell might spare its
hideousness. When I got home I found my mother and sister
anxiously awaiting me. I had a little cot in a corner of my
sister's room, and my mother, being anxious, lay on the bed
by her. I went to bed and was soon asleep, the shelling
apparently having ceased, but they had only paused to try a
new gun. The first shells always going farthest, I was
awakened by the horrible familiar hiss and plaster and glass
falling over me. The shell cut the corner of the house and
passed so near me that the glasses of the window near by my
bed were broken, and the plastering above fell on me. The
monster buried itself in our yard, making a horrible deep pit,
but not exploding. A few more inches and I would have been
buried with it. It shows how accustomed we were to shocks
that I do not remember feeling any terror, but remarked
quietly in the dark to my mother, “I think we are hit.” To my
astonishment she broke forth in ejaculations of thanksgiving.
The noise and crash had been so great she thought the side
of the room with me in it had been taken away. That was the
longest range shell that fell in Charleston. In a few days we
went to the up-country to be with friends, and then last week
came down to Otranto, where we are now.</p>

                  <p>I have not written for some time, but we all are really so
troubled and depressed that, as mother says, we have to be
physically active to keep from thinking, so little writing have
I done this winter. I suppose you know father has gone with
his company of reserves to Summerville. They are all men of
over sixty, but we hear that Summerville is pleased to have
them. Aunts Anna and May became so tired of refugee life
in Camden that they decided to join mother, Annie, and me
on the plantation. With father and our brother away we are
very lonely, but Aunt Anna's eighty odd years make us
anxious to make her comfortable. She is better off with us,
for the terrible scarcity of provisions has not touched us
here. We have enough of home provisions, but mother
gives every morsel she can spare to the hospitals and
soldiers' wayside homes in Charleston. The aunts say that
despite the enormous board they had to pay in Camden
they had only fresh pork and biscuits, not even milk, as so
many of the cattle have been impressed for the army.</p>
                  <p>Christmas was certainly a very gloomy day. The news
that Sherman was in Savannah struck us cold. Our three
cousins got leave of absence and came up for a few hours.
Mother had a turkey and we did our best, but I think they
feel very grave over the state of things. We are in terror lest
Charleston will have to be abandoned. Hal begged mother
to return to the up-country, but she says she went away
<pb id="ford103" n="103"/>
three times and will not leave again. She manages the
plantation, you know. The negroes are very good, but there
is a spirit of restlessness perceptible. Hal was shocked
when he heard that we never locked up the house at night.</p>
                  <p>All the white men are in the army and some women are
nervous, but we do not feel so. This intensely cold winter
makes us wretched about our poor bare-footed soldiers.
Mother can knit a pair of socks a day. Maum Martha spins
the wool. I can do only one sock a day. We are fortunate to
have so much lightwood. It is the only source of light we
have, but we can manage our knitting and Annie even reads
sometimes, but the paper is so bad that it is hard to read the
printing on it.</p>

                  <p>I fear you are really having a dreadful time. The high
price of provisions is certainly dreadful on people with fixed
incomes.</p>
                  <p>We had quite an adventure last Wednesday. Father
luckily came over from Summerville to dinner. It was a
bitterly cold day. We were just sitting down to the luxury of
calf's head soup, for father wished some veal to carry back
to camp, when Quash came in with a rattled and rather
bothered air, and said there was a Yankee soldier outside
who wanted to give himself up. We all were thunderstruck,
and followed father, who gave vent to great displeasure.
<pb id="ford104" n="104"/>
At the door stood a miserable looking creature, shivering
in a tattered blue uniform. He was tall, thin, and white as a
ghost, and his feet looked particularly white. I never saw a
more abject object. Father tried to be very severe, but you
know how kind-hearted he is, and while he was scolding the
man I overheard Quash say aside to him, “Nebber min' what
he say, Maussa doan' mean it. He is one ob de kindest mens
in de wurl.”</p>
                  <p>It seems that the man was a prisoner who had escaped
from the cars on his way to prison some three months ago
and was trying to make his way to the coast, hoping to get
through our lines. He had been living among the negroes,
sleeping in their houses by day and traveling by night; but
the wretched existence had worn him out and he came to
give himself up. He was an Englishman who was impressed
on his arrival in New York and he begged father to ask the
authorities to let him take the oath of allegiance and fight for
us; but father said there had been enough of that and such
galvanized Yankees had done more harm than good.</p>
                  <p>This poor wretch is the first enemy we have seen, and we
could not help feeling sorry for him, although, as father
says, no doubt he has been demoralizing the negroes. He
gave him a good dinner and turned him over to Daddy Paul
to take care of until the next day, when father took him to
Charleston and delivered him to the authorities. Mother
found him an old jacket and pair of shoes
<pb id="ford105" n="105"/>
and socks, which she gave him. Surely she had never
expected to give a pair of her socks to one of the enemy.</p>
                  <p>Maum Martha thinks our kindness misplaced and told us
he talked very different to them from the way he talked to
us, but she told us this only after he had left, although it
would have made no difference. We may have “heaped
coals of fire,” etc.</p>

                  <p>I have not heard from you for some time, but I know in
these dark days you think of us. There is no doubt we live
in dreadful times. We may soon be in the enemy's country,
or rather our troops may have to retire from the coast.</p>
                  <p>Yesterday Annie and I determined to drive over to
Summerville and dine with aunt, as she and Cousin Sue
have begged us to do so. Mother did not want us to go.
She feels the perilous times and all the sorrows she has had
make her very anxious. But at last she consented to our
going, much to Aunt May's disappointment, who thinks we
should sit down and say, “Good Lord, deliver us,” all the
time.</p>
                  <p>We had a pleasant drive over, as you know it is only nine
miles. Daddy Moses drove us and mother insisted that
Cully should go as an outrider. He rode Lamb, and went
ahead. It showed that mother was nervous, but Annie and I
were amused, as we did not know what he was expected to
do. We found aunt and Cousin Sue delighted to see us and
<pb id="ford106" n="106"/>
we enjoyed our day. We left at 5 o'clock, as we could not get
off earlier. Father dined with us and tried to start us earlier.
Aunt is delighted to have him in Summerville as she says
she “never felt so safe, because she knows he will fight.”</p>
                  <p>Our drive home was gloomy and we did not reach there
until 7 o'clock. As we drew near we met several of the
negroes on farm horses looking for us, and at the avenue
gate our maid Fanny peering for us in the dark. Mother and
the aunts were wretched about us, particularly as Uncle
Pete had come up from the city full of bad news. Charleston
is to be evacuated, as Sherman's movements have made that
necessary. He was horrified when he heard that we had
taken so long a drive, as he says the woods are full of
stragglers and escaped galvanized Yankees. I do not know
what is before us, or when you will hear from us again.</p>

                  <p>Charleston is being evacuated and our army is passing
all the time, and we reconcile ourselves to being left in the
enemy's lines by the hope that our army, strengthened by
the coast troops, may defeat Sherman. This letter will go by
the last of our troops. The army has been passing for five
days and many of the men come up to the house, where we
give them everything we can for them to eat. They are full
of courage and their appearance gives us renewed hope.
They hate to leave us behind.
<pb id="ford107" n="107"/>
Henry spent last night here. He got leave of absence with
difficulty, but will rejoin his regiment at Strawberry Ferry. He
begged mother to retire into the interior; but we mean to
stay. He left us this morning. The captain in command of the
rearguard at Goose Creek Bridge has just come to bid us
good-by, and he took two letters, which he promised to
carry into our lines—one to papa and the other to aunt,
which we knew would be the last tidings they would get
from us.</p>
                  <p>This may, or may not reach you, but it is a comfort to
write. The worst has come, or I hope it has. After my last
letter we awaited the approach of the enemy with
indescribable feelings. We tried not to think, and I must say
I was afraid of being frightened out of my wits and was too
thankful when the Yankees came. I was too angry to be
<sic corr="scared">scarced</sic>. We tried to keep up each other's spirits and were
very busy hiding things. We took only Paul, Jack and
Martha into our confidence and they helped us faithfully.</p>
                  <p>Tuesday passed in quiet. Mother, Annie and I took our
usual walk in the afternoon and met one of the negroes,
who told us that our men had not burned the bridge, and we
determined that if this was the fact, we would do it
ourselves; but as we approached we were glad to see it
blazing in the distance. We felt then that we were really cut
off from our own
<pb id="ford108" n="108"/>
people, but at the same time had satisfaction in knowing
that if our army was pursued the enemy would here meet an
obstacle.</p>
                  <p>At 5 o'clock Wednesday afternoon as we were again
getting ready for a walk, a man was seen riding rapidly up
the avenue. I called out, “The Yankees are here. I know
them by their blue legs!” and you may be sure the family
assembled quickly. In the mean while the man dashed past
the house and rode quickly around it, evidently expecting
some one to run out; finding no one, he returned to the
front of the house, where we five ladies stood together on
the piazza. By this time we saw many others coming up the
avenue.</p>
                  <p>“Where is the man of the house?” demanded the man in
an insolent tone.</p>
                  <p>Mamma replied, “He is not at home,” and Aunt May
added, “He is a gray-haired man.”</p>
                  <p>He gave a leer and said, “But not too old to be in the
Rebel army.” This could not be denied, so we were silent.
Then, with an expression of triumph he said, “You have
never seen black troops, but you will soon have that
pleasure; they are advancing now.”</p>
                  <p>Mamma said, “I suppose they are not different from
other negroes; we are accustomed to them and never have
feared them.”</p>
                  <p>This calm reply was evidently a disappointment, as he
had hoped we would have been overcome with fear.</p>
                  <pb id="ford109" n="109"/>
                  <p>He turned off and said, “I must get some poultry for the
General's supper,” and went to the fowl-house, where about
a dozen of his men joined him. In a few moments the cart,
which just at the moment was coming up with a load of
wood, was seized and filled with our fowls, turkeys, geese,
etc., and driven off.</p>
                  <p>I happened to turn my eyes toward the western entrance
from the main road and saw the negro soldiers rushing in.</p>
                  <p>To my latest day I will not forget their brutal appearance.
They came up brandishing their guns with an air of
wildness hard to describe, and in a short time were scattered
over the plantation, committing every conceivable havoc.
Their commander, Lieutenant J—, of New York, rode up to
the house, accompanied by several white officers, and while
we stood still and calmly upon the piazza he called out,
“Where is the man of the house?”</p>
                  <p>Mother replied as before, when he said, “He is a Rebel,”
and turning to her said, “I am come to liberate your people,”
to which she quietly replied, “I hope you will be as kind to
them as we have been.” This visibly angered him and he
exclaimed, “That is a strange reply to make to a Northern
man, and an officer of a colored regiment.” To which she
replied, “We will not discuss the question.”</p>
                  <p>He turned and said something to Quash, our waiting-man,
and in a short time we heard him and the other
officers upstairs in our bed-rooms. Mamma
<pb id="ford110" n="110"/>
and Aunt Anna followed quietly and found that he had
summoned our two maids, Rachel and Fanny, and was
exhorting them to disclose where everything of value was
concealed, saying, “Don't lie; that woman (meaning mother)
is very bad,” and a great deal more in the same strain, trying
to incite them against us. They spoke to these servants as
“Madam,” and of mother as “that woman.”</p>
                  <p>The two girls were very frightened, but behaved
remarkably well and assured them that no valuables were
hidden, and only the ladies' clothes were in the rooms.
However, they ransacked our wardrobes and bureau
drawers, throwing our things out all over the floor, and
when they came downstairs took all the cold meats out of
the larder.</p>
                  <p>While mother and Aunt Anna were upstairs helplessly
following Lieutenant J— around and witnessing his
shameless conduct in our bed-rooms, Aunt May, Annie
and I remained downstairs. A quiet-looking officer was
standing in the piazza.</p>
                  <p>Aunt May, who never can control her curiosity, said to
him, “We heard some heavy firing in Charleston this
morning. Has anything occurred there?” “Good Heavens,
Madam,” he replied, “have you been so long out of the
Union that you have forgotten Washington's birthday?”</p>
                  <p>At this moment about twenty rough-looking men came
charging up to the house, evidently intending to enter. I
confess that, for the first time I was alarmed, and calling to
the officer said, “For
<pb id="ford111" n="111"/>
Heaven's sake, protect us; don't let those men enter.” He
said, “I will do what I can,” and placed himself in the
doorway.</p>
                  <p>The men seeing him come forward as our protector,
stopped in the piazza. By this time Lieutenant J— and his
party had returned from searching our bed-rooms, and
calling to his men said, “Boys, take what you want.” These
acted like long-pent-up animals suddenly let loose. All our
stock, horses and mules were driven off, our cattle, sheep
and hogs were killed; the barns and smoke-house were
broken open, and all their contents scattered, and all our
vehicles of every kind, tools and implements were broken in
pieces and thrown into the creek or burned.</p>
                  <p>It was awful to hear the screams of the cattle and hogs as
they were chased and bayoneted, and the scatter and terror
of the sheep was terrible to see. Even my pet calf, which you
know papa gave me, and I took so much pleasure in raising
by hand, was killed; and dear old Aaron, our house cat, was
cruelly run through with a bayonet, right before my eyes, as
he tried to escape under the house. Such brutal scenes I
never had supposed I would ever have to witness.</p>
                  <p>While all this was going on mother said to Lieutenant J—,
“If you take from us all means of subsistence we will
starve.” He turned, and with much satisfaction said, “You
are being punished for what you have done;” and going
out, mounted his
<pb id="ford112" n="112"/>
horse and rode off among the negroes, proclaiming to them
their freedom and incessantly asking for “the man of the
house.” They could only say that he was absent, when he
said, “He may not be here, but he has left a — rebel of a
woman, who is as bad as a man, and the house ought to be
burnt.” The negroes were very much alarmed, and entreated
us not to talk to the soldiers as they hated us so and said
such awful things.</p>
                  <p>It was now quite dark and the excitement and confusion
were truly awful. We all withdrew to the parlor, and closing
the door sat in the dark, not knowing what the next moment
might bring forth; but the faithful Quash brought in a candle
and placed it on the table with his accustomed air.</p>
                  <p>He had scarcely brought it in when the front door was
opened and in walked General Potter, followed by his aids.
Not one of them had the decency to make the least
salutation, or take any notice of the five ladies seated in the
room. But the General immediately seated himself, while
Lieutenant J— seized our candle, and opening mother's
bed-room door called out, “General, this will be a comfortable
room for you,” to which remark the General assented.
Lieutenant J—, then looking around said, “I take
possession of this room for General Potter.” After this the
General made repeated attempts at conversation with us,
but as we had that afternoon seen such wanton destruction
of our property, and were constrained to see our enemies
<pb id="ford113" n="113"/>
occupying the rooms in which it had been so often our
pleasure to entertain our friends, you may imagine we were
in no mood for conversation.</p>
                  <p>We all soon went upstairs, where Quash brought us
some tea. As it was then near midnight we decided to go to
bed, and mother said she would go down in the morning
and request that a written protection be furnished us, as this
had been suggested by the quiet-looking officer, our
protector of the afternoon before. Therefore, as early as
possible she did so, but General Potter received her very
shortly, and only replied, “Your husband is in the Rebel
army.” She replied, “It was our desire that he should leave
us, and I am glad he is not here, for if he had been I suppose
he would have been shot.”</p>
                  <p>He replied, “You talk like a fool when you say that,” and
turned off; when mother said, “If that is your opinion, I have
the more need of protection.”</p>
                  <p>As the General was about to go out to mount his horse at
the door, Lieutenant B— came to the rescue, saying,
“General, with your permission, I can write a paper
addressed to the officers and men of the United States
army, saying that it is your desire that this house and its
lady occupants be unmolested.”</p>
                  <p>The General only answered, “You may if you wish,”
when a paper to that effect was written, and its influence
was certainly beneficial. We felt that we owed our safety
largely to Lieutenant B—, who conducted himself in every
way as a gentleman,
<pb id="ford114" n="114"/>
and on leaving thanked mother courteously for his
night's accommodation and politely bowed to all of
us.</p>
                  <p>It was near midday before all of the officers had left the
house, and we, much jaded, were able to have breakfast.
The house was now kept strictly shut up, as the lawn was
still studded with the tent flies of the regiment encamped
there. If a door was opened for a moment, a soldier would
walk in, and it was as much as mother could do to get him
out again.</p>
                  <p>We kept almost entirely upstairs, taking all of our meals
there, and in constant dread of making any noise. One man
said to mother, “The General thinks that your husband is
hidden; he does not believe that he is not here.”</p>
                  <p>In this extremity a kind-looking Irish soldier came to our
aid and promised that we should be protected if it “cost him
his life,” and that he would bring a friend with him, who
would spend the night in the shed room, “to be handy, if
needed.” This kind friend, McManus, proved his Irish
blood by bringing the most villainous specimen of a man we
had yet seen, and whispering to mother that “sure he had
no confidence in him at all.”</p>
                  <p>We were much taken aback at McManus's friend's
appearance, but relieved when the chaplain of the regiment
came up and asked to be allowed to sleep in the house.</p>
                  <pb id="ford115" n="115"/>
                  <p>Our servants behaved admirably and themselves
provided and served our meals with unfailing regularity, and
managed to give us many little treats, which we suspected
came from the United States commissariat. Mother hopes
that she may be able to get us to the city in safety, for our
position here is very unprotected and we wish to get
possession of our house in the city before it falls into the
hands of the Freedmen's Bureau.</p>

                  <p>I hope my last safely reached you, and I know you feel
anxious about us, so I will get — to smuggle this through
the lines. You will be relieved to know that we are once more
in our house in Charleston.</p>
                  <p>By dint of mother's representations of our unprotected
condition on the plantation to the officer in command, and
her frequent reminders that by their confiscation of all our
animals and destruction of our vehicles we had been
deprived of all means of transporting ourselves to the city,
she obtained transportation.</p>
                  <p>As soon as the Northeastern Railroad was put in running
order, which was within a few days after Charleston was
evacuated, the major informed us
<pb id="ford116" n="116"/>
that we might ride down in a box-car. He also gave us
permission to carry in the car whatever household goods
we could.</p>
                  <p>It was hard to choose from the accumulation of years
what furniture to take with us, as we knew that all that was
left would be stolen, our presence only having kept out the
vagrant negroes and camp followers, who, we heard from
the servants, complained very much that our house had not
been gutted as had others in the neighborhood. We had a
very short time for choosing, as we had notice only in the
afternoon, that we must be off in the morning. Mother had a
time among us, as each had something very
untransportable, which, to quote dear Aunt Anna, “it would
be sacrilege to leave.”</p>
                  <p>I fought hard for all the books and the old sofa, which had
been in the house since the Revolution, and was said to
have been Washington's favorite seat when he visited the
plantation in 1791; but I had to content myself with only
the books that I could get into a trunk, and when our
friendly Irish soldier, McManus, who volunteered to help
us move the things, seized our valued sofa to hoist it into
the car, it proved its antiquity by breaking in pieces. I could
have cried over the loss, but mother said, “This is no time
for sentiment; it has served from one Revolution to be
wrecked in another.”</p>
                  <p>The last night we spent at the plantation was truly
forlorn. The servants warned us to expect an attack from
some vagrant negroes, who had come from the
<pb id="ford117" n="117"/>
up-country, and were roving about, as Maum Martha
expressed it, “free till dey fool,” robbing and destroying,
unchecked by the authorities.</p>
                  <p>We asked the officer in command to give us a guard for
the night, but he refused; so mother decided that we must
spend the night together in the parlor. The men servants
promised to watch outside, and both Fanny and Rachel
begged to be allowed to stay with us in the house. You may
imagine that it was a weary vigil, as none of us slept, and we
put out the light, fearing lest it might guide some evil-doer.</p>
                  <p>Paul, Quash and Jack walked around the house by turns
all night; and I am sure that it was owing to their faithful
watchfulness that the dawn found us unmolested.</p>
                  <p>At an early hour Maum Martha brought in a nice
breakfast, and with some pride told us that one of the
officers had seen her preparing it and had expressed
surprise; but she had told him that she was from an old
Congo family herself, an' no upstart free nigger; for since
Maussa's family came from France, and hers from Africa,
they had been together for five generations. “An' so long as
I's in de kitchen I knew what's proper to be sent in de house,
even if I hab to scurry to get it.”</p>
                  <p>Quash, Fanny, and Rachel came with us to the city, but
Maum Martha and Paul were left behind in their home.</p>
                  <pb id="ford118" n="118"/>
                  <p>With difficulty we got in to the dirty box-car, and Aunt
May had quilted into her skirts many papers for
safe-keeping and around her shoulders had her valuable
cashmere shawl sewed under a black one, all of which
weighted her down so that she fell, and frightened us much
by her inability to rise.</p>
                  <p>We picked her up and were thankful that she was not
hurt, and had been kept from getting up only by her
entourage.</p>
                  <p>At the station in Charleston we first heard of the burning
of Columbia and while we were waiting for a carriage the
officer in command of the guard kept dinning into our ears
that General Hampton had burned that city, which assertion
mother firmly contradicted, persistently saying that General
Sherman had done it.</p>
                  <p>We were much afraid that we would find our house taken
by the Freedmen's Bureau, or by some officers for a
residence, but happily neither was the case. But we found
that nearly all the furniture had been stolen, and were
thankful to have the few pieces that we had brought from
the plantation.</p>
                  <p>As it was on Saturday that we came down all of our
things had to be left in the station until Monday, and then
when Quash went for them he found that the military gentry
(?) had taken from among them whatever they wanted.</p>
                  <p>All the furniture that we found in the house was an old
table and a very large book-case, and my only bed thus far
has been a mosquito net spread on the floor.</p>
                  <pb id="ford119" n="119"/>
                  <p>On Sunday afternoon mother and Aunt May went to see
Cousin M., who is very ill, and while Annie and I remained
with Aunt Anna, who was resting on her mattress on the
floor, Rachel came rushing up stairs, saying, “Oh, mam,
some officers say they want this house and have come to
take it; they are coming up into the dining-room now.”</p>
                  <p>I at once said, “We must go down and meet them,” and
calling to Annie to put the few spoons that were out at
once in her pocket, we each gave Aunt Anna an arm and
went down, followed by Rachel.</p>
                  <p>I must say I felt much agitated at the thought of what we
might encounter, and dreaded for our old aunt, who seemed
much unnerved.</p>
                  <p>As we entered the dining-room by one door a naval
officer came in by the other, advancing with a calm air of
possession.</p>
                  <p>I was just going to speak when Aunt Anna astounded us
by saying, in the kindest tones, “Why, Edmund! how is
your mother?”</p>
                  <p>We thought her bereft of reason, but the effect upon the
officer was instantaneously overwhelming. He staggered
and exclaimed, “Good God! Miss J—, is it you? You shall
not be molested,” and turning quickly, left the house
without giving her a chance to say another word.</p>
                  <p>It seems that Aunt Anna had instantly recognized him as
the son of an old and dear friend in New
<pb id="ford120" n="120"/>
York, and upon the return of mother and Aunt May the
unlooked-for occurrence was fully discussed.</p>
                  <p>Aunt was much commended for recognizing him and we
hope that her recognition will stand us in good stead, as we
know that Lieutenant Henry is a gentleman, and on account
of the warm friendship that has existed for so many years
between our old aunts and the elder members of his family
he will probably use any influence he may have with the
authorities in our favor.</p>
                  <p>The next day another naval officer called at the house
and asked to see mother, whom he told that he had had the
pleasure, previous to the war, of serving with those of our
family who were then in the navy, and although he had been
blockading Charleston for many months he had promised
our cousin, Lieutenant —, who remained in the United
States Navy, that if he ever got into Charleston he would
look us up, and gladly do what he could to help us.</p>
                  <p>Mother felt that in our present defenseless condition she
should not refuse any offers of aid, and thanked him. He
then produced a copy of a morning paper, which contained
a general order that any citizen who desired protection must
put a United States flag on his house, and that no outrages
would be punished that were committed on premises that
did not contain such flags.</p>
                  <p>After reading this order he drew from his pocket a small
flag, which, he said, with our permission, he would tack to
the piazza.</p>
                  <pb id="ford121" n="121"/>
                  <p>Mother politely declined his offer, but our aunts made
such a point of the advisability of accepting it that she was
induced to yield. He then asked me to hold the little staff
while he tacked it to the post; but I could not touch it, and
called to his assistance a little negro girl, as more
appropriate, who stood staring in at the gate, and she held it
for him.</p>
                  <p>Annie looked on quietly and said nothing, but at night,
after we were gone to bed, said, “I cannot stand it. I cannot
breathe with that flag there.” She only expressed my own
feelings, so we quietly went down in the dark, and pulling it
down, secreted it.</p>
                  <p>We determined to keep our own counsel, as we had
heard only the day before of the arrest and imprisonment of
a lady for pulling down a similar flag, and had no desire to
be martyrs, only we did not want it there. The next morning,
while we held our peace, we were much amused at the
excitement of our aunts over the disappearance of the flag,
and their insisting that they knew it had been stolen, for
they had seen “a man going down the street with one just
like it.”</p>
                  <p>The house now remains as heretofore, undecorated.</p>
                  <p>Captain Mayo, our naval friend, has just come to inform
mother that orders have been issued by the commanding
general that we all must go up King street tomorrow
morning, and take the oath of allegiance to the United
States. She positively refused, but Captain Mayo says that
in case of non-compliance
<pb id="ford122" n="122"/>
we will all have to leave the city at once. I am at
a loss to imagine what grounds the authorities have for fear
of us, as helpless a party of five ladies as can be found, the
eldest being 81, and the youngest 16; but we must decide
today, and unless you see us, if we are actually turned out,
I will write you of the result in another letter.</p>

</dateline>
                  </opener>
                  <p>Day before yesterday Captain Mayo returned and
informed us that the orders had been modified, so that if we
desired, only the oath of neutrality would be required.</p>
                  <p>We had never before heard of such an oath being
required of helpless women, but we were willing to
compromise under the circumstances. So as there was not
the smallest chance of our ever being of any service again
to the Confederate cause, we announced our willingness to
declare ourselves neutral if the United States Government
thought it important.</p>
                  <p>Aunt Anna said her 81 years rendered her utterly unable
to walk as far as the provost marshal's office and asked if
the commandant thought her neutrality of importance would
he send an officer to the house to administer the oath? This
was done.</p>
                  <p>Aunt May, having in view the new regulation, which
prohibited the delivery of letters through the post-office to
any one who had not taken the oath of
<pb id="ford123" n="123"/>
allegiance, and having her daughter in New York, from
whom she was anxious to hear, said tremblingly that she
would take the oath of allegiance.</p>
                  <p>Captain Mayo's manner to her immediately changed, and
became very cordial, as he said he would go and notify the
provost marshal and come back for us, whom he had already
offered to accompany.</p>
                  <p>We retired to our room to make ourselves presentable for
the streets, as we had not been out of the house since we
came down from the plantation; and Annie and I changed
our homespun dresses for our black and put on, with lurking
feelings of satisfaction, our bonnets, for which we had paid
the milliner, only a few months before, $150 each. We felt
that our enemies would be impressed with the fact that we
were quite within the circle of the fashionable world, and
really when we appeared Captain Mayo seemed quite
struck; but we did not then imagine the reason.</p>
                  <p>He courteously offered his arm to Aunt May, who took it
with a deep sigh, and we, leaving Aunt Anna to Rachel's
care, followed them to the provost marshal's office, where
we had reason to be glad of Captain Mayo's escort, as the
sidewalk in front of the office and the doorway were
thronged with idle negroes, who would have made
themselves very offensive if they had not seen us escorted
by a United States officer.</p>
                  <pb id="ford124" n="124"/>
                  <p>As we entered, Captain Mayo said to us in a low tone,
“The oath will be administered to you ladies by a member of
one of the best families of Boston,” to which Annie replied,
“Don't you think that he might be better employed?”</p>
                  <p>Of this the captain took no notice as he led the party to
the middle of a room, where we stood the attraction of many
curious eyes. The officer at the table came forward and
asked which of the ladies desired to take the oath of
allegiance, whereupon Aunt May, looking very conscious,
moved forward and tremblingly held up her hand, but she
was so agitated that she could scarcely murmur her assent
and sign her name to the iron-clad oath.</p>
                  <p>When she had finished Captain Mayo congratulated her
upon her renewed loyalty, but much to his chagrin she
replied, “I only did it so that I could get my letters from the
post-office; but I had not idea that the oath contained such
dreadful sentiments; please let me scratch out my name and
take the oath of neutrality instead.”</p>
                  <p>At this the provost marshal remarked, “Madam, do you
not realize the sanctity of an oath, or do you desire to take
all the oaths?”</p>
                  <p>Mother and Annie calmly took oaths of neutrality, and
when my turn came and I stepped forward to swear
neutrality to the United States, it appeared to be the
crowning farce of the day. The officers
<pb id="ford125" n="125"/>
present seemed to be impressed with the absurdity of the
thing and could not control their countenances, and smiled
as I stood before them.</p>
                  <p>As we sadly walked away we passed several Northern
women and observed that they all wore bonnets not much
larger than our hands, while our bonnets that we had
thought so much of, with their lofty fronts, could be
compared to nothing more truly than the tower of Pisa. We
could not resist the idea that the oddity of our appearance
must have led them to imagine that we had just come out of
the ark.</p>
                  <p>Upon our arrival at home Annie and I at once set about
cutting down our bonnets and drawing in and changing the
shape of our skirts, but mother was very unsympathetic and
said she could not imagine why we wished to look like
Yankee women.</p>
                  <p>Annie and I witnessed a sickening sight yesterday when
we were out on the street for a few moments. A handsome
large dog was being chased by some negro soldiers, one of
whom dashed out its brains with the butt of a rifle almost on
to our skirts. We were dreadfully agitated, and upon
mentioning the matter to Captain Mayo, he informed us that
all dogs must have licenses or be killed. I was much
distressed at the danger of losing my pet Cora, but Captain
Mayo offered to obtain a license free for her if I would
accept it, and as we did not have $1.50 to pay for it, we
accepted his kind offer, so Cora is now protected.</p>
                  <pb id="ford126" n="126"/>
                  <p>Yesterday mother received notice that a war tax had been
levied upon all real estate, and that it must be paid within
thirty days. Our tax amounts to $180, and for our lives we
cannot conceive where the money is coming from to pay it,
as we have only one gold dollar among us, but little
provisions, and only two of our cows that were smart
enough to escape into the woods when the others of the
herd were slaughtered at the plantation by General Potter's
troops.</p>
                  <p>Mother was greatly troubled about the necessity of
raising the money, and seeing an advertisement in the paper
that old china and handsome pieces of glass would be
bought by a Bostonian for relics, sent an answer to the
address and this morning took from the trunk some of our
best pieces we had saved and set them upon our only table
in readiness for the purchaser.</p>
                  <p>While we were at dinner two very unattractive citizens of
Boston presented themselves, who after looking at the
articles, declined to purchase and instead offered
themselves as boarders, saying that they had come to
Charleston to open a grocery house and would be willing to
pay their board in provisions. Of course this arrangement
was promptly declined, but we were very much
disheartened that our first effort to raise the money for the
tax had proved such a failure.</p>
                  <p>I give you a copy of the oath of neutrality I had to take;
it is such a farce.</p>

          <head>TAY—A STORY OF A MAUMA</head>
          <p>One day some time ago, while turning over the contents
of an old trunk, which had been mine since childhood, had
followed me in innumerable moves, and contained the odds
and ends full of associations as life goes on, I came to a pair
of half-moon earrings; they were very large, and of old gold.
“Oh!” I exclaimed, as I looked at them, “these bring Tay
back to the life.”</p>
          <p>My little girls, who had been looking on, eager-eyed, for
mamma's old trunk had always possessed a mysterious
charm for Floy, and Grace, enhanced since some years
previous, when, after I had given up the idea of having new
cloaks for them for the winter, I chanced to see an
advertisement for Confederate bonds, and succeeded in
finding enough of these in my old trunk to supply the
needed cloaks, and also other things.</p>
          <p>“Who was Tay?” they both exclaimed. I felt a sense of
self-reproach at the question; and I am sure to Tay herself
the idea that one of her “chillun's chillun” could have
reached the mature age of ten years and never had heard of
her existence would have
<pb id="ford129" n="129"/>
seemed incredible. It was not from any lack of kindly
recollection of the old woman that I had not told the
children of her; but my life had been a busy one, with many
invalid times, when the reverses of life pressed heavily, and
I shrank from speaking voluntarily of my childhood days,
which had been so different from theirs; and besides the
children of the South today, whose mothers were half-grown
girls at the time of emancipation, belong to a new
order of things, and are out of sympathy with their parents
on many subjects. They do not understand their elders'
feelings toward the negroes. They regard them with very
impartial eyes, and see them as they are today. And as the
succession of careless, ignorant cooks and housemaids
come and go they cannot understand the kind allowances
made for their faults by those who remember the tender
nursing of the dear old maumas. But to return to Tay.</p>
          <p>“Who was Tay?” I repeated. “Why, one of the best of
women; and it is high time you should hear about her, and
love her memory. So if you will get your knitting and sit very
quite I will tell you her story.</p>
          <p>“Her name was Kitty, but we children always called her
Tay. When your grandmother was married Tay was given to
her as her maid; and a most accomplished one she was,
besides being a skilled seamstress, and clear starcher. A
younger woman had taken her place as maid when I first
remember her, and she was the upper servant, always
carrying
<pb id="ford130" n="130"/>
the keys, and taking charge of the household, when your
grandmother was ill or absent. She was at least six feet tall;
her waist claimed nearly half her length, or looked as if it did.
She was quite light-colored, with large black eyes that
looked as if a millstone would be no obstacle to her vision. I
assure you her appearance was calculated to inspire awe in
our breasts. Her great height was of itself impressive, and
made more so by her costume. She usually wore a black
frock with a very tight body, and full skirt; and an enormous
bustle, such as was not worn in those days; a white
<sic corr="handkerchief">hankerchief</sic> over her shoulders, pinned across her bosom; a
white apron; and to cap the climax a very stiffly starched
white turban (all the worn muslin dresses of the family went
to keep up the supply). She always tied her turbans on a
block to shape them, and stuffed a newspaper in the top to
keep the shape; and when she finally put one on her head
the effect was tremendous. Her pride in gold earrings was
great. She always wore them, and kept them as shiny as
could be. With the basket of keys on her arm, she would
look like a person not to be trifled with, nor did we ever so
venture. Her devotion to us all was very great—‘Miss,
Maussa, an' de chillun’ bounded her horizon. Her idea was to
economize; ‘for Maussa,’ she would say, ‘is so freehanded,
an' six chillun is a houseful’ ”</p>
          <p>“To us children she showed her regard by great
sternness of demeanor, but compensated by the beautiful
<pb id="ford131" n="131"/>
tucking she did on our dresses—the only sewing she
ever did. And your grandmother had no respite until she
supplied the material Tay thought necessary. Your
grandmother was so sure of her trustworthiness that she
never interfered with her management. We never thought of
remonstrating, although she mortified us sometimes by her
treatment of our friends. She had no patience with too many
visitors, <sic corr="no need for parenthesis mark">(</sic>and always presided at our tea, serving us with our
cups of milk, and bread and treacle. We had some little
friends who were very apt to run in just at the tea hour.
Once, when they came steadily for a week, we saw clouds
gathering on Tay's brow, and were not surprised when, one
evening after she had helped us all, she turned to our
friends and said: ‘To-morrow, take yo' supper befo' you
come. Maussa cyan't affo'd to support two families.’ This
broke up our tea parties.</p>
          <p>“Tay had a husband as remarkable in his way as she was
in hers. He was taller than she, slim, and very black; and was
a very prosperous negro. He belonged to two maiden ladies,
and lived a very independent life, free from care. He was a
cooper by trade, and in his own shop plied his calling on his
own account, only every quarter bringing his owners his set
wages. And whenever illness or trouble of any kind
overtook him, to his owners he came for care or protection.
He finally concluded to buy his freedom, and asked your
grandfather to become his guardian, as required by the law,
if he could accomplish
<pb id="ford132" n="132"/>
his purpose. He also asked him to be so kind as to ask
his owners what they would take for him. Your grandfather
saw the ladies, who fixed as moderate a price as they could;
and when he told Daddy Sam the result of his negotiations,
instead of being gratified, he was angry, and said: ‘My
mistresses has no idea how valuable I is. I t'ought dey
would ask 'bout $300 mo'. Dey can't affo'd to part wid me fer
less, an' I means to pay it.’ The ladies were not obdurate,
and no doubt had an increased idea of Daddy Sam's value.</p>
          <p>“This worthy pair had no children; and Daddy Sam died
not long before the war, leaving Tay quite a little sum of
money. He had offered to buy her freedom for her, but she
did not desire it. I remember that when he died she took off
her turban when she went to church, and donned a gigantic
crape veil. One day she came home very angry. She had met
some sportsmen going hunting, who had begged her to go
along with them as a ramrod, as they had lost theirs!</p>
          <p>“When the war began she was very unhappy. There is
no doubt that at that period there was a feeling of
expectation and disaffection among the negroes; but Tay
was of a thoroughly loyal nature, and had no sympathy with
the negro character, and understood it entirely; and their
meaner traits were revolting to her.</p>
          <p>“One day in the early part of 1861, she came as usual
after breakfast to consult your grandmother
<pb id="ford133" n="133"/>
about the marketing that had been sent home. She had such
a funny way of describing the pieces; she always
involuntarily touched the part of her frame she was
supposed to be designating, of mutton, or lamb. I was a
light-hearted child then, and many a hearty laugh have I had
at Tay's expense, as she would touch her leg, or shoulder, or
even her head if a calf's head were in question. But to return
to this day. She must have heard some talk among the
negroes, for after she had got through her business, she
lingered and said to her mistress, ‘O Miss, I've had an awful
dream.’ Your grandmother spoke kindly to her, and asked
her what it was. The faithful creature sat on the floor, and
looking up into our faces she said:</p>
          <p>“I dreamed we was all in confusion an' dere was a big
crowd, an' Maussa was sick, an' you all looked very sad, an'
you all was dressed common; but dere was heaps of niggers
'round, but dey was all a-runnin' 'round, an' a-kickin' up a
noise; an' deir arms in deir kimbos, an' not one a-workin';
and you all called for some water, an' not one went to git it,
but I ran for it, an' I said, ‘O Miss, you has been a good frien'
to me, an' sometimes a bottom rail is more use dan a same
quality one; an' so long as Kitty is here dere will always be
somethin' between you an' the groun.’ And she burst into
tears and left the room.</p>
          <p>“Your grandmother said, ‘She has had no dream. She
wished to show us what is in her heart.’</p>
          <pb id="ford134" n="134"/>
          <p>“Ah, children, those were dreadful days, and when in
December Port Royal fell, flight, confusion, and distress
were the order of the day on the coast. By all this there
was many a young life cut short, as truly as though a bullet
had stilled it; and it was not only the men who laid down
their lives, many a gentle girl was also a victim. Your
grandmother sent my two sisters and me to relatives in the
interior of the State. She remained in Charleston to look after
our affairs, intending to go to a hospital as a nurse, if
needed. We had been in the up-country but a few days
when your Aunt Lucy, as lovely a young girl as the sun
ever shone on, was seized with fever. Her illness was fatal,
and she died before her mother could reach her.</p>
          <p>“When we left your grandmother she had been obliged
to go to our country place on Goose Creek, where she had
remained alone—the colored driver and other negroes being
the only people on the plantation. Tay had always lived in
the city of Charleston, even when we were all on the
plantation; and she always had the care of the city house.
When the direful news of your Aunt Lucy's illness reached
Charleston, Tay hastened up to the plantation to your
grandmother, saying:</p>
          <p>“ ‘I wants you to let me come an' live here, for anybody
c'n do what I does in town; but der is a lot of talk 'bout de
whole low country will be took by de Yankees. An' de
negroes will have to go inside, up country, an' make bread
while deir masters is
<pb id="ford135" n="135"/>
fightin'. Now, Miss, let me stay up here, an' keep an eye, an'
if dere is anythin' I c'n do to keep things straight, I'm here;
an' if we has to leave, I will go wid dem, an' keep dem all
steady.’</p>
          <p>“Your grandmother consented with, 
‘God bless you, Tay,’
and at once left to go to your ill aunt. Tay remained on the
plantation the whole winter and spring. Your grandmother
could not return; but never had there been as much poultry
and eggs produced, lambs saved, or butter made as was
done under Tay's management. And the quantity of
vegetables raised proved invaluable in those war times. And
all was owing to the faithfulness of this devoted creature
who remained to encourage the other negroes.</p>
          <p>“When the summer of 1862 came your grandmother wrote
her that she must leave the plantation, as she was
unacclimated to that malarial country; but she begged to
stay a little longer, as she knew she was of service, and was
quite well. Then came the news that she was sick. She had
sent to tell her young master, who was a naval officer on
duty in Charleston harbor. He at once went to see her, and
rebuked her for having remained so long in that unhealthy
climate. He got her to promise to leave the next day. Finding
that she had not arrived in the city, he obtained leave of
absence and again went after her, but found her evidently
near her end.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Ah! Massa Paul,’ she said, 
‘I got up three times to go,
as I promised you I would, an' de buggy was at de door, an'
Martha here to go wid me, but I
<pb id="ford136" n="136"/>
fainted; an' as it was de three times I know it is de Lord's
will, I'll never leave dis bed. I hope He will say<sic corr="no need for period">.</sic> ‘Kitty, you
done what you could, an' been a faithful servant.’ 
I never did
want to be nothin' but a servant. Dere's plenty of dem in de
Bible your Ma gave me; and if I c'n just jine dem I'm happy.
An' now here's what I want you' Ma to have. It's Sam's little
savin's. I always kep' dem by me; an' when I seen these war
times, an' such curious-lookin' money buy so little, I'm glad I
got it. I kep' it for a pinch; an' fixed it so nobody would
suspicion it. But I thank de Lord you come to take it befor' I
go.’ And with great effort she brought from under her pillow
a curious-looking, homespun undergarment, into which was
literally quilted coins of gold and silver; a little fortune in
Confederate money, besides various old trinkets and
watches which Sam had invested in.</p>
          <p>“ ‘My earrin's is dere,’ she said. 
‘I never wore dem since
Miss Lucy died; dey looks too bright. Now give this to you'
Ma with Kitty's duty. I wish she could ha' closed my eyes. I
know she would ha' done it. But she an' de young ladies will
be sorry, I know, when I'm gone.’</p>
          <p>“And then with the flash of her usual animation she
turned her eyes on her attendant, Martha, and said: Martha
have my three trunks of clo'es; she must give them to Miss'.
Dey will keep her house servants decent for a time; an' yo'
Ma does hate a sloven, Martha knows. I will walk at her if
she takes anythin' out befo' Miss comes. Lord help me!’</p>
          <p>“A faithful soul gone home.”</p>
