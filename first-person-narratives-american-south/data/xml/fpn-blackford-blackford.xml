        <head>PREFACE</head>
        <p>In 1909 Ulrich Bonnell Phillips published his <hi rend="italics">Plantation and
Frontier Documents</hi>, which incidentally remains today the most important
single collection of published source documents on the plantation
regime of the pre-Civil War South, in which he defined a plantation
as “a unit in agricultural industry in which the laboring force was of
considerable size, the work was divided among groups of laborers who
worked in routine under supervision, and the primary purpose was in
each case the production of a special staple commodity for sale. The
laborers were generally in a state of bondage. Wage earners might be
employed; but for the sake of certainty in maintaining a constant and
even supply of labor from season to season, indented servants and negro
slaves were the commoner resort.” He defined a farm as “an agricultural 
unit in which the labor force was relatively small. There was no
sharp distinction between workman and supervisor. A less regular
routine was followed and the primary purpose was divided between
producing commodities for market and commodities for consumption
within the family. Farmers might hire help and might buy slaves. With
unfree labor as such, however, they had little or no vital 
concern.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1">1</ref> These
definitions are generally accepted as correct but it should be noted that
there were plantations that had characteristics ascribed to the farm and
vice versa. For instance, some plantations did not grow a single major
staple for sale but produced a number of crops -  grain, fruits, and livestock
 -  for sale, and used slave labor which was not worked in routine
under constant supervision.</p>
        <p>Since 1909 many excellent journals and diaries of the rice, sugar,
and cotton plantations of the lower South have been published,
<ref targOrder="U" id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2">2</ref>  but there
has been a dearth of significant journals of combination grain, hay,
fruit, and livestock plantations of the Virginia-Maryland area.  And it
is still true, as Phillips said in 1909, “On the subject of small farms....,

the reader must keep in mind that there is a hiatus in the documents.” 
<ref targOrder="U" id="ref3" n="3" rend="sc" target="note3">3</ref>
It is a well know fact, however, that the farms constituted a most important 
element in the general agricultural and economic life of the Old
South although they were overshadowed by, and attracted less attention
than, the large and more striking plantations.</p>
        <p>It was my good fortune as editor of Henry Kyd Douglass, <hi rend="italics">I Rode
with Stonewall</hi> (Chapel Hill: The University of North Carolina Press,
1940), to find in the attic at Ferry Hill Plantation a bound volume of a
journal of that plantation kept by the then owner, John Blackford, for
the year January 4, 1838, to January 15, 1839. This plantation, located
on the Maryland side of the Potomac River across from Shepherdstown,
Virginia (now West Virginia), had characteristics of both the plantation
and the farm as defined by Phillips. The regular labor force was slave
but the plantation produced no special major staple crop. Instead it grew
grain of various kinds, hay, fruits, potatoes, livestock and timber for
sale as well as home consumption. Mr. J. Howard Beckenbaugh, the
owner of Ferry Hill in 1942, deposited the journal and other papers
in the Southern Historical Collection of the University of North Carolina, 
but withdrew them in 1954 and gave them to the newly established
Historical Society of Washington County in Hagerstown, Maryland. I
had made a copy of the journal while it was on deposit in the Southern
Historical Collection, and Mr. Beckenbaugh kindly gave his permission
for its publication.</p>
        <p>The preparation of this document for publication presented a number
of editorial problems. There is ample evidence to show that Blackford
had kept a record of his plantation for many years, probably since 1816
when he purchased the ferry, but this document is the only part of the
record known to exist. Kept in a bound ledger about ten by fourteen
inches, the journal begins abruptly on January 4, 1838. It has no title,
but I have chosen to call it a “journal” rather than 
a “diary.” It was
written, not in response to spontaneous impulse to record the observations,
thoughts, and deeds of the author, but to record the day by day 
happenings at Ferry Hill Plantation. It includes home life, the operation
of the ferry, and work in the fields, barns, and woods -  in a word the
everyday life of the Blackford family, their slaves and hired workers, and
the coming and going of relatives and visitors.</p>
        <p>Life at Ferry Hill was very different from that on a major staple
crop plantation where the laborers worked in gangs, in routine, and
under close supervision. The cultivation and harvesting of corn, wheat,
barley, oats, rye, clover, hay, and potatoes; the threshing and milling
of the grain; the daily feeding and care of cattle, horses, sheep and
hogs, and the slaughter of animals and curing of meats; the growing,
<note id="note3" n="3" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref3">3. 
<hi rend="italics">Plantation and Frontier Documents</hi>, I, 97.</note>
<pb id="greenix" n="ix"/>
harvesting, and preservation of apples, and the manufacture of cider,
vinegar, and apple butter therefrom; the daily supervision of the ferry;
and the cutting of wood for fuel and timber for lumber and shingles for
sale, all of which took place at Ferry Hill, could not easily be carried
on by slave gangs in routine and under supervision. Consequently the
laborers at Ferry Hill worked individually with little or no supervision.
Nor were they assigned tasks to do. Blackford never employed an
overseer, he chose to manage the plantation himself and to give general
supervision to his slaves and hired laborers. But he did not, as a
small farmer would have done, work with his slaves. He did no manual
labor. It was his function to formulate policies and see that they were
carried out. Nor was Blackford and his plantation unique in this respect. 
They were typical of many planters and plantations of the
Maryland-Virginia area.</p>
        <p>The Ferry Hill Journal furnishes its own warranty of truth and
authenticity. It deals concretely, unconsciously, generally impersonally,
and in evident faithfulness with life as it was lived on the plantation.
Since Blackford was the supervisor as well as owner he not only saw
but experienced the life about which he wrote. Only twice during the
year was he absent from the plantation for a full day. On one occasion
he, some members of his family, and friends made a business and
pleasure trip of seven days' duration to Washington and Baltimore.
Again he and his invalid wife spent a week at one of the Virginia resort
springs. During these absences one of his sons, and a relative who
lived on the plantation, supervised the work. From them and from slaves
and hired workers Blackford gathered information to fill in the journal.</p>
        <p>Blackford, an intelligent, well educated, and widely read man, made
no effort to use correct English in his journal. The entries were
hurriedly written for his own use, and he intended to transcribe them
into a more permanent journal. He generally wrote short notes, using
single words, phrases, clauses, including numerous abbreviations, instead 
of complete sentences. His capitalization, spelling, and punctuation 
or lack thereof are not only abominable but also maddening to the
reader. For instance in the spelling of the name of one of his close
friends and a frequent visitor at Ferry Hill there are at least four
variations. As editor I have chosen to reproduce faithfully the journal
as written; I have made no corrections, nor have I supplied missing
words and punctuation. After the reader has mastered Blackford's
original and unique writing practices in the first few pages he can
readily grasp the meaning of the erratic English construction.</p>
        <p>In order to make the appearance of the printed version of the
journal more pleasing to the eye, and to enable the reader to grasp at a
glance the day of the month and the day of the week I have chosen to
insert the names of the months as chapter divisions and to give the date
<pb id="greenx" n="x"/>
and day as the key to each paragraph. In these two items only have
I departed from the original text. For the daily entry Blackford
generally gave the date followed by the day, e.g., 4th March. Sometimes
he reversed the order; sometimes he inserted the name of the month
between, and occasionally he inserted the year also. I have chosen to
make all daily entries uniform.</p>
        <p>The journal is filled with hundreds of names of Blackford's family,
relatives, visitors, acquaintances, strangers crossing the Potomac River
on the ferry, and Blackford's slaves and hired laborers. I have made no
attempt to identify all these people. It would have been impossible to
do so. I have identified those whose identity is essential to an understanding 
of the story. Most of these appear early in the text. I have
kept documentation to a minimum.</p>
        <p>I am indebted to many people for aid in this undertaking, most of
all to Mr. J. Howard Beckenbaugh who very graciously gave his consent
to publication of the journal. Mrs. Frank W. Mish, Jr., of the Washington 
County (Maryland) Historical Society was untiring in her efforts to
locate materials on Ferry Hill. The Clerk of the Court of Washington
County, made available John Blackford's will, deeds, and other legal
papers bearing on the Blackford family and plantation. The Institute
for Research in Social Science at the University of North Carolina gave
me a Grant-in-Aid for research and typed a clean copy of the journal.
I owe a special debt of gratitude to Miss Dena Neville, Secretary of the
Department of History at the University of North Carolina, who typed
the final copy and whose sharp eye and good judgment saved me from
errors which otherwise would have appeared in print.</p>
        <p>The University of North Carolina Research Council aided in both
the research for and the publication of the Ferry Hill Plantation Journal.</p>

BUILDING THE PLANTATION</head>
          <p>When the first settlers -  Germans, Irish, and Scotch-Irish from
Pennsylvania, and Dutch from New York -  began to push into western
Maryland in the 1720's they followed the old Indian and packhorse trail
from York, Pennsylvania. Those who wished to cross the Potomac
River into Virginia found the Packhorse Ford, one mile below the site
of the present Shepherdstown, West Virginia, the one and only good
crossing for many miles east or west of it. The area on both sides of the
Potomac had much to offer the newcomers: a salubrious climate, rich
and fertile soil, streams well stocked with fish and fields and forests
with game, numerous springs of excellent water and rapidly flowing
streams for power, limestone quarries for fertilizer and building stone,
and timber for fuel and lumber. The region was rapidly settled. Maryland 
organized Frederick County in 1748 with Frederick Town as the
seat of government and Washington in 1776 with the government at
Hagerstown. Virginia organized her Frederick County in 1743 with
Winchester as the seat of government and cut off Berkeley and
Jefferson counties from Frederick along the Potomac in 1772, with
Martinsburg and Shepherdstown as the county seats respectively.</p>
          <p>As the population increased Packhorse Ford no longer met the
needs for crossing the Potomac River, and in 1765 the Virginia Assembly 
authorized Thomas Shepherd, who had founded Shepherdstown,
to establish a ferry between the town and the Maryland side of the river.
Before he began the project, however, Shepherd learned that Thomas
Van Swearingen had already been authorized to establish a ferry from
the Maryland side and Shepherd abandoned his project. Swearingen
began the operation of his ferry in 1765 with charges of three pence per
person and the same for each horse. Shepherdstown agreed to maintain
a road from the town to the ferry landing on the Virginia side. Meanwhile 
Washington County, Maryland, constructed a road from Boonsboro 
via Sharpsburg to the Swearingen Ferry landing on the Maryland
side of the Potomac. Sherpherdstown had road connections with
Charles Town, later the county seat of Jefferson, Martinsburg, Winchester,
Harpers Ferry, and the Shenandoah Valley; and Boonsboro 
had road connections with Hagerstown, Frederick, and Baltimore,
<pb id="greenxii" n="xii"/>
Maryland. Hence Swearingen's Ferry was strategically located. It
was well patronized, and soon became a successful business enterprise.</p>
          <p>John Blackford, son of John Blackford “Captain of the Independence
Blues” of the American Revolution and an early and leading citizen of
Boonsboro, purchased land from Thomas Shepherd on the Maryland
side of the Potomac River. This land, which lay below the ferry, connected 
land already owned by Blackford with the ferry landing. In
1816 Blackford purchased from Henry Thomas Van Swearingen of
Shepherdstown, Virginia, his ferry together with his franchise, boats
and apparatus, three tracts of land in Maryland, namely “Antietam
Bottom,” “Ferry Landing,” and “Ferry 
Landing Enlarged,” and also
houses and unoccupied lots in Shepherdstown. He later acquired lands
from the Bedinger and Hays families which gave him contiguous holdings 
of above seven hundred acres of land. Thus was consolidated the
Swearingen Ferry and lands and the Blackford lands to be called
Ferry Hill Plantation.</p>
          <p>Blackford and his family lived in a large, two-story red brick house
which they called Ferry Hill Place. Erected in 1812 the house still
stands in 1961 although remodeled and somewhat changed. On Ferry
Hill Plantation were three other dwelling houses and “The Cottage”
erected by Van Swearingen for the ferry attendant. The three residences
were occupied in 1838 by Franklin, Blackford's married son, and Charles
and Joseph Knode, brother and nephew of Mrs. John Blackford. Franklin 
had his own business interests but gave some assistance to his father
in managing the plantation. The Knodes cultivated Blackford's land
on a rental basis paying him a share of the crops grown. Blackford
placed the ferry under the control of two of his slaves and rented “The
Cottage” and his houses in Shepherdstown, generally but not always,
to people employed on his plantation.</p>
          <p>Ferry Hill Plantation was located in a fertile and thickly populated
area. Joseph Scott, a well known geographer of his day, surveyed the
region in 1807 and reported that the lands of Washington County were
“esteemed equal if not superior in fertility to any in the state.” Another 
writer declared that the Antietam Valley was “remarkable for its
fertility and the wheat grown here is of the finest quality and is manufactured 
into superior brands of flour.” There were on Antietam
Creek some fourteen flour mills and several sawmills and iron works.
The average yield of wheat per acre in Washington County in 1840
was 34 bushels, of corn 26 bushels. The county led the state in per
acre yield of corn and was second in wheat. Other principal products
were oats, rye, hay, potatoes, apples, honey, livestock, limestone, and
lumber. Agriculture was conducted in a scientific manner; implements
of the most improved kind were used; livestock was improved by the
best of foreign breeds; and the rewards of planting were most gratifying.
<pb id="greenxiii" n="xiii"/>
The population of Washington County in 1840 was 28,850 of
which 24,724 were white, 2,546 were slave, and 1,580 were free
Negroes. A contemporary writer described the people of the area as
“noted for their thrift, intelligence, and prosperity.”</p>
          <p>Ferry Hill Place was located on the Potomac River four miles from
Sharpsburg, eleven from Boonsboro, twenty-two from Hagerstown, and
twenty-five from Frederick, Maryland, and less than three miles from
Shepherdstown and about fifteen from Harpers Ferry, Virginia. By
1838 it had turnpike connections with all these places and thence to
Baltimore, Maryland, and Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The turnpike to
Frederick crossed the National, or Cumberland Road to Wheeling,
Virginia. The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal ran through the plantation
on its way to Williamsport giving water transportation to Washington,
D. C. And the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad gave rail connection at
both Frederick and Harpers Ferry.</p>

THE BLACKFORD FAMILY</head>
          <p>John Blackford (July 18, 178-, November-, 1839) was a wealthy
and prosperous business man. In addition to his plantation and ferry
he owned stock in the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, the Baltimore Insurance 
Company, the Boonsboro Turnpike Company, and other unidentified 
business ventures. Furthermore he lent considerable sums of money
at interest. He was a public spirited leader in his community. He
served in the War of 1812 and commanded a company that, because of
its action at the disastrous battle of Bladensburg, was dubbed the
“Bladensburg Racers.” Despite the poor showing of his troops Captain
Blackford's reputation did not suffer. He at least was later promoted
to a colonelcy in the volunteers. He served for many years as a justice
of the peace; was supervisor of the public roads in his district; was
active in organizing and building the Boonsboro Turnpike; was a
delegate to several county conventions held to encourage the building
of the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and, when it was organized in 1828,
invested in its stock. In 1830 he was appointed to a committee of
Boonsboro citizens to try to get the Baltimore Conference of the
Methodist Episcopal Church to locate its proposed college in that town.
He never sought public office but presided over a county Democratic
Republican convention in 1828. He became an ardent Whig and on
occasion bitterly condemned the Democratic majority in the county
for what he termed “questionable action” in the 
conduct of local elections.
<pb id="greenxiv" n="xiv"/>
Blackford was a comunicant of the Episcopal Church but not a regular
attendant upon its services. He contributed to its support and to the
German Reformed, Presbyterian, and Methodist churches. He gave
handsome sums toward the building of new church edifices of both
Episcopal and German Reformed congregations, but he refused to contribute 
to the Maryland Bible Society.</p>
          <p>Blackford married into the Knode family which had migrated into
western Maryland and Virginia with the earliest German settlers from
Pennsylvania. His wife was an invalid for some years and was confined 
to her bed for most of the period covered by the Ferry Hill
Plantation Journal. Blackford was deeply devoted to her, gave her
all possible medical attention, sent her to the Belinda Springs, two miles
southeast of Sharpsburg, to take advantage of its medicinal waters, and
himself took her for a week's stay at the more famous Shannondale
Springs near Charlestown, Virginia. But all to no avail, Mrs. Blackford 
died on October 7, 1838.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Blackford bore her husband five children, three sons and two
daughters. Franklin, the eldest son, was married and had one child.
He and his wife Elizabeth lived in one of the dwelling houses on his
father's plantation. He engaged in various enterprises, among them
running a tavern, breeding horses, and operating a line of packet boats
on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. He sometimes assisted his father
in managing Ferry Hill, but did not seem to have his father's full confidence. 
Jeannette Y., Blackford's eldest daughter, married Dr. Otho
Josiah Smith of Boonsboro. He was a graduate of the University of
Maryland and had studied medicine under Dr. Charles MacGill of
Hagerstown. Blackford's second son Henry V. S. was a student at the
Mercersburgh (Pennsylvania) Academy in 1837-1839. Helena, the
youngest daughter, was unmarried and lived with her parents. William
Moore, the youngest child, was just beginning his schooling in 1838 at
Francis Deary's School in Boonsboro.</p>
          <p>Three of Blackford's wife's relatives lived on Ferry Hill Plantation.
Catherine Knode, a sister, never married and John Blackford, in his
will, provided for her an annuity for life. Charles Knode, a brother,
rented the Bedford Place from Blackford and cultivated it on shares.
Joseph Knode, a nephew, rented the Shepherd Farm as a share tenant.
He sometimes assisted Blackford with the plantation, boarded some of
his hired hands, and permitted his slaves to work in the fields with
Blackford's slaves. In fact it seems that slaves belonging to John
Blackford, Franklin Blackford, Mrs. Otho J. Smith, Charles Knode,
and Joseph Knode worked interchangeably for their respective masters.
The Knodes, a large clan, were frequent visitors at Ferry Hill Place.</p>

PLANTATION MANAGEMENT</head>
          <p>Blackford, like most Southern planters, was a busy and hard working
man. He did not of course do manual labor but he chose to manage his
plantation and supervise his varied business interests without the help
of an overseer. The only manual labor he reported doing during 1838
was to replace the crank and handle of a grindstone broken by one of his
hired laborers, and it took him the entire day to perform this minor task.
The only time he mentioned an overseer in his journal for 1838 was
when an overseer from a neighboring plantation sought a job with Blackford
because his current employer had decided to rent rather than
cultivate his plantation. Much of Blackford's time was spent in his
office where he kept the plantation journal published herewith, a financial
record of the ferry, records of his activities as a justice of the peace, and
other business transactions.</p>
          <p>As noted above Blackford rented farms to his son and two of his
wife's relatives. This relieved him of close supervision over the cultivation 
of these lands. How profitable his rental lands were the records
do not show. Joseph Knode paid him 385 bushels of corn, 138 3/4
bushels of wheat, and 85 1/2 bushels of rye for the Shepherd Farm in
1837. In addition Blackford received unspecified quantities of forage
including shucks and fodder from the corn, straw from wheat and rye,
and clover and timothy hay. Blackford appointed two of his slaves as
“Foremen of the Ferry.” They did the work themsleves, called on other
slaves to assist, and even hired free labor, both white and black, to
assist in rush periods. They kept the receipts from the ferry and were
permitted to spend money therefrom for supplies as the need arose.
They generally reported the receipts daily, but sometimes they did not
report for several days. Obviously Blackford devoted little of his
time to the management of the ferry.</p>
          <p>The slaves and hired laborers who did the general plantation work
carried on with a minimum of direct supervision. Occasionally Blackford 
might ride into the fields, the range, or the woods to give general
directions or to specify exactly what work was to be done. For instance,
“I rode out and marked off the land I wish cleared.” Blackford seems
to have found this system satisfactory. Certainly he recorded few
complaints about the work done. Blackford himself looked after his
rental property, including “The Cottage” and the houses in Shepherdstown. 
And he gave considerable time and attention to lending money
<pb id="greenxvi" n="xvi"/>
and supervising his investments. These affairs caused him considerable
difficulty and he employed Joseph I. Merrick, a prominent lawyer of
Hagerstown and Baltimore, to assist him in these matters.</p>
          <p>The most important money crop grown at Ferry Hill was wheat.
Blackford experimented with various types, particularly Blue Stem and
White, in an effort to increase the yield. Other crops grown were
corn, rye, oats, buckwheat, hay including timothy and red and white
clover, broom corn, potatoes, apples, pumpkins, turnips, hemp, and
flax. Blackford harvested his own seed and sold seed to the neighboring 
farmers and planters. He had his grain milled at Mumma's, Staub's,
and Glassford's mills located on Antietam Creek, and shipped flour
and meal to Baltimore for sale. Apples, vinegar, cider, apple butter,
and potatoes were sold in the local markets.</p>
          <p>Second in economic importance to general field crops at Ferry Hill
was timber. The forests supplied wood for fuel in the homes; posts,
rails, and palings for fences; and plank, scantling, and shingles to keep
the barns, stables, storage houses, and dwelling houses in repair. Blackford 
employed a large number of hired laborers for work in the woods
during the fall and winter months. He sold large quantities of wood
for fuel to the inhabitants of Shepherdstown, Sharpsburg, and Boonsboro. 
The wood sold for $2.50 per cord, and Blackford sold as many
as one hundred cords per year to a single customer in Shepherdstown.
Some householders sent their own laborers to cut and haul their wood.
In addition to wood for fuel Blackford sold posts, plank, scantling,
and shingles in considerable quantities. In some instances he sold logs to
the mills. He supplied various mills and factories with their particular
needs. For instance he sold the Antietam Iron Works gum, oak, and
hickory suitable for making helves for the huge hammers used in its
plant. And he sold timber to the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company
for fuel and repairs.</p>
          <p>The ferry across the Potomac River was an important adjunct to the
plantation. Blackford bought a one half interest in the ferry from Henry
Thomas Van Swearingen in 1816 for $900.00. He later bought the
remaining half from Mrs. Swearingen for an undisclosed sum. Blackford 
rarely failed to close the daily entry in his journal without some
comment on the ferry business. Usually it was a laconic note running
from “Very Poor” through “Poor,”  
“Tolerable,” “Middling,” “Good,”
to “Very Good.” The state franchise laid down general regulations for
ferriage but Blackford could fix specific charges. Thus the foremen
charged a sheep herder $4.00 for ferrying a herd of five hundred sheep
across the river but charged the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company
$133.16 for ferrying two loads of gun stocks destined for Harpers
<pb id="greenxvii" n="xvii"/>
Ferry. The foremen had some difficulty in agreeing upon charges for
a circus company. The owner appealed to Blackford and only after
“considerable haggling” did he pay the charges. The ferry was a
profitable investment. In 1837 it brought Blackford $697.00 above the
cost of operation. And it continued to yield a profit to Blackford's
son Franklin, to whom it descended in 1839, until he sold it to a company
which built a bridge across the river which in turn abandoned the ferry
in 1850.</p>
          <p>Blackford took great pride in livestock breeding of all sorts. He
raised enough hogs to supply Ferry Hill with ample pork, sausage, and
hams, with a surplus for sale. He cured his own meats and in 1838
bought a machine for making and stuffing sausage and liver pudding
which he found greatly facilitated the process. So successful was the
machine that neighboring planters made use of it. Blackford raised
sheep for food and wool. Among others he raised Saxons and Merinos.
The wool was processed on the plantation and made into coarse cloth
which the seamstress made into garments for the work force. Blackford
sent yarn to the Conrodt Woolen Mills in Frederick and had it made
into fine grade carpets. Blackford raised cattle to supply the plantation
with milk, butter, beef, and work oxen. He kept a blooded bull to maintain 
the quality of his herd. Blackford kept brood mares and a stallion
and raised horses to be used on the plantation. Occasionally he bred his
mares to stallions widely known throughout the region. Blackford
practiced the arts of a veterinarian, not always successfully. And he
raised bees, chickens, turkeys, and pea fowl. Feathers from the latter
were marketed in Washington, D. C.</p>
          <p>Blackford might be called a progressive farmer. He made extensive
use of natural manures and purchased agricultural lime which he applied 
to his grain and hay crops. Although he continued to use out-moded 
tools and time worn methods of cultivation he adopted and used
new and improved farm implements and machinery, including harrows
and rollers. Some of his grain was cut with scythes and hand cradles
but in 1838 he rented a harvesting machine, probably a McCormick
reaper, for cutting his wheat. Some grain was threshed by wooden flails
or by treading, but in 1838 Blackford used a threshing machine driven
by horses, and he owned a windmill, or as he called it a “revolving
machine,” powered by nine horses. He used blooded cattle, horses, hogs,
and sheep for improving his livestock. It is not known that Blackford
took any prizes at the local county agricultural society fair, but he
was certainly aware of the extensive prize lists, published in the local
newspaper, which included horses, cattle, sheep, hogs, poultry, wheat,
corn, rye, oats, clover, potatoes, domestic linsey and carpets, apples,
cider, and vinegar, all of which were produced at Ferry Hill.</p>

<lb/>
THE LABOR FORCE</head>
          <p>The Ferry Hill labor force consisted of twenty-five slaves and a
large number of hired workers. Among the slaves were seven young
children. Two of the adults regularly attended the Ferry and an unknown
number were household servants. The remainder worked at
whatever was to be done on the plantation -  cutting fire wood and saw
timber, caring for the livestock, planting, cultivating, and harvesting
the grain, hay, and apple crops, and such irregular jobs as filling the
two ice houses, and rebuilding the cistern and water works for Ferry
Hill Place. During the year three births were recorded, two of which
were stillborn.</p>
          <p>The slaves were generally satisfactory workers. Ned and Jupe,
who were assigned as “Foremen of the Ferry,” were never criticized
in regard to their work. Occasionally Blackford would complain that
some of the field hands or woodcutters were “piddling at the job”  but
only one severe criticism was recorded of any of the slaves workers.
Once, three slaves and an equal number of hired laborers, including one
German, were hauling wheat from the fields and storing it in the barns.
Blackford found their work wanting, and recorded of their activities,
“Bad planned and poorly managed Negroe dictation.”</p>
          <p>The slaves were generally trusted and rarely closely supervised. As
already noted Ned and Jupe were given full command of the Ferry.
They were <sic corr="permitted">premitted</sic> to hire extra labor 
at rush periods and to spend
money from the ferriage receipts without specific authorization. Other
slaves were sent to Shepherdstown, Sharpsburg, or even to Boonsboro
with cash with which to purchase groceries, tobacco, clothing, and
various other commodities. In fact Blackford once sent one of his
slaves to town to purchase trimming for a fancy vest he had had a tailor
cut for himself. They were permitted to drive horses and carriages to the
neighboring towns, and in no instant was this trust violated.</p>
          <p>The slaves were well clothed and well fed. Blackford bought clothing 
for his slaves individually and when needed, and did not distribute
it to them at stated periods in the fall and spring as most planters did.
In fact he often let the slave purchase his own clothing. The following
entries taken from the journal are typical. “Gave Ned $1.50 to pay
for a Blanket which he bought of Lane and Webb.”  “Gave Murf a new
coat good Lindsey.”  “Gave Will 12 1/2 cents to buy him some tobacco.” </p>
          <p>Blackford was most solicitous about the health and well-being of his
slaves. Little Caroline fell while playing in the barnyard and Doctor
<pb id="greenxix" n="xix"/>
Richard Parran was called to treat her bruises. Little George fell ill
and Blackford immediately sent for Doctor Parran to attend him.
When Hannah, Will's wife, was delivered of a female child Mrs.
Israel Fry a midwife attended her. Daphney, who was pregnant, was
taken ill and Doctor Parran and Mrs. Fry were both called. She had
a miscarriage and was hospitalized for eleven days.</p>
          <p>Blackford showered his slaves with special favors. In addition to
furnishing them with tobacco he bought and distributed whiskey to the
workers. He permitted them to visit the family and slaves of his
daughter, Mrs. Otho J. Smith, in Boonsboro. They drove a cart and
carried chickens, eggs, butter, and other such commodities to them.
Occasionally they were given stagecoach fare to make the trip of some
eleven miles to Boonsboro. Despite such treatment Blackford's slaves
were not a contented lot. Caroline, Daphney, Will, and Isaiah were all
reported as runaways more than once. Daphney, on one occasion, got
to Sharpsburg where she spent the night before Henry, who “went in
parsuit,”  overtook her. Isaiah, a house servant who was reported
“absent without parmition,”  went to Boonsboro. Were they merely
taking advantage of their liberties; were they stimulated in their efforts
by the numerous free Negroes who resided in the neighborhood; or did
they seek freedom as a natural right?</p>
          <p>Some of the Blackford slaves were an ill-behaved lot. They frequently 
indulged in excessive use of liquor. Ned, a foreman of the
Ferry was reported by Helen Blackford to be “quite much intoxicated” 
at high noon. Again he “came up from the Ferry after dark quite stupid
with liquor.”  The following entries in the Journal are typical. “Murf
and Julious both drunk.”  “Murf drunk as usual,”  
“Murf down at the
ferry pretty drunk.”  Blackford, who reported that he once got “very
high” on champagne when on a business trip to Hagerstown, did not
punish his slaves for drunkenness. In fact he seemed to condone the
practice, and once excused them for being a little “slow and stiff” at
the harvesting of wheat because “they had no bitters the whiskey which
they all love dearly has given out.”</p>
          <p>But Blackford did not fail to administer punishment when he felt it
was deserved. Careless or deliberate destruction of property he would
not tolerate. Enoch “suffered the grey mare to run off and broke off
shafts of the cart”  and Blackford “corrected him. . .
by giving him a few
lashes.”  “Isaiah sat the peoples victuals down and the hoggs destroyed
it,”  and Blackford “whipped him.”  Again Blackford 
“punished Isaiah
pretty severely for his misconduct.”  Among other offenses recorded,
several of which went unpunished, were “use of profane language,” 
“bad conduct eave dropping and attempt to break into [Blakney's]
house,”  “Caroline behaved bad in the kitchen,”  
“Ned beat Little John,” 
“Jupe and Caroline behaved bad,”  and Ned 
“confessed to the destruction
<pb id="greenxx" n="xx"/>
of 2 pea cocks.”  Two of the young slaves 
“little Caroline”  and
“little George”  were accused of “pilfering money”  
from members of the
Blackford family but neither charge was proven.</p>
          <p>Judging from the record Blackford was a kindly, even indulgent,
master. His slaves were well fed, well clothed, worked almost entirely
without supervision, were given all sorts of special privileges, were given
the same sort of medical care as members of their master's family, and
were not severely punished. Blackford hired out two of his slaves to
close personal friends and in each case the contract called for 
“good and
sufficient clothing and provisions.”  Finally, in his will 
Blackford declared
“It is my will and desire that care shall be taken to prevent any
of my slaves being sold out of the State or to slave traders or their
agents unless for grave faults, or to any but humane and good masters.”</p>
          <p>Blackford employed a large number of hired laborers for seasonal
farm work, for cutting wood and timber, and for special jobs such as
filling the ice houses and repair work on barns and houses. Some few
were hired for the year. The hired laborers included native whites,
foreigners whom Blackford called Germans, Dutch, Scotch, Irish and
Italian, free Negroes, slaves belonging to his neighbors, and Indians.
Most of these were unskilled workers but Blackford occasionally hired
skilled carpenters and brick masons. The latter were employed to remodel
his own house and to rebuild a cistern and water works. It
is impossible to say just how many workers Blackford employed, but a
count for two months in 1838 discloses 3 slaves, 4 free Negroes, 3
Indians, 2 Dutchmen, 6 Germans, 1 Irishman, 1 Italian, and 21 local
whites. Nor is there sufficient evidence to generalize about wages or
the quality of work done. One white man was paid $1.00 per day, a
white woman 62 1/2 cents, and a Negro girl 87 1/2 cents in wheat harvesting.
An old man who did what Blackford called “piddling work”  was
given his keep, a little tobacco, and an occasional sum of money for
making fence palings. An “old Negro”  was hired to make brooms of
broom corn grown on the plantation at 6 1/4 cents each. One free Negro
cut 18 1/2 cords of wood, split 550 fence rails, and sawed blocks for
shingles and logs for lumber, but his wages were not recorded. One
white laborer split 2,640 shingles by hand, a carpenter pulled off the
old roof on the barn and smokehouse on Shepherd Farm and nailed on
6,800 shingles on the house in Shepherdstown. The brick mason who
rebuilt the cistern and water works at Ferry Hill Place was engaged in
the task for more than a month.</p>
          <p>The hired laborers generally proved satisfactory workers, but they
occasionally fell under condemnation. For instance two free Negro
wood cutters were denied the use of Blackford's grindstone because
“they had carelessly broken the handle off of the crank.”  Isaac Widows,
a white wood cutter also “broke the crank of my grindstone. I conclude
<pb id="greenxxi" n="xxi"/>
he is very Trifeling.”  Martin Shellman, another white man and a
“trifeling fellow,”  was discharged but continued 
on the place and “ate
in the kitchen with the Negroes.”  Both these men had been employed
for the year and both were re-employed after having been discharged.</p>
          <p>Blackford's chief grievance against his hired laborers was their
excessive use of whiskey. He himself contributed to this habit by serving
them liquor and by furnishing them money to purchase it for themselves. 
On one occasion Nicholas and Martin came to work, but
“booth are for a sprey.”  Blackford gave 
“Nicholas $2.75 and Martin
$1.00 which will keep them drunk for some time.”  After Shellman
“went on a sprey for more than a week,”  which he had spent in
Sharpsburg and where he had taken one of Blackford's sheep dogs,
Blackford called him in on August 26 and gave him a lecture on
whiskey drinking. “He said he would quit and drink no more.”  On
September 4, Blackford wrote “Shellman making shingles, sober and
stedy”; September 20, “Shellman still perfectly sober.”  Blackford
thought he had worked a cure. But alas, on September 30, “Shellman
came in the evening. has been Drunk in Sharpsburg all last night.” 
A few days later a stranger called and asked for a job but Blackford
decided “he looked like a drinker therefore I would not imploy him.” 
It might be noted that Blackford treated his hired laborers as individuals 
be they black or white, slave or free, and judged each on his
own merits. One example will suffice. Isaac Widows, a white man
employed for the year, “called wants meat, bread, &amp; money gave him
none. Negro George came, gave him $1 to purchase a hat.”</p>

<lb/>
SOCIAL AND CULTURAL LIFE</head>
          <p>The members of the Blackford family seem never to have had a
dull moment. Situated in a thickly populated area and within easy
driving distance of Hagerstown, Boonsboro, and Sharpsburg, Maryland,
and Shepherdstown and Harpers Ferry, Virginia, Ferry Hill Place
was hardly ever without one or more visitors, some of whom spent
days and weeks at a time. Furthermore the Ferry led many travelers
and strangers to stop at the plantation house. Many of Blackford's close
friends and relatives called every day to inquire about Mrs. Blackford's
health and dined or supped with them, and travelers often ate at the
plantation. A check for one month shows that daily callers ranged
from two to ten, those who dined ranged from two to five, those who
spent the night ranged from two to four, and that individual guests remained 
three, five, nine, and twenty-four days. Some came, like Miss
<pb id="greenxxii" n="xxii"/>
Berry of Sharpsburg, to bring delicacies, “cake and jelly for Mrs.
B” and remained for only a few minutes. Some were business men,
and some laborers seeking employment. And among them were Scotsmen
seeking subcriptions to magazines and Irish and German peddlers with
their packs on their backs.</p>
          <p>The Blackford family, white and black, suffered many ills. Mrs.
Blackford had been ill for some time before January 4, 1838, when
the journal opens. Dr. Richard Parran paid professional calls nearly
every day for several months, sometimes twice per day. But
he was also a close friend and he, his wife, and the widow of Doctor
Charles MacGill paid many social calls and often dined at Ferry Hill
Place. Dr. Otho J. Smith, Blackford's son-in-law, paid professional
calls as did Mrs. Israel Fry, a midwife who attended the Blackford
slave women. But she also paid social calls. Blackford himself administered 
drugs and patent medicines to members of both his black and
white families. These medicines included Sedlitz Powers, Brandreth
Pills, castor oil, calomel, epsom salts, spirits of niter, saltpeter, magnesia,
and laudanum.</p>
          <p>Another person who was often at Ferry Hill Place was Mrs. Nafe,
a seamstress. She seems to have made most of the clothing for the
slaves and much of that for the Blackford family. Blackford and his
sons patronized tailors in the nearby towns who measured and cut their
garments but Mrs. Nafe would sew the garments which the tailor had
cut. This was true also of the clothing of his wife and daughter. But
Mrs. Nafe was more than a hired worker, she was a friend and she
and her daughter were often guests in the home.</p>
          <p>Blackford was a well educated and widely read man; his family too
was educated and well read. Blackford was an avid reader of the
Baltimore <hi rend="italics">Patriot</hi> and always noted in his journal the failure of its
arrival. He also subscribed to the Hagerstown 
<hi rend="italics">Torch Light</hi>, the New
York <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi>, a Virginia paper probably 
the Richmond <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi>, and an
unidentified Philadelphia paper. He subscribed to the 
<hi rend="italics">American Farmer</hi>
of Baltimore and the <hi rend="italics">Ladies' Companion</hi> of New York. His library
consisted of a “Large collection of books”  including encyclopaedias,
dictionaries, a set of <hi rend="italics">State Papers</hi>, 
history, classics, and biographies.
Among the latter were John Marshall's <hi rend="italics">Life of 
Washington</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Plutarch's 
Lives</hi>. Blackford's son Franklin and other young men of the
vicinity made use of both the newspapers and books at Ferry Hill
Place. Blackford sent one of his sons, Henry, to the well known
Mercersburgh (Pennsylvania) Academy and the youngest one, William,
to Francis Dreary's School in Boonsboro. It was to please Henry that
Blackford subscribed to the Philadelphia newspaper.</p>
          <p>The Blackford family was deeply religious and, except for Blackford
himself, were ardent churchgoers. Blackford was a member of the
<pb id="greenxxiii" n="xxiii"/>
Episcopal Church, Mrs. Blackford of the Presbyterian and the children
were divided in their affiliation. Jeannette married a Roman
Catholic. The other children attended various churches, including
Episcopal, Presbyterian, Methodist, Lutheran, German Reformed, and
Dunkard. They attended also inter-denominational revival services in
Sharpsburg and a camp meeting in Pleasant Valley. The Blackfords
entertained seven different ministers, two Episcopalian, two Presbyterian, 
and one Methodist, one Dunkard, and one German Reformed, at
Ferry Hill Place during the year. All of them dined at least once and
two of them spent the night. The family contributed regularly to the
support of the Episcopal, Presbyterian, and German Reformed churches
and made large contributions to building both Episcopal and German
Reformed edifices. They also made small contributions to the Methodist
church program.</p>
          <p>The Blackfords enjoyed the social life typical of the rural farmer and
planter class. Men and boys enjoyed fishing and hunting and the
women quilting parties. Blackford himself took great delight in shooting 
foxes because of their destruction of birds and poultry. Franklin
shot quail and pigeons in Virginia which abounded in great numbers
“flying in all directions.”  The young people of both sexes enjoyed boat
riding on the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal during the summer and skating
and sleigh riding in the winter. They organized “Oyster Parties”  at 
Shepherdstown and “fishing parties”  at “Anti Eatem”  
Creek, as Blackford
always wrote it. Three circuses made their appearance at Shepherdstown 
and Boonsboro during the summer of 1838 one of which the
Blackford boys attended “to the great dissatisfaction of their mother.” 
The Blackfords also enjoyed the visits of Irish and German peddlers
from whom they purchased linens and trinkets. They joined in the public
celebration of Washington's birthday and July Fourth in Shepherdstown
where they enjoyed military parades, martial music, and the firing
of small arms as well as the “refreshments at the Springs as customary.” 
But Blackford looked askance at the “Fandango barbacue or whatever
you call it”  given in the park.</p>
          <p>The Blackfords enjoyed visits to the Virginia Springs, to Hagerstown
and Harrisburg, and to Washington and Baltimore. All members of the
family made short visits to the Belinda Springs near Sharpsburg where
they took the baths and the mineral water, and enjoyed the social entertainment. 
On these trips they were often entertained by Colonel John
Miller's family who were devoted friends of long standing. Blackford
and his sons visited Hagerstown and Harrisburg chiefly on business
but on one of his trips he attended a party at Kalhoofers “where we
drank prety freely of Champain wine,”  and he arose the next morning
“with head ache and bad feelings from having taken too much Champain.”  
Blackford and his daughter Helena made an extended business
<pb id="greenxxiv" n="xxiv"/>
and pleasure trip by boat to Washington, thence by train to Baltimore
and back home. They were accompained by Colonel and Mrs. Miller
and their daughter. In Washington they visited the City Hall, the
Capitol, and the White House where they talked with President Martin
Van Buren. They attended musical performances at Miss English's
Female School and other salons. Blackford took his wife to the
Shannondale Springs in the Shenandoah Valley where they spent a week
and took the medicinal waters and baths and enjoyed a quiet and peaceful 
rest. The season was over, so they saw few people and found little
social entertaining.</p>
          <p>Various exciting incidents and accidents occurred at Ferry Hill.
Among others was the drowning of a horse that fell from the tow path
into the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal. More tragic was the accidental
drowning of a young man in the Potomac River. He was a member of
a skating party. The thin ice broke and he sank beneath the surface
and was drowned before his companions could rescue him. The
incident that caused greatest excitement, however, was the robbery at
Ferry Hill Place. While Blackford was away at the Shannondale
Springs a slave boy, belonging to Dr. Joseph Hays of Sharpsburg, broke
into his office and took $170.77 from his cash box. “Yealow boy
Charles,”  as Blackford called him, was tried and convicted of the crime
in the Washington County Superior Court on November 27, 1838.</p>

          <p>John Blackford, author of the Ferry Hill Plantation Journal published
herewith, died from a lingering illness in less than a year after he made
the last entry in the Journal on January 15, 1839. In his will, dated
November 1, 1839, he disposed of his large estate. He divided Ferry
Hill Plantation among his three sons. To Franklin he bequeathed lands
purchased from Thomas Van Swearingen, including the Ferry, the Ferry
House Landing and Lot, together with the boats and apparatus, the
franchises and privileges, and the Landing in Virginia and the land
thereto attached. In addition Franklin was given Orchard Field, the
Lot along the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal, and the dwelling house and
vacant lot in Shepherdstown. With the Ferry went Edmund and Julious
the Foremen. Henry Blackford was given Ferry Hill Place. William
Moore Blackford was given the Lower Farm, the Shepherd Place, the
Bedford or Bedinger Farm, and his father's gold watch. Jeannette Smith,
Blackford's eldest daughter, received $12,000 in money and her mother's
gold watch. Helena Blackford received $12,000 and the family portraits.
<pb id="greenxxv" n="xxv"/>
Catherine Knode, Blackford's wife's sister, received the income on
$3,333.00 which yielded an annuity of $200.00 for life. After the above
bequests were taken care of the executors were to sell the other property
and divide the proceeds equally among the five children.</p>
          <p>The executors ordered a public sale of Blackford's personal estate
to begin on December 10, 1839. The inventory of the property reveals a
house well stocked with sliver; a large quantity of Brussels, Ingrain, and
Garth carpets some completely new; a large number of mahogany and
cherry bedsteads, tables, sofas, lounges and secretaries; eight dozen
Windsor chairs; a “Large Collection of valuable books”; lamps of all
kinds; glass ware, clocks, and Williams and Frankin stoves; and a great
variety of kitchen furniture. The plantation was stocked with work and
breeding horses; milk, beef, and breeding cattle; fifty fat hogs and
numerous brood sows and stock hogs; a large herd of Saxon and Merino
sheep; wagons, carts, plows, cultivators, rollers, and wind mills; large
quantities of hay, wheat, rye, corn, oats, hemp, and flax; timber, plank,
shingles, locust posts, saw logs, and fire wood; a blacksmith shop and
saw mill; a carriage, barouche, sleigh, gig, cart, and harness; and,
finally, sixteen slaves. The executors reported $30,917.22 derived from
the sale. No report was made on debts collected, sale of stocks and
shares, or the Kentucky lands Blackford is known to have purchased.</p>
          <p>A clearer understanding of the value of the estate may be gotten
from the knowledge that in 1846 Henry Blackford sold Ferry Hill
Place to his brother Franklin for $17,180. Assuming that the portions
of the landed estate which fell to Franklin and William were about equal
in value to that which went to their brother, John Blackford left a landed
estate of something like $52,000 exclusive of the land in Kentucky. His
personal estate amounted to about $54,000, exclusive of the value of
shares in various business enterprises and money, certainly over $2,500,
at interest. The total would have amounted to about $110,000, a very
handsome estate in 1840.</p>

 The Chesapeake and Ohio Canal Company experienced much difficulty with
its laborers. These difficulties involved conflicts between the rival Corkconians and
Langford Irish groups, between the Irish and the Germans, and between the
workers and contractors over pay. In 1838 the company dismissed and 
blacklisted some trouble makers, the militia burned about fifty shanties near Hancock,
the police arrested and the courts tried, convicted, and imprisoned twenty-odd
labor leaders. See Walter S. Sanderlin, <hi rend="italics">The Great

distinguished naval career. He saw service in the undeclared war with France
1798-1799, the Tripolitan campaign, and the War of 1812. But in 1826 he ran into

            <item>Numerous plantation journals have been published but practically
all of them are of staple crop plantations located in the lower South.
They are quite different than Blackford's journal of Ferry Hill
Plantation but are excellent for comparisons and contrasts. Among
the more important are:</item>
