        <p>My only apology for writing whatever may appear on the 
following pages is that I may leave on record a brief synopsis 
of my very tame and uneventful life; that my four little grandsons 
of whom I am very proud, may have an opportunity in 
after life to take a slight glance at some of the events transpiring 
in the short life of their paternal grandfather, in the hope
that they may improve on my successes (if it can be said that I
have had such) and profit by my mistakes which have been 
many. To them - Raymond Trice Carroll, John Murchison Carroll, 
Thomas Burns Carroll, and Kirk McKenzie Carroll - the 
following lines are affectionately dedicated by their grandfather,</p>

          <p> My great grandfather Carroll immigrated to this country 
from Ireland many years before the Revolutionary War. Landing 
in Maryland, the family drifted into North and South 
Carolina and finally some of them to Tennessee. He and several 
brothers were in the American army during the entire war, 
as were also some of his oldest sons. Grandfather Joseph Carroll 
was about eighty years of age at the close of the Revolutionary 
War, as he has related to me many times by way of entertainment 
with many other stirring scenes calculated to live 
in the tablets of the mind of a small but intensely interested 
boy. He emigrated to Middle Tennessee in his young manhood, 
bringing with him five thousand dollars, quite a little 
fortune for that day and time, where he engaged in farming. 
Let me say in regard to his character that he was one of those 
big-hearted, open-handed Irishmen, who loved a dram and occasionally 
took too much, and when in those happy moods became 
endorser for other men, which finally nearly exhausted 
all his means, leaving himself and family in straitened circumstances. 
(Boys, become surety for no man.)</p>
          <p>He soon after emigrated to West Tennessee, settling in Henderson County, then sparsely settled. Here he recuperated 
somewhat, his lost fortune, but never fully. About this time 
war was declared by the United States against Great Britain. 
He immediately volunteered and took part in the battle of 
New Orleans, Jan. 8th, 1815. It was of great interest to me 
when a lad to have him relate to me some of the many incidents 
of camp life and of how he and some comrades on the evening 
before the battle walked down the line of battle and found one 
<pb id="carroll4" n="4"/>
poor fellow down praying and crying, scared almost to death, 
before there had been a shot fired, and of how they upbraided 
him for his cowardice; about the death of Gen. Pakenham, the 
British general, etc. These recitals fired my youthful heart 
with a burning patriotism and how I wished to wear a uniform; 
to hear strains of martial music and the roar of cannon; and 
see glorious war. I thought such things would never come in 
my day, but alas! they did.  Let the sequel tell.</p>
          <p>Of my mother's people I knew but little, save that they immigrated 
to this country shortly after the Revolutionary War 
from Scotland. My mother's maiden name was Susan Ann
Burns, a Christian woman in deed and in truth, small in <sic>statue</sic> 
never weighing as much as one hundred pounds in her life; 
afflicted always after I knew her, but ever cheerful, always 
looking well to the wars of her household.  She ate not the 
bread of idleness.</p>
          <p>My mother's eldest brother, Samuel Burns, was elected 
Major of a volunteer <sic>batallion</sic> to go to New Orleans with Gen.
Jackson, but, arriving at the place of rendezvous too late, 
he with his command, was among the number that were refused,
owing to the great number of men offering their service. Many 
were turned away sadly disappointed.</p>
          <p>My father, William Carroll, was born in Lincoln county, Tennessee, 
and came to Henderson County, Tennessee, where he 
lived and died. He was a farmer all his life, never held an
office but twice, once Justice of the Peace and for two years
Tax Collector of his county, being elected to these positions by 
votes of his fellow citizens. In politics, always a Democrat. 
What might be called a rugged man, to principle he adhered 
with all the tenacity of his nature. Of a mean, low trick 
he was never guilty; principle was all with him. To the appeals 
for help from the widow and orphan, his hand was ever open; 
of his small means he contributed freely to those in distress. </p>

          </head>
          <p>The  writer of these pages was born in Henderson County, 
Tennessee, Nov. 28th, 1841, near 57 years ago. My earliest 
recollections of life are those of absolute pleasure, associated 
as they are with the remembrance of one of the kindest of 
mothers, a father who looked after my interest, a doting grandfather, who lived just across the farm half a mile from our 
house, who had me believe I was one of the grandest of boys, 
two grandmothers who thought I was quite a hero generally, 
one of whom, Grandmother Burns, made her home part of the 
time at my father's house. Here I was not scolded or petted 
but dealt with as though I were a real gentleman, which I 
appreciated very much. When I did wrong, which I frequently did, the matter was discussed with me as one of the auditors 
and frequently I thought before the conversation ended that, 
should I be naughty again, <sic>grandpapa</sic>, whom I dearly loved, 
would hardly ever speak to me again. Thus I was deterred 
from a repetition, but perhaps did other mischief equally wrong.</p>
          <p>Of our immediate family there were seven children - three 
boys and four girls - I, being the eldest; J. C. Carroll of this 
county, next; Dr. J. R. Carroll, now of this town, youngest. Of 
my sisters, Martha the eldest, many years since dead; Emily 
next, now living; Cynthia Ann died five years ago; Virginia, 
the youngest, died in infancy.</p>
          <p>My earliest friendship, outside of our own little family, was 
for a little black-haired, black-eyed girl of about my age - five 
summers. She came with her mother frequently to visit at 
my father's house; welcome guests indeed were they, especially 
to me.  Puss Grissom was her name and a dear little child of 
<pb id="carroll6" n="6"/>
sweet disposition and gentle manners. Such delightful romps 
and such happy hours I have seldom, if ever, experienced since. 
My mind runs back to those happy hours when the watchful 
care of our mothers was upon us, when the sins and sophistries 
of the world were unknown to us. And to them I hope troubles 
are still unknown. When I think of these things, I am reminded 
of a saying of the Master: “Suffer little children to come unto 
me, and forbid them not: for of such is the kingdom of Heaven. ” 
Well do I remember on one occasion that this friend and I 
wandered along down the spring branch that ran from my 
grandfather's spring, gathering wild flowers as we went, which 
grew luxuriantly and of rare fragrance all along the banks of 
the tiny rill. We traveled on gathering flowers until we were 
lost, but fortunately for us we did not know it; for we did 
not remember how we had come. Our barefooted tracks in 
the sand told of our ramble and led to our safe return. Soon 
after this her father moved away to some other country, which 
gave us sadness, but happily for us only such as passed quickly 
away. We have never met since, probably never will, but, 
wherever she is, in whatsoever clime, I hope she is happy. I 
remember vividly her merry laughter, her gentle voice, yet, 
it has been more than fifty years since we parted.</p>
          <p>My next very dear friendship was formed in this way: A 
little boy, a little older than I, visiting my father's house one 
day, brought with him as a present for me a square-plait whip 
- the first thing of the sort I had ever seen and of which I 
was very proud. Such a present and such a friend! He was a 
noble, brave, generous, manly boy and thank God he is living 
today - August, 1898. Having known him all these years, I 
can truthfully testify that he has borne out in manhood those 
noble traits of character exhibited in his youth and occupies 
now, as then, a place second to no one in my esteem. On my 
first visit to his home he treated me most royally; he led me 
into the mysteries of crawling through the fence cracks and 
how to turn my head to one side so as not to hurt my nose and 
how to catch and ride wild cattle - that is - as far as we were 
able to sit on them, which was but a short distance at a time, 
<pb id="carroll7" n="7"/>
being thrown almost as often as we mounted. As we grew up, 
our friendship was never cooled but rather intensified - my 
father having moved nearer to where his father lived. We 
were ever afterwards friends. We helped roll logs together, 
husk the corn, etc. We both entered the Confederate army in 
1861 - he, in one regiment and I, in another. After the war we 
played on the violin together, worked in the fields during 
the days we could, lay in the woods and guarded our horses 
at night to protect them from the <sic>tories</sic> who nightly prowled 
around the premises of Southern men to see if there was any 
chance to steal. Later we were partners in business; always 
Democrats; always friends. Such friendships as these, being 
mutual, are beneficial and always worth cultivation. Never to 
betray a trust reposed in either nor to go back on a friend has 
been a part of our motto, and has been religiously and sacredly 
lived up to by both of us. This good friend was J.N.  Galbraith 
now of Center Point, Tennessee.</p>

            <emph rend="bold"> My First Home.</emph>
          </head>
          <p>During the sixth year of my age my father, owning no land
where he lived, purchased a small tract about four miles away,
which was a primeval forest, near which place lived Esq. Jno.
H. Galbraith. Preparations for a move began right away and
consisted in my father going on the place, axe in hand, cutting
away the timber and making sufficient opening to set a house.
This done, he began felling small trees, eight to ten inches in
diameter, cutting them off at required length, hauling them
to the selected spot, inviting the neighboring citizens to help
to raise the house; a dinner was prepared and sent to the
place, and a gallon of whiskey completed the arrangements.
On each of the four corners of the house was a man whose duty
it was to notch the logs down, one upon another, being handed
to them by other men who were on the ground; thus the work
<pb id="carroll8" n="8"/>
proceeded, interspersed with much good feeling, and friendly 
jests until the last log was put up. Then one piece was put 
upon either end of the house extending about 24 inches out 
from either side; on the outer end of this, on either side, was 
placed a long pole called an abutment, against which the ends 
of the boards were to rest. Then the pieces on the ends were 
shorter and shorter to the top. Now we were ready for the 
boards which were laid on, and a pole of sufficient weight put 
on them to hold them down and so on to the top; then we 
began and chopped into the logs of the house on each side and 
hewed them down thus taking off the rough bark; this done, 
we proceeded to nail boards on the inside of the cracks between 
the logs and to fill up the outside of the openings with 
mud; this done, we had a warm cabin; we then began laying 
the floor which was made usually of puncheons hewn out and 
put down as closely as could be done with a hand axe; next, long 
riven boards were gotten out and shaved as smoothly as possible 
and a door shutter made of them hung on wooden hinges,
which usually made a loud creaking noise on being opened or 
closed. The place for a fire was usually four to six feet wide, 
built upon the outside with logs and laid on the inside with 
mortar and rocks, the hearth back and all up to where the 
chimney proper started, which was built of sticks and mud. 
This completed, our humble mansion was ready for occupancy. 
We had no saw mills then as now, driven by steam, nor nails 
with which to fasten down boards or plank. Such things of 
course were in use, I suppose, in some places, but for lack of 
money on our part did not extend to us. We moved in and began 
making rails and building a rail fence around the house. 
We built a log stable for a horse a smoke-house for our meat 
and a log house for a corn crib, and dug a well. By the time 
this was all done, it was springtime - March. Father went to 
clearing a piece of land and I, to piling brush, being the eldest 
and only help at this time. Late in the season we succeeded in 
getting six acres of land cleared and planted in corn which 
of course made only a poor crop on account of the shade being 
too dense to admit the growth of corn hence the yield was 
<pb id="carroll9" n="9"/>
small. However we continued to clear land and build till 
father had a good small farm of rich land for that section. 
Thus in course of time better buildings took the place of our 
primitive log cabin. We were possibly as happy as if our surroundings 
had been better, that is, we children; for this was 
all we knew. The labor which we did, though hard, was no 
particular hardship to us, as we knew nor thought of anything 
else.</p>

            <emph rend="bold">My First School.</emph>
          </head>
          <p>About my eighth year I started for school, father leading 
the way, axe in hand, cutting off a limb here and a brush 
there. I blazed a tree first on one side and then on the other, 
of the newly made path, that brother and I might have a guide 
to and from the school. (This school generally lasted from
ten to twelve weeks. At least from the time we got through 
our crops until time to take the fodder, we were continuously 
in school.) On arriving at the Seminary we found quite 
a pleasant-looking gentleman in charge - Mr. R. G. Hughes, who 
proved to be what his appearance indicated, a real good fellow. 
Those who wished to, studied; those who did not relish 
studying, were not compelled.</p>
          <p>Our school building was as primitive as our residence. 
Round logs composed the body of the house; it had a dirt floor 
or rather no floor at all; a large fire-place occupied almost one 
entire end of the building. Round logs had been split open in 
the middle, the splinters hewn off on the split side, holes bored 
in from the bark side, and long pins, put in them from that 
side as supports, furnished the seats for the pupils. These 
seats were from some cause always made high so that many 
of the small children's feet reached no nearer the floor, than 
from six to eighteen inches. There we sat and swung our feet 
from morning until noon and from noon until dismissal. Our 
<pb id="carroll10" n="10"/>
writing desk consisted of one long plank put up on pins along 
one side of the house; one of the long benches being used for 
a seat, and of extra height; a log was cut out of the house 
just over the writing bench to admit the light. Many were the 
little notes we passed and slipped into each other's copy books 
while learning to write. At school, we all spelt aloud and read 
aloud; sometimes we could have been heard two hundred yards 
away, especially on Friday evenings when we had a spelling 
match, which was an evening of great excitement and looked
to with much interest. Not much school, you think, which is 
true, as compared with the older communities, or with our 
modern colleges, built of brick, warmed by hot air and lighted 
by electricity but then it was a school, the best we had, and did
much good. I attended this school three sessions from eight 
to twelve weeks at a time in so many years. During this time 
I learned to spell and read fairly well and to write a fairly
legible hand. I also learned the multiplication table, possibly 
to add simple numbers, but there was no such thing in our 
school as a history, geography or English grammar in fact I 
never saw an English grammar until I was almost grown, hence 
pass over grammatical mistakes as lightly as possible.</p>
          <p>It was the custom of our professor to allow the first who arrived 
in the morning to recite first that day and many were 
the mornings that we almost flew in our efforts to be first. Of the
girls and boys who attended this school many remained in the 
country and grew to be stalwart men and women and helped
to make the country what it now is. </p>

          </head>
          <p>Grandfather came by our house on his way to the store, riding 
horseback. I mounted on the same horse behind him. On 
our arrival at the store, I thought I had almost entered a new
world and to me it was: such fancy goods, such nice pictures,
such nice glassware, etc., and above all such shining tinware. 
I had never dreamed of such a beautiful place as this being 
on earth. I feasted my eyes on the new things while grand-
father chatted away with the storekeeper. When ready to 
leave for home he asked me what I wanted and gave me what 
I called for - a new tin bucket of which I was very proud and
thankful. Encouraged by this adventure, I some time later 
made another trip to another store with some company and 
some mode of transportation; this time there was a gentleman
playing on a violin, the sound of which was extremely pleasing
to me and it looked so easy for the man to play; it just seemed
that anyone could do that; so grandfather when he was ready 
to leave for home asked me in his good-natured broad Irish
accent: “Me lad, what do ye want?” I said: “That fiddle,
Grandpa.” He told the gentleman to hand it to me which he 
did. Of course I felt supremely happy, but found it would 
not play for me as it would for the owner; so I did not succeed
in making a musician, for which I have no special regrets. </p>

          <p>During these years of attending Hughes academy, clearing and
fencing land, it was necessary for me to take part in all 
the duties of the household, my mother being always a delicate 
woman in feeble health a great part of the time confined 
to the bed, unable to do her work, and father too poor 
to hire it done. The younger children and I learned early to 
do all kinds of work - milk the cows, churn the milk, cook a
meal of victuals, etc. It was sometimes the case that brother
and I would take the clothing of the family to the well and 
wash them, which we cheerfully did. We sometimes felt a little 
mortified at seeing other young people of our age pass by 
in good clothes and happy, while we were bent over the washtub. 
All this feeling was wrong in us; all labor is honorable, 
it matters not what it is, and washing being hard work I think
boys should assist in doing the work where the family has it 
to do. Boys are much stronger than girls, as a rule and should
always assist their mother and sisters in doing the hard work
about the place.</p>
          <p>During these years we had another professor at the Hughes
academy, Mr. Smith, a good man; and one other, Mr. T. J.
Bailey, also a fine man and who prided himself very much 
upon the correct understanding of Webster's Blue Back Spelling 
Book. So we were put through again and again and inaccuracies 
of other teachers printed out. We now entered upon 
the study of arithmetic, Pike's old work being the standard at
that time; it treated mostly of shillings and pence - old English 
money - a thing obsolete as far as our currency is concerned. 
So under this professor, studying eight weeks in a year during
the summer solstice, in two years I actually got as far as the 
<pb id="carroll13" n="13"/>
rule of three, as well as I remember, about the thirtieth page 
of the book; and here my educational labors ceased. I am 
just a little sorry that I can not have a photo of this professor.
Unfortunately he was very lame, one leg being much shorter 
than the other; and one eye seemed smaller than the other. 
Seated upon a high chair, a long black hickory being conveniently 
near, woe to the child whom the professor caught 
not spelling or reading aloud, or smiling at the rosy-cheeked
girls, or fixing a pin in the seat so that the nest boy might 
sit upon it. Engaging in any of these to us seemed little harmless 
pastimes. On such occasions the professor would rise in
his chair and pitch that long black hickory at the <sic>violater</sic> who
must pick it up and carry it to the professor and after a few
preliminaries square himself and take a whipping, very much
to the edification of the school and to the advancement of education 
in those parts.</p>
          <p>Sometime during these years I saw my first book-agent who
called at my father's house to spend the night. After supper 
he exhibited his books. Among the number was Bunyan's Pilgrim's 
Progress; after looking through it, I was very anxious 
to own it; but in this case, as in many others, I did not have 
the money and father never thought it right to charge a man 
for lodging and horse feed. So after breakfast next morning 
the agent left and with him my hopes of obtaining a new book.
Though after the lapse of several months I found the much 
coveted volume in the library of a Baptist minister who kindly
loaned it to me. I sped home light of heart and footstep too, and
gathered in my brush for a light that night; for remember this 
was before the time of Lucifer matches, sperm candles, or coal
oil, at least in our part of the country. For light we made tallow 
candles, when we had the beef tallow which we could afford 
to use only on special occasions. For all ordinary occasions 
we used a lamp made in the potter's shop, having a bowl 
that held about a pint into which we put hog's lard or any 
kind of grease. Into this we put a strip of cotton cloth called 
a wick and lighted this wick at one end; thus we had a dim 
light, but this we could not always afford as was the case in 
<pb id="carroll14" n="14"/>
this instance; hence the gathering of the sticks and limbs. And
now for the reading of the much prized book which began immediately, and let me say, right here and now, that never before
nor since, neither do I ever expect to read anything with half
the interest as I did this one volume; it held me spellbound until
late hours at night. Its stirring scenes passed through my
dreams; it riveted my susceptible mind to its passing scenes as
with rivets of steel from which I could not and did not want to
free my mind, until I had read the last word. Someone who
may read this scrawl, will want to know why of such deep
interest in such a work. Reader, let me tell you - I had never
been fifteen miles from home in my life; I had never read fiction; 
I had never seen a geography; I knew nothing of fiction
and every word my father and mother said to me I believed
with all my heart; they never deceived me about anything,
hence I accepted as a literal fact everything heard or read; I
verily believed that there were somewhere in the world just
such roads, such country, as therein described, just such personages 
as Christian, Patience, Charity and others; such mountains 
with great gulches through which they had to pass; great
lions lying beside the wayside looking for prey; and lo, when
they approached nearer they found them with chains around
their mouths. Of course I learned later the true intent of the
story, but the reader can see the cause of my intense interest
in the book.</p>
          <p>Along about this time some parties put up a store about three
miles from our home and advertised that they would exchange
goods for “sang,” a medicinal herb that grew spontaneously in
our neighborhood. I concluded at odd times to dig some of the
roots, this being the part of the plant used. So in a little while
I had quite a little sack full of it. In a few days opportunity
offered and I took my “sang” to market and very readily
made a sale. My chief desire was for store goods enough to
make me a pair of pants and this being the second store I had
ever been in, everything looked pretty to me, and noticing a
piece of striped goods I concluded it was the thing I wanted,
so I took the worth of my produce in the same striped goods,
<pb id="carroll15" n="15"/>
which I learned later was a very good article - ticking. I 
hurried home, elated over my purchase, and the prospect of a 
pair of new pants. Mother, God bless her memory, would not 
mortify my feelings by saying it was not desirable goods for 
the purpose for which I wanted it, but cut out the pants and 
made them for me. So on Sunday following I donned my new 
pants and a new white shirt, every thread of which, both warp 
and woof, mother had made with her own hands, even to the 
buttons which were made of thread alone by mother's own 
hands. Thus attired I went to church. Although my feet were 
not <sic>incased</sic> in patent leather, or leather of any kind for that
matter, I felt no embarrassment not knowing at that period of 
my life, as I learned later, that the harness made the horse desirable. Any way those were happy days; whether modern 
ways will give to the world a better citizenship remains to be
seen.</p>
          <p>A few more years of clearing land, rolling logs, etc., brought
me to the year 1856. Mother's health, which was always poor, 
had gone almost completely away; she became almost <sic>bedfast</sic> for the remainder of her life and to add to our troubles, father,
while assisting a neighbor to raise a house, had the misfortune 
to have his leg broken below the knee. We made a litter and
neighbors brought him home, one man at each of the four 
corners. To further add to our troubles, as though we did not 
yet have enough, brother, next younger than I and the two 
oldest sisters were taken sick of typhoid fever. I, being the 
only one of the family old enough and well enough to do anything, 
all this was more than I could do, but we secured the aid
of a good lady and by the assistance of kind neighbors, which 
we always had, we did pretty well. Father recovered after a 
long time as did also brother and sisters, but our poor mother
gradually sank. Physicians administered to her the best they
could, but she gradually wasted away from the ravages of that
awful disease known as consumption of the bowels. She spent 
her life for the good, <sic>upbuilding</sic>, consolation, support, and encouragement 
of her husband and children; many were the times 
that I heard her encouraging words to my father in the days 
<pb id="carroll16" n="16"/>of our family afflictions, telling him to fear not; the Lord 
would provide; counseling us children as how we should live 
and act. She, feeling and knowing that the end was near, gave 
to her expressions a deep, fervid, intense interest that they
would not otherwise have had.</p>
          <p>She had always managed, some way, to clothe, mostly with the
work of her own hands her family, especially the children; 
cotton goods for the summer and woolen <sic>linseys</sic> and jeans for 
the winter, dying the woolen goods with the bark of the walnut
tree which gave a beautiful dark brown color and made it very
pretty. The buttons for these goods she made by covering a 
piece of leather or gourd with some dark material. She lived 
as the Scriptures describes, a good mother. She looked well to 
the ways of her husband. I gave to her in her sickness my best
attention, while she was sick, and as the other members of the
family who were sick grew better I came more and more to the
assistance of my mother, but alas! the end came on the evening 
of March 27th, 1857. She called me to the bedside and told me 
she was dying: the three next children being unable to go to 
her, father with difficulty being at the bedside. She uttered
a short prayer, pressed us to her dying breast and said to me
“John, you have been a dutiful son. Meet me in heaven.”
Then a few feeble words to father and me to care for her children 
and all was over. We carried her remains to the family
cemetery where they were decently interred: I, being the only
member of the family who was able to go to the grave. Returning 
home, everything was sad and lonely; mother gone, the
family sick, but after all our log cabin was our home. To care 
for the sick was my duty which I did as faithfully as I could. 
The deep interest I felt in them and my knowledge of their 
gradual and permanent improvement caused a more hopeful 
spirit to come over me by soon seeing them all able to be stirring 
a little in the house. Spring being now well advanced, 
I went about making a small corn crop. So after a few weeks 
I had it planted; later along father and brother got able 
to help me some and after all we made a fair crop, a sustenance. 
Boys, let me say right here, be good to mother; she it is who 
<pb id="carroll17" n="17"/>
will go down to the very death for you, she it is who will never
forsake you; father, brothers, sisters, aye, even your wife, but
mother never: though a felon's chains might bind your hands 
(which God forbid), the world pass by and scoff, but mother will
be there to plead, to comfort, to counsel and to console. 
Boys, stand by mother, she may become old and fretful and 
possibly hard to please, but hold up her hands and steady her
trembling, tottering steps.</p>
          <p>Boys, the prettiest sight that was ever witnessed in the town
of Henderson, Tennessee, was that of a young Mr. Savage of 
that place whose mother was old and tottery; but in that manly 
son who was then about twenty-two years of age, she had a
treasure, a son of whom any mother would be proud. Each
Sabbath morning he took mother's arm and supported her      
feeble steps to the church, sat with her during the service, led
her back to her arm chair at her own fireside; thus he preferred
mother to all the gayety of society. That young man occupies 
a lucrative position in one of the learned profession in one of 
the best cities of the South, and well he should - he deserves it.
<emph rend="bold">Boys, take care of mother.</emph></p>
          <p>During these ten years our wooded country had improved 
much. Esq. John H. Galbraith was a neighbor, a prominent 
citizen and afterwards sheriff of our county.  D. M. McCollum
settled about two miles north of us, a very intelligent and
good man and, by the way, the first postmaster we had in our
vicinity.  Several families moved in from North Carolina and 
quite a number of families from Middle Tennessee; among 
whom I remember the families of McCollums, Van Dyke, 
Bunch, Puryear, Owens, Hardeman, Smith, and others whom I 
do not now recall settled on the south side of our little neighborhood, 
bringing with them money with which they purchased 
lands and paid for them. Also negro slaves which were put
immediately to clearing the land which was very rich. The
sons of some of these gentlemen worked also in all the labors 
of the farm.  A country store was erected in one mile of my 
father's house, a <sic>postoffice</sic> - Center Point - established. School
facilities were improved. Sabbath schools were organized; 
<pb id="carroll18" n="18"/>
churches, erected; newspapers began to circulate freely among
our people. An era of prosperity had come down upon us.
Also during these years a Masonic Hall was erected, a two-
story frame building; a Masonic lodge organized which occupied the second story of the building, the basement story being 
used for preaching, open alike to all denominations of
Christians and later for school purposes and for all purposes
of gathering when the people of the neighborhood thought it
necessary to come together. Also during these years the
voices of many distinguished statesmen were heard among us;
among the number being Hon. J. D. C. Atkins and Emerson
Ethridge, who were perhaps the peers of any men in Tennessee
upon the political issues of the day; loud and long were the
cheers given to each champion as he would score a point against
the other, but after the contest was over all returned to their
daily avocations with good will for all. Let me say right here
that there was not a saloon in our good neighborhood, nor one
allowed; neither is there one nor one allowed even to this day, it
being more than fifty years since my father, J. H. Galbraith,
and other good citizens moved into and began to settle up the
country. One fellow, however, had the audacity to attempt to
run a saloon over the protest of this good citizenship, which
lasted about four days. His goods were not destroyed nor his
person injured, but he became aware that it was perhaps safest
and best for him to take his whiskey and himself and remove to
neighborhoods which were more congenial, which he accordingly
did, very much to the satisfaction of all concerned. Just here
it is well to remember that whenever a community determines
to put an end to a nuisance of that kind, it is best to listen and
take heed, for it is going to be done at any cost.</p>
          <p>I forgot to say in the proper place, but will now say, that
Mr. C. W. Brooks was one of the first settlers, a good and
substantial citizen, always found working for the best interests 
of the community. Dr. J. F. McKenzie, a man of good
mind, great energy, and of much moral worth to the community, 
also settled in the immediate neighborhood. Three
<pb id="carroll19" n="19"/>
miles west of us lined Mr. John Criner, an old settler and a
man of much deep, common sense.</p>
          <p>During this period of life I read the newspapers which were
full of the happenings in Kansas Territory. The territorial
government had applied to Congress for statehood in the Federal 
union. The abolitionists of the north wanted it admitted
only upon the terms of a free state, while the Southern or pro-
slavery people wanted it admitted as a slave state; that is, that
a citizen of the United States, owning slaves, should have the
right to go into Kansas and have his property and slaves protected, 
as any other property, which had been done under the
constitution of the United States from the beginning of the government. 
The northern Free Soilers, as they called themselves, 
sent men and arms to Kansas under the name of the
Secret Aid Society, for the purpose of driving out the Southern 
people. The other side being equally determined, it resulted 
in frequent collisions at arms between the contending
factions. My sympathies naturally went out to the Southern
people, not that I owned any property in slaves, but I naturally
loved the Sunny South together with all her institutions, then
as now; whether right or wrong, was no question with me. I
am for her and will be, I think, while I have an existence upon
the earth. My patriotism began to run pretty high; so I made    
up my mind that if I had any way of getting over there I
would go and help my people. After some reflection I frankly
laid the matter before my father, telling him of my intentions.
He heard me kindly through my story. When I had finished,       
he told me that I knew nothing of life in an army; that I had
best wait, for he believed that inside of two years a fearful
war would be forced upon the people of the Southland; that,
when the time came, it would be our duty to aid our people
to the best of our ability. After this conversation I abandoned
the idea of a trip to Kansas.</p>

          <p>About this time came John Brown's raid into Virginia.
Thus every move on the political chessboard was a move in 
the direction of war the most fearful in the annals of history.
Thus John Brown's raid was the first shot fired and the 
first onslaught made upon the institutions of our country,
which burst upon us in all its fury in the year 1861. I was 
then in my nineteenth year; full of patriotism and hope of success; 
anxious to take part in the struggle, I enlisted in a company being raised by Richard Barham May, 1861. The company 
was soon recruited to about one hundred men. Barham 
was elected Captain and a full quota of officers were selected.
We went into camp at Trenton, Tenn. I was elected fourth 
corporal, the lowest office in the army, if it could be called an
office at all. But what of that; any and all were willing to 
serve anywhere! To wear a Confederate uniform and fight for 
one's country was glory enough, we thought. If positions were
offered, they were accepted patriotically and the muskets were
carried with the same pride and patriotism that actuated a   
Major General.</p>
          <p>We drilled every day - morning and evening, attended roll call,
did camp duty, cooked our own rations, washed our own 
clothes, etc.</p>
          <p>Our first lieutenant being a man who had some military training, 
we were soon a fairly well drilled company of volunteers.</p>
          <p>I bought a copy of Hardee's Tactics, also a copy of military
law and by adding study to practice, pretty soon became a fair
drill-master.  In the volume in military law I learned that the
rules and discipline of an army was no Sunday school affair. 
Soon we had companies enough in camp to organize a regiment 
<pb id="carroll21" n="21"/>
 - 27th Tenn. Infantry. C. H. Williams was elected Colonel.
Then began company, <sic>batallion</sic> and regiment drills, in earnest;
officers drills also. These drills with other duties occupied all
our time. About this time it occurred to the powers that were,
that we had neglected to elect a chaplain, which had to be
done, as everything else in that patriotic regiment, by the votes
of the soldiers. So a young man applied for the position and went
among the different companies soliciting votes and I for very
mischief went out among the companies not knowing
them nor they me, but few outside our own company. Other
mischievous comrades caught on and went out electioneering
for me; the election came off and I was actually elected chaplain 
of one of the finest regiments in the Confederate service.
When the result was announced I was actually dumbfounded.
The colonel ordered the new chaplain to appear at headquarters. 
I positively refused to go and after an explanation
by some friends that the whole thing was a huge joke on my
part and never intended to go outside of my own company, the
matter was dropped. I never afterward attempted to play the
role of preacher.</p>
          <p>Soon after this I was elected orderly sergeant of our company. 
We then went to Columbus, Ky.; thence to Felicanna,
Ky.; then to Bowling Green. Ky.: then to Nashville, Tenn.;
thence to Corinth, Miss.</p>
          <p>At this place, our first lieutenant, John Skiffington, concluded 
that a position in the quartermaster's department would
be more in keeping with his ideas of war. He resigned his
commission as Lieutenant and I was elected to fill his place.</p>
          <p>At this time General Albert Sidney Johnston who was in
command of the Confederate army, ordered a move upon the
Federal army, under the command of Gen. U. S. Grant,
which was encamped on the west side of the Tennessee river
at Pittsburg Landing and around Shiloh church from which the
battle took its name. We moved out on Thursday evening and
on Friday evening encountered the federal outpost. After
a light skirmish we drove them in. On Saturday we lay in line
of battle all day long and Saturday night also. This delay was
<pb id="carroll22" n="22"/>
caused by the tardiness of one division of the army not getting
in position, as it should have done, until late Saturday evening.</p>
          <p>So on Sunday morning, April 6th, 1862, the sun rose brightly; 
everything was full of animation, life, and hope. We
moved to the attack driving everything before us; cheer after
cheer went up as we drove them from one position to another.
So by five o'clock p.m., having fought all day, we had the federal 
army in our clutches; but just at this juncture, Gen. Buell
of the federal army began to land his army of reinforcement
on the west bank of the river, consisting of forty thousand
men. There was also a powerful federal fleet in the river
that bombarded us all night long on Sunday night. With this
reinforcement they succeeded in driving us off the field by
three o'clock on Monday evening. The combined loss of both
 - armies is placed at forty thousand men - a fearful slaughter.
Of the many little incidents that happened during the two
days battle I will only relate one or two. Captain Barham
being slightly wounded early in the engagement, retired from
the field. The command of the company then devolved upon
me, as first lieutenant. A member of the company came to me
after the battle had been raging for some hours on Sunday
morning and told me he was going to be killed. He looked
pale, though fearless. I tried to dissuade him but, nay; he said
it would be so. I asked him to take some tobacco with me, which
he did, saying it would be his last, which it was; the poor fellow 
was killed a few minutes afterwards.</p>
          <p>On the battlefield there was a pretty large highland pond and
is today denominated by the <sic>federals</sic> as the “Bloody Pond,”
and is so marked. Well do I remember wading through it on
Sunday evening about four o'clock, the water coming to my
waist. The <sic>federals</sic> were making a strong fight here; knowing
that if I were wounded and should fall in this water I would
drown, I rushed through and waited until the company came
up. We passed on beyond this place to near the bank of the
river, and at dusk a cannonball from a federal gunboat cut
off the whole top of a tree which fell lengthwise on our regiment 
and killed eleven men of one company. Darkness now
<pb id="carroll23" n="23"/>
closed the scene and on Monday evening, after fighting all day 
to 3 p.m., we returned to Corinth, Miss. We were worn out 
and disconsolate; so many comrades, who had gone out with 
us, were not there to answer roll-call as they had been left
wounded or dead on the battlefield. Our ranks were so depleted 
that a reorganization of the whole army was necessary. 
I was chosen Captain of our company. Of such distinction I 
was much pleased and very thankful as I regarded this as an
endorsement of my conduct in my past life (with the company as
well as my patriotism).</p>
          <p>The ordeal of battle and reorganization having been gone
through with, we began drilling daily. More regard was paid 
to discipline. In a short time however the federal army began 
to move against us. Sharp, close, hard-picked fighting continued 
night and day with occasional fighting with considerable
bodies of both armies; notably at Farmington, a village town 
between Corinth and Pittsburgh Landing. In May, however, the army 
evacuated Corinth and moved round to Chattanooga, 
Tenn., from there to Mumfordsville, Ky., where a portion of 
the army captured the federal garrison; then to Richmond, 
Ky., where the federal army was defeated, and to Perryville 
where was fought one of the hardest battles of the war, in 
which I was wounded. A ball passing across and cutting out 
a piece of the right knee cap, from which I did not recover
rapidly. From there I was taken to Knoxville, Tenn., over a 
rough road in a wagon. On the way out some one stole my hat 
and coat also my haversack containing my provisions. Arriving 
at Knoxville, Oct. 17, we were surprised to find ourselves
and the whole earth covered with a four inch snow. At this 
place General Manney visited me. On the next night we were loaded
on a freight train and started to Chattanooga.</p>
          <p>Here I want to turn aside to relate an incident of two members 
of my company:  William Rhodes of Lexington, Tenn., 
one of the nicest young men in the regiment and as brave as he
was young and fair; and Frank Buck, a mere boy, both of 
whom came to me when we were in line of battle and told me 
they were going to be killed that day. Their pale features, their 
<pb id="carroll24" n="24"/>
calm demeanor, their determined looks impressed me much. 
While I had no authority to offer such thing, yet, I did offer
that they take pass and drop out, which they refused to do 
and were both killed in less than two hours; I wish to relate
here the conduct of Joe Wheeler, of Henderson county, the
color-bearer of the regiment and a member of my company, 
who, while holding the colors aloft during the hottest of the
fight, had his right arm shattered, let the colors fall, but,
seizing them with the other hand, held them up until a bullet
through his brain put an end to his existence.</p>
          <p>Arriving at Chattanooga about midnight, the weather at this
time being very cold, we were unloaded and carried to a frame
church on the outskirts of the city and laid on the floor as we
arrived, until the floor was literally covered with wounded men,
few of whom had blankets to cover with and no chance for 
a fire to warm. We were in anything but a comfortable condition. 
This was the best, I suppose, that could be done for 
us; any way it was hard luck. During the night owing to poor
health I found it necessary to dispense with what clothing I 
had left, except one shirt which I had on. Morning soon 
dawned and some friends of mine found me in a nude condition 
and ministered unto my necessities. A brother whom I 
had not seen for months came walking up, having heard of 
the battle, and wanted to see me. Soon I had comfortable
clothes. A good room in the hotel and a bed to lie on; what 
a great thing to have a friend! Boys, never betray a confidence 
reposed in you nor go back on a friend.</p>
          <p>Bragg's army moved to Shelbyville, Tenn., where another 
reorganization of the army was necessary and our ranks were 
by this time very much depleted. I of course was absent on 
wounded furlough and it was not expected that I would again 
be able for military duty. I was left out of the organization,
but after months I became able for duty again as a cavalryman. 
I reported for duty, was transferred to the cavalry department 
and ordered to West Tennessee, then overrun with 
the <sic>federals</sic>, there to raise a company of cavalry which I did
after several weeks and many narrow escapes.</p>
          <pb id="carroll25" n="25"/>
          <p>While in Middle Tennessee I met with my old time friend
and neighbor, J. N. Galbraith, who had been released from a
northern prison, having suffered much and lost the use of one
eye. I had sufficiently recovered from the wound to travel
with the aid of a stick. We decided to try our luck in crossing
the Tennessee river and trying to see home-folks again. We
succeeded in evading the <sic>federals</sic>, arriving at home and spent
a brief time very happily. In a couple of days it was discovered 
that we were at home and reported to the authorities who
gave us a hot chase and came near capturing both of us. On
arriving at the Tennessee river on our return to protection, we
found no means of crossing, but we turned into a deep gulch
covered with a thick underbrush and tied our horses, disrobing 
ourselves of clothing except a couple of undergarments,
and procuring a couple of logs, making them fast together
with grape vines, we pushed into the river and used our best
exertions to make the opposite shore before some federal gunboat 
should overhaul our frail craft and take us to prison.
'All went well until we came half across the river; the grape
vines came untied; the logs rolled apart and we were into the
river. Both of us being good swimmers we went on pretty well.
On nearing the bank I asked my friend how he was doing; he
answered pretty well, only one leg was cramped and sticking
straight down. However, we went ashore, rested a little, held
a council of war and decided to move on to a farm house which
we did. Placing ourselves behind a fence with our heads just
over the top rail, we called. A lady came to the call. Making
known to her our situation she soon found us friends. With
a skiff we soon succeeded in crossing our horses and getting
on the remainder of our clothing which we very much needed.
That night we spent under the friendly boughs of a spreading 
oak.</p>
          <p>On my return to West Tennessee for the purpose of raising
a company of volunteers, we had many difficulties. We had no
arms except occasionally a flint-lock shotgun that we could
pick up. We went along, enrolled whom we could and let
them remain at home. This enrollment was secretly carried
<pb id="carroll26" n="26"/>
on until such a time as we could get men enough to organize a
company, which we finally succeeded in doing. Our company 
when organized consisted of about sixty men. So on a summer 
day of 1863, at a good spring in a deep hollow, on the farm 
of J. T. Maness, the organization was perfected. I was elected
Captain of this company also, M.L. Cherry, first lieutenant,
William Record and Robert Long, second lieutenants. We had 
now men enough to start South but no arms or ammunition. 
We however concluded to try a raid down towards Adamsville, where
we were sure there were federal soldiers of the “home-
made sort,” as we termed them. (That is persons who, living 
in this country, had joined the federal army.) Capt. James
Stinnett, who had a small company, and I, with what armed men 
I had, went down and sure enough we came on a good sized 
company of them. A fight immediately occurred in which we 
were successful by putting them to flight, capturing a few of
them and getting one of our men wounded. Getting a few guns 
we returned somewhat encouraged, <sic>bivouaced</sic> in the woods a 
few days and concluded to raid a portion of the country known 
as Hooker's Bend, where was congregated a lot of thieves
claiming to be, and were, federal soldiers, who would make 
frequent incursions into our part of the country and carry off
whatever they could get their hands on. Here we found a
formidable company, but who seemed not disposed to fight 
much. So after maneuvering most all day, three of our boys 
being hungry rode up to a house, asked to get some bread and 
were closed in upon and captured by the <sic>federals</sic> and carried 
to their camps for the night. Following closely after them 
we remained until daylight and made a rush for them. One of 
the prisoners, a Mr. Benson, just as day began to break seeing
the guard turn his head away, gave him a blow with his 
fist, that sent the fellow whirling to the ground and made his
escape. Meeting him he told us where they had camped; so 
we charged upon them and as usual they fled. We recaptured 
our soldiers, picked up several horses and a few guns, captured 
a few prisoners and ran the crowd into the bottom, returning
<pb id="carroll27" n="27"/>
 again to our places of hiding, not knowing what hour 
a heavy column of <sic>federals</sic> might come upon us.</p>
          <p>During these days, Col. Faulkner of a Kentucky <sic>batallion</sic> of 
Confederates passed through the country whose advance guard were
dressed in federal uniform in order to protect themselves and
evade the federal columns, should they meet them. Calling 
at the house of a unionist they inquired of him if there were
any rebels in the country; he said there were and proceeded 
to give names, writing them down for the officers, noting 
as he wrote what should be done to this one and to that one.
When he came to the name of my father, he said burn 
him out, that he had a son in there who was a bad guerrilla,
referring to me. When he had finished his memorandum, the officer 
told him to get over the fence and move along that these
were Confederates he was talking to. The mortification and
downright fear depicted in his face was awful to behold. They put
him under guard, foraged on him taking bacon, hams, chickens, 
etc., and he furnished a bountiful supply. During the night
the officer sent for me and, when I arrived, had the man 
brought into my presence and rehearsed in my presence what 
the old sinner desired done with his southern neighbors. I 
saw that those men intended to kill him; they told him they
would. Having known the old rascal for years, I begged for 
his life and offered to go security for his good behavior during 
the war. He promised to leave the country and not to meddle 
again in such manner, which he did and kept his word faithfully 
with me. And after peace was made he made a warm 
personal friend of mine. At his death I was one of the pall-
bearers and helped to place his remains in their last resting
place. Peace to his ashes!</p>
          <p>Our desire now was to get out through the federal lines to
Mississippi, where we could get arms. There being six other
pieces of companies in the country, we got together and organized 
by electing D. T. Spain, Colonel; James Franklin, Major, 
and had altogether, perhaps, three hundred men, mostly unarmed 
and in constant danger of being captured, frequently 
having to disband and seek safest in the woods. At this time 
<pb id="carroll28" n="28"/>
General N. B. Forrest forced his way through the federal lines
and came to Jackson, Tenn. We immediately reported for 
duty to General Forrest and went South into Northern Mississippi. 
A great many men of our number  had once belonged 
to the Southern army who, at the time of the evacuation of
Corinth, Miss., after the battle of Shiloh, were at home and  
who remained there until this time. Here a new trouble 
arose; a report was circulated to the effect that these men 
would be returned to their old commands in infantry service 
and their horses used to mount new men. This caused a regular 
stampede; men left in dozens until within a short time there
were only 150 men present out of the 300 taken out; this necessitated 
a reorganization. I was absent at the time, but the
whole <sic>batallion</sic> was thrown into one company and I retained 
as captain of it. I was surprised on my return and of course 
felt grateful for the honor. We were then attached to a regiment, 
21st Tenn. Cavalry, under Col. A. ST. Wilson who by the way
was a brave and chivalrous man. Our first introduction 
to the <sic>federals</sic> now was a skirmish in the night-time which 
was pretty exciting, but no damage either way. A couple of 
days later we met a federal force at Okolona, Miss., who fought
us hard but we whipped them and drove them into Memphis,
capturing and killing many of them and getting arms and ammunition 
of war enough to arm our command; also a lot of 
blankets which we very much needed; many of us not having 
even one blanket nor an overcoat. Returning to Okolona we 
rested a few days. The winter being very severe it was with
difficulty that we kept from frost-bites which some did not.
Getting the command in as good shape as possible, we moved to
Jackson, Tenn., capturing Trenton, Tenn., and other places, 
fighting at Johnsonville on the Tennessee river, Paducah and  
Fort Pillow on the Mississippi river, which was a garrison of
negro troops commanded by white men. After much parleying 
and urging a surrender to us they refused; we stormed the
works and when the fight was over and the smoke cleared, there
was not many of them left. We carried off the artillery and 
what prisoners we had taken. Just here I will state that, while 
<pb id="carroll29" n="29"/>the flag of truce was up, Captain James Stinnett and I with
some picked men crawled up close under the guns to be ready
in case they refused to surrender, to prevent them from discharging 
their cannon into our ranks which we successfully did.
The little town was then by some mishap or other burned. This
being in April, 1864, we had not tents or other shelter. During
all these winters when it rained we protected ourselves as best
we could with oilcloths captured from the <sic>federals</sic>; our 
head we <sic>pillowed</sic> on our saddles when we had time for a nap;
our rations were poor; musty corn meal, and bacon and beef 
when we could get it. Of this we did not complain. It was 
the best the Confederacy could do for us. Our currency was 
so much depreciated as to be almost worthless. To give an 
idea of its purchasing power, I owned a good horse which 
would, in ordinary times, be worth a hundred dollars, which
horse was valued into the service at eighteen hundred dollars.
Tobacco was worth five dollars for a single plug and, if fine,
about twenty dollars; a large watermelon would bring from 
five to ten dollars. I saw sixty dollars paid for one quart of
whiskey. Of this currency we did not have very much; we 
were not paid regularly. I remember that at the time of the 
surrender the government owed me about twenty-seven hundred 
dollars. The wages paid an officer of my rank was one 
hundred and thirty dollars per month; hence you will observe 
that I had not been paid in quite a while. Of this we made no
complaint, as one was about as well off without it as with it.
The success of the cause was our leading thought and, for the 
accomplishment of this end, we were willing to undergo anything 
that might befall us.</p>
          <p>Returning from this digression to the thread of my theme, 
we left Fort Pillow, denuded of me and guns, and West Tennessee 
with not a federal command in it outside of the city of
Memphis. Turning again Southward we crossed the Tennessee 
river at Florence, Ala., crossing the men in skiffs and on flat
boats, and swimming the horses; no wagons except those for
carrying ammunition and a few ambulances were allowed. 
Encountering the <sic>federals</sic> on the east bank of the river, driving 
<pb id="carroll30" n="30"/>
on toward Nashville, we hurried them along, stopping at
Pulaski, Tenn., taking a few block-houses. This being now well
up into the month of May. We passed on to Athens, Tenn.,
where we forced a surrender of about 2,500 men who were
well fortified. General Forrest did this bold strategy very
much to our delight; to storm a breastwork across a broad deep
ditch and it protected with an <sic>abattis</sic> made secure with telegraph 
wire, was no light job. But they knew we had stormed
the works at Fort Pillow a few weeks before and had confidence 
in us to believe that we would do the sanae for them.
Passing on we came to a negro corral where were quarters of
a large number of <sic>negroes</sic> and horses belonging to the federal 
government; all were protected by a block-house and federal 
garrison. This we captured - horses, <sic>negroes</sic> and all, but
they were retaken that same evening by the <sic>federals</sic>, over
which we had a skirmish; there being only a few men left as
a guard they were not able to cope with the federal forces.
Passing on from here we were ordered back west of the Tennessee 
river to meet a raid of infantry, cavalry, and artillery,
commanded by Major-General Sturgess of the federal army.
The brigade, Bell's, to which we were attached marched
seventy-five miles during the day and night before we encountered 
them. Striking them at Brice's Cross Roads, Miss., on
June 10th, 1861, tired, hungry, and sleepy as we were, we
dismounted and made immediate preparations for the assault.
Our enemies outnumbering us almost, if not quite, three to one,
we knew we had hard work to do. When our brigade arrived,
General Forrest met us and had something to say to each man
as he passed along the line - some word of encouragement.
We could all see with what intense feeling and anxiety he
regarded the issue. This made the men more determined. We
moved to the assault through a deep underbrush in which
the enemy was concealed. The onslaught was terrific and repelled 
with equal vigor; for hours it seemed as though we were
on a scale which rose and fell with about equal regularity as
each side charged and <sic>countercharged</sic>, until finally we broke
the center of the federal line and, doubling it back, put them
<pb id="carroll31" n="31"/>to riot. We followed them until midnight and for nearly two 
days afterward, killing and wounding many of them, taking 
many prisoners. In this engagement many of our best men 
were lost, many killed and many more wounded. After this and 
our return, we went into camp for a much needed rest for both 
men and horses, which lasted only about two weeks, until another 
raid was started out from Memphis under the command 
of General A. J. Smith of the federal army, a brave and 
skilful officer, with a more powerful army than that brought 
out by Gen. Sturgess. About July 10th, 1864, we met at Harrisburg, 
Miss., and in a charge on the evening before the main
battle, our brigade was considerably damaged and forced to
retire; many of our men shed tears, this being the first 
repulse we had met with. During the night the <sic>Federals</sic> fortified 
a strong position and on the morning we assaulted them 
and after two hours were compelled to withdraw from the 
field and accomplish by strategy what we could not do by main
force. Our company on that morning consisted of sixty-two 
men leaving out the horse holders which were every fourth 
man. (Remember we fought on foot) and when the fight 
as over thirty-two were either killed or wounded. A sad day
indeed for us, but we had to fight whatever we came to. To 
drive General Forrest out of Mississippi was, it seemed, the
determination of the federal government and not to be driven 
much we were equally determined. On the next day we, 
by a flank movement, brought them out of their stronghold and
succeeded in driving them from the state after some days of
skirmishing. On the third day of this battle the <sic>federals</sic>, 
had gotten into a skirt of timber beyond an open field in which 
were long rows of pens of corn, cotton gins, fencing, etc. All 
of which they had set on fire. The sun being very hot, the 
heat and smoke from this burning property was too much for 
me. I was suddenly overcome by heat and had to be carried 
from the field. From the effects of which I have never recovered 
nor never will. On the next day I was able to sit on 
my horse, but weak and feeble. At this time the Confederacy 
was waning fast.  Of the six hundred thousand men of all
<pb id="carroll32" n="32"/>
arms, who had enlisted into the service of the Confederacy, 
at least half; or more than half of them had been killed,
wounded, died, or discharged on account of sickness, or deserted. 
I am sorry to say we had some of this latter class. There
could not have been, I do not think, more than 250 to 
275 thousand left and they were guarding a line of defense extending 
from the Atlantic to the Indian Territory on the west. Of
the two million eight hundred thousand enlisted in the 
federal army, we could not have, I think, disposed of more 
than eight hundred thousand of them; pretty good if we had 
done this much. Now against the two hundred seventy-five thousand
Confederates, there was an army of two million men 
of the federal army to hurl against that thin line of Confederates. 
But each day we presented as solid front as possible 
and fought as gallantly and as faithfully as in the earlier 
days and possibly more so. Another short rest, shoeing horses 
and getting ready for another raid, we were notified of a force 
moving out from Memphis again; this time by the way of 
Pontotoc, Miss., commanded by the same federal, Gen. A. J. Smith,
with a still more formidable force than before. This 
was now August: the weather, distressingly hot; horses and 
men jaded, but there was no chance for a rest. We moved 
out in the direction of the invading force and met them near
Pontotoc, Miss., began skirmishing with them, prepared for 
an engagement, but finding the federal force had infantry 
enough to cover our front and us in single line and as much
cavalry as we had we were utterly unable to force them back. 
As we would engage them in front their cavalry would swing 
around to our rear and force us to fall back. Thus we went 
for several days until finally General Forrest resorted to one 
of his masterly strategic movements. The order was passed 
through camp for volunteers to go on a heavy detached service 
and none but good horses allowed to go. So when we were 
ready, our command was very formidable; neither did we 
know where we were to go, but the fact was soon developed 
that we were destined for Memphis. Filing out around the 
federal army, leaving General Chalmers in command of the 
<pb id="carroll33" n="33"/>forces left in front of the enemy, we went on quietly until we
came to Cold Water river, a considerable stream on which
we had to lay a pontoon bridge; this we soon did, General
Forrest assisting in the work with his own hands. Crossing
quietly and night soon coming on, we proceeded on our way
and just before day a shot from Captain Bill Forrest's pistol
notified us that the federal outpost had been encountered; one
guard being killed and the remainder captured. At this signal 
we made a charge for the city, at the outskirts of which
we ran upon a division of <sic>federals</sic> who had just arrived and
gone into camp the previous night. These we run over and
through, who in their night-clothes looked like ghosts but
to them we paid no attention save to give them a passing shot.
each part of our command having been previously assigned to
different parts of the city and ordered not to pay any attention
to firing either on the right or left. Our part of the command
having been ordered to the Gayoso Hotel in which were guarded 
Gen. Washburn and his staff to effect their capture was
our mission. A dense fog overhung the city, making it impossible
to distinguish a gray from a blue uniform, which was possibly
an advantage to us. On arriving at the hotel we found it
strongly guarded and one of the great difficulties now was to
find something with which we could batter down the doors.
We however succeeded, after some minutes, in getting in but
during this time a continual firing was going on upon us from
housetops, cellars, etc. Gen. Washburn succeeded in making
his way out through some private passage and getting away.
However we captured most of his staff officers and also the
General's uniform, watch, etc. Not having time for the officers 
to dress, we had to march them out in their night clothes
and barefooted. Of course this was not very elegant, but the
weather being warm it did not seem to be injurious to their
health. Inside the building there were many hand-to-hand
combats, men fighting like demons. This melee lasted, perhaps, 
an hour and a half. During this time the guards whom
we had run over on the outskirts of the town in the early part
of the action, had formed in our rear and as they thought effectually 
<pb id="carroll34" n="34"/>
closed every avenue of escape for us. This necessitated 
a charge which we successfully did, fighting pretty hard
at times and losing some good men and capturing some prisoners. 
Darkness still hung over the earth and discerning a
line of battle moving into us and being near, Col. Forrest requested 
me to find out which they were. I rode hastily up to
them and asked in a low commanding voice what command.
The answer came loudly and distinctly: “Ohio boys.” Said
I, “All right, ” turned and galloped away. This just saved
us, as there was a command in front of us then. skirmishing
with us; so we turned to the right and galloped out, getting
out with the prisoners. General Forrest moved out a couple
of miles and formed a line of battle. He sent in a flag of
truce and also Gen. Washburn's uniform and asked that the
clothing of the captured officers and some provisions be sent
them; also proposed an exchange of prisoners. To this Gen.
Washburn demurred saving that he would capture Forrest
and his whole command before night. General Forrest replied 
that he would return by way of the Hernando road, the
way he had come in, which he did; but Washburn considered
this bold assertion a mere ruse, concluding that his enemy
had designs on the Memphis and Charleston railroad which
was in the hands of the <sic>federals</sic> from Memphis to near
Corinth and accordingly put his forces on that road to protect
it from the expected raid. So we proceeded as we came on the
same road back to Panola, Miss. This raid into Memphis had
the effect of again ridding North Mississippi of a federal army.
That which we could not do by fighting, we did by bold
strategy.</p>
          <p>I will stop to relate that during the war many federal soldiers 
took wives of the negro women where they were quartered; 
among our prisoners on this raid was a real fat Dutchman
who had a negro wife, whom he carried along with him. The
weather being very warm; water, scarce; both captors and
captured became very thirsty. On coming to a bold running
stream of clear water, our Dutchman rushed in and fell down
to drink. A mule (on which some of our soldiers were mounted) 
<pb id="carroll35" n="35"/>
standing in the water happened to notice the Dutchman
lying behind him, raised one foot and kicked him in the head
killing him instantly, at which the negro lamented very much
but the procession moved on.</p>
          <p>Getting to Mississippi again, we were much worn down - 
men and horses too. We were compelled to have at least a
month's rest after getting in for both man and beast.  After
getting in as good condition as possible and fully satisfying
the <sic>federals</sic> that we were not going to give up our territory,
we moved into Middle Tennessee again and, having a long
line to guard, we were continually on the march skirmishing
and fighting. Again in Tennessee we encountered <sic>federals</sic>
on every side. Moving on to Pulaski we drove in the pickets
and captured the garrison; then to Sulphur Trestle where we
had a pretty hard fight, destroying the <sic>trestling</sic> which was a
long one; thence around Columbia, Tenn., burning a bridge
and destroying railroad track; at another place we captured
a considerable fort and several prisoners; at this point an old
Dutchman who was a member of the garrison had dug him
quite a hole, reaching in under a steep bluff. After the surrender 
of the garrison, every effort was made to get this fellow 
out of his hiding place to no effect; said he had no business 
out “dare.” Being no way to get him except to dig him
out, we moved off and had not the time to give to the capture
of one man. We next moved in the direction of Lawrenceburg 
where we had a pretty stiff fight; next in the direction
of Franklin, Tenn., where we took part in that memorable battle; 
after this we were sent to Murfreesboro, Tenn., to assist
in the capture of that place. After a hard struggle we failed
to capture the works. Here I was severely wounded in the
left foot, the ball passing through the instep, from which I
have never recovered. I was carried to the field hospital for
the purpose of amputating the limb, but after a consultation
H was deferred. I was then carried back to Franklin, Tenn.,
where I remained until Hood's defeat in front of Nashville.</p>
          <p>Here I will digress to say that the company was commanded
by Lieutenant M.L. Cherry until the army again arrived in
<pb id="carroll36" n="36"/>
Mississippi. Here another reorganization was necessary, 
made so by the fearful depletion of our ranks. I was again 
chosen Captain of the company which now took what was left 
of about three companies to make one. Mr. Frank Bell of 
Purdy, Tenn., the former adjutant of the regiment, first lieutenant; 
Mr. W. B. Malone of McNairy county, second lieutenant. 
I was never with the company again; this being the last 
of December, 1864, and the surrender <sic>occuring</sic> in May 1865. 
I was unable to walk even at the time of the surrender. (Here 
I want to say that two nobler, braver, officers never lived than
Frank Bell and W. B. Malone.)</p>
          <p>Leaving Franklin just ahead of the retreating army in a
one-horse wagon with one mule to draw it, Mr. James Record, 
a member of our company, who had been with me all the 
while nursing me, drove the mule; I lay on my back with the 
shoe off the well foot and it placed against the front end of
the wagon to hold the wounded foot from jolting against the 
wagon; the weather being very cold and only one blanket each,
we moved out, cold of course; my right foot was soon severely
frost-bitten; so much so, that the skin and toe-nails all came
off together. In crossing one of those rapid running streams 
in Lawrence county, Tenn., had to keep a certain track for 
on either side the water was very deep. Crossing one of these
streams the water came up over me. Of course I had my head 
up above the water; but, on nearing the bank and the current
being very strong, our wagon swerved downstream (a few feet
perhaps) where the water was very deep. Just before reaching
the bank, it seemed that the mule would give way entirely and 
so stood holding with all his might; with all the encouragement
that could be given him, he finally male a supreme effort, got 
to the bank and out of the water, very much to our delight;
for as to me I thought a watery grave was my doom. Continuing our
journey my clothes froze on me and I was in quite a 
bad plight. Calling at a farm house late in the evening we 
were taken in, warmed and fed. We continued our journey 
the next day with about the same luck as the previous day, except 
the wetting. Just here I want to state that lieutenant 
<pb id="carroll37" n="37"/>I. J. Galbraith who had a large mule came to us and put it to the
wagon in place of ours, which was about worn out. He rode
my horse which was being led behind the wagon; the kindness
of this gentleman we much appreciated; it enabled us to go on
our journey; he also stayed with us until the end. On the
fourth day we arrived at Carrollsville, on the Tennessee river.
By this time I was very much worn out but had no chance for
a much needed rest and the treatment which I so much needed. 
Behind us thundered the cannon and shouts of a victorious 
army; in our front yawned the turbid waters of the Tennessee 
river upon whose bosom and sometimes, in distinct hearing, 
floated a portion of the United States navy. To cross we
were compelled. Casting about we found a man with a dugout
just large enough for me to be laid in and for the oarsman to
sit on the other end. The frail craft sinking up to within about
four inches of the top. We moved on gently, though the river
was level with its banks; the low coarse whistle of a federal
gunboat being uncomfortably near; we crossed all right and
friends carried me up the bank and to Mr. Frank Hassell's
who lived near the river. At this point before crossing, we
had to abandon our wagon; the <sic>federals</sic> having destroyed
every kind of craft on the river to prevent people from crossing, 
there was nothing left but to swim the stock to the west
bank. At Mr. Hassell's we were kindly treated that night.
Early the nest morning we saw approaching the residence from
the direction of the river, a body of men some of whom were
wearing blue overcoats. A heavy fog hung over the land as a
pall of darkness, making it impossible to distinguish friends
from foes. The men who had been with me the evening before
and night, feeling themselves unable to cope with the (as we
thought) advancing foe, retired. I arose from the bed and
holding to a chair managed to get to the gallery in front of
the house, and laying my wounded foot on the railing and
clasping my left arm around a post, all this time clad in my
night-clothes I was watching the approach of the body of men.
I thought that death or a prison awaited me and not knowing
which, but, if any difference, preferring the former, either of
<pb id="carroll38" n="38"/>
which was most appalling. I had noticed moving about the
house, during my stay there over night and that morning, a
rather beautiful young lady of medium height, delicate build,
dark brown eyes, long flowing tresses of silken black hair, but
had not once thought of the real deep, fiery southern blood that
coursed her delicate veins until she came suddenly up to
where I was holding to the post. She handed me my pistols
which had been left in the room and said to me, “Sir, those
are <sic>federals</sic>. Sell your life as dearly as possible. They will
burn this house and premises, but that is all right. Kill as
many Of them as possible.” Saying this she moved inside the
door to await results. Being determined never to go to a federal 
prison and being much encouraged by the words of the
young lady, I stood as erect as possible for one in my condition
and determined to fire on them with deadly aim. as soon as
they came to the fence, which was within about ten feet of
where I was standing. When they arrived at the fence to my
great surprise and gratification, they were Confederates, many
of whom I knew. We had a good handshake all around and
were happy. They remarked that from the color of my dress
they would have supposed I was for peace.</p>
          <p>The name of this young lady I do not now remember, but
learned that she is in Paducah, Ky., engaged in the millinery
business, doing well and loved and respected. God grant her
a long and happy life and an eternity of bliss.</p>
          <p>Collecting our little band, taking leave of this kind and hospitable 
family, Mr. Hassell lending a buggy to assist in getting 
me home, we started on our journey again, the distance
to Center Point, the home of my father, being about thirty
miles. Putting my wounded foot upon the seat of the buggy
by the side of the driver and laying my head and shoulders
in the foot of the buggy, a peculiar position for a buggy ride,
but it was the best and only way I could go. This position and
the condition in which my foot had gotten by this time,
made the travel very painful to me. I surely thought that I
would not survive the day; a rough and rocky road added to
my tortures. Arriving at my father's house about dark, I
<pb id="carroll39" n="39"/>was carried in, given some nourishment and placed on a feather
bed, a luxury I had not enjoyed for quite a while. The wound
being very painful, I slept but little, but the fact of being at
home, gave me much cheer. The wound grew worse all the
while, so much so, that fears were entertained of lockjaw.
I remained at father's one week only. When it was known
among the Unionists that I was at home wounded, that part
of the country being largely on the side of the federal authorities, 
it was dangerous to be seen in many places. I was
doomed, so the enemy thought, to capture and possibly death.
Suspecting their intentions, a good Southern lady took a piece
of cloth, made with her own hands, and went out among the
loyal citizens, as they termed themselves; the cloth was suitable
for men's wear and offered it for sale; stopping at every house
and chatting along with the Union ladies, she soon found the
plans they had laid for my capture or death; of course the
cloth was not sold nor was it intended to be; it only furnished
an excuse for the calls, but I was fully notified of the fact that
I was to be dispatched. A brother who was at home had an
os wagon backed up to the door of the room and I was duly
placed in it and driven, jolting along a distance of four miles,
to the home of an aunt of mine who cared for me, giving me
all the attention possible. This was Aunt Nancy A. Carroll,
whose small baby girl would bring such things to me as she
thought I would like to eat and also slip them to me. The
physician allowed me only a certain amount which we did not
think enough. Here I improved some. In about one week,
however, I was again informed that it would be dangerous for
me to remain longer. It seemed as if the loyal unionists thirsted 
for my little remaining blood. So I again sought the ox
wagon and this time went to Mr. Jessie Rhodes', a good Southern 
man and very kind, whose wife was equally kind. Here
I was laid behind the door in a room where no one saw me except 
they came into the room, which they seldom did.</p>
          <p>I remained here until the 17th day of the following April.
On that day I crawled out into the yard and saw for the first
time in four months the beauties of nature. The leaves were
<pb id="carroll40" n="40"/>
green, as were every living thing; wheat, up pretty tall, lambs, 
frisking about; farmers, at work; all nature wore a smile. I 
remember that I had only seen through the crack of the door 
so safely was I hidden. This effort of crawling out, though, 
damaged me and it was three weeks before I could be out 
again. But during this last confinement, though I improved 
rapidly and was able to read, which helped me to while away the time, the wound recuperating all the time. Again getting out I thought by laying my wounded foot on the horse's neck I could ride to father's, a distance of about seven miles, which I did get
ting along pretty well.</p>
          <p>Arriving home, my sisters put my horse away. Stepmother and all the family came out and seated. We were engaged in a good old-fashioned family circle conversation, for neither thay nor I expected, when I was taken away from t
here the previous winter, that I would ever be home again. In the midst of this pleasant reunion what should I see but a company of bluecoats, about forty in number, near the house and approaching rapidly. Escape was impossible even if I had been well; a 
bold front was my only chance and that a very poor one. I thought, when I learned that it was a troop of the famous 6th Tenn. Cavalry, U.S.A., Col. Hurst's, noted for their chivalry in killing prisoners, robbing houses, wardrobes, etc., a terror in fact t
o old men, helpless women and innocent children who happened to be a Southern turn of mind. I took up my crutches, hopped out to the gate, put my crippled foot on the fence, addressed them as gentlemen, invited them to alight which they declined to do. Ju
st here the strategy on my part began. My belief has ever been that they intended to kill me as their custom usually was on such occasions. Inquiring my name and rank, and being told, they began to question me upon a great many things, my wounds, my horse
, and many other things; I answered to the best advantage. Finally of them, a large stout man wearing a pair of green spectacles, rode up near where I was standing with a pistol in hand. I believed my time had come. Just at his moment one of the crowd spo
ke up and said: “That man is telling the truth,” referring   
<pb id="carroll41" n="41"/>to me. After a consultation with each other they 
turned to me and said they wanted my horse. To this I replied 
I had no horse, having lost him when I was wounded; my horse that
moment was in the stable. They then proposed to take me 
to prison. To this I, of course, consented, telling them as I 
had nothing and could not ride they would have to haul me. 
They then inquired the way to several different homes of 
Southern families which I proceeded to give them, though in 
a very circuitous route, telling them as I could not get away 
I would be there on their return to which they assented and 
rode away. One may imagine, but not realize, how supremely 
happy I was at this. My great fears were that they would
look about the barn and see that my statements were false 
but they did not. I watched the receding column with
breathless anxiety, as it slowly passed out of sight. Then my
sister, in meek silence, led my horse, briddled and saddled, to
the door and assisted me to mount, my crutches on one arm 
my wounded foot hanging straight down. Turning my horse 
towards the gate he leaped the fence; I felt that I was again for
a time at least a free man. Going in the direction of a friend's
house for whom they had inquired and knowing that, 
to get there first, I must go through the woods and ride rapidly, 
I pushed on and succeeded in warning the people to put 
their stock and themselves out of the way. This accomplished, 
I started in the direction of home and on going by to warn
another Southern family of the raid that was upon them, I 
rode into this same crowd plundering the house of a Southern 
man; their horses tied along the yard fence; coming on to 
them in the manner in which I did it was almost impossible 
to go back. So I rode along by the fence, the men in the 
house looking at me but for some cause they hesitated and 
did not fire upon me. Trusting to my good horse, Texas, 
dangerous as it was I passed them; my beautiful gray horse  
whose action was good and of whose speed I had no doubt, 
I gave the word to go and he went by in such speed that in a
moment of time I had passed and turned down the hill out of 
their sight and out of range of their shots. I continued my ride 
<pb id="carroll42" n="42"/>
deep into the bottom. The wound in my foot by this time 
bled quite freely and it was considerably swollen by swinging 
down so long. When I was fully safe, I dismounted and
remained two days before I was again able to move.</p>

            <emph rend="bold"> A Reign of Terror.</emph>
          </head>
          <p>Emerging from my seclusion I went back into the country  
where I could at least feel safe from the enemies of our country
and get much needed rest. About this time came the 
fall of Richmond and the surrender of Lee's army which       
sounded the death knell of the Southern Cause. The Unionists
became very much <sic>emboldened</sic> by this and became more and 
more aggressive towards their Southern neighbors and especially 
towards those who had been in the Southern army. 
Many of those who had been enlisted in the federal army from   
our part  of the country began to return to their homes. Flushed
with victory by the accomplishment of that towards which they 
had contributed very little, they banded together with a lot 
of scoundrels who had not been in the federal army, save 
for a spell, but who wore the blue for the purpose of murder,
arson and theft. I remember well one calm summer day in 
1865 when they went to the home of Dr. J. J. McBride, robbed 
the house of what they wanted and burned the premises 
and buildings with contents. Moving on from this they came to 
the house of Mr. Briggance, an old and respected citizen, 
whose only offense was that he had a son who had been in the
Confederate army and who was then at home and at work on 
the farm. They marched this son to the house, tied him to a 
tree in the yard and in the presence of his aged father and
mother shot him to death and burned the house and contents. 
Moving on in this work they nest came across Mr. George 
Swift. Him they murdered and left dead on the roadside for 
a pious father and mother to take home and bury. Proceeding 
on, the next victim was an old and inoffensive man, he, as the 
<pb id="carroll43" n="43"/>others, had been a Confederate soldier; he too was shot down 
in his own doorway. These are only a few of the many occurrences 
of this kind that happened during that reign of 
terror. Looking back over these times my blood recoils at the
recital. Some of this same crew of outlaws came to Mr. J. 
H. Galbraith's; his son, J. N. Galbraith, was at home on parole;
his aged mother, young wife and little sister were present. 
They began to shoot at him; the pleadings of a mother, wife 
and sisters for the life of a dear one, pleading only as they
could plead, had no effect on them. He fled; they pursued and
shot at him. Being weak they soon overtook him. Being well
acquainted with him, they said, “Newt, c---- you, we have a  
mind to kill you but will let you pass this time, you look so 
d---- bad. ” This set of men had been, by him many times, accommodated, 
as a merchant and in many ways. This reign 
of terror continued on and on; about this time, the last of   
May and first of June, the paroled soldiers of the Confederate 
armies, that were left, began to arrive home. That remnant 
of the proudest army that ever faced a foe, many of whom 
had not seen home nor friends since 1861, without money,  
without clothes save a much worn and faded Confederate      
suit. They went to work with the same determination to make 
a crop as they had to win the fight. But even at this peaceful 
occupation with a parole ill their pockets, many of them were
shot at their plows. Looking back over this reign of terror 
one can but exclaim, “Great God! dost Thou control and direct
the destinies of men upon the earth?” On many occasions 
the ex-Confederates, at work; their old gray jackets would be
taken off, and being on the fence or other convenient place 
while at work, if there chanced to pass a squad of these <sic>federals</sic>, 
they would frequently stop and draw their pistols and
proceed to put the old jackets full of bullet holes. The ex-
Confederates, unarmed and not allowed to carry arms, they 
would curse and abuse the ex-Confederates to their heart's 
content. This thing becoming so unbearable that there arose 
what was known as the Ku-Klux-Klan, a secret oath-bound
organization among the Southern people. They wore masks 
<pb id="carroll44" n="44"/>
and traveled in the night-time. The insignia was a skull and
cross-bones. Of this order I was a loyal member and woe unto 
the insolent negro or turbulent white man who incurred its
displeasure! This was made necessary in self defense and 
had the effect of putting a quietus on the insolence of that crew
of thieves. By fall of the year my wound had so much improved 
that I had began to wear a soft shoe. In company 
with another rebel I repaired to another part of the country 
and began to build and repair cotton gins. We found our work 
in demand and prices remunerative; so we continued while 
there was work of that kind to do. That winter I went home 
and father and all of us went to work repairing his premises  
and rebuilding his mill which had gone down during the war. 
By the spring of 1866, I was sufficiently recovered to wear a
shoe and began to clean up a piece of land which had not 
been cultivated but once during the war and was overgrown 
with bushes; many trunks of fallen trees still lay where they 
had fallen. I began, I think the first of February to cut and
burn logs, dig grubs and fix fence with no help but my own 
hands, hoping that I might be able to make an honest living by
the sweat of my face and be unmolested by those unprincipled
scoundrels; but not so, by this time the whole of the federal
army, which had been enlisted in this country had returned 
to their homes; their pockets lined with greenback money, 
good horses and good clothes. Many, in fact most of the ex-
Confederates, having been driven from their homes or killed, 
it was thought too much for an ex-Confederate captain to live in
that country; much less to have the audacity to attempt to till
the earth and cultivate a crop. So I was again spotted 
as one not worthy to cumber the earth. The plans were laid 
that, on a certain Tuesday, I should pay the penalty by giving 
up my life as many others had done not long before.</p>
          <p>I was hard at work chopping on a big, hard, old log and on
looking up towards the road, I saw an old man, whom I recognized, 
as, having been at the beginning of the war in 1861, a
rabid secessionist, but who had after the battle of Shiloh become
extremely loyal to the other side, riding carelessly along eyeing 
<pb id="carroll45" n="45"/>me all the while. This gave me an uneasiness. Getting my 
horse and watching, I soon saw twenty-seven men in blue rushing 
towards me from every direction, halting and shooting at 
me all the while. It seemed for a little while that they had 
me, but, being astride my splendid gray horse, Texas, I rode  
out through them and made my escape without hurt or loss, 
except my hat and a rather painful wound in one shoulder 
caused by the horse running against a tree. There was no 
legal process out for my arrest or anything of that kind. 
They had been entertained at a citizen's house for a day or two,
dancing, drinking etc., and to close the entertainment in good
style, go out and kill a rebel, which they failed to do this time
at least. Returning in a couple of days, I determined to make   
a crop or die in the field so proceeded with my work, keeping 
my faithful horse tied near me, a double barreled shotgun
conveniently near and a pistol always at hand. When it came  
time to commence plowing, I plowed a mule, kept my horse
bridled and saddled near the center of the field. At night I
slept in the woods where I might be safe; neighbor boys frequently 
staying with me. On one occasion a man whom I 
had known well before the war by the name of John Griswell, 
came walking slowly into the field where I was at work.
Allowing him to come within about forty yards of where I 
was, I put my hand on the gun and asked him if he wanted
anything. “No, nothing much.” he said with a yawn. “You 
seem to be pretty well armed,” said he. “Yes, fairly well,”
I answered. “I just thought I would come down and see how 
you were getting on.” “Thank you,” said I, “won't you 
come nearer?” “Thank you,” said he, “I'll be going. Good-bye.” 
I watched the receding figure with considerable mirth,
though it was all by myself, and thought of the wolf that went
out to get wool and came back shorn. He doubtless thought 
that he would come down, find me unarmed and do and say 
just what he pleased. Proceeding with my work I made about 
fifty barrels of corn and nearly one bale of cotton. The reign  
of terror still continuing, things had come to the point where 
I could not longer remain in the country without either killing 
<pb id="carroll46" n="46"/>
a lot of them or being killed. I had at intervals worked a 
little in a country store and boarded with the proprietor, 
whose eldest daughter, then at home, was to my mind as perfect 
a model of Southern womanhood as could possibly be 
found and to say that I admired and loved her was putting it
mildly. But to mention such a thing to her, situated as I then
was, I could not afford to do. Through the advice of friends 
and considering a treacherous and unrelenting foe which I 
had to deal with, it was thought best that I leave the country. 
I accordingly bid the home-folks adieu and with a heavy heart
parted with them all, and especially when it came to bidding
farewell to her whom I loved and had not dared to tell so.</p>

          </head>
          <p>I went on my way to Kentucky; arriving there, I found   
many good, warm-hearted Southern people who gave me employment 
and treated me kindly. I went immediately to cutting 
wood at one dollar per cord all that winter and spring,
driving a team part of the time. During the summer I went 
to school, worked Saturdays and all vacations, finally selling 
my horse and going to school more, obtaining a very limited 
education - arithmetic, geography and English grammar. Returning 
during the winter of 1868 to Henderson, Tenn., where 
I engaged as a clerk at a very small salary, more to learn the
business than for the money which I was getting for it. At 
the expiration of my term of service for the firm. I was asked 
to teach a school at Center Point, my old home and neighborhood, 
which I gladly accepted. Matters had undergone a 
great change during these years. The Republican party, that 
party of corruption and oppression, had passed an act in 1861,
disfranchising all Southern sympathizers and ex-Confederates,
that is, not allowing them to vote nor hold office in the state,
but the leaders of this same party had fallen out among themselves; 
one of them being governor and another one wishing to 
<pb id="carroll47" n="47"/>be; the one who was already governor, fearing the other one 
would defeat him and having the power to issue certificates 
of enfranchisement to whom he pleased, had his agents appointed 
and issued them broadcast; the result being his election 
by a large majority and the election of a democratic
legislature also the enfranchisement of all the people. Thus was
brought about the saying. “When thieves fall out, honest men 
get their dues. ”Seeing the Democrats again in power in the 
state and this rabble having spent most of their war money, 
a good many of them having been killed, first and last, they 
were very much calmed down. Seeing their political rule at an
end, they were quite willing for peace and friendship to which 
we assented. So I went on with my school two years, having 
good success, about as many pupils as I could attend to, many 
of them being young men and young women whose opportunities 
had been poor as had been my own. At the end of two 
years I had advanced the classes as far as I had education 
to do; so I closed out the school-teaching business, sat by the 
door and bid my pupils each farewell as they filed out and 
away with a strange sadness in my heart, wondering what 
would be the life of this one and that one. Let me say, though,
in closing this chapter, that all of the boys and girls who were
of my pupil, all of them save one, have made men and women 
of honor and integrity. Among their number today are some 
of the most successful farmers, merchants, doctors, etc., and 
for each and all of them I entertain the highest admiration 
and respect. Looking over my accounts I found that I had 
made after paying my little expenses, one thousand dollars, 
so I put forth my energies and collected it up. Not much 
money, you will say and tight too, but then I had made it
honestly and saved it and it was my own, hence my appreciation.</p>

          </head>
          <p>Turning my attention now, for something more permanent 
and lasting in the way of a business pursuit, than school-
teaching, still having in mind the features of a brown-eyed,
dark-haired maiden, before referred to, in fact, the image of 
her rosy cheeks, gentle voice and manners, had not faded from 
my memory during all these years. Time had rather intensified 
than weakened my admiration for her. So from what I 
had seen and heard on the subject, I concluded that I was 
really in love with Miss Mary S. Galbraith. Being now in the 
thirty-first year of my age and she in her twenty-first, thought
we ought to get married. I proposed and she accepted accordingly. 
On the fourteenth day of Dec. 1871 we were united 
in marriage by Rev. Mr. Swift, a Methodist minister, and a 
true Southern man. On the third day after our marriage, we 
took a bridal tour, walked about four hundred yards to her
brothers, Mr. J. N. Galbraith's, home, took dinner, had a good
time and returned, being pleased with the partnership already
formed; I concluded to try a further partnership with the 
family in a business way; I conferred with Mr. Jno. H. Galbraith 
and his son J. N. Galbraith upon the subject, and after
some deliberating, they agreed to accept me as a business
partner. So with my one thousand dollars, I entered the
mercantile business. Our business did fairly well. At the 
end of three years we thought best to dissolve the firm which 
we did. I then went into business on my own account, at the 
same place; of course in a very small way. I entered my own
establishment which was a very small concern, being a log 
house 18x24 feet. I succeeded fairly well, built up a good 
trade, and for eleven years worked faithfully and hard; as 
I now remember, losing only three or four days by sickness 
during these years. My business prospered as well as it 
<pb id="carroll49" n="49"/>could in a country place with only a small capital to operate
upon. I worked all the while; if I thought it necessary 
to ride at night to see after my affairs, I did so, rain or
shine; I failed not; how foolish! as the sequel will show. 
All this time my faithful wife was ever at my side, to aid, 
to comfort and to encourage. Her health was not very 
good. She was not strong, but looked well to the ways of her
household, ate not the bread of idleness, and took special care
of everything I made, rejoicing with me at our moderate success. 
Not knowing how the wealthy fared nor how the very 
poor lived, we were free from both extremes and as happy as 
we could well be. I am reminded of the saving of the prophet: 
“take me neither rich nor poor, lest I be rich and forget 
Thee, or poor and despise Thee.” Our oldest son now being
about eleven years old and our only daughter about eight,
we thought it necessary to see about their education and having 
no school at or near our home at Center Point, we decided 
best for the children that we go to Henderson, the county 
seat of our county, where we might educate our children. 
Our youngest child, a boy, having died in infancy left us only
the two children, Thos. B. and Vorena H. Carroll. Accordingly 
we purchased a lot and built a house, wife and children 
moved to it, the children entering school. I continued my business 
at Center Point, but during the second year of this mode 
of living, my health began to give way. Suffering from the
effects of wounds which brought on a disease known among 
the physicians as locomotor ataxia from which I will never
recover; having been most of the time since I was attacked, 
a period of fourteen years, only able to do a very little work 
and now for the past six months have not been out of my door-
yard but one time.</p>
          <p>Our children did well in school. Thos. B. graduated in
West Tennessee Christian College, married when about twenty-
one years of age to Miss Suzelle Murchison, a beautiful and
accomplished lady. They have two sons, Raymond Trice and John
Murchison Carroll, of whom I am very proud. </p>

          </head>
          <p>Our daughter, Vorena H., graduated at the West Tennessee 
Christian College. We then sent her to a female college at
Holly Springs, Miss., for two years, where she added to her
former acquirements. She was not a thorough scholar, but
liberally educated in languages - English, French and German; 
a full course of mathematics, music and art; in all of 
which she did well; added to these were all the household acquirements   necessary. And above all of a noble character, 
amiable disposition, a kind word for all, the humble as well 
as the favored. Our extreme love for her was fully reciprocated. 
During her absence at school, we built a new house on 
our lot and otherwise beautified our home. On her return 
from school she said, “Papa, this is the prettiest place on
earth. I never want to leave here again.” We were all so 
happy at being together once again. We thought she was 
with us to remain to cheer us along down the shady side of 
life. But alas! She was not to be. After only a few months 
she was stricken with that awful disease, peritonitis, from 
which she lingered eight and a half months in great pain. All
that medical science could do was done. The best nursing in 
our power and that of a host of friends was rendered, but all 
to no avail. Death, the grim monster, that calls alike for the
good and the bad, the innocent and the guilty, came and 
took her from us. At the awful stroke, the light seemed to 
have gone out of our home and happiness departed from the 
earth as far as we were concerned. A small marble enclosure, 
a plat of green grass, a few flowers and evergreens, planted
there by loving hands, in the Henderson cemetery, mark the 
spot where we laid to rest our loving and beloved daughter, 
whose remains must await the call of the resurrection. Her 
photo on the mantel, her works of art on the walls, her little 
<pb id="carroll51" n="51"/>room, her everything left, only reminded us more forcibly of 
the departed one whom we shall never more see upon the earth.
Anything and everything of hers we see are only silent reminders 
of her industrious hands and amiable disposition.</p>

          </head>
          <p>Let me now drop back a few years to the beginning of my
ill health and bad luck. Being prostrated as I before referred
to, I was taken to Henderson and in the spring following 
hauled back to Center Point, spending the summer there and
selling half interest in my business to J. R. Washburn and 
later selling him the other half. Returning to Henderson I
engaged in business with W. E. McCleod. Later we took 
in another partner, Mr. W. G. Massengill; later we dissolved
this firm. Still later I engaged in business with Mr. W. C. 
McCollum. Our business did not prosper, losing heavily on 
cotton, in fact almost everything. At this time, the general
government forcing a gold standard upon the country, ruined 
us financially. I went out of the business, but not out of debt.
Shrinkage in values of everything at a ruinous rate; cotton 
going down from 11 cents per pound to 4 1/2 to 6; corn from 
65 cents per bushel to 16 cents; real estate declining at least
300 percent; good lands in the vicinity of Henderson which
brought from 25 to 40 dollars per acre, twelve years before,
could not now be sold at all for more than six to ten dollars
per acre. Business men, the oldest, best traders of all kinds,
going into insolvency right along one after another; creditors
becoming more and more exacting; syndicates and banking institutions becoming more and more cautious, exacting 12 per 
cent. and 15 per cent. for the use of money; a pound of money 
or a pound of flesh seemed to be the order of the day and holders 
of real estate who like myself thought it the safest and best
collateral in the world, found themselves suddenly bankrupt. 
The products of the soil going at such low prices, the people 
<pb id="carroll52" n="52"/>
actually became too poor to consume. In this condition I find 
not only myself but many others and when the end will come 
or what will be the final result, I cannot foretell. If it does
not end in revolution I shall be agreeably surprised. Under 
this system of government, the money-lender is in position to
demand of the producer, who has to have money, about as 
much of the products of the soil as he wants for a dollar. In
many cases this is so. I claim that we are entitled to an equal
chance in the race of life; no more, no less. That when the government 
steps in and says by law to the holder of real estate,
“I will reduce the volume of currency so that money will become 
scarce and high and everything else;” or in other words
it shall take 2 1/2 pounds of cotton to bring as much money as 1
pound did three years ago, or four acres of land, or three
horses; this is simply highway robbery, no less so because  
done under the forms of law. Government has put forth its 
hands and taken from one of its citizens and given to another,
because that other had invested in bonds and gold while the
one had put his money into real estate, thereby reducing the
wealth of two-thirds to three-fourths and enhancing the wealth 
of the other in like proportion. Such is the case in this country
today and the government which did it ought to be reformed 
or abolished, laying its foundation on better principles. 
Thomas Jefferson said, “Equal and exact justice to all, special 
privileges to none,” which is the only true policy of government.</p>
          <p>Now in this year of grace, by observation and experience I
am prepared to offer the following suggestions. I am persuaded 
that I am correct when I say, look well to your health,
guard it with a zealous care. That is your only capital. Fortunately 
for you, maybe, you were not born rich, but what is
better, you were born of healthful parents, having sound 
bodies and strong minds. Of which we hope you have inherited 
much. Having that grand prerequisite to begin with, 
you have it within your power to rise to positions of trust 
and eminence.</p>
          <p>Merit being the card that always wins in the end, therefore 
<pb id="carroll53" n="53"/>prepare yourselves to fill any position to which you may be
called and, when called, discharge it faithfully and fully to the
very utmost detail, be that position high or low. Should you
become farmers, lawyers, or teachers, it matters not what your
calling may be, stand at the head of the list; try to be the 
very best. Remember that success is obtained only by a thorough 
knowledge of, and close application to, every detail of 
a business. Be sure to ask of those who are proficient in any
business or study that you would like to learn. They could 
perhaps give you in a few words what it would perhaps take 
you weeks, unaided, to learn.</p>

            <l>Be it upon Christian or heathen ground.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>In you intercourse with the world be ever so courteous to
all, especially to the aged. It is worth all it costs and more
too. “Bow thyself to the hoary head and honor the face of 
the old man,” saith the scriptures.</p>
          <p>Don't ever think that the eyes of older persons are not looking 
upon you and taking cognizance of your conduct. For there
certainly will be others besides father and mother who 
will do this, and the estimate placed upon you by these outside 
persons will determine largely your standing in the community. 
Much depends upon this.</p>
          <p>Be sure never to deceive any one. Speak the truth though 
the heavens' fall. Be ever careful to do only such acts as you
would be neither ashamed nor afraid for the world to know. 
Then you will be all right. A conscience void of offense is 
the great bulwark to manhood. In fact you can never be manly 
men if your lives are flecked with deeds of evil.</p>
          <p>Should you with friends at any time' enter into any kind of
contest in school work' or anything else, do your best in an
honorable way and, if successful, never arrogate to yourself 
all the praise for the success, but concede to those who worked
with you full honor for their part. Modesty, that crowning 
gem of the virtues, demands this of you. It will make personal
friends of the one you' thus act toward. Some civilities of 
<pb id="carroll54" n="54"/>
this sort, especially towards the poor or those whose station 
in life might be below yours, will be appreciated and make 
them your friends. Whereas an abrupt speech or haughty 
manner will make them enemies. You want the friendship 
of all, where it is not necessary to sacrifice principle to
obtain it. This never do under any circumstances.</p>
          <p>Have few confidants outside of father and mother, but 
should you have, which most persons do, be a confidant indeed;
keep locked within your own bosom anything thus communicated 
to you if you thus agree. It is in many cases better,
though, to say, to one who seems to have a great secret he wishes
to communicate, that you prefer that he does not tell you. 
It is such an easy matter to become a tattler if one is not particular.</p>
          <p>You are certain to have troubles that you want sympathy 
and help to solve. In such time go to father and mother 
who are your best friends and into whose ears you can confidently 
pour all your hopes and fears and whose experience 
in life and observation of men and things, will enable them 
to point you in an honorable way out of your troubles. Depend 
upon them and take their advice. In them you have 
friends without dissimulation, variableness, or shadow of turning. 
The world may buffet you, pass by, and scoff at your misfortunes. 
Men, who in your days of prosperity were ever
ready to smile upon you, many times in your hours of distress 
will not know you. All men will not do this but some 
men will. Father and mother never will, consequently go to 
them. Tell them the trouble, take their advice, their experience 
in life will enable them to point out to you the dangers 
in this or that course; also to direct you what to run after and
what to refrain from; that which is dangerous to your life and
character, also that which will be ennobling to both.</p>
          <p>To mother be very kind, respectful and obedient. She will
never forsake you. Prison bars might enclose you, which God
forbid, but even then mother will be there to own, to comfort, 
and to plead for her sons. If necessary to go to the 
very death, she will go for you. Having such how kind, obedient 
<pb id="carroll55" n="55"/>and careful you should ever be toward her. If mother 
is sick, wait upon her; nurse her; care for her. On rising in 
the morning never fail to seek mother and say: “Mother, are 
you well today?”  Never leave home even for one day without
telling father and mother good-bye; and on returning never 
fail to greet them kindly. They will appreciate this in you 
more than you suspect. They entertain for your welfare a 
deep solicitude; the depth and intensity of which you have 
but little idea. Be ever kind to all people, especially those in
distress; despise no one's condition in life, for think to-day
how sad or poor may be yours tomorrow.</p>

              <emph rend="bold">Be Temperate In Expression.</emph>
            </head>
            <p>I have so often heard extravagant expressions that I wondered 
that someone didn't take them to task about it. I 
have heard such expression from right sensible persons too: 
“As high as a tree,” “as black as a negro,” etc., when the
objects spoken of did not resemble trees nor <sic>negroes</sic>; neither 
did the persons speaking intend to be so understood. How 
much better to express ourselves in moderation! Be exact 
as possible; never exaggerate in your description. Then explanations 
are unnecessary.</p>
            <p>Be sure to govern your passions in a proper manner.  Why, 
I have heard persons say, “I got so mad at so-and-so, or such-
and-such persons” - as if to fly into a passion was a virtue that
all might be proud of. Such a one has my sympathy; a terrible 
malady has possessed him instead of a virtue. Why, a 
man in extreme anger, a drunk man and a crazy man are for 
the time being much alike. They are unfitted for business,
unfitted for social circles, a torture to themselves, unpleasant
to their friends, in fact repulsive to all. Therefore how important 
it is maintain an equal frame of mind, thereby being 
at all times ready for the transaction of business, the reception
of friends and for the practice of morality and virtue.</p>
            <p>Above all avoid the intemperate use of ardent spirits.  In
fact use it not at all. Intoxicating drinks are harmful to all,
and, when once a person has become habituated to the use of 
this stimulant, it is frequently impossible for him to resist the
temptation. Many a good boy and bright young fellow can 
note the beginning of his downward career to his first drink.
Never take the first one and you will never need the second.
Never begin drinking the vile stuff and you will never have 
to quit. Let it severely alone. If you drink it to excess, which
you may do, if you drink at all, it will corrupt your morals 
<pb id="carroll57" n="57"/>however good, cause you to waste your time and money; it
will cause you to be shunned by the good and virtuous; it will
make your wife a slave and your children beggars; it will ruin
the happiness of your home, dethrone your reason and make
you hate yourself; it will leave your boys and girls uneducated
and paupers; it causes suicides, beggars, murderers, and, if
there is anything else imaginable more horrible, it is that also.
Never go near such damnable places as where whiskey is sold.
How easy it is for persons in both youth and age to become
entangled in the meshes of intemperance! Go not near it. Go
nowhere or into no place where you would be ashamed for
your mother or sister to go, or where you would be ashamed to
be found dead. Never play cards nor gamble in any way. It
leads to ruin; and remember, when you have staked your first
money on any game or taken the first drink, you have taken
the first step in a downward course-boys, never take it.</p>
            <p>In your business relations with men be careful that you
fully understand the propositions and that the person with
whom you are trading understands every detail as well as yourself. 
This will prevent misunderstandings and lawsuits, make
lasting friends, and keep you out of much trouble. Make
promises slowly and after much deliberation and then not
without you see some reasonable chance of fulfillment. But
when you have promised, bend all your energies to make your
word good. Never go to law about trifles; it is better to
sustain a small loss than to enter into lawsuits. The winner 
in such cases is loser in the end. Avoid every appearance
of wrong-doing and all appearance of evil or that which might
lead to misunderstandings.</p>
            <p>Should you enter into mercantile pursuits, be careful to take
care of yourself. Go not in debt. Buy only what you can pay
for at the time or on very short notice. Sell' for the money
and, should you owe anything, pay it out of the first money.
Remember that should you get behind - owe matured bills that
you cannot meet, no one will come to your relief, except that
he is to get more from you that he gives. You will have in this,
as in all other things in life, to stand alone, unaided, and the
<pb id="carroll58" n="58"/>sooner you realize this fact the better for you. Therefore begin
in that way.</p>
            <p>Beware of debt; shun it as you would the deadly upas-tree.
Anyone out of debt is in pretty fair condition. Earn your
money with your hands. When you have done this, you will
the more appreciate it and be the better prepared to make
paying investments. Knowing the amount of labor that is
necessary to earn a dollar, you will know exactly what a dollar
is worth and, therefore, look the closer to your interests and
let matters which do not concern you, especially, pass by; for
should you espouse the cause of everyone who has a grievance,
your time will be so closely occupied with other people's business 
that your own affairs will suffer thereby.</p>
            <p>Always have as soon as it is possible for you to earn it, a
small amount of cash on hand, that you may be able to take
advantage of any good trade that is offered. Such trades
come to those who have ready money. Any person man or boy,
with one dollar in his pocket, though his clothes be patched
and his hat seedy, is in better <sic>conditon</sic> and much to be preferred 
to the <sic>conditon</sic> of the one who has no money and who
is “diked” up in good clothes and owes for them. The first
one is a free man; the second, a slave.</p>
            <p>In selecting your associates prefer those whose moral and
intellectual acquirements are high; and to be congenial and
companionable to such associates, it will be incumbent upon
you to prepare yourself to entertain them in conversation upon
such topics as are interesting to them. This will require at
your hands attention to your reading, study of history, biography, 
travels, etc., not neglecting the current literature of the
day. No one enjoys the society of another whom they know to
be their inferior in point of culture. Therefore, should you
aspire to associate with well-informed persons, you must also
be informed, and then cultivate the art of being a good listener
as well as a good conversationalist. Should there be one in
your midst who is backward or timid, manage by gentle means
to draw him into the conversation; he will perhaps give you
a lot of information. Modesty, being one of the cardinal virtues, 
<pb id="carroll59" n="59"/>should be respected. Should one of your company be
speaking, listen attentively until he has finished; then give
your views, if at all, in a plain, simply unostentatious manner.
Let the company see that you are not vain nor puffed up. Should
you enter into discussion with anyone upon any question either
for information or because you consider his position an erroneous 
one, do so in a calm and dignified manner. And in
stating the position of an opponent, state it correctly and
fairly, but discuss its features with all you ability and with
all the proof of history, or testimony that you can command and
expect the same of him. In your debating societies it is better
to trust your memory as to statements of an opponent than to
write notes. The former will so much improve your memory
as to enable you after a time to repeat almost a whole speech,
whereas, writing tends to weaken the memory. Therefore,
cultivate your memory in every way possible. Commit to 
memory songs, poetry, speeches of able men, whole chapters 
of Scripture for you will find it will pay you. With this fund 
of information on hand, you can call it to your aid at will;
you will surely need it. The historian, Gibbon, it is said, could
commit to memory a whole page of the London Times by 
breakfast. This came largely by cultivation. Do likewise. In 
your selection of books read none but those of standard authors.
Dime novels and other trashy reading tend to weaken the understanding. 
Have nothing to with them.  If your associates 
are those who have nothing to talk about higher than neighborhood 
gossip or scandal, if we hear that alone, we will soon be 
of the same mental calibre and look, listen, and enquire for more
of the same abominable stuff.</p>
            <p>Just so with or reading; we must cultivate a desire for
the best, right at the start before our minds become vitiated 
by the absorption of evil. Always, in conversation, speak of
things more than of persons. If you can speak well of anyone, 
do so in moderation; if you cannot thus speak, it is best to
remain silent. If it should be necessary for you to speak in 
condemnation of the acts of any one, be kind enough to say
perhaps the man may be pretty fair but his act was bad. Judge 
<pb id="carroll60" n="60"/>
not harshly of anyone for you perhaps are not fully aware of 
all his surroundings. Environments have much to do with the 
deeds of all of us; therefore let us be mild in our condemnation 
until we know all the facts.</p>

            </head>
            <p>Mr. Briggance was a true Southern man and, when after
the battle of Shiloh the whole of West Tennessee was overrun 
by the <sic>federals</sic> and when the loyal unionists of our own country 
were extremely troublesome, it became unsafe for Jack to
remain at home. So resorting to cover of the woods and night 
to save his life, he became somewhat noted as a guerrilla. Many
were the <sic>federals</sic> that he captured, unaided and alone, and carried 
across to Middle Tennessee or other places where he could
deliver them to the Confederate authorities. When he had delivered 
one, he lost no time but would immediately return under 
cover of darkness and bring forth another lot. On one 
such tour, traveling until late in the night before he came 
to the federal camp, the weather being very warm and raining all
night, Jack was very tired and sleepy; so much so that on 
his return with his prisoner he became so fatigued that he 
called at the house of a friend for a short rest. Telling the
Yankee to lie down and rest, which the fellow seemed very 
anxious to do; after a few minutes Jack dropped asleep. The
Yankee immediately took the gun, tapped Jack on the shoulder 
and told him, “We will now return to camp.” Jack dreaded 
this very much, but there was no chance but to accept. 
After marching back a couple of hours, the Yankee became 
very tired and proposed to stop in out of the rain and wait until
daylight. Briggance of course assented. This time Jack went 
to sleep and the Yank was guard. Pretty soon, the Yank went 
to sleep and Briggance took the gun, woke him and told him
they would now return towards the land of Dixie. This time 
<pb id="carroll61" n="61"/>he landed him on the east side of the Tennessee river where 
the Confederate forces took charge of him.</p>

            </head>
            <p>Away back in 1866 when it was decided unsafe for me to
remain longer in my native country, I decided to go to Kentucky. 
On my way, passing through Dyersburg, Tenn., I concluded
to exchange my cavalry saddle with a saddler for one 
of a more peaceful and citizen-like look. While at this, a lot 
of ex-federal soldiers surrounded my horse and began to say, 
“I know that horse,” which I knew was not so. But, as their
custom was, I thought they intended to take him from me by 
force if necessary. I went on putting on my new saddle, adjusting 
the length of the stirrup, etc., until I was ready to
mount; pulling a navy six which I had attached to a belt and 
hid under all overcoat well to the front, I announced boldly
that, “This is my horse, gentlemen,” mounted and rode away, 
but not without many misgivings as to what might befall me 
before night. Occasionally looking back to see if I was being
pursued, I pushed on finally coming to the Obion river and 
near Hale's Point on the Mississippi river. Dark came on me.
Finding the Obion river three miles wide from the backwater
and no means of crossing that night, I sought a place to remain 
over night. I wanted a private place too, so, if pursued, 
I might not be found. Turning my horse into a bridle path 
leading along near the water's edge, I soon came to what had 
once been a substantial residence; darkness now had fully 
closed upon everything. Calling at the fence, a man answered 
and upon inquiring if I could pass the night with him, said I
could but would have to occupy the same bed with him, to 
which I assented. Alighting, he ordered a <sic>darkey</sic> to take my 
horse and put him away. There was quite a number of <sic>negroes</sic> 
about there and when my horse was being led away, I never
expected to see him again, but of that I spoke not to my host. 
We entered the cabin. Pretty soon a negro woman brought in 
a supper of bacon and cornbread. Soon the table was put back. 
The room being only about sixteen feet square, containing one 
<pb id="carroll62" n="62"/>
bed, a table, one large box, was quite full. Soon the <sic>negroes</sic>
whom I soon found occupied all the other buildings on the 
place, began to file into the cabin. Mr. Selph (for such was 
his name) reached for an old fiddle and began playing a kind of
mixture between “Mollie Put the Kettle On” and “Run, Negroes, 
Run.” These <sic>negroes</sic> dancing with all their might and 
eyeing the stranger with peculiar <sic>inquisitveness</sic>. Jim would 
jump as high as the table while Bill and Joe cut the pigeon 
wing. Sal was good on the back-step; other ladies of the crew 
did equally well. All of which I feigned to admire and especially 
the music. Thus, the party went on, enjoyed as they
supposed very much by me in whose honor I suppose it was 
given. I swayed with the music and heaped encouragement 
on Jim, my object being to keep it going all night if possible. 
I thought by doing so they probably would not steal my horse.
About ten o'clock at night a couple of men came to the fence and
calling Mr. Selph to them held a hurried conversation. Returning 
he invited me and insisted that I should accompany them
about a mile where they said a very entertaining time 
might be had. To this I demurred and insisted that our own 
party proceed. The men disappearing the dance proceeded. 
While Selph was out, I took a survey of things and saw a 
carbine and brace of pistols hanging on the wall beside a 
federal uniform, which was anything but reassuring to me. 
I soon saw he was tired of his fiddling and without assistance in
music the pleasure would cease. So I seized the instrument, gave
it a few jerks and proceeded to accommodate the crowd 
with “Big Nigger Rare Around,” which must be heard to 
be appreciated. This enlivened Jim and the other dancers to 
such a pitch, that I really thought the entertainment would 
last all night, Mr. Selph himself finally taking a hand in the
dance. However about two o'clock a.m., Sunday, as it now was, we
decided, not on account of it being Sunday but on account 
of being worn out, to quit for the night. The <sic>negroes</sic> repaired 
to their cabins and mine host and I began to discuss matters 
a little. Observing my coat was of Confederate gray, I told 
him frankly I had been a Confederate soldier. He told me 
<pb id="carroll63" n="63"/>
he had once been also, but had gone to the <sic>federals</sic> and had
deserted them also. So we retired, he going to bed first and
behind and I, on the front side. He put his pistol under his
head; I drew mine and laid it on a box at my head. He went 
to sleep but I did not. I imagined a great many things; many 
of which might have been true if I had just but known. Of
one thing I was certain, I was in the presence of and in the
house of one of the worst wrecks of humanity I had ever 
met. There among those <sic>negroes</sic> he lived an outcast I felt
certain. No other white person on the premises and a lot 
of ferocious looking negro bucks to do his bidding. I felt I
would be in luck to get away, but felt somewhat reassured from my
performance on the violin. Daylight soon came, though, and 
to my delight and surprise I found my horse all right; I had 
a meat-and-bread breakfast; I was a splendid fellow with mine
host as well as with the <sic>negroes</sic>. I engaged the <sic>negroes</sic> to 
ferry me across the backwater three miles, which they did; 
paid my bills; bid Mr. Selph a goodbye, promising to return 
and spend another night with him on first passing, which I have
never done yet and guess never will.</p>

              <emph rend="bold">War Incidents of Mr. (afterwards Lieutenant) M. L. Cherry
		     of My Company.</emph>
            </head>
            <p>About the winter of 1862 after the battle of Shiloh, the
<sic>federals</sic> having taken possession of West Tennessee and especially 
the river counties and many of those who had been 
rabid secessionists only a short time before; and many others 
who thought more of greenback money, a suit of blue clothes 
and a horse, which they never paid for, than they did of their 
country, entered the Federal army, not for the good of the
service; not that they ever expected to fight the Confederate
forces; but for the sole purpose of terrorizing their Southern
neighbors. Such a one was Jack Jones, who upon seeing Mr. 
Cherry go into the house of a miller to whose mill he had 
gone to get meal for his family, rode up to the dooryard fence
and thus accosted Mr. Cherry:  “Come out here, Mr. Cherry.
<pb id="carroll64" n="64"/>
By God I am northern cavalry. I have come to take you off, 
you G--- d--- rebel.” Cherry said, “Jack, I don't see how 
I can go today; my wife and children need some meal.” “Get 
over the fence, I tell you,” said Jones as he reared up in his
stirrups. “All right,” said Cherry, “if I must, I will.” So 
proceeding to the fence, and stepping over he seized a hoe 
and dealt Jones such a blow across the side of the head as
brought him to the ground and then proceeded to give him 
such a beating as only a large stout man thoroughly aroused,
could do. The old miller all the while begging for Jones' 
life, and knowing full well that, if Jones was killed there at
his door, perhaps his own life would be the forfeit. He 
finally persuaded Cherry to leave Jones alive, when the following 
dialogue ensued:</p>
            <p>Cherry - “Jack Jones, if I spare your life this time, will you
ever insult me again?”</p>
            <p>Jones - “No, I will not, Mr. Cherry.”</p>
            <p>Cherry - “Jack, if you ever meet another man that looks 
like I do, will you meddle with him?”</p>
            <p>Jones - “I will not, Mr. Cherry.”</p>
            <p>Cherry - “If I conclude not to cut your head off with this 
hoe and throw it away, will you ever be seen in this country
again, Jack.”</p>
            <p>Jones - “No sir, Mr. Cherry, I will not.”</p>
            <p>Cherry then permitted the miller to assist Jones on his 
horse and he moved off, his new federal uniform stained in 
his own blood, and his head and face much battered and so far 
as I know he kept his word and was never seen in that part of the
country again.</p>

            </head>
            <p>During the winter of 1862-3 there was a great effort made 
on the part of the Confederates to gather in absentees and, 
to further this end, recruiting stations were established at
every place where we could hold a position bordering on 
territory held by the enemy. Accordingly a station of this sort 
<pb id="carroll65" n="65"/>was established at Linden, Tenn. A Mr. Appleby, who was a 
member of the 27th Tenn. Reg., had left the command without
permission and gone out on the west side of the Tennessee 
river. Hearing of his whereabouts and that he was to be married 
on the east side of the river on a certain night, the commandant 
of the post, Col. Frierson, sent a squad of soldiers to
the place to arrest Mr. Appleby. Arriving on the premises 
about 9 p.m., we found the marriage ceremony had been performed. 
The entertainment - music and dancing - was going 
on in high glee. Arresting the newly-married gentleman, we
started immediately to Linden with him; arriving there we
delivered him to the Colonel who of course ordered him to the
guard-house for safe keeping. On the following evening the 
bride appeared before the Colonel commanding the post; looking 
quite bright and pretty she said, “Colonel, you have my
husband under guard. I am here to ask his release. I suppose you 
have a wife at home.” “Yes, madam,” replied the Colonel. 
“Well, would you not consider it all act of cruelty to your wife
to say nothing of yourself, were someone to lock you up in prison 
in sight of your home and in sight of her whom you loved, 
and deny you the pleasure of each other's company?” The Colonel 
hesitated, stammered, and coughed a little; his military
dignity subsiding much and replied, “My dear madam, it 
would seem a little bad, but then military law - ” “Hold on,
colonel,” replied the lady, “you have the law ill your hands 
in this case. I ask as a matter of justice that you release to me
my husband.” “Well, madam,” replied he, “If your husband 
will agree to report every morning at nine o'clock while we 
are here. I will give an order for his release.” “All right,”
responded the lady, “have him brought in.” This was 
done, the husband, happy; the lady, in smiles; the military dignity 
at this time all gone out of the colonel. Upon leaving them
the Colonel said to the lady, “Now, if your husband should not
report promptly, I shall have to take you in his place.” “All
right, Colonel, if my husband is not here at the proper time, I
will be here in his place.” So saying the couple departed. On
the morrow at 9 a.m. the lady entered the office of the Colonel,

looking her prettiest and said: “Well, Colonel, I told you if
my husband did not report at the office this morning that I
would; so here I am. Husband and I decided that he could do
better over in West Tennessee or Kentucky than he could in
the Confederate army. Colonel, what will you have me do?”
The Colonel who, at this recital, had assumed all his military
dignity appeared as though he wanted to fight something or
somebody, but seeing how completely he had been out-generaled,
said with a smile, “Madam, you will have to go.” “Thank you,
Colonel,” replied the lady. As she passed out the door saying 
to the colonel, “Should you ever pass our way, come and
see us. I am sure Mr. Appleby would appreciate entertaining
you.” And with a triumphant wave of her hand, she departed.</p>
