<hi rend="italics">(Emily Hawthorne.)</hi></docAuthor>
        <p>In presenting a new book to the public, it is not necessary that the
reasons <sic corr="therefore">therefor</sic> should be set forth 
in a long introduction or a
tedious explanation. It is appropriate, however, that as the
publisher of this unique volume, I point out its strangely original
features, which impelled me to take an interest in its success and
commend it to the rank and file of our army of brave defenders,
as well as to those who wore the gray. Many books have been
written since the war, illustrative of battles, teeming with glowing
descriptions, and claiming glorious victories won by mighty generals,
as in the history of the campaigns written of or given by Grant,
Sherman, Johnston, and others. Most of these volumes have
been biographical, rather than historical. Of those last emanating
from the South, that of Hon. Alex. H. Stephens is, perhaps,
the most just and unprejudiced. It gives expression to the views
of a statesman, thinker, and scholar. It is therefore on a high plane,
and may not, as it should, be thoroughly understood by the masses.</p>
        <p>“Fagots from the Camp Fire” is exceptional in its style and scope.
Its graphic delineation of the coarsest phases of every-day life; its
portrayal of most thrilling incidents within the experience of soldiers
and people of the South; how they loved and hated, starved and
died; and the tender pathos which marks many pages, although told
in the rude language of the uneducated, yet bear that “wondrous
touch of nature which makes the whole world kin.”</p>
        <p>While leaders of opposing armies may not acquiesce in all theories
propounded in “Fagots from the Camp Fire,” the common people, and
especially soldiers who participated in these campaigns, will
agree that these extraordinary narratives are as nearly literally true
as it is possible to make them, after the lapse of fifteen years.</p>
        <p>That “truth is stranger than fiction,” is often illustrated in these
pages. The chief of scouts, who figures so conspicuously, holds a
paper signed by General J. B. Hill, Provost Marshal-General of the
Confederate
<pb id="dupre6" n="6"/>
Army, and endorsed “Approved” by General Joseph E. Johnston,
now a Member of Congress from Virginia, which states that Captain
*** * ******, of Company B, 7th Texas Regiment, Granberry's Brigade,
served as a scout in the campaign of Georgia, and that he acquitted
himself with great skill, courage, and adroitness. Thus the absolute
accuracy of the “Captain's” statements is attested. The distinctive
features, therefore, of this publication, are that it gives an insight into
modes of life in the Gulf States and in Tennessee, which have never
before been portrayed; that the wild adventures and desperate deeds of
Southern scouts are authentic incidents and true to the life; and
that it is the only book published which, while reciting such adventures,
and depicting such scenes, is written from a Union standpoint. If
the author at times advances theories which may not be approved,
it must be remembered that these are one man's opinions in relation
to subjects about which so few think alike. It must not be forgotten
that a truthful and just picture of the country, people, and times could
not have been given if the rudest, most ludicrous stories told had been
omitted.</p>
        <p>Having, as the editor of the <hi rend="italics">World and Soldier</hi>, at Washington,
been the recipient of thousands of letters within the past few
months, from veteran soldiers of the Union; knowing how eagerly the
“boys in blue” read every scrap of war history, and having received,
also, many tributes from Confederate ex-soldiers in praise of the
soldier's paper, although it advocates the interests and tells of the
deeds of their former foes, I earnestly believe that the time has come
when dissension should be buried in the grave of oblivion, and that
those who wore the blue should clasp hands with those who wore the
gray  - </p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>For both have suffered and both have lost,</l>
          <l>And victory won was at fearful cost.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Therefore, commending this book to the public, we shall follow it,
in a few weeks, with “The Soldier's Scrap-Book,” a volume of campaign
stories for the rank and file, in which many of the war incidents
related by common soldiers will appear, with a collection of battle,
decoration, and memorial poems. No one can conscientiously conduct
a newspaper in the interest of soldiers without a desire to
benefit and immortalize those who so bravely endured danger and
privation, suffering and death. Such, at least, has been my
experience; and  - </p>

        <head>PREFACE.</head>
        <p>I do not tell of great battles, or Generals, or Presidents, or Kings,
and therefore, do not write history. I only define the woes, triumphs,
modes of thinking, living, fighting, and dying of scouts and common
soldiers. I tell of wild adventures, hideous deaths, and marvelous
escapes. I recite terrible incidents, others ludicrous, and others most
pitiful; and if a narrative be rude in expression, significance, or morals,
it is because, if more tasteful, it would not be truthful.</p>
        <p>Mankind recks more of Thermopylæ, with its handful of heroes,
than of all the fields of filthy carnage on which Persians fell and
Greeks triumphed. The Alamo, with its one hundred and sixty-five
immortal defenders, leaving no survivors, will be the subject of song
and story when Arbela, Cannæ, and Austerlitz are forgotten.</p>
        <p>I cannot help thinking, therefore, that with such themes, and when
I tell, too, of the woes of women, and of vices that sprang from war,
and then of the negro and his relations to victors and vanquished,
that this book will excite interest. This will hardly be lessened when,
because of my apprehension of his virtues and character, I have
chosen, without his consent, to dedicate this modest volume to Colonel
W. W. Dudley, the maimed veteran whose devotion to the interests
and fame of Union soldiers is only equaled by his generous
estimate of the virtues of those who starved and fought for the hapless
Confederacy.</p>

        </argument>
        <p>After Grant's victory and Bragg's defeat, at Missionary Ridge, in
November, 1863, and after the repulse of Hooker's Corps at Ringgold
Gap by Cleburne's Division, Federal and Confederate armies went
into winter quarters  -  the former at Chattanooga; the latter, at
Dalton, Georgia. Detachments of Federal forces occupied positions,
at short intervals, from Knoxville to Chattanooga, and thence to
Bridgeport on the Tennessee River. Small bodies of Union soldiers
held each railway station between Bridgeport and Nashville. Over
this road supplies and re-enforcements for Sherman's army of invasion
were drawn, and an army was required for its protection. General
Joseph E. Johnston, commanding the Confederate forces, had his
headquarters at Dalton, thirty-eight miles from Chattanooga, drawing
supplies over the railway from Atlanta. General Pat Cleburne's Division
was encamped along the brow of Tunnel Hill, eight or ten miles
north of Dalton. In February, this cantonment was transferred to a
point east of Dalton on the Spring Place Road. Our cavalry held the
line from Kinton's Farm, nine miles, to Varnell's station, on the
railway from Dalton to Cleveland, and thence along the hills to the
Stone Church, just south of Ringgold Gap, thence to Villanow
and to the boundary line of Alabama. The railway distance from
Dalton to Chattanooga is thirty-eight miles. Between these points
occurred many of the strange and extraordinary incidents and
adventures of which subsequent pages will tell.</p>
        <p>The area of country between the two armies within which scouts
operated, having the average width of fifteen miles, extended from
Knoxville, in East Tennessee, about one hundred and eighty miles, to
Huntsville, Alabama. Generals Sherman and Johnston both employed
large numbers of scouts, but collisions between these were
<pb id="dupre14" n="14"/>
neither as frequent nor dangerous as between Southern scouts and
citizens of the country, the greater number of whom were devoted to
the cause for which Sherman fought. The domestic enemies of the
South were the more dangerous, not only because more blood-thirsty
and murderous than soldiers, but because it was quite impossible to
distinguish these bushwhackers, as they were termed in the partisan jargon
of the period, from unoffending country clodhoppers.</p>
        <p>We contemplated the most innocent-looking and rudely clad country
bumpkins with keen suspicion. They recognized us at a glance, and
hied away, as soon as our backs were turned, to tell our enemies of
the course we had taken and of our probable resting place for the
night. After asking directions from such persons, which we never
followed, we were accustomed to listen for the firing of signal guns, of
which we comprehended the import as well as they to whose ears
they were addressed. With the armed bushwhacker we knew how to deal,
but were helpless in the presence of those who seemed wholly intent
upon the perfection of crops and cultivation of fields and gardens.
We soon learned that most innocent-looking farmers underwent sudden
and violent transformations of conduct and character. Rustiest,
most illiterate and rudely clad plowmen became even demoniacal in
blood-thirstiness, and in this were wholly unlike our Northern
public enemies. From hollow trees, or from beneath ledges of stones on
mountain-sides hard-by the farm-house, concealed breech-loaders were
drawn, and assassins' bullets sent many Confederate soldiers to untimely
graves.</p>
        <p>Women and children were as false to the South and as true to the
Union as fathers, brothers, and sons, and woe to the Confederate
soldier, recognized as such, who followed paths into which he was guided
by these loyalists. Many an unnamed grave tells where unknown and
forgotten scouts heedlessly confided in statements made by matronly
dames or blushing maidens. Often were brave men lured into modest
cottages by proffered food temptingly spread before the weary
and hungry. The feast was one of death. While hunger and thirst were
appeased, and repose cunningly invited, an unseen member of the
household sped away to mountain fastnesses to carry tidings of the
scout's folly to the bushwhackers' strong-hold. The messenger returned
with enough resolute men to render escape impossible. Matron,
maid, or boy hastened from every mountaineer's home to tell
bushwhackers the route of every body of Confederate scouts that traversed
the so-called neutral ground between the two great armies of the North
and South. Such was the condition of affairs and such the conduct
of the masses of the people, especially in Eastern Tennessee. The
people were poor. They read the Bible and Brownlow's <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi>. They
listened to Andrew Johnson, if Democrats; to Brownlow and Nelson,
if Whigs; and thus, as political thinkers, were led, almost <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">en masse</foreign></hi>,
into thorough Unionism. The strongest passion of these illiterate
descendants of heroes of King's Mountain and Cowpens impelled them
to kill. “Death to enemies of the Union!” was the legend inscribed
<pb id="dupre15" n="15"/>
upon their hearts and memories. The bushwhackers' definition of
war was written accurately in tears and blood, and flame and famine
by General Sherman. It was simple destructiveness. It meant to kill.</p>
        <p>At this period President Lincoln had won little popular sympathy or
affection among Southern loyalists. His potency came later and
was greatest after his death. Then Eastern Tennessee and Northern
Georgia celebrated his apotheosis, awarding to his name and memory
profounder respect and more honest reverence than was conceded by
those who were near enough the veritable demi-god to discover human
frailties.</p>
        <p>These facts are defined that Northern people may confess some
Inadequate appreciation of the sturdy, honest devotion of those men
and women whose sacrifices in behalf of the Union were a thousand-fold
greater than of men who bought substitutes, paid taxes, speculated
in shoddy and bonds, and celebrated the Fourth of July and Black Friday.</p>
        <p>East Tennessee loyalists believed that the enemies of the Union
Deserved death, and death it was, and this internecine war, waged by
one against another household, or by members of the same family,
arrayed against one another, was the most relentless, bloody, and
ruinous that ever desolated hearths and homes.</p>
        <p>Rarely, very rarely, was it a “rebel's” good fortune to encounter
in this region devotees at the shrine of “Confederatism.” Now and
then, as these pages will show, this “Switzerland of America”
produced a secessionist, as earnest, devout, and active as were Union men
like Crutchfield and Brownlow. It may not be improper to suggest
that the first blood spilled in the great conflict was not, as is commonly
supposed, at Alexandria, Virginia, when the zouave fell, but in
Chattanooga, when “Bill” Crutchfield, afterwards, when Reconstruction
progressed, a Member of Congress, was stricken down in his own hotel
in Chattanooga. Mr. Jefferson Davis, having resigned his seat in the
United States Senate, was on his way to Jackson, Mississippi. His
first speech in behalf of the “new nation” was made at Bristol; his
second, at Chattanooga, and in the bar-room of the old hotel, of which
“Bill” Crutchfield was proprietor. Davis was defining numberless
wrongs inflicted upon the South, and woes that had befallen the country
in the election of Lincoln, when Crutchfield, intolerant as Davis,
pronounced Davis' statements false. One John W. Vaughn, sheriff
of Monroe County, afterwards made a brigadier by Davis, instantly,
in defence of Davis' wounded honor, broke a black bottle, snatched
from the shelf of the bar-room, over Crutchfield's head. The bleeding,
stunned Crutchfield was borne helpless and senseless from the
scene of conflict, shedding the first blood spilled in the war. It
trickled out of East Tennessee into the mighty torrent that soon
afterward flowed, steadily and sluggishly, along the course of Sherman's
march to the sea.</p>
        <p>The neutral ground contained few inhabitants entertaining the
<pb id="dupre16" n="16"/>
feelings or convictions of Vaughn, and Northern, encountered no
such dangers as Southern, scouts surmounted or evaded at every step
in Eastern Tennessee and Northern Georgia. Now and then a woman
was loyal to the cause of the South, and the bravest and truest of our
race, whether adhering to the Union or to the Confederacy, were
fearless women of the mountains and valleys between the two armies.
When England and Scotland were at war, the Border produced no more
illustrious examples of splendid heroism or of nobility of character,
or of fidelity to a cause espoused, than this mountainous, rugged
district in which incidents occurred of which these pages tell. Some
Walter Scott will yet make posterity remember, when traversing
Northern Alabama, Northern Georgia, Western North Carolina, and
Eastern Tennessee, that a sort of sanctity overshadows this region,
and that it is holy ground, baptized in the blood of a border war more
deadly than that waged with the rude weapons of a rude age in glens
and mountain fastnesses of Scotland. For such a story-teller this
modest volume contains facts on which fiction might build a pantheon
peopled with gods of heroism and patriotism.</p>

        </argument>
        <p>What follows in this narrative is nothing more than a plain recital
of facts drawn from memoranda made at the time. Written with a
pencil eighteen years ago these are not always perfectly legible, but
enough can be deciphered to recall vividly the minutest details of
incidents strongly impressed upon the memory of one only eighteen
years of age when he became a chief of scouts in the army of Joseph
E. Johnston.</p>
        <p>On the day <sic corr="above">abvoe</sic> mentioned Major-General Pat Cleburne, of
the most skillful and bravest of General Johnston's subordinates,
selected six men, of whom I was given charge, instructing us to make
the circuit of Sherman's army. We were to fix the location of each
command, define the force at each point and the strength of each
fortified position. We were to go first to Charleston on the
Hiwassee River and learn what progress was making in rebuilding the
railway bridge burned there by the retreating Confederates.</p>
        <p>After a toilsome march of thirty miles, avoiding public highways,
we rested for the night at Red Clay, a little village on the boundary
line of Tennessee. We dared not make a fire. Armed with Henry
rifles and Colt's repeaters and having forty rounds of ammunition and
rations for five days, our journeying had been toilsome and fatiguing.
Our conversations were conducted in an undertone. We moved even
cautiously in the thicket in which we were concealed, fearing that
the slightest unusual noise would attract the attention of some drowsy
Federal sentinel.</p>
        <p>Surely one who has never occupied such a position or confronted such
dangers can never comprehend the emotions excited by our
<pb id="dupre18" n="18"/>
suddenly changed condition. For months and years we had constituted
inseparable parts of a great mass of armed men. We were
never conscious of personal danger. The possibility of capture or
death, save in battle, never occurred to us. We had never a thought
for ourselves. Parts of a vast machine, we lived and moved as such
until personal identity was almost unrecognized. But here were
six men  -  a seventh, a newspaper man, joined us at Charleston  -  giving
only voluntary obedience to one of their number. We were not only
removed from the mass of which we had become an inseparable part,
but thrown, in the midst of extraordinary dangers, wholly upon our
own resources as men and as individuals. We could not sleep. We
were in the enemy's lines, and when fatigue wooed repose and fitfully
closed our eyes, we dreamed of spies dangling at ropes' ends beneath
shadows of great oaks that stretched mighty arms above our resting-place.</p>
        <p>Wherever we slept one or two men always stood as sentinels until
we resumed our march. We will never forget the feeling of unutterable
solitariness and hopeless helplessness that possessed nerves and
soul, and almost paralyzed us when we lay down on the frozen hillside
to rest on the night of December 14, 1863. We could hear the dull
roar of innumerable human voices and footsteps about the camp fires
of Sherman's countless legions.</p>
        <p>We stood guard in turn, each serving four hours. After daylight
we dared to have fire enough to prepare strong coffee, most grateful
to men who had passed a bitterly cold December night upon the bare
earth, each covered by a single blanket.</p>
        <p>At daylight we resumed our march, moving in indian file along the
verge of the mountain range's summit. At noon we approached the
Big Blue Spring. One of our number ascended a tree with a field
glass, whence he scanned hills and valleys on every hand. We made
coffee, rested an hour, and marched towards Cleveland where, at
nightfall, we bivouacked.</p>
        <p>We could hear the drum-beat of the Federal garrison and ourselves
next morning were aroused by reveille. We loitered two days gathering
information from the people of the place in reference to the
strength of the garrison and examining for ourselves the earthworks,
and marched to the Hiwassee River just below the village of Charleston.
Here, as details hereafter given will show, our small force of
men was recruited by the accession of a seventh, a newspaper man,
who had escaped from Knoxville when the place was captured by General
Burnside.</p>
        <p>We wanted other edibles in substitution for hard-tack and bacon.
It was agreed that Spratling, a fearless, gigantic young soldier, and I
should apply at a farm-house fifteen miles away, said to have a
well-stocked larder, to buy such provisions as were required. We had
learned that the farmer we proposed to visit was a peaceful Union
man, but were advised to be watchful. “He might betray us.” We
reached his pretty cottage late in the afternoon, and ate at his table,
<pb id="dupre19" n="19"/>
paying for the privilege. We were not his invited guests, and as such,
owed him nothing. Spratling said that this reflection, ever afterward,
gave him great satisfaction. The farmer and his wife agreed at table
that they would send a well-freighted market wagon next morning to
our camp. The wife was especially demonstrative, suggesting that we
might have a fire and occupy a small house a few rods away in a
corner of the yard. We expressed a proper sense of gratitude and
soon sought this resting place. We built a fire, talked cheerily half
an hour to our kindly host, spread blankets before the blazing faggots,
smoked our pipes, and then, bidding him good night, with repeated
assertions of gratitude, rested on the floor.</p>
        <p>But neither Spratling nor I slept. As soon as the sound of Mr.
McMath's footsteps was inaudible, Spratling whispered:</p>
        <p>“I mean to watch that old coon. I think he is playing falsely,
and if he seek to betray us, he won't find Spratling stupidly sleeping.”</p>
        <p>I concurred in this, and we covered the blazing faggots in the
fireplace with ashes. When the flames were extinct, Spratling and I,
lying on our faces, crept out of the hut. One stood as sentinel while
the other slept just outside the enclosure about the buildings. An
hour had hardly passed when Spratling, then on watch, saw McMath
issue from his doorway with his wife. She even followed him to the
stable, urging him to ride “hard and fast” to the bushwhackers' camp,
not more, as we learned afterward, than five miles away.</p>
        <p>We now knew what was coming. We discussed the propriety of
leaving; but Spratling insisted that he must await the issue.</p>
        <p>“I would never forgive myself,” he said, “if I fled without punishing
that old scoundrel's treason to pretended friendship and <sic corr="hospitality">hospitalty</sic>.
If he return alone, we will capture and send him south. If he come
with five or a dozen bushwhackers, we will stampede or seize their
horses, kill as many of the enemy as possible, and take refuge in the
creek bottom which we examined this afternoon.”</p>
        <p>Spratling and I had slept two hours each, when we heard the clatter
of coming hoofs. We counted the bushwhackers as they entered the
gate, near which they left their horses. The mistress of the cottage
met them at the door. She had been keeping watch, and would have
discovered our “change of base” if we had not crawled noiselessly,
lying on our faces, out of the cabin.</p>
        <p>It was nearly five o'clock in the morning when we could see that
some one of the eight persons in the house always watched the cabin
door. McMath's wife was now actively engaged going in and out of
the kitchen, and soon breakfast was spread. It is needless to suggest
that Spratling and I were not asked to share this early matutinal meal.
We saw the good, fat dame convey a significant brown jug, soon
eloquent, as through all the ages of the world's history, of devilish
deeds, into the hallway occupied by the six bushwhackers. They
drank. It was the last draught of alcohol that ever went hissing
down the throats of more than one of those terrible men, who thus
nerved themselves for bloody, murderous deeds.</p>
        <pb id="dupre20" n="20"/>
        <p>Spratling and I had gone to the rear of the house, nearer the woods,
and were at a point whence we could see distinctly every person in the
hallway. In this, as stated, the breakfast-table was spread. We were
now protected by the palings, shrubbery, and peavines in the
garden between us and the house. The sun had hardly lighted up
with earliest rays the tree-tops on the highest hills when the
bushwhackers, McMath watching the door of the cabin we had vacated,
sat about the breakfast-table. Their guns were ranged, leaning against
the wall, on either side of the broad, open hall.</p>
        <p>Our opportunity had come. We were about to avenge, in advance,
our own contemplated deaths.</p>
        <p>Three bushwhackers sat on either side of the table. We crawled
along the palings till we reached a point from which only two of the
enemy and Mrs. McMath, who sat at the head of the table with her
back towards us, were visible. Three men in the line of each of our
shots, we leveled our rifles. I gave the word “fire,” in a hoarse
whisper. I abhorred the necessity. A cold tremor ran along my
nerves. I shuddered.</p>
        <p>We would have repeated the shots, but feared that we might kill the
woman. Such were her screams when her guests fell dead or
wounded, that her more timid, treacherous husband was wholly helpless.
While he was wringing his hands and running from one fallen
friend to another and then to the relief of his suffering wife, we
crossed the enclosure, and selecting two of the best horses and
leading two each, rode away towards our encampment.</p>
        <p>We were not apprehensive of pursuit. McMath had asked and we
had spoken falsely as to the distance and direction of our camp and
knew that some hours must elapse before he could summon a force
that would dare to follow us. He supposed we had straggled from a
command only seven or eight miles distant, not less than five
hundred strong. While we apprehended little danger at the hands of the
bushwhackers, the facts would be noised abroad and we could not
remain in safety about Charleston. We congratulated ourselves on
the acquisition of just horses enough, fresh and strong, to mount my
footsore and weary men.</p>
        <p>We had ridden three or four miles before we began to talk of what
had happened and of what we had done. It was the first killing that
either Spratling or I had <sic>had</sic> ever perpetrated, except in an open field
and fair fight, and both confessed qualms of conscience.</p>
        <p>“How could we help it?” asked Spratling. “If we had not killed
them, they came armed to kill us. If we had fought them openly, we
would have fallen, and certainly by suicidal hands. To fight is to
kill, and this is our business, and there was no escaping the necessity
for methods we adopted. If our numbers had equalled theirs, we
should have resorted, and properly, to the same stratagems. General
Sherman is right. War means murder, desolation, destruction, and
death. We are warriors,” said Spratling. “We are murderers and
horse-thieves, I greatly fear,” was my earnest answer.</p>
        <pb id="dupre21" n="21"/>
        <p>Spratling confessed that he did not like it, that his conscience was
troubled, and that he was almost sorry, though we had six horses,
that he had not assented when I proposed to leave the bushwhacker's
place before his coadjutors came. Hurrying events and impending
dangers made us forget everything but the fact that our speedy
departure from Charleston was a matter of urgent necessity.</p>
        <p>We had already spent two days at Charleston on the Hiwassee
watching the process of rebuilding the railway bridge. Thence we
rode to Pikeville, in the valley between Walden's Ridge and the
Cumberland Mountains. Late in the afternoon we came to the
Tennessee River five miles below the little village, Decatur. A skiff,
or dug-out was soon discovered. But while a comrade and I had been
searching for such a means of crossing, others discovered a whiskey
distillery. They and their canteens, in the absence of the proprietor
of the gum-tree pipe through which the alcohol flowed, were soon
well filled. We crossed the river, concealed the dug-out in a thicket
for possible future use, and a mile farther west, near a country road
and the river shore, rested in a dense wood. Our sentinel stood near
the highway. Unhappily, his canteen was bursting with raw, corn
whiskey. He drank too deeply, and when a wagon with a dozen
country girls and boys occupying it came rattling over the stony
roadway, echoing songs and laughter burdening the cold night wind with
the delicious music of women's voices, our sentinel could not restrain
himself. He knew that the party of revellers came from a farm-house
we had passed during the day, and were celebrating a country wedding.
Brandishing his musket, he confronted the roysterers, demanding
instant surrender. The women were frightened beyond measure.
Their screams drew us to the spot. Our sentinel was holding the rein
of one of the horses attached to the vehicle, and insisting that
its occupants must come down and surrender. He brandished his
repeater, and when we appeared, the young men, seeing that resistance
would be worse than idle, descended from the wagon. They were
assured that no harm was intended, and that this intoxicated sentinel
and others like him need only be appeased.</p>
        <p>What a vision of beauty I beheld in the perfect face and form of
one of those mountain lassies! The luminous splendor of her great,
lustrous black eyes lighted up her pale, beautiful features, as I first
beheld her beneath the clear moonlight gilding hills and valleys, with
matchless radiance that fascinated me. Why, I could not tell, but
frightened as she was,  -  perhaps because I was only a year or two her
senior,  -  she ran to my side and seized the hand that clasped my rifle.
I looked into her pale, beautiful face, amazed and startled by her
charms. I had never imagined that a woman's figure, eyes, pleading
face, limitless confidence, and silent appeal for protection could be so
eloquent. The hot blood, when I pressed her hand, rushed to my
face. I said to her, “You shall not be harmed,” and then added,
with much hesitation, “Won't you tell me your name, and where do
you live?”</p>
        <pb id="dupre22" n="22"/>
        <p>“O, yes,” she answered, “my name is Mamie Hughes. I am here
visiting relatives. My home is on the other side of the Union army
in Georgia, and I can't get there now.”</p>
        <p>Here Mamie was suddenly silent. She suspected, I thought, that I
was a “rebel,” but was doubtful I was conscious that I could trust
her. Her wonderful face and eloquent eyes had won my confidence,
if not my heart, and I said to her, in a whisper, “I am a Southerner.
Say nothing. If you utter a word, we seven will be hanged as spies.”</p>
        <p>At this moment our boisterous, half-drunken sentinel was insisting
that the fiddler should organize cotillions and that we should dance
by moonlight. Thinking to humor the fancy of my intoxicated men
and let the merry-makers go in good humor, I said:</p>
        <p>“Yes; we will dance by moonlight, and these gentlemen here shall
drink with us and we will part friends, regretting that we frightened
these beautiful young ladies.”</p>
        <p>This apology exasperated the drunken sentinel, who drawled out,
“Friends! did you say, Captain? These people are d--d Yanks.”</p>
        <p>“The rest of them are, but I am not,” whispered Mamie, pressing
closely to my side.</p>
        <p>It was needless to attempt further concealment of our character or
purposes. I stated to the oldest of the East Tennesseeans that we
were Kentuckians on our way to join the Southern army and were
going out by way of Cleveland. I said further that our comrade was
only impelled by too much whiskey when he arrested them and that I
regretted the fact as did my associates.</p>
        <p>There was no response. The young men were sullen and silent and
Only the pretty Mamie beside me pressed my hand very gently.
Another girl, more fearless than the rest, said, laughing:</p>
        <p>“Oh! it makes no difference. Let us make a night of it and dance
with these soldiers. What a jolly story it will be to tell. We are
prisoners of war and can't help ourselves. Let us dance.”</p>
        <p>“Surely,” I answered, “no harm is intended, and I would gladly
have those gentlemen there join us. Such opportunities do not often
present themselves, and we soldiers must take advantage of them.”</p>
        <p>I whispered to Spratling, when the young East Tennesseeans made
no reply to my proposition, to see that neither of them left while
we danced. He stalked out, a very giant, into the roadway and
stood like a massive statue of granite, his presence a significant
menace.</p>
        <p>The fiddler, half-drunken, began his task. I led in the dance with
Mamie Hughes. She soon entered into the spirit animating us and
forgot that we were strangers. I was lapped in the joys of Elysium.
I forgot the lapse and value of time. I told in whispered, earnest
words the story of my love, and surely the pretty, blushing, silent
girl was not displeased.</p>
        <p>Spratling came at last, while I was looking into Mamie's fathomless
eyes and dreaming I knew not what, and said to me:</p>
        <p>“Captain, it is time we were off. This place won't be safe for us
<pb id="dupre23" n="23"/>
after daylight. These prisoners of mine are furious and most
impatient. They have been plotting our destruction. One of them there,
I am sure, loves madly that pretty black-eyed girl you have been
dancing with. He would murder you now if he dared. Our presence
here will be reported to Yankee scouts within an hour and we must
be off. Escape even now is hardly possible.”</p>
        <p>While the rest of Mamie's friends were clambering into the wagon
she told me where her parents lived. I said to her:</p>
        <p>“You must not forget me, Mamie. I will surely see you again.
You will not forget me will you?”</p>
        <p>“Come and see me,” she answered. “I will tell them at home how
good, and brave, and true you are.”</p>
        <p>She was in the act of clambering over the wagon wheel into the
body, where her friends were already seated, when I caught her arm
and whispered, as I raised her into the vehicle, a reassertion of my
deathless love. I detected a tremor passing over Mamie's frame.
She turned to look, as I lifted my cap, into my sunburnt face. The
wagon moved rapidly away.</p>
        <p>Kissing her hand she tossed the breath that passed her rosy lips, as
if it had been a sparkling gem dissolved in morning mists, towards the
spot where I stood entranced, motionless, and oblivious of everything
except the wondrous charms of the departing divinity.</p>
        <p>I don't know how long I might have stared in the direction Mamie
had gone if Spratling, the bravest and truest of men and scouts, had
not said:</p>
        <p>“Captain, it is time, if you don't propose to follow that pretty girl,
that we were getting out of this country. Within two hours a squad
of cavalry will be here looking for us.”</p>
        <p>Within ten minutes we resumed our march, but not in the direction
of the towns I mentioned to Mamie's friends. On the contrary, we
moved westwardly towards Walden's Ridge. We had not proceeded
five miles when we heard signal guns in many directions and the
sound of horns used for like purposes by the native Unionists or
bushwackers. We ascended the ridge to its summit. Day was dawning
when we looked down into the long, deep valley below. Signal fires
still blazed at different points, and a rocket, making lights of different
colors, climbed through the air far above the ridge and exploding
fifteen or twenty miles away, recited the story told at headquarters of
the Union army by Mamie's friends. It stated, “There are seven
spies within our lines.” In any event this was the translation we gave
to this sign in the heavens, as significant of capture and death as was
that of victory and empire which appeared to Constantine.</p>
        <p>Throughout the weary day, when we peered forth from our hiding
place, we could discover bodies of horsemen moving in the valley
below, in all directions, in search of the Confederates known to be
within the Federal lines. Using a powerful field glass we defined during
the day the route we were to pursue during the night that we might cross
the valley in safety between Walden's Ridge and Cumberland Mountains.</p>
        <pb id="dupre24" n="24"/>
        <p>We descended, with darkness, into the valley and moved rapidly
across it. We reached the mountain's summit before day dawned.
After this toilsome march, occupying the whole night, we were
without food, fatigued beyond measure, hungry as famished wolves,
and in the midst of relentless enemies. We had neither food, tobacco,
nor coffee.</p>
        <p>Our condition was becoming desperate. At two o'clock in the
afternoon we found in this sparsely populated district a modest little
log farm-house. Stationing my men about it to prevent the escape of
its inmates, I applied for food. The mistress of the cabin refused to
sell anything. There was no help for it. We entered the cabin, and
telling the good dame that we were starving and desperate and that
she must give us bread or her home would be destroyed, she sullenly
prepared dinner of the coarsest food. Two men, that we might not
be poisoned, watched the process of cooking it, and we ate ravenously.
The timid nominal head of the household begged his wife to give us
all we demanded, and soon intimated privately that he was a devout
“rebel.” We knew he was lying, but accepted his assertions as if we
deemed them true. We stated that we were of Morgan's cavalry, and
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">en route</foreign></hi> to Kentucky to bring out recruits. We made minute
inquiries about roads leading north to McMinaville. He answered
truthfully, as we happened to know.</p>
        <p>Late in the afternoon, when about to depart, we almost made a
Rebel of his red-haired, hideously ugly wife by presenting her five
dollars in United States currency. She grinned so gleefully when
Spratling gave her the money, and drew so near to express her amazed
gratitude, that Spratling, dreading a kiss from the ignorant, vulgar,
frightful creature, leaped from the doorway. He told me he was
never “scared before in all his life.” She was very thin and her
back was bowed, as Spratling described her, like that of a “razor-back
hog.” Her frowzy, red hair, unkempt for twenty years, was powdered
with ashes. She wore two garments. The outer, made of four yards
of dingy gray calico, was tucked up at the waist, exposing her red,
rusty, sinewy limbs almost to the knees.</p>
        <p>She was offended by Spratling's sudden terror and retreat, and we
knew that this Medusa of the mountains, if possible, would avenge the
indignity. She began to denounce us. Her eloquence was absolutely
wonderful. Daniel O'Connell's traditional fish woman could never
have been more voluble or coarse than this frightful hungry-looking,
red-faced, red-headed, and red-mouthed angular creature. She
leaped violently around the great barrel-churn in the yard and
kicked at each of a dozen lazy, cowardly, yelping hounds that
lay about the great receptacle of sour milk. She made and sold
butter to Federal soldiers encamped in the valley, and in neighboring
villages.</p>
        <p>Spratling was noted for his tremendous strength. Like most
Physically powerful men, he was exceedingly good natured. But
it was wholly impossible to withstand shocks to one's temper
<pb id="dupre25" n="25"/>
administered by this voluble termagant. Spratling was first amazed,
and when she finally stood facing him, her arms akimbo and legs
extended as far apart as the contracted calico would admit, and
poured forth a volley of disgusting epithets, Spratling could no longer
contain himself.</p>
        <p>He suddenly seized the scrawny, bony creature, and inverting her,
high in the air, as suddenly thrust her, head foremost into the
barrel-churn half full of milk. The woman's stockingless legs were
twirled about piteously above the top of the churn. I was paralyzed for
a moment. The scene was painfully ludicrous. But the woman was
drowning. Convulsive movements of her red legs showed that she
was in a death struggle. Even the dozen dogs stood up and looked
on in mute astonishment. To spare the woman's life I suddenly
tipped the churn over. Her clothing was rudely displaced and as the
milk spread over the lower side of the little enclosure, and her head
and shoulders were uncovered, she crawled out backwards.</p>
        <p>Evidently those dogs had never witnessed such an exhibition. As
the good dame backed out of the barrel on all fours, the dogs stood
transfixed with astonishment, staring a moment at the unusual
spectacle, and then, howling piteously, each turned and fled in abject
terror. Convulsed with laughter, I ordered my men to fall into line
and march. Spratling was holding his sides and rolling over and
over on the ground. The mountain groaned beneath roars of laughter.</p>
        <p>It was horrible and cruel, but no incident half so ludicrous was
ever witnessed by a squad of veterans. The good dame's senses were
hardly restored when we began at last to move rapidly away. She
finally rubbed the grease out of her eyes and began to comprehend
the ridiculous aspect she had presented. She gathered up her
consciousness, and pulled down her petticoat and began to gesticulate
wildly, and pour forth an interminable vocabulary of coarse epithets.
She pursued us to curse poor Spratling who ran down the declivity
roaring like the bull of Bashan.</p>
        <p>We traveled rapidly perhaps five miles along the road we had been
directed to take leading to McMinaville. The moon had not risen
and total darkness enveloped us. Leaving the highway we entered
the woods going directly back towards the scene of buttermilk baptism.
We moved as silently as possible and had not reversed our course half
an hour till we heard the red-headed woman's sharp, clear voice
ringing out on the cold night air. She was urging a dozen bushwhackers
to keep pace with her in pursuit of “infernal pimps of hell
and Jeff Davis.” Her wild fury and shocking imprecations made us,
rude soldiers as we were, shudder. The winds stood still that they
might not bear on their weary wings the insufferable burden of her
horrible oaths. We were even sickened by the woman's mad depravity
and infernal fury. When the echoes of her harsh, sharp voice were
no longer audible, I said to Spratling: “Hell hath no fury like a
woman  -  baptised in buttermilk.” Spratling's suppressed laughter
shook the tree against which he rested his sturdy body, and we
<pb id="dupre26" n="26"/>
resumed our toilsome journey over shapeless stones and through
mountain thickets, never resting through that livelong, weary night.</p>
        <p>We marched by night and rested during daytime until we reached
Stevenson near the <sic corr="Tennessee">Tennnessee</sic> River on the Nashville, Chattanooga
and Memphis roads.</p>

        </argument>
        <p>A devoted rebel family at Stevenson furnished supplies while we
were encamped in a secluded spot near the village. We mixed
occasionally with passengers on railway trains, from Memphis and
from Nashville, meeting at this place. Spratling was a capital farmer,
and I, a plow-boy. We wore the rude “butternut” or homespun
goods of the country and only a pistol and knife, never visible. We
received northern newspapers from every quarter and carefully filed
away every paragraph that might be of value to Generals Bragg and
Johnston. Wounded and sick soldiers, in endless trains, now and
then moved northwardly, and interminable supply trains, day and
night, went south. We noted everything. From sick-leave officers
awaiting transportation, and from quartermasters' and commissaries'
agents we learned how many they fed or transported in many divisions
and corps. We made contracts to supply an Ohio brigade with eggs
and potatoes which were never executed, perhaps because “bread and
butter” brigades, and divisions, and corps, alone, came then, as now,
out of Ohio.</p>
        <p>Early on the morning of December 30, 1863, the good dame who
had furnished our simple meals came to our resting place to say that
a little child of a bushwhacking neighbor had said that the rebel camp
on the mountain-side would be attacked that night and its occupants
shot or hanged. I proffered the woman fifty dollars in greenbacks.
She refused to accept it; but when I said, “You are poor, and I am
paid by the government and given this money that I may give it to
such as you,” she said, “I did not know how I could live when you
went away, yet I came to urge your immediate departure. With this
fifty dollars and what I have saved I can feed and clothe myself and
children almost a year.” She kissed my hard, sunburnt hand, and
<pb id="dupre28" n="28"/>
with tearful eyes turned away. I never saw her afterward, but no
braver or truer woman lives than Mrs. M--y, of Stevenson.</p>
        <p>How bitterly cold were the last days of December, 1863, and the
First of January, 1864, surviving soldiers serving under Rosecranz, and
Sherman, and Johnston, and Bragg will never forget. Early in the
morning of the 30th of December we strapped our blankets on
our backs and with three days' rations traversed the distance
between Stevenson and Bridgeport. We reached the river just after
nightfall. Fiercely cold as were winds and waves there was no help
for it. We must cross. There was no security save in placing the
river between ourselves and the relentless bushwhackers. We could
find no boat, and the swollen river, divided in its midst by a long,
narrow island, was then, perhaps, two miles wide. It seemed, when
we looked out, wistfully and anxiously enough, that bitterly cold
night, upon its moaning, starlit waters, certainly ten miles in width.</p>
        <p>Of a wrecked boat on the shore we constructed a raft capable of
conveying our blankets, clothing and weapons. We swam beside it
down the river to the island. Almost frozen when we reached the
sandy bank, we lifted the raft out of the water, bore it across the
island, launched it again, and again drifting down and across the river,
landed safely, but paralyzed by cold, on the southern bank. Icicles
clung to my hair and beard. My teeth chattered and I felt that
numbness and drowsiness slowly overcoming me which immediately
precedes death. We rubbed, one another violently with blankets and
when thoroughly dry and re-clad in <sic corr="woolen">woollen</sic> I never enjoyed so keenly
the sense of perfect youthful vigor and vitality. I was aglow with
ecstatic physical blessedness. We soon ascended and followed the
ridge that connects Bridgeport with Lookout Mountain. We stood
upon the summit of the precipice that overhangs the railway and the
Tennessee. The railway track rests upon the verge of the stream and
enormous, rugged stones superimposed on one another like those
of some mediæval ruin rise precipitously hundreds of feet, and
are projected beyond the railway and overhang the water's edge. At
day-dawn we looked down from this dizzy height. A railway train
going to Chattanooga came roaring and shrieking from Bridgeport.
It seemed as we contemplated it, moving with tremendous velocity
Constantly accelerated into the river. We shuddered involuntarily
when it went down out of sight under the cliff, and seemingly
headlong into the broad, boisterous bosom of the Tennessee. Then
ensued the silence of death. Great, projecting stones cut off sounds
and vision, and the sudden stillness that pervaded mountains, valleys,
and river was painful to the last degree.</p>
        <p>With a wild shriek of seemingly ineffable delight the locomotive,
its great, black pennon of smoke curved backward, rushed from
cavernous depths below to greet from the hill-top it ascended, the
splendors of the sun just rising on the brightest and coldest morning
that ever dawned upon the South.</p>
        <p>In re-writing these memoranda I omitted a page to which I now
<pb id="dupre29" n="29"/>
recur. While we were at the railway bridge which Federal soldiers
were rebuilding across the Hiwassee River at Charleston we encountered
a gentleman who had been now and then in the Confederate States'
service as a staff officer, but for several preceding months editing a
paper at Knoxville. He was well known to us and <sic>and</sic> at his own
suggestion became, temporarily, one of our number. He withstood
hardships uncomplainingly and whiled away tedious hours of compulsory
idleness with stories he had gathered while war raged. His purpose
was to reach Atlanta, whither his newspaper, when Burnside, with
snowy locks, and side whiskers, and smooth towering occiput came
down upon Knoxville, had been removed. On the night of December 31,
1863, colder if possible than the preceding night, we climbed
the summit of Lookout Mountain. If the one hundred and fifty
thousand soldiers then within fifty miles of Chattanooga were reading
at the same instant, the above sentence, they would each whistle and
shudder, and perhaps one hundred thousand would exclaim, <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="it">una voce</foreign></hi>,
clapping their sinewy hands, “It was --- cold!” It's a pity, but old
soldiers will use frightful exclamations. But none have forgotten the
terrors of the night which witnessed the death of 1863 and the birth
of 1864. Seven of us, with a blanket each, not daring to build a fire and
hungry as famished wolves, spent that fearful night on the topmost
summit of Lookout Mountain whereon some ancient fable tells that
Hooker fought a battle even among the clouds.</p>
        <p>In the starlight, while looking for a place protected against Northern
blasts, a shallow cavern was discovered. We gathered dry leaves and
made a resting place within. And yet such was the insufferable cold
that we could not sleep. We smoked our pipes and “spun yarns” through
the tedious hours of the weary night.</p>
        <p>“Gentlemen,” said Bowles, one of our number, “I have seen and
shared in several battles, and a big battle is only a rapidly alternating
succession of d----d big scares; but I never witnessed such an infernally
big scare as the red-headed milk-maid of the mountains inflicted on them
d----d dogs.”</p>
        <p>Then followed such shouts of laughter that I absolutely feared the
echoing peals would be borne by cold blustering winds down into
Federal headquarters just below in Chattanooga.</p>
        <p>“If the dogs have got back,” said Spratling, “and I'm going there
to see about it, I'll bet ten to one that every time she stoops, ‘she
stoops to conquer’ and them d----d dogs go flying and howling down
the deep jungles of Sequatchie Valley.”</p>
        <p>“I can never forget the scene,” interposed Blake. “When she stood
on her head in the churn, her little, starveling legs dancing an
inverted hornpipe, the picture was sublime in its very uniqueness.
But when the captain here overturned the churn and the dogs all
stood up and looked on with growing interest, licking their chops
and crying over much spilled milk, and then, when their attention
was gradually arrested by the old woman backing out of that churn
wholly uncovered and on all fours, it was entirely too much for the
<pb id="dupre30" n="30"/>
dogs. It was more than I could stand. I turned away only to see
and hear the dogs frightened, shrieking, and flying in all directions.”</p>
        <p>“Do you know,” continued Blake, “that the woman's husband
was delighted? He sneaked off. I saw him behind the chicken
house, throwing himself back and forth like a cross-cut saw, and
holding his sides with both hands, his cheeks swollen and his eyes
bursting from their sockets. It was keen enjoyment of fun struggling
against the terror in which he held his red-headed, dreadful wife. We
made a good rebel of him. Don't you remember that we heard not
a word from him when the wife led our pursuers so noisily and
vengefully on our track. We have won him, and if ever I go on
another expedition in that direction I would not hesitate to trust that
man. His gratitude to us is boundless, and his devotion will be admirable.”</p>

The Good that Came of It.  -  Descent of the Mountain.  -  Hunger and Roast

        </argument>
        <p>There was silence and an unavailing purpose to sleep when the
newspaper man said that he had told us how he escaped from
Knoxville, going out on one side of the then little city when General
Burnside entered on the other.</p>
        <p>“It was impossible to go directly south. The railway leading to
Chattanooga was held at every bridge and station by Federal pickets.
Therefore I went towards Nashville. I spent a day at Kingston, an
ancient town of twenty-five hundred inhabitants on Clinch River
at the base of the Cumberland Mountains. Thence I journeyed slowly
southeast, pretending to be a Kentuckian on my way to Chattanooga
where my brother was dying in the hospital.</p>
        <p>“I had, as a Whig and Unionist, traversed this district, and now from
the home of one friend I was directed to another. I traveled at
night, and was accompanied, on horseback or in a farm wagon, by
the political and partisan friend with whom I had spent the preceding
night. I was educated, before I entered the university and afterward
the law-school, at a theological college, and learned how to prepare
very acceptable sermons, perhaps for the reason that I could memorize
readily and recite <hi rend="italics "><foreign lang="la">ore rotundo</foreign></hi> what I had written. When I first
encountered you, and when Blake recognized me, I had been forced,
most unwillingly, to enact the role of chaplain and missionary sent
down from Cincinnati by the Young Men's Christian Association. Of
course I sought the acquaintance of the best people of the place, and
was at last forced to deliver, much against my will, two sermons while
traversing the country from Kingston to the Hiwassee at Charleston.
The last was pronounced, the day before we met, with infinite zeal
<pb id="dupre32" n="32"/>
and fervor. In my audience were many grim, but devout, Union
soldiers. On this occasion I delivered the sermon which you read in
Tristram Shandy. Of course I had amended, modernized, and localized
it. Those most familiar with Sterne would hardly have recognized the
pretty homily. I used this charming discourse because I had mastered
it perfectly and was sure I would go through with the day's work
never incurring a suspicion or exciting a doubt as to genuineness of
the character I assumed. If I had not played Beecher, on the 
most awkwardly. But I was no spy. I only sought to escape into
the Gulf States and was overjoyed when I recognized my learned
friend Blake here in the rude garb of an East Tennessee clodhopper
at Charleston.</p>
        <p>“So much by way of prelude to a recital of incidents of the previous
Sunday. There was a Methodist conference in session in the village
of Kingston. I had just reached the place, and, Sunday morning as
it was, found idlers about the tavern eyeing me suspiciously. When
any two persons saw me approaching they parted at once and each
went his way. The somewhat aged landlord was studiously polite and
reserved. Seeing many people coming into the village I learned that
the Methodist conference of the district was to sit and resolved, rather
than be captured by these bushwhackers and shot or sent a prisoner
of war beyond the Ohio, to become a Northern missionary. I took a
conspicuous seat in the church soon filled to overflowing.</p>
        <p>“Near me sat a bright-eyed, slender, sallow little preacher. He wore
a threadbare broadcloth coat of the Methodist regulation pattern.
There were constant nervous twitchings of the corners of his mouth
and laughing devils in his merry eyes. His name, as I learned afterward,
was Weaver, a famous practical joker as well as eloquent evangelist.
A song was sung. The venerable Bishop of the district occupied a
raised seat in front of the pulpit and bending in the presence
of God uttered a fervent prayer for peace and for the ‘restoration
of harmony and good government.’ Though there was nothing in the
prayer pronounced by the devout old man to offend a ‘rebel,’
he was evidently loyal to the ‘Stars and Stripes’ as were
nine-tenths of his hearers.</p>
        <p>“Silence, when the Bishop resumed his seat, pervaded the assembly.
At length a youthful, graceful preacher addressed as ‘Brother
Williams,’ evidently much excited, and pale and tremulous, rose in the
midst of the congregation, and, hesitating and stammering, said:</p>
        <p>“ ‘Brethren, Brother Jones and I came to town early this morning with
Brother Weaver.’</p>
        <p>“I turned and looked at Weaver. There were a thousand merry
devils lurking in his bright, mischievous eyes. The corners of his
mouth were drawn down and lips suddenly compressed. Seeing that
the eyes of the assembly were turned upon him, he modestly bowed
his head and sat in moody silence and perfect stillness gazing at his feet.</p>
        <p>“Brother Williams proceeded:</p>
        <pb id="dupre33" n="33"/>
        <p>“ ‘While we were crossing the main street of the town awhile ago,
brother Weaver, looking up at the windows of the hotel, remarked, in
very sad, solemn tones, to Brother Jones and myself, that the last
time that he slept in that hotel the landlord's wife occupied his
apartment. Of course I was startled, not to say shocked. Brother
Jones, too, was much excited, and both of us listened intently to
Brother Weaver's reply when I asked him if it were possible that I
heard aright. He answered, “Yes, my brethren, it is my duty to tell
the truth and whatever you may think, and whatever the consequences,
I must repeat that what I have stated is true. The last time I occupied
an apartment in that hotel the landlord's youthful wife was my companion.”</p>
        <p>“ ‘Brother Weaver's face, while this speech was uttered by him, was
expressive of profoundest melancholy.’</p>
        <p>“ ‘And I am persuaded,’ continued Brother Williams, ‘that he was
moved to make this painful confession because the face of the Lord
was never more patent in His goodness and heavenly benefactions than
when it shone upon us this morning in the gorgeous sunlight that
suddenly flooded plains, hills, and mountains. It rolled and fell like
a brilliant Niagara of jewels and gold from the summit of the
mountains yonder into this deep, beautiful valley. Clinch River, my
brethren, shone lustrously as burnished silver, and the very splendors
of the morning and pearly brightness and purity of skies overhanging
this matchless land of beauty and blessedness were eloquent of God's
goodness and suggestive of man's penitence. Brother Weaver, I am
sure, could not withstand the force of nature's persuasive eloquence;
and coming, as he was, to God's temple, he was moved to make this
painful confession of his heinous crime.</p>
        <p>“ ‘I appeal to Brother Jones, who accompanied us, to attest the
truthfulness of my statements.’</p>
        <p>“Williams sat down and Jones, an illiterate circuit-rider, rising,
slowly and timorously said:</p>
        <p>“ ‘Brethren, all that you have hearn is only too true,’ and his eyes
filling with tears, he used his handkerchief, and hesitating, stammering
and weeping, was at last enabled to drawl out in broken accents, ‘I
hope, my <sic corr="brethren">brethering</sic> you will deal <sic corr="leniently">leaniently</sic> with Brother Weaver.
The flesh you know is weak and Brother Weaver has repented. I
know he has because he has confessed.’</p>
        <p>“A torrent of tears swept down Jones' rugged features and with an
audible groan he dropped, like a dead man, on his seat, utterly
crushed by the weight of this unspeakable sorrow.</p>
        <p>“Profoundest silence reigned, broken by sobs and groans of
miserable and sympathetic Brother Jones. No assembly, christian or
heathen, was ever more profoundly shocked. Women of the
congregation, nervously excited, grew pale and haggard. The face of
the Bishop's venerated wife was of ashen hue. Weaver was the flower
of the flock of young preachers.</p>
        <p>“At last the Bishop rose and said:</p>
        <pb id="dupre34" n="34"/>
        <p>“ ‘Brethren, you have heard, with horror and dismay, statements
made by our two young brethren. I see Brother Weaver there, his
head bowed beneath the weight of shame and penitence. Will he
not speak? Has he nothing to say?’</p>
        <p>“The Bishop resumed his chair.</p>
        <p>“Slowly, most deliberately, and with an irrepressible twinkle in his
clear, bright eyes, Brother Weaver, drawing himself up by the back
of the seat before him, rose to confront the eager gaze of the excited
assembly. He stood some moments looking sorrowfully over the
throng gazing intently into his attractive, but saddened, solemn face.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Brethren,’ he said at last, ‘I did make the confession which my
friends heard and have accurately repeated; but it so happens that
when I occupied the room mentioned, with the landlord's wife, as
stated, I was the landlord, and the woman was my wife.’</p>
        <p>“The true state of the case was slowly comprehended by the duped
and stupefied multitude. The Bishop and his wife were first to
discover the immaculate innocence of the two circuit-riders, Williams
and Jones, and a broad smile spread over the kindly face of the godly
man. His fat wife began to laugh immoderately. The infection
spread, and when it had grown into a great roar the lantern-jawed,
solemn, weeping Jones sprang up in evident disgust and exclaimed:</p>
        <p>“ ‘Sold! awfully sold! Weren't we, Brother Williams?’</p>
        <p>“This outburst of the mortified Jones, who had wasted bitter tears
and sweetest sympathy upon Weaver, perfected the sudden revulsion
from profound sadness and solemnity to an apprehension of the
absurdity of the facts and their utter incompatibility with the
seriousness of the place, day, and occasion. The Bishop's fat wife
crammed her handkerchief into her mouth and the Bishop himself,
contemplating the vacant look of empty astonishment that overspread
Jones' heavy face, who seemed to ask himself, ‘How could I have been
such an arrant fool?’ was wholly overcome. He caught a glance from the
tearful eyes of his agonized wife and could contain himself no longer.
He threw his head backward, clapped his hands to his sides, and roared
with laughter. I never saw a religious assembly, on the Lord's day, in
such a deplorable, unseemly condition.</p>
        <p>“The incident served to divert attention from myself. I mixed
and talked and laughed with busy, garrulous men and women, and
each seemed to think the rest had known me always. The Bishop,
first mildly chiding Brother Weaver for the innocent fraud practised
upon two zealous circuit-riders, pronounced a sermon of singular
simplicity and marvellous incisiveness and force. The minds of his
auditors were diverted wholly from sinful rebels, and when I returned
in the afternoon to the hotel, having passed under the inspection of
the multitude, the venerable landlord greeted me most graciously and
called forth the good-looking wife that I might see, as he stated the
proposition, ‘how <sic corr="naturally">naterally</sic> even a preacher might go wrong in his
hotel.’ ”</p>

fires blazing along the curves of Moccasin Bend and on the slopes of
mountain sides and down the deep valley of the Tennessee, were
sounding the reveille when the modest journalist concluded his recital.
When, some weeks later, it was written out, I had not learned how to
insert the words [“laughter,”] and [“great applause”] in brackets, as
since introduced by party leaders; otherwise these pages would show
how keenly the story, here imperfectly reproduced, was enjoyed by
cold, comfortless, and hungry scouts ensconced in a little cavern on
the summit of Lookout Mountain, on the ever memorable night of
December 31, 1863, the first anniversary of the battle of Stone River.</p>
        <p>The mountain was veneered with sheets of ice. We knew that few
were abroad on such a morning, that sentinels and pickets stood near
camp fires, and that scouting parties of the enemy sought shelter
within cabins of bushwhackers. Avoiding paths and roadways and
cabins we began to slide, rather than walk, down the mountain. In
a few hours we reached McLemore's Cove and thence, painfully
fatigued by sliding over the frozen ground sheeted in ice, we plodded
wearily along the ridge, known, I believe, as Taylor's. Night was
coming on. We had eaten nothing for twenty-four hours. Made
reckless by suffering, one of our number shot a hog. It was hastily
skinned, washed, sliced and roasted to a crisp, in thin strips,
by a roaring fire made to glow with the farmer's rails whose sustenance
we devoured. Without bread or salt, we ate ravenously. I have
since dined at the Fifth Avenue, at Morley's, the best <hi rend="italics">cafes</hi> of Paris,
Berlin, and Vienna, but never derived such exquisite pleasure from
food as when we half-frozen soldiers sat about the blazing rails, and
ate unsalted pork on the heights that look down upon Chattanooga.</p>
        <p>Two days later, moving at night, and concealed and resting in
Densest thickets during daytime, we rested at Tunnel Hill, where
General Pat Cleburne was encamped. He congratulated us in most
flattering terms on successes achieved, was pleased with the fullness and
accuracy of information given as to the numbers, purposes, and
positions of the enemy, and made me accompany him to General
Granbury's quarters. Here we spent most of the night while I recited,
as given in these pages, the story of our adventures. I gave, besides,
minute descriptions of the country and relative positions of the forces of
the enemy and the strength of each position defined in pencil sketches
I had made. That night it was determined by these two Confederate
leaders that a permanent body of scouts should be kept constantly
employed between the lines of the two armies. I was commended by
these officers to General Joseph E. Johnston and soon afterward given
charge of a body of scouts and entered upon the execution of hazardous
tasks incident to the position. I am glad to state that I never forfeited
the personal esteem and unlimited confidence of either of these three
great leaders; and that I, a boy not quite eighteen years of age, won
and retained under such an ordeal, the unfaltering friendship and
confidence of these accomplished gentlemen and soldiers, is the most
pleasing reflection incident to my conduct in life.</p>

        </argument>
        <p>After a few days rest, I was given charge of thirteen men and
assigned the task of arresting deserters and bushwhackers. We
established a rendezvous about midway between the two armies and between
Ringgold and La Fayette in Georgia. One man was made cook
and commissary, remaining always at our place of encampment, while
twelve men were constantly on duty. Six went out each morning,
three going east and three going west. When these came back, the
other six in turn explored the “neutral ground.” Seven men were
always ready to defend our stronghold, and the country about us was
perfectly patrolled. Within a week we captured and sent back eight
deserters to be tried and shot. Returning to camp late one afternoon
I was startled by a rapid fusillade in its direction. I was sure the
bushwhackers had attacked my little garrison and hurried to its relief.
Of course, anticipating an ambuscade, we moved, when within a mile
of the scene of conflict, very cautiously. But the firing was suddenly
silenced. We feared the worst  -  even that we would find our comrades
dead on the unnamed, unknown field of conflict, or hanging to
great trees hard-by. Just then there was an explosion as of a six-pounder
field-piece. Then the garrison shouted as if a great victory
were won and an enemy put to flight. We moved forward cautiously,
full of gravest apprehensions.</p>
        <p>There was a prisoner held in our camp, the meanest villain, and
murderer, and coward that ever slunk away from an open fight to do
assassin's work at night or by the roadside. It was my purpose to
send him that night, to be court-martialed and shot, to General
<pb id="dupre37" n="37"/>
Cleburne's head-quarters. He had recently waylaid and murdered, as
my men knew, two of the bravest soldiers.</p>
        <p>By some means, in my absence, the little garrison had been
supplied with “mountain dew,” that intoxicating beverage which,
while war ravaged the South, came trickling down, drop by drop, from
green logs upon sheds of poverty in deep glens, first to madden, and
then to lull jaded inmates to repose. While the scouts were half
drunken, this wretched murderer and deserter had attempted to
escape. He had been fired upon, and swooning unharmed, in pitiful
terror, was brought back to our resting place. His meanness and
cowardice exasperated the drunken soldiers. One of them climbed a
slender hickory tree, forty or fifty feet high, strong, tough, and
elastic as whalebone. The weight of the soldier's body barely bent
the top of the tree to the ground.</p>
        <p>At the moment I came in view of the spot, the bushwhacker,
attached by a cord about his neck to the tree-top, shot upward through
the air. His head was jerked away from his light, sinewy, little body.
The neck seemed, as the little villain sped upward and away through
the air, quite a yard long. He was instantly killed, the dead body
having been thrown by the slender, elastic tree more than one
hundred feet from the point at which it left the earth, describing a
semicircle above the tree-top. The hickory tree almost instantly
re-assumed its erect position, and when I stood in the midst of the
men, the dead body, almost motionless, swung down among the topmost
branches of this extraordinary gallows. The men, drunken as
they were when firing the fusillade of triumph and when they exploded
an old musket barrel half full of powder and driven downward in the
ground till only the touch-hole was exposed, stood sober and erect,
and stared upward in horror at the dead body of the wretched bushwhacker
dangling from the tree and swinging helplessly around its top.</p>
        <p>I asked no questions. None were needful. An ugly, brown jug
was overturned on a blanket. Its open mouth, from which whiskey
gurgled, in melancholy accents, recited every incident of the horrible
crime. Its breath was noisome as its deeds are always disgusting and
hideous. Drunken as were my guardsmen and incapable, I was
forced, by every consideration of safety, to find at once another
rendezvous. The explosion of the gun barrel invited spies and scouts
and bushwhackers from all directions, and assured of their speedy
arrival, our safety demanded instant flight.</p>
        <p>My whole force had been rapidly drawn together, and within
twenty minutes we began to move. Time was too valuable to devote
a half hour to the burial of the ghastly corpse in the tree-top. We
left it, a hideous spectacle, swaying restlessly to and fro as the winds
moved the body of the slender tree. Birds of prey, in unbroken,
untraveled forest solitudes, devoured it. There was no Rizpah to
defend it. Its bones, when stripped of flesh, were restive as before,
and still were dancing, when fierce, wintry winds bent the great forest
oaks, a ghastly dance of solitude, around the body of the tree of death.</p>
        <pb id="dupre38" n="38"/>
        <p>We moved to a point near La Fayette, a village in Walker County,
Georgia. There, one of my men learned from a country girl he often
visited, that the bushwhackers of the district would meet, in order to
effect an organization, the next Saturday night, at an old church in or
near McLemore's Cove several miles away. The girl was informed
that forty or fifty armed men would be present. We could only be
assured of the damsel's truthfulness by going into McLemore's Cove.
There was great hazard to be incurred. If assailed and overpowered
there was only one way of escape, and our force was too weak to
cope with that to be organized by the bushwhackers. We held a
council of war, and after due deliberation, condemned the proposed
expedition. Five of us persisting in the purpose to capture the
bushwhackers, finally arranged it that we would secure the co-operation
of a cavalry force at the nearest Confederate outpost, and make a vigorous
descent upon the country church. Fortune favored us. We had not
gone five miles in the direction of the proposed rendezvous before we
discovered a solitary horseman, who proved to be the very man we
wanted. He came upon us so suddenly, in an abrupt curve of the
densely wooded roadside, that he had no opportunity to escape.
Covered instantly by five muskets, he dismounted and surrendered
without a murmur. We agreed with the prisoner, who was quite fifty
years old, such was our eagerness to obtain information, if we found
his statements truthful, and if he would give us information we wanted
and no more wage war against the South, that we would release
him. He assented, and confirmed the story told by Ralph's sweetheart.
We found all his assertions correct, and the bargain then made
was afterwards faithfully executed. Two men, with this prisoner,
were sent to the nearest cavalry encampment. Fifty men were placed
at my disposal; the church, while the bushwhackers occupied it, was
completely invested; and its occupants, about fifty in number, were
captured without firing a gun. They never dreamed of the possible
presence, in that remote, inaccessible cove, of a strong body of
Confederate cavalry.</p>
        <p>Of course, we who participated in the hard march and toils and
dangers of this expedition into McLemore's Cove were not a little
irritated when, returning to camp, we found that our comrades had
done nothing in our absence. They had participated in many country
dances. They were telling of the beauty of many maidens, occupants
of many cottages and cabins everywhere within ten miles of the
village. They had forgotten our existence and inquired most carelessly
about the result of the fortunate expedition. We were
grievously offended, and proposed, at the earliest opportunity, to
punish their timidity and selfishness.</p>
        <p>A country dance was organized and appointed for that very evening.
We five who had shared in the expedition into McLemore's Cove
made no sign, but went quietly to the ball. We danced as vigorously
and joyously as the rest till perhaps eleven o'clock. Then, as
pre-arranged, three of the five mentioned went unnoticed to a point near
<pb id="dupre39" n="39"/>
the court-house, half a mile distant, and fired a volley of muskets and
pistols. Instantly the music was silenced and dancing suspended.
Each soldier hurriedly armed himself. No further demonstration of
enemies or friends occurring, two of my recusant scouts, blustering
monstrously and asserting much fearlessness, said they would go out
and discover the cause of the alarm. Accompanied by a fun-loving
Irishman, I followed, pursuing a street parallel with that taken by
these mock heroes. They went not farther than two hundred yards,
and stopped beneath the dense shadow of a great cedar tree. We fired
our muskets into the tree-top above their heads. Each thought the
other mortally wounded. Both cried out, “They are coming! They
are coming!” and fled precipitately. We fired our pistols to accelerate
their flight, and heighten the terror of their dismayed comrades.
They rushed into the hall among frightened women and unnerved
men, unnerved because dangers environing them were unseen and
unmeasured. Rapidly girls and beaux of the immediate vicinity ran
away to their homes, and there was such a stampede, as “when Belgium's
capital had gathered in her beauty and her chivalry.”</p>
        <p>My object was accomplished. The men who had refused to go
with us into McLemore's Cove were <sic corr="woefully">wofully</sic> frightened. This Capua
in Lombardy which had wrought such fatal paralysis of the soldierly
virtues and energies of my scouts, was divested of attractiveness, and
next morning, rising before the sun, my men were ready for the
execution of any task of toil or feat of daring. I explained the
incidents of the night before and stated that soldiers were made
worthless by whiskey, dancing, and women, and that, if reform were
impossible, I would send them back to the ditches and have others, in
their stead, detailed for this free and exciting service.</p>
        <p>I should not forget to state that the honest bushwhacker we captured
won my confidence to such an extent that I told him how
completely my heart had been entrapped by the charms and wiles and
graces of pretty, confiding, frank, and fearless Mamie Hughes. To
him I entrusted my first letter to Mamie. I retained no copy, but
remember that I suggested that she should take advantage of the
bushwhacker's thorough knowledge of the country and of his
trustworthiness, and accompany him to her own home below Dalton. I
confessed to the bushwhacker how thoroughly I was devoted to the
charming girl, and promised, if he would conduct her safely to her
own home below our lines, I would do him any personal service he
might require. I am not sure that my judgment approved the
arrangement I made for a meeting with Mamie. If I had loved her
less, I would never have proposed her subjection to the dangers and
fatigues of such a journey even with such a guardsman. But I had
never ceased to think and dream of Mamie's great, lustrous, black
eyes and of that limitless confidence I read in them when she looked
upon my face and held my hand by the moonlit roadside where the
compulsory dance occurred on the cold, bleak hillside not far below
the village of Charleston. Every day some soldier, noticing my
<pb id="dupre40" n="40"/>
abstracted manner, said that Mamie Hughes had wrought a marvelous
transformation of my conduct and character. When relieved of duties
and anxieties incident to my position and to dangers almost always
environing us, I stood aloof from my men, no longer participating in
their rude sports or occupying a place at some improvised card-table.
I was dreaming of Mamie Hughes, and sought solitude, that undisturbed,
fancy might reproduce her matchless charms. She had promised
never to forget and meet me at her home. From the day
on which I transmitted the letter telling her to come, that I must see
her again, that I loved her passionately, that I had never been able to
dismiss the splendid vision wrought by her presence or repress aspirations
excited by the hope that she would love me  -  from that day I
had been a changed man. I was conscious that I had entered upon a
new life. I had found one to share it who had already become an
inseparable part of my existence.</p>
        <p>Wedded life, if marriage be unity, begins before we go to the altar
and before the priest utters his meaningless jargon. This is only a
ceremony; the fact is accomplished and real wedded oneness begins
beneath the moon and stars, as when, on the roadside, Mamie and I
met and parted so suddenly that her face and form constituted an
imperfect memory, while their effect upon my conduct and emotions
wrought such a change in my character and habits that my associates
knew that we “twain were one flesh.” They had seen how I was dazed
by the wonderful fascinations of the little sprite that sprang,
a brilliant, startling vision from dreamland, in the midst of the
mountains of East Tennessee.</p>
        <p>From many sources I had learned the history of Mamie's family.
Her brother was a Union soldier serving under Colonel Cliff. Her
father, a life-long Whig, was a devout loyalist or Union man, while
she and her mother were enthusiastic rebels. It is a strange fact,
soon discovered in traversing these mountainous districts of several
coterminous States, that while men were commonly “loyal,” women,
more impulsive and sympathetic, and apt to serve the weak against
the strong, were ardent “rebels.” Political and partisan considerations
involved were never valued by Mamie Hughes. She was born
rich and a slaveholder, but never dreamed of the pending conflict as
a struggle to maintain or extirpate slavery. She was not of those who
went to war because the Union would not suffer southern masters to
convey negros in the abstract to an impossible place  -  Kansas. She
would not have given one drop of the blood of those dear to her for the
freedom or slavery of all Africans in the South. Fighting was
begun, and womanly sympathy impelled Mamie to espouse the cause
of the weak and of those she knew and loved. Her father, recognizing,
as the daughter and wife did not, ties of partisanship, and
listening, as was his wont, to the sturdy, practical, simple eloquence
of Andrew Johnson and reading the <hi rend="italics">National Intelligencer</hi>, a Whig
and conservative newspaper that once entered the home of almost
every slaveholder, was an unfaltering, earnest Unionist.</p>
        <pb id="dupre41" n="41"/>
        <p>I had observed differences between northern and southern women
produced by the institution of slavery. If the northern dame were
self-reliant, she was also cold, selfish and practical. If southern
women were physically helpless, and unused to toil, and knew not
how to serve themselves, they were also wholly ignorant of the
depravity, as well as selfishness, of men. The hybrid race stood
between the maiden of wealth and social vices of which she never
dreamed. Chivalry honored and respected virtue because there
was no necessity, as society was arranged, for assaults upon its
strongholds. But beyond this, the co-existence of two races, the one
enslaved and by no means faultless, imbued free-born damsels with a
degree of self-respect, and pride of person and race which repelled
every approach of degradation and dishonor. Selfish interest concurred
with and heightened and ennobled the tenderest sensibilities and
truest sympathies of southern women. It was their province to
minister to the sick, to clothe the naked, and feed the hungry. Their
reward was two-fold: in dollars that glittered in greasy, healthful,
shining African faces, and in that higher, holier pleasure derived from
the consciousness of doing good, in ministering to the delights of
others, and relieving woes of the helpless, dependent and unfortunate.
Slavery, therefore, produced the noblest women possible, and I loved
Mamie Hughes none the less that she was an hereditary slave-owner.
Infinite and numberless as were evils incident to the “peculiar
institution,” it begat a class of men and women, and a state of society,
in many of its aspects, as admirable and delightful as that is degraded
and brutal in numerous localities has supplanted African servitude
and white mastery. Planters were petty kings, wielding powers almost
of life and death. The master's slightest nod was the iron law of the
realm. None of God's creatures are so good and great that they
are worthy of such autocratic power, and few so ignorant and
depraved that they should be subjected to this despotic authority; the
right of masters was no more divine than is that of kings. Mamie's
father, like my own, reigned unrestrained despot over five hundred
human beings, and such a father hardly tolerated the unconquerable
fidelity of the mother and daughter to the “treasonable Confederacy.”
That both might entertain changed or modified opinions,
they were separated, and Mamie was sent into East Tennessee to spend
a few months with her “loyal” cousins. There I had met her, as
already stated, and there I was hopelessly enchained, a helpless victim
of the simple wiles and native charms of pretty Mamie Hughes.</p>
        <p>Before the deluge of woes, war, poverty, vice, and crime swept over
and annihilated it, the hospitality of the “Old South” was traditional
as it was matchless. In fact, monumental virtues, as well as vices,
were sturdy outgrowths of negro servitude. These were expanded and
flourished, until (in its social aspects, as seen from without and as
presented in the every-day life of southern households) strangers
deemed it paradisical. The characters of the planter and of members
of his family were shaped by peculiar influences wrought by peculiar
<pb id="dupre42" n="42"/>
relations of master and slave, and by consequent peculiar modes of
life. He trafficked and traded with nobody. He only gave. His
cotton or sugar or rice factor, in the nearest commercial mart, sold
his crops and bought his annual home, and plantation, and household
supplies. His overseers commonly bought mules, and horses, and
bacon, and the planter only rode over his estates, and watched the
growth of crops, and determined questions of right and wrong arising
among “his people” on his broad estates. Humanity was profitable,
and hospitality, where farms and gardens and orchards produced
everything that hospitality consumed, cost nothing. Planters were
even willing to pay for agreeable society. Therefore, their residences
were hotels where no bills were presented. They had dogs, and
horses, and guns, and wines, and dinners to attract those whose
society they courted. Having no business or trade relations with
their neighbors, they had no quarrels or law suits, and thus the loftiest
and most admirable personal virtues were cultivated and exercised,
and worthy men, as well as admirable and haughty women, sprang
from the centuries of African servitude.</p>
        <p>Mamie Hughes was thoroughly imbued with the feelings, and
instincts, and ineradicable pride of race that <sic corr="distinguished">distinguised</sic> the best and
truest and haughtiest of her sex. She had been blest, and injured in
nothing, by influences exerted by negro subordination to the white
race. Rich, never having known a want ungratified, she was self-willed
and arrogant. Accustomed to the exaction of obedience, she
expected limitless concessions to her demands. The time was coming
when Mamie must adapt herself to conditions of life wholly subverted.
She was anticipating it and schooling her proud spirit even then, that
she might defy poverty and cheerfully accept its griefs. The tide of
desolating war had already swept over the homes of her kindred in
East Tennessee. There she had led the way in executing each
arduous household task suddenly imposed by hard necessities of the
period upon her aunts and cousins. She encountered every stroke of
poverty with seeming indifference. She toiled steadily, intelligently,
and skillfully, and such was her patient, smiling heroism, that
misfortunes became sources of pleasure, because of the delight involved
in retrieving them.</p>
        <p>And Mamie Hughes was a true representative of her class. The
richest, and proudest, and noblest of the South when poverty came,
were never heard to utter a lament. There were no Jeremiads
in which were inserted tedious parenthetical descriptions of gorgeous
splendors and fabulous wealth in the midst of which she had moved
and reigned in unrestricted authority. Mamie, as subsequent pages
may tell, was true to herself, to her class, and to the nobility of her
race. She was fearless and confident, encountering calamities and
triumphing over poverty with a determination and steadiness of
purpose that exacted every concession of gratitude and love which
intelligence and truth always award to the loftiest heroism.</p>
        <p>Besides a sugar plantation in Louisiana, Mamie's father owned rice
<pb id="dupre43" n="43"/>
fields in South Carolina; but his preferred home was in the broad,
rich valley, in --- County, Georgia, fifty-eight miles from
Atlanta. Here Mamie's mother, and grandmother, and great
grandmother, were born, and here her fathers had tilled the soil, and
gathered wealth, and owned countless slaves, through many
generations. Great old oaks, and walnut trees, and Lombardy poplars
had been planted one hundred years before in long lines leading through
the enclosed forest to the rambling, irregular cluster of apartments,
passages, dining, dancing and music halls, and library, and bed-
chambers that constituted the ancestral home of Mamie Hughes.
How I happened to go thither, and what vicissitudes of fortune befell
Mamie, her brother, and myself, will appear hereafter.</p>

        </argument>
        <p>We had been pursuing the usual routine of scouts' duties several
days near La Fayette, capturing deserters and bushwhackers, and
incurring at all times unseen and unmeasured dangers, when we
learned, through a woman, of course, that a lieutenant of a Georgia
regiment, Longstreet's Corps, who had escaped as a deserter from our
lines, was harbored by his cousin, so-called, a gay and charming young
widow of the town. We were eager to capture the young gentleman.
Our fair informant, moved by jealousy, said that he had concealed
himself in the forest while we were in La Fayette, but returned when
we left the place. I went about the streets everywhere stating that we
would move south, into our own lines, the next day. With my whole
force, and with baggage packed and rations prepared for a long march,
we moved out of the place. Five miles away we entered a thicket,
remaining there till midnight. Then, with four men I retraced my
steps and reached the widow's house in the suburbs about one o'clock.
In the darkness I stationed my men about the house, supposing that the
gay Lothario, hearing of our departure, would return before day-dawn
to his accustomed and most comfortable quarters. We were only
mistaken in the date of events. We rested, watching intently, but in
vain, for the Lieutenant's approach, till streaks of gray light danced
and flashed and disappeared, and then marked the verge of the
eastern sky. Then it occurred to me that our intended prize might
have entered the house almost as soon as we left the place.</p>
        <p>Just then a drowsy negro appeared. He came out of his cabin
hard-by, slowly yawning, and stretching himself, and rubbing his
eyes, to the wood pile behind which I was seated. He was muttering
<pb id="dupre45" n="45"/>
to himself and cursing the cold weather and “Massa Jones” who had
ordered him to kindle fires in the “white folks' house.” Silently,
and unseen, in the gray mists of early dawn, I leveled my musket.
The sleepy negro's nose struck the cold barrel.</p>
        <p>“Golly! What's dat?” he exclaimed, starting back, and throwing up
his hands.</p>
        <p>“Be silent, you black rascal, or I'll blow away the top of your
head,” was my low response.</p>
        <p>Cuffee was now wide awake. His greasy eyes glistened in the pale,
thin fog. I said to him that if he obeyed me he should not be
harmed. To steady his nerves and confidence I gave him a silver
half dollar. He had not seen one since 1860. He grinned when
rubbing and looking at it, and then an awfully black pall of gloom
settled instantly and fell over his sooty face when he <sic corr="contemplated">contemplaced</sic>
the lowered musket, still pointed at him.</p>
        <p>“Cuffee,” I said.</p>
        <p>He started, thrusting the half dollar into his breeches pocket.</p>
        <p>“Cuffee,” I continued, “I want that Lieutenant who is staying in
your mistress' house.”</p>
        <p>A broad grin slowly spread over and illuminated Cuffee's
portentously black physiognomy. He was silent a moment, and then said:</p>
        <p>“Go an' cotch him, masse. He's in dar.”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” I responded, “I know that, but he is armed and desperate,
and if I open the door he will shoot. You must open it. He knows
your voice and will come unarmed to admit you with your load of
wood. When he opens the door my musket will make him stand
harmless and helpless.”</p>
        <p>“You is gwine to tuck him wid ye, is ye? An' he aint comin' back
enny mo?” Cuffee asked, with a look of anxious inquiry.</p>
        <p>I answered him that the deserter would be seen no more in La
Fayette.</p>
        <p>“All right, masse. Mistis nestils to him moas too much enny how
and Cuffee doesn't want any white boss on dis place.”</p>
        <p>He piled up the wood on his shoulder and moved to the house.
He leaned forward and the wood struck the door. He had hardly
asked the Lieutenant to open it when the young gentleman appeared
in his night clothes. The click of the lock and gleam of the bright
gun barrel almost touching his face, paralyzed him. “Walk out,” I
said. “Cuffee, bring out the gentleman's clothes, and don't forget
his pistols and other property. He must go with us, and we have no
time to lose. When the sun rises, the bushwhackers, knowing we
have left, will take the town.”</p>
        <p>Pale and trembling, his lips white and eyes starting from their
sockets, the young man read his final doom in the facts before him.
It was not my musket that frightened him. He saw the gallows just
behind me. His knees shook, teeth chattered, his face was of ashen hue.</p>
        <p>“Come out,” I said. Holding the door-facing, and moving
helplessly, he advanced, as I stepped backward. I whistled. My
<pb id="dupre46" n="46"/>
comrades came instantly. Cuffee assisted the deserter in dressing
himself, and we were moving away when the vigorous widow, by some
means became advised of what was occurring.</p>
        <p>She leaped out of the house in her night clothes, and alternately
weeping and railing at us, demanded the release of her “husband.”
She sought to pass me and reach the two men between whom her
lover was rapidly moving away.</p>
        <p>I caught her arm and asked if she had “reflected what disgrace she
was bringing upon her name by this public betrayal of relations
subsisting between herself and that deserter? The neighbors are
awake. See the lights in that cottage, and how fires blaze this cold,
bright morning on many hearths, and yet here you are in your gown
howling after that deserter. Your child will be dishonored!”</p>
        <p>The woman stopped. She covered her ears with her hands and
stared fixedly and wonderingly in my face.</p>
        <p>“Go back,” I exclaimed, and thrusting her hand violently from
me, I left her mute and motionless. I had not gone very far, when,
looking back, the hapless widow had disappeared. I never saw her
afterwards, and am sorry to tell her, even now, since every wanderer
in Northern Georgia will read this book, that her lieutenant was
sent under guard to his command which had been transferred to
Virginia, and there he was tried, convicted, and shot for desertion.
For obvious reasons I have not given his name, once honored everywhere
in the South, or that of the fascinating dame who surely loved
him very tenderly.</p>
        <p>We moved leisurely toward Ringgold. We had heard from a
<sic corr="farmer's">farmers's</sic> good wife, from whom we bought eggs for breakfast, that
there was a deserter, as she believed, secreted at a designated
neighbor's house. We were then about nine miles from La Fayette. She
said that the mistress of the place had a child not more than ten or
fifteen days old, and that half a dozen women were always there to
serve up the gossip of the country for the delectation of the poor
mother, still bed-ridden.</p>
        <p>“It will happen, therefore, said the good dame, that if you search
the loft and inspect the out-houses, you will be beset by the most
frightful scolds that ever assailed a soldier. The women that meet
there are unlettered wives or daughters of bushwhackers and one or
two men would not be safe in attempting to discover the hiding place
of a  deserter from the southern army.</p>
        <p>Very unwillingly did the two females who met us at the doorway,
admit us into the house designated. My force was now reduced to six
men and our appearance was not very imposing. But when the
women saw that we were armed and resolute, we were told by a
thin-visaged, long-nosed, angular creature to “search and be derned!”
She shook at us an old cotton umbrella and said: “Ef this 'ere
umbaril would shoot I'd kill the last derned one of ye! I thot you
was a lot of Jeff Davis' sneaks and spies to cum pokin' about under
people's beds and things!”</p>
        <pb id="dupre47" n="47"/>
        <p>Here a meek-looking, tearful woman nudged the fierce declaimer
with her elbow. I observed the movement and accepted the suggestion
in reference to the beds. But the violent old harridan talked and
raved only the more violently and volubly until she finally broke
down giving way to floods of grief pumped up by impotent rage.</p>
        <p>We peered into every nook and corner of the house, and looked
under every bed and finally went away, still believing that a deserter
lurked about the place. But we abandoned the search and concluded
at last the bird had flown. We loitered for a time at the spring under
the hill near the house. A barefoot boy, a cunning little rascal,
twelve or thirteen years old, was throwing pebbles into the spring. I
soon discovered that he knew what were our purposes, and where the
deserter was concealed. I offered the urchin a silver half dollar to
tell. He yielded at last, unable to withstand a bribe involving the
instant delivery of a box of percussion caps. He told me to raise the
planks under his sick mother's bed and I would find there a man
whom he “didn't love.” He said this fellow “had bin thar more'n
a year, off and on, and my own dad, he's bin a soldiering sumwhar in
Virginney,” he believed.</p>
        <p>The boy asked what we proposed to “do with Mr. Jobson.” I asked
why he wished to know.</p>
        <p>“Oh! nuffin much,” said the youth, “he aint my dad and I'm jest tired
of folks axin' me ef he aint.”</p>
        <p>We returned to the house, encountering at the entrance a fiercer
volley of imprecations than before. Even the silent, weeping dame,
whose pitiful face and heart-rending sighs had excited our compassion,
was now voluble and defiant.</p>
        <p>“Here's six pore lone wimmin right 'ere in this 'ere naberhood an'
nary a man to take care of us, and look arter us, but one, and you
mean Jeff Davisites want to take him away.”</p>
        <p>She broke down completely, dissolving in a flood of tears, and
fell weeping beside Spratling, who, with a cocked pistol in his hand,
disappeared under the sick woman's bed. She screamed, the baby
shrieked, the women all crying out, danced hysterically about the
apartment.</p>
        <p>Spratling lifted a plank from the floor and ordered the “d-d
ground hog,” as he pronounced him, to “crawl out.” The cocked pistol
nudged him under his ribs. He begged Spratling not to shoot, and
came forth submissively enough. I had obtained a pair of handcuffs
in the jail at La Fayette. Persuaded by Spratling's repeater, the
deserter, Jobson, dropped his wrists into the iron bands. I locked
them and turning to the petrified, horror-struck virago who had
abused me so mercilessly, I said most harshly:</p>
        <p>“Hold up your hands! you, too, shall be hanged for harboring
deserters.”</p>
        <p>Her courage gave way. She gasped for breath, grew pale as a
corpse and fell backward, her head striking the floor heavily.</p>
        <p>The excitement had been too much for her. I was alarmed. It
<pb id="dupre48" n="48"/>
never had occurred to me that I would kill a woman. Of men slain
in an open field and fair fight, or to save my own life when assailed
by ambushed enemies, I never recked a moment, but when this
ungainly, obstreperous woman fell, I confess I shuddered, and simply
because of the sex of the dead. I dashed a bucket of water in her
face and when at length she gasped for breath, I thrust a canteen of
whiskey down her throat.</p>
        <p>It is a solemn fact, incredible as it may seem, and three of my
comrades of that day, still living, will attest this statement, that when
the fiery liquor began to gurgle, as it trickled and leaped along the
rough-ribbed channel of her elongated œsophagus and finally lighted
blazing camp fires beneath her diaphragm, she sighed and opened
her eyes. Then she looked up into my face very tenderly, and
smiled, oh! so lovingly! The fiery draught was</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Sweet as the desert fountain's wave</l>
          <l>To lips just cooled in time to save.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>I rose up exasperated and wished at the moment that death might
seize, and the devil fly away with the grateful, whiskey-loving
creature. I jerked the canteen from beneath her toothless gums.
Her lips collapsed and struck one another as did the sides of the
empty Confederacy not very long afterwards. The secret of womanly
devotion to the ungainly, cowardly Jobson was disclosed. He was a
distiller of “pine top” or “gum log” whiskey in a cavernous valley,
and a canteen would have been more effective than a repeater in
discovering his hiding place.</p>
        <p>Mr. Jobson fettered, I ordered my men to march.</p>
        <p>After the annoyances and excitement of the day there was a radiant
serenity of light crowning the hills, and glowing at sunset about more
distant mountains, that throbbed in its intensity. It was divinely
restful, like the passion and peace of love when it has all to adore and
nothing to desire. The splendor and beauty of mountains crowned
by the glories of the setting sun and contemplated through this
transparent atmosphere were matchless. There was a gleam of divine
glory in aspects of nature about me and I basked in the sweet
invigorating air that was like a breath of Paradise.</p>
        <p>Ten days later Jobson was tried, convicted, and shot as a deserter.</p>

Dying Soldier.  -  “He took up his Bed and Walked.”- - Spratling falls

        </argument>
        <p>When my brigade was going into action at Chattanooga, September,
1863, Tom Ellison, a private from Coffeeville, Texas, grew very
sick. Weak nerves caused his fall. He was simply paralyzed and
helpless from insane terror. I have seen brave men, so esteemed at
home, and because of courage illustrated in deadly personal conflicts,
shrink into absolute helplessness when first moving under fire and
advancing upon serried ranks of armed battalions. Again I have seen
those bravest in battle, and then utterly oblivious of themselves, who
shrank timidly from a personal rencontre. Fear is an unaccountable
passion, and I am persuaded, after no little experience in fighting, as
a scout, as a veteran, and as a private citizen, that courage is
commonly the fear of being thought a coward. Few are wholly devoid,
like General Forrest, of the passion of fear, and the bravest are
sometimes hopelessly victimized, when they least expect it, by absurd
terror.</p>
        <p>But this man Ellison, in the presence of danger so imposing and
sublime that most soldiers, in its face, absolutely forget their own
identity, becoming wholly reckless, shrank down in his place in the
line of battle, and no force or danger or sense of shame could drive
him forward. Afterward, and from that day, he was dangerously sick.
Doctors said his nervous system was wholly shattered by terror.</p>
        <p>When our army retreated from Missionary Ridge, in November,
1863, Ellison was left sick within the Federal lines. His comrades
said he had taken the “iron-clad” oath of fidelity to the Union, gone
north, and died. But soon after we had captured Jobson, a country
dame informed us that a deserter was sojourning at a neighbor's house
<pb id="dupre50" n="50"/>
hard by Jobson's den. We were especially anxious to capture this
faithless Confederate, because, assured of encountering and mortally
offending one or more of the horrible women who sought so earnestly
to prevent the extraction of Jobson from his subterranean hiding place.
But greater became our anxiety to secure the deserter when informed
that he was a Texan. Our brigade was from that commonwealth and
felt itself disgraced that a citizen of Texas proved false to the cause
we had espoused.</p>
        <p>We surrounded the house designated by our informant before day-dawn,
that none who slept within might leave without our assent.
At sunrise I knocked at the door. Heavy footsteps of my men and
Clanking of our arms at once extorted groans from the sick man. I
did not, of course, know who he was and only that he pretended to be
suffering fearfully, and yet had walked during the week, to Chattanooga
and back, quite forty miles, in a single day. I knew these to be
absolute facts and am sure that he would have deemed me a heartless
wretch if he had beheld significant smiles overspreading mine and
Spratling's faces when we heard his heart-rending groans and pitiful
cries for relief.</p>
        <p>Sure enough, when a pretty girl admitted us, she asked us to step
lightly, saying, “There's a very sick man within. Any noise distresses
him. He is very sick and nervously sensitive. Step lightly. I am
not sure he will be glad to see you. He is from Texas and must be
true to the South.”</p>
        <p>The bright-eyed, cunning woman smiled, bent her knees, her body
went down about four inches, her head was projected slightly, and
she pulled gently upward at each side of her homespun, striped
dress-skirt. Such was her salutation, as she stepped lightly backward,
inviting us to enter. The details show that a veritable queen of fashion,
among <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="el">hoi aristoi</foreign></hi>, could hardly have greeted us in a more approved
manner. Then, too, she smiled as blandly and naturally and
graciously as if she were even delighted because of our coming.</p>
        <p>What social triumphs this cunning, pretty creature, whose form was
perfect as her face was fair, features regular, and eyes brilliant, might
have achieved if she had not been born and reared in comparative
poverty among the mountains and sand-hills and pine-covered straw
fields of Northern Georgia.</p>
        <p>I could not help discovering in the fascinations of the laughing,
youthful, and beautiful woman very potent apologies for the unearthly
groans and execrations that proceeded from the apartment of the
dying(?) soldier. I whispered to Spratling:</p>
        <p>“No wonder he is dying. A true soldier could afford to die for a
woman like that. I don't blame the fellow, even though he be a
Texan, for desertion.”</p>
        <p>“I don't see how he could well help it,” was Spratling's generous
response, and Spratling still stared vacantly at the doorway within
which the pretty sprite had disappeared.</p>
        <p>Evidently the great, rude soldier was the victim of the winning,
<pb id="dupre51" n="51"/>
merry eyes and sunny smiles of the meteor-like vision of beauty that
flashed so suddenly across his pathway.</p>
        <p>What was our amazement on entering the sick-room to behold the
familiar face of our late “dead” comrade, Ellison. He, too, was
startled. He drew his hand across his eyes. He rose up in bed.
He shrank back abashed. A death-like pallor overspread his face.
He had evidently been dreaming of scenes in which the chief actor
sits on his coffin while a dozen soldiers, half of them using muskets
charged with blank cartridges, that no one of them may know who
does murder, fire upon the deserter. Such executions are very frequent
in civil wars. There were northern men in southern, and Southerners
by birth in northern armies. To desert a cause which it cost so much to
uphold, and abandon an undertaking which seemed hopeless, and more
than purposeless to those who revered the Federal Union, was easy.
Multitudes were fighting against their original convictions of duty
and right, and others encountered dearest friends and kindred on
bloody battle-fields. That desertions in such a war were numberless
surprised no one, and the very greatness of their numbers rendered
severity and certainty of punishment the more necessary.</p>
        <p>No wonder Ellison shuddered. He knew that of all men Spratling
and I would be most anxious to punish one who had brought disgrace
upon our brigade. He groaned in an agony of terror. I could not
help pitying him. But the necessities of the case were inexorable.
I ordered him to rise and dress himself. He groaned and wept and
insisted it was impossible. I drew a gleaming knife and holding his
head said that if he did not obey instantly I would cut off both his
ears, and if he still refused I would order my men to fire on him.
Groaning and weeping like a pitiful baby, he crawled out of bed and
with trembling hands and quivering limbs dressed himself and sank
upon the floor exhausted by his terror.</p>
        <p>“You may rest a moment,” I said, “but you shall march thirty
miles to-day. Bushwhackers are on our track. We must take the
woods. Be cheerful; order breakfast for all of us. We will pay for
it in silver, and I think”  -  the wretch was fumbling with a pair of
crutches  -  “you can leave your crutches. You didn't take them with
you when you went to Chattanooga and back, last Tuesday.”</p>
        <p>Poor Ellison! I was sorry for him. He stared at me a moment,
and then fell over backward, shocked and swooning. I baptised his
face in whiskey, pouring a little in his open mouth, and his senses
returning, he looked vacantly around the room for a moment, and said:</p>
        <p>“I am ready. Tell me what I must do.”</p>
        <p>I repeated the suggestion as to the necessity for our immediate
departure, and ordering one of my men to hand-cuff and take charge
of Ellison, felt that the game was my own.</p>
        <p>Spratling had modestly suggested his own willingness to see that we
had an early breakfast. In social life he was unique. He talked
little and rarely laughed; but if his stories were brief, they were most
amusing, and the more, because of his profound solemnity.</p>
        <pb id="dupre52" n="52"/>
        <p>He was a fine-looking, blue-eyed, light-haired, good-natured young
fellow, six feet four inches high, of infinite pluck, enormous strength,
and perfect truthfulness. He was born and reared wholly innocent of
contamination by books, in the mountains of Tennessee, had migrated
in his early youth to Texas, and came back a soldier, twenty-eight
years old, with Granbury's brigade, in 1861, to his old home.</p>
        <p>I assented, of course, to Spratling's proposition to have breakfast
prepared for us and went out to see that no one approached, and
station a sentinel at a proper point of observation. Spratling, I
discovered, was in the little kitchen in the yard with the pretty maiden
and her mother. He was evidently pointing towards Ellison's bedroom,
and telling of the great miracle wrought, and how it was
effected, when poor Ellison heroically put aside his crutches and
walked before a persuasive musket. Bessie Starnes  -  I learned the
name soon afterward from Spratling  -  laughed so immoderately and
neglected culinary duties so sadly, that, when I drew nearer, her
mother was chiding her. Finally the good dame said, “Mr. Spratling,
if you want breakfast, you must quit spinnin' them funny yarns.
That gal thar allus was a rebel, and I aint mad about it, and now she's
clean gone daft because you tell her about the devilment you've done
and because she thinks you a game, true soldier, and not one of them
thievin' deserters like that hand-cuffed wretch sittin' at the gate thar
and aweepin' like his heart would break. I do hate the likes o' him,
and Bessie loves a brave feller.”</p>
        <p>Then the good woman suddenly checked herself and cast a most
inquisitive glance at her pretty daughter gazing steadfastly in
Spratling's honest, earnest, clear blue eves.</p>
        <p>He began to tell of the fascinations of his wild home-life on
cattle-flecked plains of Texas. Bessie listened breathlessly and so
intently that the mother's warning was unheeded, and roasting potatoes
were utterly forgotten. The mother gazed in her face again, as if to
read her inmost thoughts, and sighed. Perhaps it was because she feared
her child's fidelity to plighted troth was endangered. Evidently the
mother ascribed to the daughter the feelings which I traced and
discovered in Spratling's absent-mindedness. He had at least confessed,
for the first time, boundless admiration for a woman.</p>
        <p>The mother seemed to brood over the facts before her. She was
silent, and talked and smiled no more. What evil in her eyes
threatened her winsome child? She devoted herself the more
earnestly to accustomed tasks. She kneaded corn meal dough, adding
salt, in a poplar tray. When it was of proper consistency she made
round, flat “pones,” almost an inch and a half in the middle. These
were deposited in the midst of the fire on the hot hearthstones, and
covered with red hot hickory ashes. The bread was thus roasted.
When extracted, piping hot, it was the famous negro “ash-cake,” to
be eaten with butter and milk. Each of us ate one of these ash-cakes,
weighing half a pound, and drank a quart of milk. Broiled spareribs,
biscuits, and coffee made the breakfast perfect in a soldier's eyes.</p>
        <pb id="dupre53" n="53"/>
        <p>Bessie served us at table and I am sure that Spratling never knew
what he ate or whether he ate at all. Bessie always stood, by accident
of course, where she could look into Spratling's face, and such a feast
of love and luxuries was never spread. Spratling, a very cannibal
with his eyes, was devouring the charming girl.</p>
        <p>Hebe never moved more daintily or served at Olympic feasts with
more graceful decorum than did pretty Bessie Starnes, when gliding
noiselessly about the rude table spread for rebel scouts.</p>
        <p>Bessie we knew to be a devout rebel. The mother, when we paid
for the breakfast, in silver half dollars, was moved to confess her
devotion to the Confederacy, and ask us to call whenever it was
possible. The head of the household, in Oglethorpe County, below our
lines, when our army retreated, found it difficult to secure access to
his home. In his behalf we promised Mrs. Starnes to intervene when
we returned to the army.</p>
        <p>We left Spratling and Bessie at the gate. Spratling was holding her
hand.</p>
        <p>“Join us,” I said, when I passed him, and when going away, “at the
‘Big Spring,’ at noon to-day.”</p>
        <p>Bessie gave me an astonished, but as I thought, a grateful look,
Spratling's face was slightly flushed. I pressed Bessie's hand, and
with Ellison before me, walked away toward Cleburne's encampment.</p>
        <p>Conscious of the honest sincerity of Spratling's devotion and of the
depth and strength of his affections, I was anxious to be assured that
his love was requited. If Bessie rejected his proffered love and
fidelity, I believed he would be utterly unmanned. In any event, I
so dreaded the result that I could not refrain from asking him, when
we were alone at noon, “whether Bessie could be trusted.”</p>
        <p>He evidently divined the true meaning of this modest inquiry, and
answered:</p>
        <p>“Of course; but I must go there again as soon as you can spare me.”</p>
        <p>Each relying upon the other as confidently as upon himself, and
each having often imperiled his life that the other might live ;
inseparable as Spratling and I had been from the hour that Jefferson
Davis lighted the match at Fort Sumter that set a nation aflame; made
friends by common toils and dangers and by indestructible confidence;
still  Spratling never alluded to Mamie Hughes, and the word “Bessie”
never passed my lips. I recognized the sanctity that invested the
name in Spratling's eyes, and he knew that woman alone may enter
the gate-way to that garden of the affections in which the sensitive
love-plant blossoms and bears most delicious fruit.</p>
        <p>Anticipating somewhat the order of events, it is proper to state that
Ellison, our prisoner, was tried by a drum-head court-martial for
desertion, and properly acquitted. He had been left sick in bed in
the enemy's lines, and was never a deserter. He returned to his
place in the ranks, and there was no better soldier from that day forth
than Ellison. He lived, it is true, in a sort of trance, was always
<pb id="dupre54" n="54"/>
silent and abstracted, obeying orders mechanically. Some weeks after
his acquittal and after events here recited occurred, Spratling was
sitting beside me in our tent, in front of General Granbury's, when
Ellison, with his accustomed anxious, feverish look, passed us
very hurriedly.</p>
        <p>Spratling, pointing towards him, said:</p>
        <p>“I am sorry for that poor fellow, and for myself that I aided in
arresting and frightening him. True, we secured testimony that saved
his life, but I sometimes think that we caused him to become the silent,
nervous hypochondriac that he is, and then, do you know that he loved
Bessie Starnes to madness. He thinks I robbed him of her love. I
will tell him everything, some day.”</p>
        <p>There was infinite sadness, to be accounted for hereafter, in
Spratling's low, melancholy tones when the last sentence fell from his
lips. I had heard of the deep shadow that fell across the sunshine that
once lighted up with gladness his eyes and face, and warmed his
generous, loving heart.</p>

        </argument>
        <p>To discover agencies employed in effecting escapes by deserters, was
eminently desirable. Within the hour that the exit of a fugitive from
our army was discovered, his capture, we had learned, was impossible.
He seemed spirited away. There was a mystery about it that excited
keen inquiry and not a little anxiety among our commanders. I was
instructed to put a period, if possible, to the process and resort to any
means I might approve and employ any force required. I repaired at
once to General Cleburne, who was my personal friend, and said to
him that the easiest and surest, if most dangerous, mode of ascertaining
the facts would be found by my own desertion. He approved the
proposition, and, General Johnston assenting, I selected Doc Nooe,
or Noah, a Kentuckian, as the sharer of my toils and of the hazards
of the undertaking. He knew leading men in many portions of the
Dark and Bloody Ground, as Spratling did not, and when questioned
in reference to people or localities, would commit no blunders. He
had been two years a citizen of Texas, and I knew him thoroughly.
He was courageous, honest, and a devout believer in the justice of the
Confederate cause. He loved the excitement of battle and was
thoroughly tired of idleness in winter quarters. If arrested, he was
to be the tale-bearer to account for our flight and assure our captors
that our sole purpose was to return to our old homes and kindred in
Kentucky. But for this, I would perhaps have preferred Spratling as
my coadjutor in this scheme of desperate hazard.</p>
        <pb id="dupre56" n="56"/>
        <p>With these general plans defined, Nooe and I left our lines about
day-dawn. Even before sunrise, while moving rapidly along a little
path leading toward Chattanooga and passing between Villanow and
Ringgold Gap, we were hailed by a watcher in a thicket by the roadside.
We stated at once the purpose of our flight. There was no
danger incurred. If our captors were Confederates, we would be
taken to Cleburne's or Johnston's headquarters and tried, convicted,
and shot  -  with blank cartridges. If our captors were Federal scouts,
we were certainly safe if our statements were accepted as truthful.
We were hastily questioned and such was the overweening confidence
of the common soldier of the North in the supreme, palpable justice
of his cause that he never doubted when even hardened, fighting
rebels pretended to approve it. In the loyalists' eyes it was almost
impossible for a Kentuckian to be disloyal. There were genuine
adherents, it was supposed, of Davis, Yancey, Ben Hill, and Bob
Toombs, away down south, but very few, it was thought, in Kentucky
and Tennessee.</p>
        <p>At the rendezvous of Federal scouts and of bushwhackers not far
away, to which we were hurried, we were rigidly questioned. A
dozen men stood around and listened, intently scanning our faces.
The sun was above the horizon, but its direct rays did not illumine
our resting place till it was high in the heavens. In the gloom of the
deep valley and beneath a great projecting stone that concealed
perfectly the cavity in the mountain-side occupied by these daring
men, we underwent this searching examination. The Kentuckian,
Nooe, never hesitated. He never once faltered. His courage and
intelligence alike were faultless. The most keen-sighted  -  and
bushwhackers were more apt to suspect the honesty of others than
Federal soldiers  -  were thoroughly satisfied of our perfect integrity.
Every kindness was shown us. Cigars, liquors, and luxuries amazed and
delighted us. We ate and drank prudently. Our lives were at
hazard. Any blunder, even the slightest, would be instantly fatal.</p>
        <p>The hiding place was wisely chosen. No visible road or path
approached it. The beaten track we followed led near and beyond
it. We bent low beneath dense undergrowth, and diverging abruptly
from the path, we found, not far away, at the head of the creep ravine,
the narrow entrance, between great stones, to the broad deep chasm
beneath the northern side of the mountain. If enemies came from
the south, occupants of the rendezvous could descend into the ravine
and escape unseen; if from the north, they could ascend the cliffs
and pursuit was almost impossible. Sentinels, at each point of
approach, were always on duty. Each week, late at night, guides,
with deserters who had been gathered in, went forth to Chattanooga.
The residence of Mrs. Shields, whose business it was to provide
deserters with food and lodging, was the last resting place of deserters
entering the Federal outposts.</p>
        <p>We remained in the bushwhackers' den forty-eight hours, when we
were consigned to the care of a guide and went directly toward the
<pb id="dupre57" n="57"/>
nearest pickets of Sherman's army. We had studied meanwhile, as
carefully as possible, the topography of the country and watched every
landmark closely, that we might make no mistake when we returned to
requite with bullets every kindness shown us by our generous,
confiding hosts.</p>
        <p>How infinitely brutal and brutalizing is war! Lying, stealing,
treason, and murder become foremost of fine arts.</p>
        <p>We arrived at Mrs. Shields' covert, with our guide, before daylight.
Her husband was absent, serving as a blacksmith, in Chattanooga. Both
were living, I am told, not many weeks ago.</p>
        <p>She was bright-eyed, shrewd, fearless, and active  -  eminently well
fitted for the position she occupied. How keenly and earnestly she
scanned our faces at breakfast! I had little to say, while Nooe
talked volubly of Kentucky and of anticipated delights that would
attend his arrival at home. He never seemed conscious of the
presence or suspicious watchfulness of the adroit, wary, fiery, little
woman. We ate ravenously and were greatly fatigued. Therefore,
we stated to our guide, that we must sleep a few hours, before the
resumption of our march, and that he might return, if he chose, to
the bushwhackers' rendezvous. He assented.</p>
        <p>We were left alone at Mrs. Shields'.</p>
        <p>During the day we discovered that in the smoke-house, pantry, and
in the loft, rich and abundant stores and supplies of all descriptions
were deposited by Federal authority, for the use of bushwhackers and
deserters. Federal picket lines were only two miles distant.</p>
        <p>Just before sunset, a little boy, when we had bidden Mrs. Shields
an affectionate <foreign lang="fr">adieu</foreign>, was assigned the needless task of leading us to
the nearest pickets. The boy was lazy and stupid. We gave him a
few small coins, and telling him we could find our way without his
assistance, induced his return.</p>
        <p>Before leaving our headquarters we had so ordered events that a
cavalry force of thirty men should come to meet us, by way of Ringgold
Gap, at a little church within ten or twelve miles of Mrs. Shields'.</p>
        <p>It was now very dark, and we soon lost our way and even feared
That we might encounter Federal soldiers at every turn of the road.
One's fancy, stimulated by reasonable apprehensions of danger and by
darkness, becomes singularly productive of causes of alarm. Great
stones and broken trees became silent, watchful horsemen, and shadows
made by clouds and uncertain moonlight, falling through tree-tops,
became ghostly wanderers, resting upon dense undergrowth along
either side of our devious pathway. Our senses were keenly alive to
the slightest impressions. Nooe detected, telling me of it in low
tones,  faint, unsteady light not far from us. We feared we had lost
our reckoning and discovered the resting place of a body of Federal
pickets.</p>
        <p>The forest was unbroken. No weary, somnolent winds, wooing sleep
in silent solitudes, wandered by to disturb death-like repose that
<pb id="dupre58" n="58"/>
rested upon the great trees and stilled the pulse-beats of the voiceless
woods.</p>
        <p>Discovering at length that the pale, uncertain came through
crevices in a wretched log hut, we approached it very slowly and very
cautiously. No sound came from within, and at length we were satisfied
that the cabin was unoccupied. The fitful light we had seen was
produced by an expiring blaze burning very low on the hearthstone.
We went about the cabin and finally called out, “Who is here?”
Again and again, when we called aloud, there was no response. We
rebuilt the fire and found every evidence of the recent and hurried
abandonment of the house. Roasted potatoes had been left on the
hearth and two tin plates and knives and forks on the table. A
blanket and mean bed-clothes were on a sort of bedstead attached to
the walls of the hut. At length we discovered blood stains on the
floor. A dead body had evidently been dragged out at the doorway.</p>
        <p>It was now midnight. There was nothing to detain us. Hunger
impelled us to take the potatoes, and we resumed our journey. The
very stillness of the forest made me whisper to Nooe:</p>
        <p>“Nature is shocked, stupefied, and silenced by witnessing the
ghastly deed done here to-day in this wretched cabin. Bushwhackers
have been here. It is their hideous work.”</p>
        <p>We passed near a little faded white church. The moon had risen
and was now shining lustrously. We could see distinctly the few
white gravestones in the church-yard, and fifty steps away, white
palings, tipped with black, enclosed many graves, and now and then
a raid pen encompassed some freshly raised hillock.</p>
        <p>“See,” I said, “even here there are newly made graves and where-ever
our footsteps lead, we soldiers are only digging graves. Mighty
armies are engaged in this mournful task. Bushwhackers and freebooters
and scouts  -  all of us  -  are now grave-diggers. I am sure,
when looking upon these freshly reared, narrow mounds over which I
have been walking every day since the spring of 1861, that blessed
mother earth, stricken with grief, always heaves a little sigh when one
of her children falls.”</p>
        <p>I had hardly spoken, when a white figure slowly rose up in the misty
moonlight out of a grave in the remotest corner of this “God's acre.”
Very slowly it came forth, as it seemed to us, out of the earth. It
Stood still a moment, as if unused to the dim shadows of the silent
night, and then glided slowly and silently, as if moved by the lazy
winds, down the declivity.</p>
        <p>It soon passed from sight.</p>
        <p>Nooe and I stood still, staring with wide open eyes in stupefied
silence in the direction the ghostly apparition had moved.</p>
        <p>“What, in God's name, is that?” he asked.</p>
        <p>“Let's follow it, and see,” I answered. The suggestion restored
manhood and excited a share of that ardor springing from the presence
of danger over which courage is delighted to triumph.</p>
        <p>We walked rapidly in the direction taken by the seeming shadow of
<pb id="dupre59" n="59"/>
death escaped from a newly made grave. As we passed the grave, we
saw that no grass had grown over its little hillock and the clods had
not been dissolved in nature's tears.</p>
        <p>“Perhaps,” I said, “somebody has been buried alive and we have
witnessed this strange resurrection.”</p>
        <p>“God knows,” answered Nooe; “I only know if I had not started
to find out, I would gladly go back.”</p>
        <p>We slackened our speed when we again caught sight of the slowly
moving figure.</p>
        <p>“Who is that?” exclaimed Nooe, in nervous, quick tones.</p>
        <p>The apparition turned and stood still. We advanced very slowly.
I could hear distinctly the beating of my oppressed heart and think
that my hair stood on end. Nooe hesitated.</p>
        <p>“Shall we go on?” he asked, in unconsciously uttered words.</p>
        <p>Desperate rather than heroic, I answered, “What, Nooe, do we
fear?”</p>
        <p>And yet in all my life, in a charge upon serried ranks of a solid
phalanx, scaling a fort's walls as leader of a forlorn-hope, or meeting a
cavalry charge, or when storming a battery, I had never been victimized
by such unseemly terror.</p>
        <p>“Surely,” I thought, “graveyards do yawn and discontented spirits,
in these troublous times, do revisit the land of the living.”</p>
        <p>We were now advancing very slowly and within ten paces of the
apparition, standing still and facing us in a narrow path hedged in by
dense thickets and overhanging tree-tops. Little, tremulous, narrow
streaks of pale moonlight, penetrating dense shadows of forest foliage,
fell upon the white-robed figure before us.</p>
        <p>In husky tones, Nooe asked:</p>
        <p>“Who  -  what are you?”</p>
        <p>There was an age of silence, deeper than that of the breathless
woods or of footfalls of the ghastly shadow before us. Like some
great sorrow or weight of intolerable grief, this death-like stillness
bore me down, and I felt that I was in the presence of a living death.</p>
        <p>The answer came at last. In low, tremulous, painful accents of
unutterable anguish, a woman's voice responded:</p>
        <p>“I am most miserable, and helpless, and heart-broken of women.”</p>
        <p>There was an interval of silence.</p>
        <p>“Why are you here, and why in that graveyard at this late hour?”
I asked.</p>
        <p>“We fled from bushwhackers in East Tennessee and only two days
ago succeeded, by the merest accident and good fortune, as we
thought, in passing through Sherman's lines. My husband was one
of a squad of Confederate soldiers ordered to execute the decree of a
court-martial at Greenville and hang an aged man who burned some
railway bridge. His neighbors and friends swore they would avenge
the ‘patriot's’ death. They resolved to kill every person who was a
participant in the taking of that old man's life. Finding that we were
nowhere safe in East Tennessee, and having been twice shot at, once
<pb id="dupre60" n="60"/>
in our own home at night, we came south. But ministers of
vengeance were on our track. The worst of bushwhackers about
Chattanooga are my old neighbors. I know them well. We were
resting at the little cabin on the roadside, on that hill there, when
three of those terrible men from Green County  -  I recognized them  - 
rode up to the door, and in my presence, shot my husband to death.</p>
        <p>“Whether this happened to-day, or yesterday, or a week ago, I
cannot tell. I know that people came, dug a shallow grave, and
buried him in a blanket, and left me here. I only woke from a trance
a little while ago, and when I looked up, I saw the gravestones about
me, and the little church on the hill, and the path that led to the
wretched cabin where we had rested a day.</p>
        <p>“I am very, very cold, and going back to the little cabin, if I can
find it. I don't know what is to become of me. I am friendless,
helpless, and alone.”</p>
        <p>The wretched woman, as we learned afterward, had been seemingly
unconscious when her husband was buried by the bushwhackers and
two or three people of the vicinity, and these had hardly finished the
irksome task of interment when a squad of Confederate cavalry was
discovered taking possession of the church. Bushwhackers and pitying
people fled, leaving the widowed woman where we first mistook her
for a disembodied spirit.</p>
        <p>The cavalrymen who frightened away the grave-diggers were the
very body of men sought for by Nooe and myself. Uncertain as we
were of the correctness of the course we had pursued through the
night, guided by moon and stars, it happened that we had deviated
very slightly from the direct route from Mrs. Shields' to the appointed
place of rendezvous at the little church.</p>
        <p>The helpless woman was to be cared for and we must move at once.
She had been subjected to so many griefs and woes of war that this
last great sorrow seemed only to invest her with a sort of dazed
insensibility to suffering, giving a marble-like hardness to her features.
She was very handsome and graceful. Her perfect self-possession and
natural kindliness and intelligence won the regard and respect of the
rudest soldiers. We “impressed” the wagon of a farmer for her us,
and at sunrise moved rapidly toward our nearest outposts The lady
was sent to General Johnston's headquarters, while with fifty cavalrymen,
having stationed a force at each point of exit, I made a descent
upon the bushwhackers' stronghold. They had been warned of danger
and fled. I found pinned securely to a tree at the entrance to their
cavernous retreat a rudely written note of which I have a copy. It is
couched in the following graceful terms:</p>
        <div2 type="notice">
          <head>“NOTISS.</head>
          <p>“Ef we ever cum across you two dam rascals and spies again you
dance on nuthin' and pul hemp like hell. We hang every Kaintuck
we ketch. But want you sweet on old Kaintuck!”</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="chapter">
          <p>Kuklux warnings, of a later period, were modeled after this graceful
<pb id="dupre61" n="61"/>
proclamation of the outraged bushwhacker. Analyzing the proclamation
I discovered that its writer was not wholly revengeful and malicious.
While I am sure, if caught by him, I would have been hanged, yet
for all that, he appreciated the joke so deftly practised by Nooe,
by means of his beautiful and heartfelt disquisitions in the
bushwhackers' den, and at the bushwhackers' feasts, pronounced upon
the delights of his “Old Kentucky Home.”</p>
          <p>The cavalry were sent to the outposts, while Nooe and I, with our
original thirteen men, hurried back to Mrs. Shields'. We reached her
hospitable dwelling before sunrise. An hour later my whole force,
except Nooe and myself, never disguising the fact that they were
rebels, were given an excellent breakfast. Mrs. Shields was a discreet
woman and knew that twelve hungry soldiers are dangerous; but when
they produced silver with which to pay for her kindness, she was coldly
hospitable. The men having breakfasted, Nooe and I entered the
gateway. Mrs. Shields stood in the door and stared at us, and then
shading her eyes with her hand from the bright sunlight, and gazing
intently in our faces, was assured of our identity. I never beheld
such an exhibition of insane rage and malevolence. She had been
restraining herself with the utmost difficulty while my men were at
the table. She was forced to listen silently to their boastful stories,
to recitals of their vaunted deeds, and to harsh criticisms upon the
vices of bushwhackers. She was full of pent-up wrath, even before
Nooe and I appeared. She was excited, too, because of denunciations
heaped, on this occasion especially, on those who murdered the East
Tennessee soldier in the hut at the little church. The young widow,
the men said, though she moved about and talked and smiled, produced
the impression that she was still asleep, having never become
conscious of her latest and greatest grief. She was in that condition,
her escort said, when they left her at army head-quarters.</p>
          <p>The pent-up fury of Mrs. Shields broke down all restraints when I
looked smilingly into her face, and asked her to give us breakfast.
Her eyes and mouth, while she stared at me, were wide open. Then she
exclaimed, in husky tones, her voice quivering with rage:</p>
          <p>“I would see you both eternally d--d, first.”</p>
          <p>She turned to the table, and while she vilified us and the “one-horse
Jeff Davis Confederacy,” she hurled plates and viands out of the back</p>
          <p>“I can feed honest, brave, rebel soldiers. That is bad enough for
a woman who was born under the old flag and means to live and die
under it, but would die a thousand deaths rather that let a pair of
sneaking, lying, rebel spies sit at my table. Oh! how you two did
love Kentucky! I thought from the first you were a pair of Texas
cattle thieves. I watched you and when you bribed that stupid boy,
Bill Callaway, to come back, I knew you were not going into Chattanooga.
I sent the first honest man that came by down to the picket lines,
to inquire whether you had gone in. I had you tracked towards
Mount Pisgah Church. I sent word to the bushwhackers' cave
<pb id="dupre62" n="62"/>
that you were coming with one hundred to capture and hang
them. They were saved by me, and you pitiful fools were out-manœuvred
by a woman. You might eat in my house if you hadn't been
such a pair of stupendous asses. Outgeneraled by one little
woman!” And peals of mocking laughter rang through the house.</p>
          <p>The men listened in amazed silence. She talked most volubly and
her keen intelligence was wrought up to vigorous action. Nobody
could long submit in silence to such a castigation as she administered.
Her eyes blazed with unaccountable fury, while she gesticulated
violently and reasoned with the precision and fierceness of a most
skillful prosecutor. Every imprecation fitted its place and there was
cunning logic in her frightfully fierce objurgations.</p>
          <p>Seeing no end to the woman's vocabulary of epithets or themes
of denunciation, I said to her that we had heard enough, and that
we came, after paying for breakfast, to take charge of supplies
deposited there by the northern army for the use of deserters and
bushwhackers.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Shields was silent. She stared at me as if bewildered. She
turned suddenly to the fire-place and seizing a half-consumed fagot
threw it violently at my head. Living coals were scattered everywhere.
She rushed out of the house, and when I went to the back door,
she had already thrust a fire-brand into a little shed attached to the
main building and filled with hay. Almost instantly the heroic little
woman, with a bundle of valuables in a large satchel and her bonnet
on her head, was standing in the road contemplating, with a degree of
satisfaction too profound for utterance, the destruction of her
comfortable home.</p>
          <p>We saved a few canvassed hams, several boxes of cheese, and a
little canned food, but the brave, earnest, patriotic blacksmith's
wife had again won a confessed victory by such a sacrifice as few men
would have dreamed of making. She was then, and may be now, for
aught I know, my mortal enemy, but she deserves a monument
prouder and loftier than many that have been reared to perpetuate the
memory of deeds infinitely less honorable and requiring infinitely less
devotion and heroism than she illustrated when applying the torch to
her own loved home.</p>
          <p>While equestrian statues and bronze and marble everywhere, in
Washington and other cities, tell of the grand achievements of men,
why may not some artist's pencil or sculptor's chisel tell posterity of
the deeds of this devoted woman, who sacrificed her wealth and all
that she cherished, contemplating the conflagration with heartfelt joy,
because she witnessed at the same moment the discomfiture of her
country's enemies.</p>
          <p>No single grand public attestation of woman's worth and patriotism,
as illustrated in the war between the States, has been carved on
monumental stone or set up in bronze or <sic corr="lined">limned</sic> by artist's pencil. But
war crowned its infernal vices and crimes by hanging an innocent
woman, a deed so foul that it overshadowed the horrible crime it
<pb id="dupre63" n="63"/>
sought to avenge. Through all ages, Mrs. Surratt's slender neck and
clenched, motherly hands will hang out in the hot sunlight, swinging
slowly round in their bundle of black rags. Her upturned, pitiful
face will never be banished from the conscience of the people.
Partial amends to woman should be made by rearing a monument to
fearless and devoted Mary Shields.</p>

        <argument>
          <p>Conservatism.  -  Bell and Douglas.  -  Andrew Johnson.  -  “Rebels”
and “Bushwhackers.”  -  Mamie Hughes and the Bushwhacker.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>Knowing that smoke and flames of the conflagration would attract
the attention of Federal pickets and scouts within a few miles of us,
we made a hasty departure, going directly towards La Fayette. When,
next morning at ten o'clock, we approached the town, a countryman,
coming out, informed us that the place was occupied by a small body
of Federal cavalry.</p>
        <p>A reconnaissance informed us that a courteous, kindly Federal soldier,
Colonel Burke, of the Tenth Ohio Cavalry, was in charge of half a
dozen Confederate ladies sent out of Nashville by Andrew Johnson,
then, I believe, Military Governor of Tennessee. A like body of
Confederates from our army head-quarters met Colonel Burke in
La Fayette, they spent the night together, danced with the ladies from
Nashville, and with all the pretty girls about La Fayette, stole the
hearts of the choicest of them, and went away to return, not long
afterward, to desolate the land with fire and sword.  Soldierly hostility
was purely political. It was never personal or social. The bushwhacker,
on the contrary, was the personal, unrelenting foeman of
every one who upheld the Confederacy. The reason was that a
secessionist's fierceness and anxiety to consolidate southern opinions
rendered him most intolerant. Before secession was accomplished,
contumely, abuse, and social exclusiveness were employed, and,
in the Gulf States, a Union man, in 1861  -  the people had been
so instructed by fierce party leaders  -  was socially ostracized and
despised. Unhappily for the conservatives of the South, their great
leaders, Bell and Douglas, the former superannuated and incapable of
exertion or usefulness when nominated for the Presidency, and the
latter, a citizen of a northern state, exercised no potency in the
South, while Yancey, Toombs, Tom and Howell Cobb, and every
<pb id="dupre65" n="65"/>
Federal office holder in the South, as instructed by Davis and Quitman,
Lamar and A. G. Brown, toiled side by side with Andrew Johnson
and Isham G. Harris to consolidate the South. Andrew Johnson was
hanged in effigy, in Memphis, by Whigs and Douglas men, in the fall
of 1860. Afterward, when each southern Federal senator vacated his
seat, and Johnson, hating Jefferson Davis, saw how infinitely
conspicuous he himself became as the solitary southern senator, withdrew
from association with his partisan friends, the adherents of
Breckenridge, Davis, and Yancey, and pronounced for the Union. Therefore,
the unmitigated abhorrence with which Johnson's personal and
political character and conduct were contemplated by secessionists, and,
therefore, the bitterness of this hostility between rebels and
bushwhackers  -  the native southern fighting Union men.</p>
        <p>Our most dangerous and fearless foemen, as scouts, were these
bushwhackers, and yet among these we found loyal personal friends,
and thoroughly honest, trustworthy gentlemen. It will be remembered
that we encountered and captured and held as a prisoner, some days,
a bushwhacker and ex-schoolmaster named Wade. After studying
his character, I released him because of his accurately truthful
statements, and in consideration of his promise to accompany Mamie
Hughes, if she sought to come south, to her father's summer country
seat, not far below Dalton and Tunnell Hill. While we were
encamped in the woods near La Fayette, Wade came boldly to my
sentry post, near the main road to Chattanooga, and asked to be
conducted into my presence. I was pleased to meet him. I really
liked the intelligent, honest, fearless Unionist, and then I was keenly
anxious to hear from Mamie Hughes. We walked down to a little
spring below the hill and there I asked impatiently:</p>
        <p>“Have you seen Mamie?”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” answered Wade, “I went to her uncle's, near Charleston,
on the Hiwassee. I pretended to be a sick East Tennessee Union
soldier. She is the epitome of all rebeldom, and while her cousins
came to hear me tell of my adventures, Mamie stood aloof. But I
remarked at breakfast, while Mamie's face was half averted  -  she was
my <hi><foreign lang="fr">vis-a-vis</foreign></hi>  -  that I had been below Chattanooga and captured and
held several days a prisoner by rebel scouts; and, my God, Captain,”
exclaimed Wade, “you should have seen the color come and go in
Mamie's sweet face. She said not a word, and soon recovering
herself, drank a little tea, and turning to see that I followed her
with my eyes, she went out.</p>
        <p>“I soon discovered an opportunity to confer with her alone. She
was now as eager to hear as she had been persistent, for two days, in
avoiding me. I was shunned, I now know, simply because I am your
public enemy; she sought me because I am your personal friend.”</p>
        <p>“I think,” I said, “you can always trust me as your friend.”</p>
        <p>“I repeated to Mamie what you said, telling her that whenever she
wished to return to her home in Georgia, I would see her safely restored
to her father's care.</p>
        <pb id="dupre66" n="66"/>
        <p>“ ‘Oh!’ she said, ‘my poor father was already no more, and I did
not know it, when I met the Captain beneath the stars and by moonlight,
and danced with him so joyously on the hill-side beyond the Tennessee.
My brother is in the Union army, a lieutenant in Colonel Cliff's
regiment, and my poor mother is alone at the farm below Chattanooga.
I must go to her and then I will be nearer’  - </p>
        <p>“She stopped; looked furtively in my face. I was watching and
listening. She was instantly silent and her cheeks were redder than
before. We were seated in a vine-clad summer house. Mamie turned
away to hide her blushes among the rose leaves. When spring-time
comes no bud will blossom there more bright or beautiful or sinless
than the faultless girl you love. I am going, if you will trust me,
because I now love Mamie as my own child, to see Mamie's mother,
and with her assent, the poor child's wishes shall be executed. Her
wretchedness, when she spoke of her mother's solitude, was measureless.
Her cousins said she ‘was always crying and always deploring
the impossibility of reaching her own home.’</p>
        <p>“But Mamie's mother doesn't know me. I must see her, with this letter
from Mamie.”</p>
        <p>I could not help taking it, and would have kissed it, if Mr. Wade had
not been looking at me.</p>
        <p>“Certainly,” I said, “I will see that you pass safely below our lines.
General Cleburne, when I tell him what I want, will get a paper from
head-quarters that will enable you to serve Mamie.”</p>
        <p>I sent a courier that night with dispatches to General Cleburne's
head-quarters, telling him, among other things, that I wanted “a pass
through the lines for Mr. Wade and for a rebel Georgia girl whom I
loved.”</p>
        <p>Wade, the noted bushwhacker, slept that night beside my camp
fire and beneath my blankets. He ate and drank with us and I am
sure there was never a more reckless, thoughtless, joyous body of men,
in either army than they who followed my fortunes and sought by
every means to please the excellent bushwhacker. He was much
older than any of us, had been a godly country pedagogue, but had
acquired many soldierly tastes and habits. He could drink mountaineers'
whiskey, told capital stories, and was an adept in Schenck's
game of poker.</p>
        <p>On the third day after his departure the courier returned with
needful instructions and orders, and with the passport for Mr. Wade
and Mamie Hughes.</p>
        <p>I was perfectly blest.</p>

        </argument>
        <p>When the passports were delivered by the courier, I called the
bushwhacker and pedagogue and silently gave him the papers. I was
dreaming of the day when I would meet Mamie Hughes, and was
never conscious of keener delight than that given by my interview,
as narrated in preceding pages, with the scholarly, modest, earnest
bushwhacker. He read my heart and was silent, that I might dream
uninterruptedly. Blissful visions were conjured up by the pedagogue's
simple recitals. His pictures were exact copies of those my fancy had
already etched a thousand times upon the clear blue sky when
proximity of danger repelled sleep, and when I watched the stars, or
discovered in white clouds, gorgeously gilded by moonbeams in
this transparent atmosphere, the fancied outlines of Mamie's sweet
face and matchless form.</p>

and inspecting his forces at Sweetwater and other points. I was
at a fat and loyal widow's house on the roadside when he and his staff
were passing. A soldier galloped by exclaiming:</p>
        <p>“ ‘General Sherman is coming!’</p>
        <p>“I went to the door, but the widow almost ran over me. She
rushed out into the midst of the highway, and there she stood
bareheaded, her red, fat face shining, as if oiled, in the brilliant
sunlight, her bosom filled by ‘two churns,’ as she mildly described
them when fattening her twins, her body thrown back and arms akimbo.
She stood with a protuberant avoirdupois of two hundred pounds squarely
<pb id="dupre68" n="68"/>
and firmly the midst of the highway The foremost of the horsemen
asked her:</p>
        <p>“ ‘What can we do for you, madam? Why do you block up the
road?’</p>
        <p>“ ‘I want to see Gineral Sherman,’ was her firm answer.</p>
        <p>“Another officer came up asking, ‘What do you want madam?’</p>
        <p>“ ‘I'm bound to see the Gineral,’ was the sturdy response.</p>
        <p>“ ‘I am his chief of staff, madam. Can't I serve you, and will you
not be good enough to leave the road that we may pass?’</p>
        <p>“ ‘I'm bound to see Gineral Sherman,’ persisted the good dame.
The front of her dress was apparently quite a foot shorter than the rear
that hardly touched the ground as she stood bending backwards with
naked arms akimbo, looking up and eagerly scanning the face of each
horseman. Her circumference, described by a cotton string around
her body  -  she had no waist  -  must have been five feet. Of course the
highway was effectively closed.</p>
        <p>“ ‘The General rode up asking, when the obstruction to his progress
had been described by an aide-de-camp:</p>
        <p>“ ‘What can I do for you, madam?’</p>
        <p>“ ‘ Is you the Gineral?’</p>
        <p>“ ‘I am. How can I serve you?’ he replied.</p>
        <p>“She walked up, and standing beside the General's horse, held the
bridle reins and began:</p>
        <p>“ ‘You see, Gineral, my old man and the three boys is in your army
afightin' agin Jeff Davis and for the old flag. I'm here a lone widder
with the two gals and the two twins, makin' a honest livin', I am; and
lo! and behold, Gineral, a lot of your soldiers keeps acomin' to see my
darters, Susan Ann and Maryer Jane, and acourtin' around here of
nights, and every time enny of 'em comes they tote away a turkey
or two tell I haint but one fat gobbler left. I've lost nigh onto
fifty turkeys, Gineral, and I'm ruinated and I don't know what's
to become of me and the gals and the two twins at these innercent
breasts.’</p>
        <p>“Here the good dame lifted up the lower end of her striped,
homespun apron and wiped first one and then the other greasy, red eye.</p>
        <p>“The General was evidently deeply affected. Natural nervous
impatience had been heightened by the endless multiplicity of just such
complaints as this preferred by the fat dame before him. He was
disgusted, even furious.</p>
        <p>“He straightened himself up, raised his plumed hat, stood in his
stirrups, and said:</p>
        <p>“ ‘Look at me, madam! Listen while I speak! In your presence
and in that of these valiant men and of the bended heavens, madam,
I here swear and pledge myself to crush out the Great Rebellion if it
costs every damned turkey gobbler south of the Ohio!!’</p>
        <p>“The General's manner was eminently and grandly theatrical,
solemn, and imposing.</p>
        <p>“The woman, with earnest, inquiring gaze, stared wonderingly for
<pb id="dupre69" n="69"/>
a moment at the General, and comprehending at last the trifling
character of her sacrifices, said, as she slowly released the bridle rein:</p>
        <p>“ ‘Gineral, I have a fat gobbler left. It is your'n. Wait tell I go
and fetch him.’</p>
        <p>“ ‘With all my heart I thank you,’ was the General's response, and
as he rode away, I heard the long, loud laughter of the rollicking staff.
One of them thoughtfully remained to get the turkey, for which the
courtesying dame, with eyes full of oily gratitude, accepted a
five-dollar greenback sent by the General.</p>
        <p>“East Tennessee,” continued the pedagogue, “is in a terrible
condition. The people are preyed upon by both armies and by
banded thieves and highwaymen that belong to neither. The morals
of the people are affected by these facts. The seat of war is the scene 
of vice as well as suffering. I think many years must elapse, and a
new generation of men and women come upon the stage, before the
South can be restored to its original condition. The worst products
of the war will remain here; the best return to their homes beyond the
Ohio. Poverty and vice and illiteracy will be dominant for many
years, and I dread peace as much as I abhor war. There is no future
in the South for men of my age, habits, tastes, and training. Demagogues,
of the revolutionary, violent sort, will win ignorant popular favor;
and prejudices and hates of this lawless period will shape results
of popular elections. Discord, violence, and vendettas will
brood fatefully over this hapless land.</p>
        <p>“I was infinitely amused, not long ago, by a little incident
illustrative of what I have been saying. You know my school was broken
up, my home and books were burned, and I was thrust into prison at
Knoxville. For what, I never knew. I was furious, and swore
vengeance, and was wreaking it right and left when I fell under the
influence of your generosity and of the tender, filial confidence and
affection and marvelous beauty of Mamie Hughes.</p>
        <p>“The story I would tell is simply this. It illustrates my lugubrious
philosophy, showing the tendency to evil of every incident of hateful,
vicious, red-handed war. One of the richest citizens of Carter County,
in Tennessee, is David Haines. His son, Landon C., is a brilliant,
facile talker, a lawyer of ability and pronounced success, and a violent,
original, “blood-drinking secessionist,” so called in allusion to the
fact that political prophets used to tell the “submissionists,” or Union
men, as you remember, that they, the prophets, would drink all the
blood to be shed in any war that would follow secession. Landon C.,
the son, is now a member of the Confederate Senate, at Richmond.
Then, too, the fortunate Mr. Haines, <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">pere</foreign></hi>, has a son-in-law in the
person of Hon. Nat G. Taylor, The old Whig congressman and eloquent
Unionist.</p>
        <p>“Thus, you will observe, the elder Haines is braced up by a pair of
capable defenders in the son and son-in-law. Therefore, when Federal
soldiers came plundering and seizing wagons, horses, and supplies
of every description, as is their wont in Carter County, Haines, senior,
<pb id="dupre70" n="70"/>
announces the fact that his son-in-law, the congressman and preacher
and orator, Taylor, has promised him ample protection and that his
property shall not be molested. Taylor's name is potent among Union
men.</p>
        <p>“When Confederate guerrillas come dashing over the hills and
hollows of Carter, robbing barn-yards and stables and smoke-houses,
then the paternal Haines, with earnest, illiterate eloquence, his white
locks streaming in the wind, tells that he is the father of the great
Confederate senator, Landon C. Haines, and that Landon made Jeff
Davis promise him immunity from these exactions levied by Confederate
soldiers. The result has been that <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">pater-familias</foreign></hi> Haines, until
recently, has been effectually guarded by the son-in-law against
Federal, and by the son against Confederate bandits. About two
weeks ago a squad of bushwhackers made a descent upon the old
gentleman's pretty farm, and were about to desolate it. He came out
and scanned their trappings closely. They gave no sign, but were
badly appareled and armed, each man to suit his fancy. Mr. Haines
concluded they were “rebels.” He began his usual pretty little
eulogium upon ‘my eloquent, high-larnt son, Landon C., is a member
of the Confederate States Senate, in Richmond, and he made Jeff
Davis promise,’ etc. The wicked bushwhackers would hear no more.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Come, boys, help yourselves,’ exclaimed their leader; ‘this is
the d--d old daddy of that howling fire-plug of hell, Landon C.
Haines. Clean out the d--d old rascal.’</p>
        <p>“Nothing visible was left. Mr. Haines loves money for its own
sake. He was almost paralyzed by the blow. I did pity his sorrows.</p>
        <p>“A few days later another squad of thieving soldiers came by.
They bore no flag or other distinguishing marks of ‘nationality.’
They rode through the gate and up to the door. Mr. Haines sat
there, eyeing them intently. He could not tell whether his unwelcome
visitors were  northern or southern.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Tell me,’ said the leader of the squad, after some trifling
conversation, ‘are you Union or rebel?’</p>
        <p>“Mr. Haines, staring vacantly at his questioner, was silent for a
moment, and then said very slowly:</p>
        <p>“ ‘I'm jess nuthin, and sense I come to think about it, I'm d-d
little of that.’</p>
        <p>“The soldier was so amused.  -  Mr. Haines is an illiterate old
gentleman  -  that he laughingly ordered his men to ‘feed their horses
and let the old man alone.’ ”</p>

        </argument>
        <p>Next morning after the grand “international” ball in La Fayette
the Federal cavalry set out to return to Chattanooga.</p>
        <p>At the same time, my diminutive force, accompanied some distance
by the East Tennessee <sic corr="schoolmaster">shoolmaster</sic> who had agreed to do no further
military service, moved toward Ringgold Gap.</p>
        <p>Late in the afternoon we were moving leisurely through the woods
two miles west from the town, Ringgold, when suddenly startled by
the appearance, not far away, of a force of Federal mounted men.
Ambulances followed them and we were amazed to discover, after a
hasty reconnaissance, that this very <sic corr="cavalcade">calvacade</sic> left La Fayette when
we did. In truth, it was the women's escort that pretended to leave
for Chattanooga. It then occurred to us that the purpose of the
Colonel leading the force was to take advantage of the flag of truce
to gather information. Secreting ourselves by the roadside till the
ambulances went by, we moved rapidly to the high hills just west of
the town of Ringgold. Satisfied that wrongful advantage was sought
to be taken of the flag of truce, we proposed, soon after night-fall, to
“stampede” the horses of the cavalry and ambulances and at least
compel the cunning Ohio colonel to return to Chattanooga on foot.
We watched the movements of the escort closely, and disposition of
their horses.</p>
        <p>The sun was going down and had just become invisible. Sitting
<pb id="dupre72" n="72"/>
on a fallen tree, smoking a cob-pipe, some little distance from my
men, I was startled by the approach of two Union soldiers  -  infantry
men  -  walking leisurely toward the spot where my men were lounging
on their blankets. I advanced on the unexpected intruders and
ordered them to halt. They failed to obey, but turned back. I
called to Spratling or Lewis for a gun. The latter ran to me saying,
in a whisper, “For God's sake, Captain, don't shoot. There is a
brigade of Federal infantry just over the hill, there!”</p>
        <p>There was no time to be lost. The two Union soldiers had not
reached the top of the hill, going to their brigade, just below on the
other side, when we were in full flight in the opposite direction.
There were half a dozen Federal pickets, now discovered for the first
time, between us and the bridge across the creek at the foot of the
hill west of Ringgold.</p>
        <p>It was now growing dark, and as my men wore Federal overcoats
we slackened our speed thinking that we would be deemed stragglers
and suffered to pass without molestation. If not, there were thirteen
bullets for not more than five or six lazy-looking German sentinels.
I passed within five paces of one of these. He simply grunted, when
he looked at me, and I heard him mutter:</p>
        <p>“Tam straeghlers!”</p>
        <p>We were now within the Federal lines and almost in the midst of the
enemy's encampment. I was never environed by such dangers, and
never, when potent causes for gravest apprehensions were discovered,
have I confessed, as on this clear, bright wintry night, a keener
sense of genuine anxiety and even of alarm. Camp fires began to
blaze everywhere. A division or corps of the Union army had
evidently just reached the place and was bivouacking for the night.</p>
        <p>Soldiers who were at Ringgold will remember the long-framed
house, with its portico and rose vines, at the west end of the bridge
across the deep creek. In the rear of this house was the kitchen and
back of that was the smoke-house; behind this was the orchard, and
then the open farm occupied the valley, extending nearly a mile to
the base of the lofty wooded hills. The deep creek winds about
through the farm in every conceivable direction. The owner of the
place, a rebel, had left it in charge of an old colored servant and his
wife. I had often stopped at the place and the good colored dame
and her husband knew me well. She addressed me as “sonny,” and
I was accustomed to praise “Mammy's” ash-cakes  -  corn-cakes roasted
in hot ashes  -  and buttermilk. I was hurrying to “Uncle Mose” and
“Mammy” for information and that I might have their advice and
assistance. Fortunate were we in first seeking the negroes' aid. “The
‘big house’ ”  -  a designation commonly applied by negroes to the
master's residence  -  “is chuck full of Yankees,” said old Mose, after
staring wildly at me for a moment.</p>
        <p>“In the name of gorramity what you doin' yere, Marse Jim?”
whispered “Mammy.”</p>
        <pb id="dupre73" n="73"/>
        <p>Her eyes protruded from her head till I could have knocked them
out with a board brought down edgewise perpendicularly. By the
bright fire-light I could discover that her sooty face had assumed an
ashen hue. She spoke in a hoarse whisper.</p>
        <p>“Marse Jim,” said the old man, “dar war some Yanks here yistiddy,
de fust dat cum. Dey knode you and I said dey had you onct and
dat you fooled 'em and got clean away wid 'em. Dey said dey was
gwine to hang you and Marse Nooe dar. Dat's what sheers dis
niggah. You must git cleer away.”</p>
        <p>“Show me the road to the mountains at once. We can't talk
now,” and old Mose led the way to the rear of the smoke-house, and
pointing across the creek and farm, told me to go.</p>
        <p>Pressing the hard hand of the old negro and telling him to say to
“Mammy” that I would soon see her again, I leaped the fence, my
men following, and we ran at the top of our speed toward the creek.
Signal guns were firing and drums beating an alarm. We could hear
the rattling of arms and movements of horses. The moon was up, and
in the cloudless sky, diffused the light of day about us. We had
emerged from the little orchard and gone two hundred yards in the
open field, each of us exerting himself to the utmost, when we heard
cavalrymen swearing, and tearing down the fence behind us. Before
they entered the field, we reached the creek, five feet deep, and its
banks eight or ten feet high. We never hesitated or looked to the right
or left. Leaping in, we were immersed to the armpits. The shock, heated
as we were by terrible exertion, almost paralyzed us. The night was
bitterly cold, and words can never describe the unutterable anguish
we experienced when, slowly scrambling up the bank with limbs
hardly obeying volition, we began again the unequal race for life.</p>
        <p>Thirty or more horsemen were in close pursuit. When they came to
the stream, the shadows of moonlight may have exaggerated its depth.
They halted and then rode up the stream to find a crossing place.
Meanwhile we were recovering our capacity for flight and moved
rapidly. The cavalrymen fired a harmless volley at us, and
then shouting triumphantly because a good ford was discovered, they
came rushing across the level field. They were within one hundred
yards when we again plunged into the creek; and within fifty yards,
again did we cross it, and again our pursuers swore furiously, and
fired wildly at us, and rode madly up and down the creek to discover
a crossing place.</p>
        <p>Our enemies were now scattered. Five or six  -  probably more  - 
crossed the stream ahead of the rest, and as we were almost out of the
clearing and just as we entered the woods, these eager horsemen rode
rapidly to prevent our access to a place of security. Spratling and I
had taken the lead in this furious flight. He was strongest and I
most agile of the scouts. As the horsemen began the ascent of the
declivity, we stopped that our whole force might encounter the
approaching pursuers. Nooe and the rest soon stood by us in the
shadow of a few trees. The reckless riders came within thirty paces
<pb id="dupre74" n="74"/>
when we fired. I don't think one of those gallant, excited riders
escaped unharmed. But we did not wait to see. We were not sure
even then that the pursuit would be abandoned and therefore hurried
through the forest up the ascent.</p>
        <p>Utterly, helplessly exhausted, we rested at last on the mountain's
summit. Weary beyond measure, our clothing frozen, and fearing,
if we kindled fires, that pursuit would be renewed, we were reduced to
the last extremity of suffering. We looked down upon endless lines of
Federal camp fires and listened to musket firing about Murdock's
Mills, south of Ringgold Gap, in the direction of Tunnel Hill. The
configuration of endless lines of armed men could be defined by means
of steady flashes of musketry and occasional explosions of field
artillery. It was a splendid exhibition, but physical anguish rendered
enjoyment of the dazzling, imposing spectacle, impossible.</p>
        <p>In desperate straits men think rapidly. How absurd, I reflected
even then, had been my threat addressed to the two Federal stragglers
an hour or two ago! how insane my vengeful little plan for the
punishment of the flag-of-truce escort for its detour made, as I had
supposed, to gather information! The Ohio Colonel knew more than I
when he moved his cavalcade into the encampment of Palmer's Corps,
sent to Ringgold Gap to compel the return of Cleburne's division
suddenly ordered to Mississippi to arrest the march of a Union
force across that state. Palmer's object was accomplished.
As I learned later, Cleburne was even that night turning backward
from Mobile and Meridian towards Atlanta and Dalton.</p>
        <p>Cold, icy winds swept over the mountain top in freezing, fitful
gusts. When we moved, our ice-incrusted clothes crackled, while our
bodies had been superheated by this desperate flight and toilsome
ascent. We were absolutely freezing to death. One of my men said, his
lips trembling and teeth chattering:</p>
        <p>“Boys, its a pity we hadn't surrendered. The devil will get us
anyhow.”</p>
        <p>We were forced to have a fire; but there was not a match that
could be ignited. We had been too often baptised. Fortunately
our cartridges were waterproof.</p>
        <p>Just then Nooe discovered the glare of a fitful light down the
mountain-side. Kendrick and I proposed to go in a body and capture
those who enjoyed the warmth of the blazing fagots or die in the
assault.</p>
        <p>Nooe said “it were wiser if only one or two went forward. If
these find everything right, they can whistle and the rest will join
them. As you two proposed that all should venture to the spot, it is
proper that you two should go forward.”</p>
        <p>I pressed Kendrick's foot with mine that he might be silent, and
assented to Nooe's plans. If there were no danger, I was to whistle
like a partridge and my comrades would come to me at once. If we
fell into the clutches of bushwhackers, of course we would die and
make no sign.</p>
        <pb id="dupre75" n="75"/>
        <p>“Kendrick,” I said, as soon as we left the scouts, “if we find
everything comfortable, let us be silent and punish the boys for
sending us helpless into hidden danger like this.”</p>
        <p>“Agreed,” answered Kendrick, while we trudged along, ice-clad,
our very bones shivering and freezing, down the steep declivity.</p>
        <p>Reckless because of mortal suffering, we looked eagerly through
crevices in the walls of a log hut and beheld a rudely clad country
jade lighting an oven from a log-heap fire on the broad hearth.
What spasms of hunger suddenly attacked me! I caught the fumes of
the baking opossum. Kendrick hastily knocked at the closed door.
I was still watching the woman. She dropped the pot-hooks upon
the oven lid and turning toward the door, asked, in a sharp, shrill,
husky voice:</p>
        <p>“Who's dat?”</p>
        <p>“Madam,” I answered, “we are two starving men. We will give
you a silver dollar for that 'possum and potatoes. Let us in. We
will not harm you. We are freezing.”</p>
        <p>Slowly and doubtingly the ignorant creature removed the bar across
the shutter and we entered, paid the woman the stipulated price, and
in less than five minutes had devoured the opossum. No more
delicious food ever delighted a hungry, weary, freezing soldier than
this <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">summum bonum</foreign></hi> of African luxuries  -  “baked 'possum and
roasted sweet 'taters.” But negroes are not singular in appreciation
of this choicest southern luxury, that most abounds where persimmon
trees flourish. When United States Senator Garland of Arkansas was
asked by an eastern gormand how an opossum should be cooked, he
answered:</p>
        <p>“The bent of my mind is that if you would boil the 'possum in
salt and pepper water until it is quite tender, and then brown it well
in an old-fashioned oven, or skillet, wherein around its body a goodly
number of potatoes are baked and browned, you would have a dish
unrivaled, and more than Oriental, and a person who could not
relish it, whether he took the 'possum hot or cold, would have no
celestial fire or music in his soul.” As to whether the 'possum is best
eaten hot or cold, the Senator confessed his inability to decide.
“Rather than miss it entirely,” he added, “I would try to eat it in
any way I could find it, and really I am of the opinion that it is
best hot or cold, according to the state it is in when I last partake
of it.”</p>
        <p>A daintier dish was never set before a king, and no sybarite ever
enjoyed the costly viands of Lucullus' table as did we this baked
opossum and potatoes.</p>
        <p>We had hardly dispatched the grateful repast when we heard the
footsteps of our comrades. They could endure mortal anguish no
longer and came to share our unknown fate. We asked them to enter,
telling the woman that she was safe and should be well rewarded
for her kindness. The poor creature, staring stupidly and
helplessly in my face, shrank, with a small yellow mop in her mouth,
<pb id="dupre76" n="76"/>
into the corner, and soon slept. Kendrick and I were well pleased
to tell of the feast that had been spread for us.</p>
        <p>“You sent us alone,” I said, “to prison or death. We avenged the
wrong by leaving you to freeze while we feasted.”</p>
        <p>We filled the fire-place with blazing logs, and Kendrick and I agreed
to take the first watch. The boys drew lots to determine who
should succeed us at midnight, and very soon profound rest dissipated
every memory of the surprises, hopes, excitement, and keen anxiety of
the memorable day and night at Ringgold Gap.</p>
        <p>Our breakfast next morning was a reproduction of the supper of
the preceding night. The good dame was surely objectionable as
a cook. She was the ignorant widow of one of those ignorant,
stupid fellows who are caressed and flattered by “great, good men,”
so called, and induced to become food for powder. The lackadaisical,
yellow creature, with streaks of yellowish snuff trickling from a filthy
mop in her mouth, said “she had heern he was kilt sumwhars in ole
Ferginny ”</p>
        <p>She sniffled a little, and taking more snuff on the mop, filled her
stained, yellow mouth and wiping supposed tears, with the corner of
her greasy, homespun apron, proceeded with melancholy slothfulness
to fry thick flitches of bacon and thinly sliced sweet potatoes, and
bake corn-bread, and boil coffee.</p>
        <p>Nine-tenths of the people of the Gulf States were preparing at this
selfsame moment just such breakfasts of these selfsame simple
materials. Our hostess was only peculiarly blest in having coffee
furnished from the haversack of one of my comrades. Further south,
rice constituted as in India, breakfasts, dinners, and suppers of an
agricultural people cut off from commercial intercourse with all nations.</p>
        <p>In the early summer of 1863, I descended the Tennessee River in a
skiff with Major Hornor, of Helena, Arkansas, from Chattanooga to
Decatur, Alabama, and thence crossed the country on foot from
Decatur to Birmingham, known as Elyton, a wretched little village,
and thence I went to Columbus, Mississippi. Even then there was
neither sugar nor coffee, and only bacon and corn-bread, on the tables
of the rural districts. The people of Northern and Central Alabama
suffered most. They had the least possible communication with the
exterior world. The women were appareled in the coarsest cotton
fabrics, woven on rude domestic looms and spun on hand wheels, such
as are only to be found to-day in collections of curious <hi rend="italics">bric-a-brac</hi>.
Salt, even at the period designated, could not be bought by the
indigent population, and when a hog or beef was slaughtered, the
people of each vicinage assembled and each took away a share that the
whole might be used before decomposition began. These poverty-stricken
districts were solidly democratic. They had been first for war,
and only very old men, women, children and deserters occupied
this broad district. Pitiful to the last degree was the
<pb id="dupre77" n="77"/>
condition of the country with its starving, rudely clad mothers and
abandoned wives and yellow-legged, unwashed, unkempt, unattended
children.</p>
        <p>I spent the night with an old man, Elisha Short, in a district of
Pickens County, Alabama, known as Bunkum. I gave him ten dollars in
Confederate currency to kill a kid. I had a little salt and we fared
sumptuously, having milk and corn-bread. Mr. Short seemed to think
the condition of the country somewhat changed, but had no definite
idea of the cause of calamities that befell him and his neighbors.
He had been told, as he said to me, that “a feller named Abe Linkhorn
had raised hell sumhows and was ruinatin' things, but he didn't
know for certain.” He had “heern of a feller what was a speakin'
round for Kongris or sunthin' tellen the peepil to secesh and he heern
they had seceshed and it looks like a hell of a bizness at this
particular time. Thar's sunthin' about the nigger in it, but as we-uns
haven't got any niggers, we don't know much about it. Everyboddy is
Demmycrats in these yere parts, end of course we could get salt and
things ef it wasn't for them Whigs and Abbylisherners.”</p>
        <p>These, substantially, were the words and sentences of the good
old man who stammered fearfully. He had been falsely educated by
party leaders and believed, till the day of his death, if he lives no
longer, that Lincoln was the author of all the woes that befell the South.</p>
        <p>The air was clear, sky cloudless, and sun shone brightly upon
housetops in the valley. Blue, spiral columns of smoke ascended, like
incense, toward heaven, from chimneys of cottages, in the beautiful
valley below, when we discovered, with a field-glass, that there were
no Federal soldiers on the south side of the mountain. Ascending
to the summit we beheld long blue lines of soldiers, like endless
serpents, winding steadily and curving with the roads over the hills
and along the valley toward Chattanooga. Palmer's spies and scouts
had informed him that Cleburne was ordered back from Meridian,
Mississippi, and Palmer, his object accomplished, was returning to his
original position, We followed him a few miles to gather in stragglers
and secure newspapers and possible valuable information.</p>
        <p>Our purpose accomplished, we went to Tunnel Hill. Here we
rested for a few days; in the meantime were ordered to report for
active service to General B. J. Hill, Provost Marshal General of
General Joseph E. Johnston's army.</p>
        <p>We served General Cleburne no more.</p>
        <p>From this time forth our toils and dangers, as we well knew, would
be incessant. General Joseph E. Johnston, among his soldiers, was
supposed to be omniscient. On the track of one there always followed
another scout, to verify or correct statements made by the first. It
was impossible to mislead the General, and nothing was surer to send
a scout to service in the ranks than any exaggeration of the importance
or number or value of facts he had ascertained. Most soldiers
<pb id="dupre78" n="78"/>
engaged in this business reported too much. They saw too much;
they risked too much; they triumphed over insuperable obstacles and
achieved results that the wily commander knew to be utterly impossible.
I do not think that General Johnston was ever fatally misled. I
was often amazed because of his possession of information which I
thought nobody besides myself could give. Therefore, I never reported
inferences for facts, and never anything that I did not know to be
absolutely true. He was never unreasonable and never exacted
impossibilities. I was ordered, when I made my first exit from our
lines, to enter those of the enemy and report their strength at a given
point. After earnest efforts to pass the Federal pickets during three
successive nights, I returned at the time fixed, to General Johnston's
head-quarters; and when I said I could not get through and gave the
reasons, the General thanked me and at once sent me on a more
dangerous mission.</p>
        <p>It is not always possible for a scout to discover the disposition or
strength of the enemy's troops. Patient watchfulness and slow,
tedious movements along deep gullies and under the shadow of fences,
crawling through briers and under-brush and crouching low when
watchful sentinels grow restive, are least painful and tedious of tasks
executed by scouts.</p>
        <p>I am satisfied that the mere proximity of an unsuspected scout affects,
unconsciously, the nerves of a sentinel. Of course the poor fellow
does not know that, if discovered, I am ready to kill him. He can
not be conscious of unseen dangers, but surely recognizes
unconsciously the presence of fate impending. He begins to move as
the scout draws nigh. The slightest sound made by a broken twig
beneath my knees and hands, as I would creep silently by, would
make the drowsy watcher start violently. Peering about him for a
time into the darkness, he would again resume his ceaseless, steady
march. Why, otherwise, do sentinels, when the stealthy, noiseless
scout approaches, at once become silent? The melody that was
chanted in low, soft tones while the sentinel was dreaming of the
pretty girl that sang it at her own northern fireside, when at length I
can almost see the color of his eyes, is heard no more, I have
never drawn near enough to one of these watching, and therefore,
nervously excited sentinels that I was not sure that he was told by
some invisible scheme of telegraphy of my presence, of my purpose,
and of imminent dangers that beset him. He whistled no more; his
lowly uttered song that he was humming was silenced; and he was
conscious surely of vague apprehensions of undiscoverable danger. In
my inmost heart I have pitied an unhappy sentinel exposed to dangers
he never measured and moved, by an instinct he did not comprehend,
to tremble when he did not know that a bullet would pierce his
brain at the very instant he discovered me. But the sentinel's death
was no more painful to him than the mode and fact of taking his
life were alike hateful to me. He would surely have killed me; therefore,
I slew him. For all that, the necessity and the fact were alike horrible.</p>
        <pb id="dupre79" n="79"/>
        <p>Henceforth we were to go on foot in pairs. We were to move by
day and night. We were to live between the picket lines of the two
armies. We were to deal with spies and scouts and bushwhackers and
loyalists. Whatever the hour at which we reached our lines to make
our reports, we were arrested and taken under guard to the provost
marshal of the army and thence to General Johnston's head-quarters.</p>
        <p>It happened on one occasion that one of my comrades was shot and
killed, and his passports were secured by bushwhackers. I came
immediately to head-quarters and reported the fact. Instantly General
Johnston revoked all permits to pass the lines and every one
seeking to enter was put under guard and sent to the provost marshal.
We captured five men with forged copies of the dead scout's papers
within our lines. They were all shot by decree of a drum-head
court-martial. I was amazed to learn the next day, from a Yankee scout
I captured, that he knew the fate of the five unhappy men who attempted
to use copies of the passport that belonged to my dead comrade. He said:</p>
        <p>“Your General Johnston is a wary old fox. We thought we had a
safe and sure means of ingress and egress through your lines when we
secured perfect <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">fac similes</foreign></hi> of the paper signed by General Johnston
himself. By his instant revocation of all passports, and thus, the
capture and examination at head-quarters of all persons entering your
lines, five ardent bushwhackers lost their lives.”</p>
        <p>Our picket lines were quite nine miles from Dalton, and many
nights, walking this distance when the whole army slept, have I
wished that I were reduced to the ranks. Weary and footsore I
trudged, buoyed up by the hope that the intelligence I bore would
serve or save the Confederate army. There was, however, a degree
of fascination in risks constantly hazarded, and in this life of
constant excitement, that made it inexpressibly fascinating.</p>
        <p>Then, too, I was conscious that in the ranks, subjected to rigid
discipline, and compelled to answer at roll-call, I could never achieve
the leading purpose of my life, of which I dreamed day and night.
The hour was drawing nigh when, if the good schoolmaster could
execute his designs, I would meet Mamie Hughes and when, with her
guide, she would be entrusted for a time to my guardianship.</p>
        <p>General Johnston, when giving me orders and instructions late at
night, said:</p>
        <p>“You are the eyes and ears of my army.”</p>
        <p>I answered:</p>
        <p>“My eyes will do perhaps, but I hope my ears are not big enough to
provoke the suggestion.”</p>
        <p>The General smiled good naturedly, and I said,  -  and I could not
help blushing frightfully,  -  “General, I want to get a young lady
through the lines to her mother's, below Tunnel Hill.”</p>
        <p>“Is she of kin to you?”</p>
        <p>“No, sir.”</p>
        <p>“What, then, is your reason for this evident anxiety on your part?”
<pb id="dupre80" n="80"/>
Turning away, that he might not scan my face so intently with his
keen, clear, kindly eyes, I said:</p>
        <p>“If you have a moment's leisure, General, I'll tell the whole story.”</p>
        <p>His elbow rested upon the little, low, pine table before him, strewn
with papers. His hand supported his massive head, and while a
smile, half incredulous and half sympathetic, played about his face,
he listened to the story of my love.</p>
        <p>When I had recounted incidents of the dance by moonlight on the
banks of the Tennessee and of our flight across Sequatchie Valley
into the Cumberland Mountains, I told the story of the old scold and
of her immersion by Spratling in the barrel-churn. The General
could not contain himself, and forgetting, for the moment, the great
burden of anxieties that weighed him down, he laughed till his sleeping
staff aroused by the extraordinary incident, came to inquire what
had happened.</p>
        <p>I briefly told of the ex-bushwhacker Mr. Wade, and of the pass I
wanted for him. My requests were granted with instructions to guide
me for the ensuing week, when, saying, “I will always be grateful,
General,” I tipped my cap and bowed myself, at two o'clock in the
morning, out of his presence.</p>

        <p>I had passed out of the lines, and with Spratling, awaited at the
rendezvous, near La Fayette, the coming of Mr. Wade, the ex-bushwhacker
and pedagogue. He reached our encampment at ten o'clock on the
day fixed for our meeting. When I greeted him, extending my right,
I held up the left hand, proffering the passport of General
Joseph E. Johnston. I am sure the generous, good man never
confessed in eyes and face a keener pleasure. His life had been
devoted to the service of others. He was now a homeless wanderer.
Incapable of any task save such as life-long schoolmasters assume and
deprived of the privilege of waging war against the Confederacy, he
was even grateful for that of serving Mamie and myself, and infinitely
grateful for the confidence reposed in his truthfulness, integrity, and
courage. When I gave him the passport, he said he had seen Mamie's
mother, delivered Mamie's letter, and after spending a day and night
beneath the roof of Mamie's hospitable home, conceived it his duty to
fulfill, speedily and faithfully, promises given the mother and daughter.</p>
        <p>“If not arrested and detained in the Federal lines at Charleston or
its vicinity, I will meet you,” he said, “three weeks hence at the old
camping place near Tunnel Hill. I have no pass for Mamie granted
by General Sherman's Provost Marshal, and if I find it difficult to
secure or the task tedious, Mamie does not lack courage, and as a lad of
fifteen years would gladly and naturally follow these gray hairs. I am so
well known among the soldiers and officers at the Hiwassee bridge
that I am sure I will encounter little hazard and that I can come
south with Mamie having no other 'permit' than that which I have been
accustomed to use. The worst that can happen will be the return to
Mamie's present home on the north side of the river. Then she
<pb id="dupre82" n="82"/>
must enact the role of a country boy and we will come down safely
through that great, empty arm of the primeval sea now known as
Sequatchie Valley. You crossed it, without a vessel and at night and
dry shod, not very long ago, but the time was, at some remote period in
the world's history, when mightiest ships could have floated serenely on
the bosom of its fathomless waters. A little creek drains it to day.
This stream I have followed from its source, gathering old, very old
sea shells on its banks and counting deep, long, and parallel fissures
worn by the ocean waves far up the mountain sides that hedge in this
marvelous Sequatchie Valley. In studying this sublime history of a
mighty sea, walled in on every hand, receiving great tributary streams
through Cumberland and other Gaps, overspreading the district known
as East Tennessee, and discharging its superabundant floods, in
the olden eternity of the past, through Sequatchie Valley, she will
confess the keenest and most intelligent interest. Then Sequatchie
Valley was a Straits of Gibraltar at the entrance to another
Mediterranean. In studying these marvelous pages of God's greatest
Book  -  Nature  -  Mamie will forget dangers and fatigue and forget,
now and then, that she ever danced with you by moonlight on the banks of
the turbulent Tennessee. I have wandered again and again through this
deep, broad valley, an ancient river's bed, and am sure I can escape
from East Tennessee into Georgia by following it along the mountain's
base or summit. I know the simple, honest mountaineers and no
picket lines or armies can close countless paths along which they will
guide me even to this very spot. Mamie's youthful vigor, her life in
the open air, her eager anxiety to return to her widowed mother and
to”  -  here the kindly pedagogue hesitated and looked furtively into
my face, while I could see cunning smiles dancing hornpipes in his
merry eyes  -  “to soothe her sorrows,” he continued, “would enable
her to withstand the fatigues and dangers of the toilsome, tedious
journey.</p>
        <p>“The climate of this mountainous region, where the sea itself was
once bathed in sunlight, is faultless. It begets buoyancy of heart and
spirit; and consciousness of existence, in this blessed valley, is an
undefinable, delicious joy. The skies are roseate with eternal sunshine.
The atmosphere, bereft of moisture by mountains on every hand, is so
crystalline that distance fails, by half, as elsewhere, to lessen objects
of vision. The sun rises in cloudless, gorgeous splendor and sets in a
sea of golden glory. No shadow of cloud veils its glowing disc. The
moon is wafted by night over an inverted, starry ocean, and glows with
a brilliancy elsewhere unknown. The stars are blazing electric lights
to illumine God's dwelling place and pathway.</p>
        <p>“In a coming age, when peace and unity are restored, men and
women will dwell here whose tastes and intelligence will be shaped by
grand physical facts and aspects of nature about them, and the
grandest race on God's footstool will dwell in Sequatchie Valley.</p>
        <p>“Pardon my enthusiasm. I love East Tennessee, the land of my
birth. I only wish to assure you that you need have no fears. Mamie
<pb id="dupre83" n="83"/>
has been climbing the hills, rowing a boat, learning how to use a
repeater, and riding horses for months. Recently her industry, since
she proposed to make the journey on foot to Tunnel Hill, has been
redoubled, and I am persuaded that, when she reaches this place, she
will be eager to join in one of your hazardous incursions into the
Federal lines.</p>
        <p>“And yet when I was leaving Mamie, she came and kissed my
wrinkled brow and said that my face and conduct and the stories I
told always inculcated the lesson which she had learned to lisp in
childhood:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“ ‘Naked on parents' knees, a new-born child,</l>
          <l>Weeping thou sat'st when all around thee smiled.</l>
          <l>So live that, sinking to thy last long sleep,</l>
          <l>Thou then canst smile while all around thee weep.’</l>
        </lg>
        <p>“She has perfect health, and if a Mohammedan, instead of a
Christian, would be pronounced horribly fanatical. Of fear she never
knew an emotion, and is only timidly modest. Dismiss all anxiety.
She will meet you in three weeks at Tunnel Hill. I was reading to
Mamie the verse which tells that</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“ ‘Brutes find out where their talents lie;</l>
          <l>A bear will not attempt to fly;</l>
          <l>A foundered horse will oft debate,</l>
          <l>Before he tries a five-barred gate;</l>
          <l>A dog by instinct turns aside,</l>
          <l>Who sees the ditch too deep and wide;</l>
          <l>But man we find the only creature</l>
          <l>Who, led by folly, combats nature;</l>
          <l>And when he loudly cries, forbear,</l>
          <l>With obstinacy fixes there;</l>
          <l>And where his genius least inclines,</l>
          <l>Absurdly bends his whole designs.’</l>
        </lg>
        <p>“She looked up when I closed the little volume in which the stanza
was pasted, and asked if I sought to convey a lesson for her to study.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Do I propose,’ she asked, ‘ “to combat nature” when I would
ride the most unmanageable horse? My sex cannot vote, and yet I
read with keenest interest discussions of political questions. I am
taxed; I toil to add to public wealth; and yet I must fill only the
meanest places in industrial life. We are paid less than men for the
same and better service in public schools. We are used as nurses, but
reviled as physicians. Barbarous codes of one thousand years ago,
enacted by opinion and custom when men were mere fighting brutes
and shaped the blessed Common Law, still fix the position and define
the rights of my sex. Kept in ignorance, the calamity repeats itself
forever; and womanly ignorance and weakness refuse to demand
woman's emancipation. I never felt the burden of fetters I wear as a
woman till I wished to assert myself and, guarding myself and defying
danger, return to my home in Georgia. “Brutes,” as the poet tells,
“find out where their talents lie;” but women are not suffered to
<pb id="dupre84" n="84"/>
have talents. They can aspire to nothing higher or nobler or more
useful than offices of washerwoman and housekeeper for despotic
husbands who come home from ballot-boxes and public meetings for
food we must cook and clothes we must cleanse. We are not even
supposed to know why war rages or what you insane, selfish, wicked
men are fighting about. My conviction is that the main cause of the
measureless calamity is found in the fact that surfeited flies, feasting
through forty years upon public pap, have been brushed away that
another swarm, starved through nearly half a century, may prey upon
the people. I have observed that every Federal office-holder ejected
by Lincoln's election was instantly a howling, hooting secessionist.
He set his neighbors, family, and friends in an uproar, and by sheer
violence silenced opposition to the frenzied place-hunters. But isn't
it singular that women, knowing nothing of questions involved and
the least possible of results to follow, are most violent and earnest
partisans either of the South or of the North. I can't help it,’ said
Mamie, ‘but I do wish we women were differently educated and
reared with higher and nobler purposes, and imbued with nobler
convictions and loftier aims than those now hedging in our unworthy
aspirations.</p>
        <p>“ ‘When I was nearly fifteen years old, standing before the mirror at
my sick mother's bedside, she was telling me of the terrors of this
horrible inter-state war “precipitated by him who madly fired the gun
at Sumter that set the continent aflame.” “There are terrible days
coming,” said my mother. “Why do you weep?” I asked. Her
answer was, “Because you are not my son rather than my daughter.”
I, too, wept. And every tear we shed was illustrative of the terrors
of a code which has fixed the status and defined a sphere of inferior
action for my sex from the Dark Ages even to this good hour. We
have become at last separate property holders. We can testify in
courts. We are at last, as wives, separable in matters of property from
the man. We could not enter literary colleges or medical schools, but
nearly all these are open to us at last. We have found access to the
pulpit and bar, and our worth and equality and keenness of perception
and skill in art and in the professions are confessed. We are advancing
steadily and will be finally invested with every privilege of
citizenship. The right will finally triumph, and mothers will weep
no more that daughters are not sons.’</p>
        <p>“Such was the substance, captain,” said the schoolmaster, “of
Mamie's earnest, vigorous speech made to me as her audience. I was
delighted, because I believe as she does; and let me tell you, captain,
that the exigencies of this war have stirred many an idle intellect to
its profoundest depths. Even that little sweetheart of yours becomes
a philosopher, dealing with questions of state-craft. She said to me
one morning, and I don't understand it all yet, that the South pretended
to fight because it couldn't take negroes to Kansas where nobody could
or would have a slave, free labor being cheaper than that of slaves.
Then she said:</p>
        <pb id="dupre85" n="85"/>
        <p>“ ‘Within a life-time, after slavery is no more, the South will never
believe that it ever approved the institution, and he will be execrated
who asserts that the South fought that Mr. Toombs might “call the roll
of his slaves,” as he prophesied, “on Bunker Hill,” or even in Georgia.
The negro, like my sex, has almost reached the proper period of
preparation, and slow emancipation was coming, even if the bayonet
had not intervened.’</p>
        <p>“General Cleburne,” said Mr. Wade, “and the ablest officers in
your army illustrate the force and accuracy of this girl's reasoning.
They propose, even now, to convert slaves into soldiers, making
faithful soldierly service the price of negro freedom. I am told that
politicians who became generals, except Cleburne, oppose, but the
greater number of officers and men approve the proposition. A
soldier is only a breathing machine. One perfectly disciplined
human creature is as valuable as another. Confessing this fact,
soldiers of the South do not object to the imposition of a share of
their toils and dangers upon these slaves. But Jefferson Davis, it is
said, objects, and negroes may not be suffered, like other races, to
fight for their own freedom.</p>

        </argument>
        <p>Spratling, I well knew, was anxious to revisit the home of Bessie
Starnes, the pretty, black-eyed mountaineer's daughter, who half
promised and half refused to love him. It was part of my duty to learn
whether the Federal army corps, encamped not far from Bessie's
home, had changed its position. Spratling, advised of every order
I was required to execute, gladly agreed to go alone and ascertain the
facts, assuring me that Bessie would tell him everything that had
occurred in that vicinity.</p>
        <p>“Oh! she is bright-eyed and cunning and silent,” said Spratling.
She told me, when I was coming away, that she often learned what
I was most anxious to know. Bessie listens intently when Federal
officers breakfast with the pretty, black-eyed, laughter-loving
mountain lassie. She asks how long they will remain where they are,
‘because she will be so idle and lonely when gallant men and officers
leave the neighborhood.’ She told me she would have a ‘big lot of
news to tell me’ when I came back. Very many Union soldiers, of
different Tennessee regiments, went from Bessie's neighborhood.
These constantly revisit their homes and tell the seemingly careless,
but curious girl all they know. She knows the strength of each
Tennessee regiment and brigade, and who commands, and where they
are encamped. She corresponds constantly with a young Georgian
in Cliff's Tennessee ‘loyal’ regiment. The truth is, I think he is my
rival; and if the fortunes of war so ordered, I would not <sic>not</sic> weep if
his career were brief and brilliant. I have thought, when Bessie was
gazing abstractedly in my face and when she was evidently measuring
<pb id="dupre87" n="87"/>
my virtues and worth, that she was weighing these against the
admirable qualities of heart and person that distinguish, as she told me,
the young Georgian in the Union army. But despite her possible love
for him, she will be true to me as a rebel. Her sympathies are wholly
with the South.”</p>
        <p>The gigantic Spratling soon left us, moving down the long slope of
the rocky hill-side with an elasticity in his movements and healthful
vigor in his gigantic body and limbs that compelled us to watch and
admire, as he went bounding rapidly down the declivity. His footsteps
were hastened by anxiety to listen once more to the rich tones of
Bessie's musical voice and gaze in the fathomless depths of her
fascinating, brilliant eyes; and perhaps he dreamed of dewy, pouting
lips he had never kissed.</p>
        <p>When Spratling had disappeared, Mr. Wade said to me that he had
a newspaper containing an absurd and inaccurate and untruthful
account of the shooting of the Confederate raider, General John H.
Morgan.</p>
        <p>“I was in Greenville when Gillem's command made its descent
upon the place. Gillem himself did not know that Morgan was in
the village. He was advised, which was true, that Morgan had gone
to Abingdon, Virginia, to see his wife, who had just become a mother.
But Morgan hastened back to Greenville, for reasons that became
apparent when we secured his private and official papers, even the
letters from his very passionately devoted wife.</p>
        <p>“Morgan made no secret of his purpose to attack Gillem. In fact
he was reduced to the necessity of executing at once some brilliant
stroke of heroism or of retiring in disgrace from the Confederate
service. His exactions, levied alike upon friend and foe, and outrages,
practised even upon rebels or upon the wives and children of Confederate
soldiers, forced General Echols to order him to transfer his
authority to his next in command. Morgan resolved to fight, and if
possible, destroy Gillem, and thus win such <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">eclat</foreign></hi> that Echols would be
compelled to revoke this order. Unhappily for Morgan, he was
induced to spend a night at the elegant home of his aide-de-camp,
Major Williams, whose widowed mother resides in Greenville. Cards,
wine, and most accomplished women  -  one of these, Miss N. N. Scott,
a <sic corr="granddaughter">grandaughter</sic> of H. L. White, Andrew Jackson's great rival  -  made
sleep, till a late hour, impossible.</p>
        <p>“About sunrise, Mrs. Williams, finding her home surrounded by
East Tennessee Union soldiers led by Colonel John B. Brownlow and
Others, hurried to Morgan's room. She knocked. He awoke and
came in his night clothes to learn that he must fly or be put to death.</p>
        <p>“ ‘These men will not spare you,’ she said. ‘I hear them, even
now, threatening to burn my home. They have learned that you are here.’</p>
        <p>“<sic corr="Mrs.">Mrs</sic> Williams told me all this,” said Mr. Wade.</p>
        <p>“Morgan hastily drew on his pantaloons, and leaving his coat and
vest, the former having on the collar the insignia of his rank, ran
<pb id="dupre88" n="88"/>
down stairs and out through the back door and down the high, broad
steps that led into a garden and vineyard in the rear of the building.</p>
        <p>“Meanwhile, Major Williams, instead of following Morgan to the
small, frame church under which Morgan proposed to conceal himself
and thence escape into the woods not far away,  -  the church was quite
fifty or sixty yards from the residence,  -  took refuge under the steps
which Morgan descended into the vineyard. A good-natured dog's
family here had their bed of sticks and straw. Williams, almost
suffocated by the process, covered himself with the dog's bed, remaining
there till ten or eleven o'clock, when the Union soldiers left the
yard. Then he crawled into an empty cistern, and shuddered when
a Union soldier walked over it, saying, as he lifted the cover and
looked down into the darkness, that he would ‘get a squad to fire into
that d--d hole; it may be half full of thieving Morgan's men.’</p>
        <p>“Williams deeming the place unhealthy,” continued the pedagogue,
“crept out and, entering the kitchen, was concealed by his ‘black
mammy,’ the fat queen of the kitchen, beneath the floor. Meanwhile,
Brownlow's soldiers captured Captain Clay,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1">*</ref> grandson of the matchless
popular leader, Henry Clay, of Kentucky. From him I learned many
facts which I now recite.</p>
        <p>“General Morgan was seen, when approaching the rear of the
church, by one of Colonel Brownlow's men and forced to return
towards Mrs. Williams' residence. He had retraced half the distance
to the house and was in the little vineyard, the vines waist high,
when Andrew Campbell, a private, on the outside of the enclosure,
fired upon Morgan, who was moving rapidly. Morgan fell, dying
instantly. Members of Mrs. Williams' household at once made the
fact known to our soldiers that the great guerrilla was slain.
Meanwhile, many of Colonel Brownlow's men,  -  the brigade was an East
Tennessee organization,  -  having unrestrained access to the whiskey
shops of the town, were half drunken. Morgan's dead body, still
bleeding,  -  the blood issuing from the orifice made by the musket ball
in his back,  -  was taken from the garden by Captain Northington,
placed across the bow of his saddle, and thus borne on horse-back
through the streets of Greenville. This was done that the people and
soldiers might know that the terrible raider and plunderer was dead.</p>
        <p>“Morgan may have been a better man than they deemed him, but
he was abhorred, as a lawless robber, ruffian, and heartless freebooter,
by the common people of East Tennessee. Horrible stories were told
of his brutalities and crimes, and whether well founded or not, it is
certainly true that his alleged lawless deeds caused the promulgation
of the order depriving him of his command, which we found among
his papers in Mrs. Williams' house.</p>
        <p>“It is proper to say that General Gillem was of obscure origin. His
mother was keeper of an apple-stand in Grainesborough, Jackson
County, East Tennessee. He was the protege of General Alvin
<note id="note1" n="1" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1">*Captain Clay is still living in East Tennessee.</note>
<pb id="dupre89" n="89"/>
Cullum, formerly circuit judge at Gainesborough and, later, member
of Congress. While sitting in Congress, Cullum sent Gillem to West
Point and Andrew Johnson, because Gillem was an East <sic corr="Tennessean">Tennesseean</sic>,
caused him to be transferred from a quarter-master's to a brigadier
general's position. Gillem's nomination was still unconfirmed by
the Senate when his command moved upon Greenville.</p>
        <p>“Gillem, when Colonels Brownlow, Miller, and Ingerton urged him
to attack Morgan's command in Greenville, when they supposed
Morgan to be in Abingdon, refused to do so. He finally agreed
that the attack might be made. When his subordinate officers
mentioned moved upon the place through a pitiless and <sic corr="ceaseless">ceasless</sic>
rain-storm, marching at night over the worst possible roads, to attack
a force twice as strong as their own, Gillem said to Brownlow that
it was ‘a d--d wild goose chase and he would have nothing to
do with it.’</p>
        <p>“Brownlow answered, ‘If we don't attack Morgan, we know he
means to attack us. Then we will be surely beaten. As assailants,
we will be victorious.’</p>
        <p>“But Gillem refused at last to participate in the assault upon
Greenville, remaining several miles away at a country farmhouse. When
he came into Greenville he encountered Colonel Brownlow who had
pursued Morgan's flying men more than five miles toward Jonesboro'
and returned to Greenville.</p>
        <p>“Brownlow said to Gillem, ‘We have killed General Morgan.’</p>
        <p>“Gillem supposed Morgan to be in Abingdon where he was seen by
Gillem's spies. Therefore, he believed that Brownlow was jesting.</p>
        <p>“ ‘There,’ said Brownlow, ‘is Captain Clay, of General Morgan's
staff. Let me introduce you. He will confirm my statements.’</p>
        <p>“Gillem was amazed and the more delighted. The United States
Senate had recently refused to confirm his nomination as brigadier
general. He knew that this sublime luck, in the achievement of
which he had not the slightest agency, assured his confirmation.”</p>
        <p>Gillem was not mistaken. The taking off of the rebel raider
made Gillem a major general and, after peace, a colonel in the
regular army. He will be remembered for the defeat he suffered in
the lava beds at the hands of the red warrior Captain Jack.</p>
        <p>It should be stated perhaps, in connection with this recital of facts
by the ex-bushwhacker, that it may be colored somewhat by his
prejudices, but he could have no selfish motive impelling him to do
injustice to Gillem who was loaded, it seems, with honors for a deed
of which he was wholly innocent. Even so of a woman who left
Mrs. Williams' house the evening that Morgan arrived. She, or
others for her, caused the story to go abroad that she went to Gillem's
head-quarters that night and telling him that Morgan, unguarded,
slept at Mrs. Williams' house, induced Gillem to assail the town.
Nothing is further from the truth.</p>
        <p>Colonels Brownlow, Miller, and Ingerton did induce Gillem to
assent to the assault upon Morgan's greater force than their own, but
the argument they made, as already given, was that, in Morgan's
<pb id="dupre90" n="90"/>
absence, his command would be much more easily discomfited,
and they knew that Morgan or they themselves must be beaten.
Their only security rested in an offensive, aggressive campaign.
But Gillem shrank from it and at the last moment stood aloof,
and neither conceived nor proposed nor executed and only assented
to the plans of his subordinates, Colonels Brownlow, Miller, and
Ingerton.</p>
        <p>“It may be proper to say,” added the schoolmaster, “that special
credit is due Captains Wilcox and Northington who commanded the
squad of 50 men that surrounded Mrs. Williams' residence and
prevented the escape of Morgan and his staff. Major Newell,
commanding about 100 of the Tenth Michigan Cavalry, actively
co-operated in the assault upon Morgan's 2200 men, our whole
force numbering 1100.</p>
        <p>“I wish to add that, for the first time in this unhappy war, a surgeon,
A. E. Gibson, here distinguished himself by acts of personal valor.
He brought down his man with a musket instead of a dissecting
Knife; and then, when the fighting was done, was as generous and
kindly to prisoners he captured as to the soldiers of his own (Colonel
John B. Brownlow's) regiment. By the way, I have a theory that
doctors, as well as poets, are born not made. Dr. Frank A. Ramsay,
of Knoxville, would have been the first pathologist of the age if he
had never read a book or managed countless hospitals or sat through
all the years of his busy life at bedsides of the sick and dying. He
reads one's disease when he reads his face, and ministers to that of
mind or body with matchless art.”</p>
        <p>The schoolmaster and I were resting on blankets near a fire that
burned against the body of a great fallen oak. We heard the clatter
of horses' hoofs at the base of the hill. Knowing  that these horsemen
would surely see the smoke and flame and inspect our resting place,
we gathered up guns and baggage and went into denser woods in the
valley below, following the course of the road that we might discover
the character and purposes of the horsemen. They proved to be
general officers of the Confederate army on a tour of inspection.
They were accompanied by aides-de-camp and a small body of
cavalry. Generals Bate, Walthall, Cleburne, Walker, Mercer, and
perhaps others were of the number. I was delighted to meet General
Cleburne, and as soon as I heard his voice and before I recognized his
face, ran into the road to greet him. Cleburne dismounting, grasped
my hand, and commended me, in a kindly little speech, to his
comrades, telling them how long and well I had served him as a scout.
I was pleased to see with General Bate the newspaper man who had
assisted at baptismal services on the Cumberland Mountains. He
was evidently delighted to encounter me. He said his brother John
was a private in Pinson's Mississippi Cavalry, and that he was spending
a week or two with John and with General Bate. I suggested to
the journalist the possibility of exciting adventures between the lines,
and proposed his participation in dangers of an incursion into
Tennessee. I adverted to the delightful companionship of the
<pb id="dupre91" n="91"/>
pedagogue, who spun interminable yarns, in a modest, unobtrusive
way, through days and nights by glowing camp fires. The editor was
captured, I think, by the pedagogue. He gave his horse to his brother
and even after swimming the icy Tennessee at Bridgeport, was pleased
to renew modes of life peculiar to those who never dared to sleep
beneath a roof and rarely twice within a month at the same place.
The journalist and I, after arranging for a future meeting with his
brother, and after I had given General Cleburne a hurried description
of the country and told him that he was then six miles from the
enemy's nearest outposts and twelve from his own, bade <foreign lang="fr">adieu</foreign> to
officers and men and soon joined the pedagogue at the camp fire.</p>
        <p>We moved that afternoon five miles toward Starnes' place. Starnes'
pretty daughter, it will be remembered, had fascinated Spratling when
we captured the supposed deserter Ellison. To this new encampment
Spratling was to return the next day. Here clearest, most delicious
chalybeate water gushed from between great flat stones in a deep
narrow valley, and from the summit of the high hill above the spring
we could see the road a mile along its tortuous course that led to
Chattanooga. The schoolmaster was rapidly recovering from the
effects of his toilsome journey, and the newspaper man ready for any
adventure.</p>
        <p>Making a fire of materials that would blaze little and glow in living
coals, we sat, half-reclining upon blankets, a fallen tree serving as a
pillow. Broiled bacon, hard tack, and coffee taken from Mrs.
Shields' depository of supplies constituted materials for an excellent
evening repast. This disposed of, we lighted our pipes, and the editor
and the schoolmaster began to discuss the course of public and
military events. I had given the journalist a brief sketch of Mr.
Wade's career, and in order to account for the presence of such a
man in such a place, had shown how valuable he had become.</p>
        <p>“In 1860-61,” said the journalist, “I was as devout a Unionist as
yourself, Mr. Wade. I then abhorred, even as I was taught in childhood
to hate Benedict Arnold, those who advocated the secession of
the South. It was in June, 1861, that I inserted a paragraph in the
newspaper of which I was then a youthful editor, in which I said
there was no practical difference between Jefferson Davis, a secessionist,
and Wendell Phillips, an abolitionist. In other words, I declared
secessionism and abolitionism identical in purpose and results. I was
arrested under a decree emanating from the despotic vigilance
committee, and when taken before that body, was informed by the
president, Frazer Titus, an honest, good citizen, who had gone mad
with many like him, that if the conduct of the <hi rend="italics">Daily Bulletin</hi> were
not conformed to the necessities of the Confederacy, the newspaper
should not exist. I was told that if I had not been born, reared, and
educated in the South, and if my social position were different, I
would be imprisoned and exiled. This occurred just before Tennessee
finally agreed to co-operate with the Gulf States.</p>
        <p>“What are we going to do about it?” continued the newspaper
<pb id="dupre92" n="92"/>
man. “Suppose we win this fight, which does not seem very
probable. We will have two Unions instead of one. Each, jealous
of the other, will maintain a great standing army. White people are
tired of fighting and abhor already, every fact and incident of the
war. It is stated that two-thirds of those enlisted as Confederate
soldiers since 1861 have deserted. Admitting, however, that the
South win, will it retain its winnings? Will not two Unions, if we fly
from one, be doubly intolerable? Will the people endure quadrupled
burdens of taxation? The truth is I don't see very clearly what we
are fighting for.</p>
        <p>“We are not waging war for negro property. Those owning
twenty negroes are exempt from military service. Then no father or
mother would give a son's life for all the blacks on the continent.
Then, too, negro slavery has become negro ‘servitude’ and if there
had never been an abolitionist or secessionist to keep the country in
an uproar, thus enabling them to secure offices and honors by the
consolidation of parties and sections, if the right of petition had
never been denied, the slave codes of the several southern states would
have been mollified and the process of emancipation, as Henry Clay
advised, been begun. Even with these fierce slave codes nominally
operative and now and then enforced, prohibiting the education of
negroes and subjecting them to restraints and penalties too horrible to
approve, negroes on every plantation are taught to read and write,
and in wide districts the best preachers are hired to minister to their
spiritual wants.</p>
        <p>“The negroes know what will be the result of Federal triumph in
this conflict and yet they are content to toil industriously and create
supplies in the absence of masters and overseers everywhere, for the
armies of Jefferson Davis. Luckily our wives, mothers, sisters, and
sweethearts are left at home under the guardianship of ‘servants’
and not of ‘slaves.’ The next step in African redemption should be
a modification of the Mexican system of peonage, and then should
come perfect liberty. President Lincoln entertains proper opinions
on this subject, and General Cleburne and others of our leaders
propose to give absolute freedom to those negroes who serve in our
army. Many of our general officers oppose the scheme of negro
conscription, but such multitudes of capable white men now escape by
nameless and numberless subterfuges and deserters become so innumerable,
that the negro will soon be required to do more than feed and
clothe and care for the families of these soldiers. General Cleburne
is not singular in advocating negro conscription and then negro
emancipation.</p>
        <p>“White men are weary of the toils and dangers and hardships of
these terrible campaigns and begin to think that as soldiers are veriest
slaves, so slaves should be faultless soldiers. I am persuaded that,
however the war result, the negro will be the gainer. If we win,
it will be through negro intervention as a soldier and because negroes
fed and clothed us and have taken care of our families while we
<pb id="dupre93" n="93"/>
fought. In the county in which my father, mother, and sisters live in
Eastern Mississippi there are at this hour thirty thousand negroes and
less than four thousand whites, and two-thirds of these whites are
helpless old men and women and children. I have never dreamed of
danger to befall those I love. In fact, the more perfect the liberty
given this peculiar race the stronger the development of those singular
virtues of patience and kindliness that everywhere distinguish the
African. I saw a letter in <hi rend="italics">Harpers' Weekly</hi> written in 1860 from New
Orleans, by James Harper, in which he said the planters of the South
were most anxious because of the conduct of their slaves; pruning-hooks,
scythes, axes, and all implements that might be used for
murderous purposes were carefully removed at night from the negroes'
reach and that servile insurrections were greatly dreaded. Some
knave imposed upon Mr. Harper. I have never heard man or woman
in the south refer to the negro except in kindness, and never heard a
suspicion of negro fidelity to his master suggested, and now quite one
half of our generals would gladly convert the blacks into soldiers,
giving freedom to each family whose head serves a year or falls in the
ranks.”</p>
        <p>I asked the journalist if he believed negro servitude would end if we
won victory at last.</p>
        <p>“Certainly,” he answered. “Each of the two rival Unions,
Lincoln's and Jeff Davis', must maintain great armies and fleets.
Each 'nation' will fear the other. White men are already weary of
military life, and its duties will be assumed, north and south, by
negroes. Lincoln and Davis will finally become two starveling, lean,
lank, lantern-jawed grand Turks, upheld by two grand armies of
black janizaries. Lincoln, like Andrew Johnson, is a native-born
‘plebeian,’ and Jefferson Davis an aristocrat. But whatever their
impulses or purposes, they will he helpless. The two Unions, because
of retro-active pressure, must become consolidated, costly despotisms.
Burdens of taxation will be enormous and the people, remembering
the time, prior to 1860, when we did not know, except that the
politicians howled mightily, that we had a government, will force their
masters to reconstruct the Federal Union. Therefore I could never
see any use in secession or in all this terrible fighting. The end
defined is inevitable, If the North triumph, the Union will be
restored, less slavery; if the South, the Union will be as surely
reproduced with gradual emancipation.</p>
        <p>“But there is a fight progressing. I can't stop it and I couldn't
prevent it I am only for the under dog in the fight. It is my
d--d dog,” said the journalist laughingly, while he contemplated
the smiling face of the drowsy pedagogue, who said:</p>
        <p>“I don't see that we differ widely enough to render further
discussion a necessity, and I am only led to reflect by what you have
stated, that when the disgusted, weary people of the South no longer
sing that horrible, dolorous ditty which has utterly unmanned your
soldiers and broken the spirit of your women, whose pitiful refrain is
<pb id="dupre94" n="94"/>
‘Maryland, my Maryland!’  -  when you have substituted aggressive,
vigorous popular melodies, like that which I have heard chanted by
ten thousand voices of earnest men whose heavy tread shook the earth,
while earth, air, and ocean caught the refrain, ‘Old John Brown's
soul is marching on’  -  when you have reproduced the spirit of the
army and courage of the people by showing them that there is some
grand end to be attained by fighting,  -  then, and not till then, will
Lee and Johnston win victories.</p>
        <div2 type="trailer">
          <p>NOTE.  -  In confirmation of the pedagogue's statement that General
Gillem had nought to do with the killing of General Morgan, it is stated
on page 540 of General Basil Duke's “History of Morgan's Cavalry,” that
Morgan's “body was taken from hands which defiled it by General Gillem,
as soon as that officer arrived at Greenville and sent to us under a flag
of truce. It was buried at Abingdon and afterward in Hollywood at
Richmond.” Thus it seems that Adjutant General Duke knows that General
Gillem was not at Greenville when Morgan was slain.</p>
          <p>General Duke recites the story that a daughter-in-law of Mrs. Williams
conveyed to Gillem the news that Morgan was in Greenville. In this General
D. is wholly wrong. Greenville was assailed because Morgan was supposed
to be absent, and that therefore his command would be easily routed.</p>
          <p>General Duke feelingly insists, and he knew Morgan thoroughly well, that
he was incapable of wrongs and robberies ascribed to his supposed vices
by the people of East Tennessee. But General Duke tells, as the
school-master stated, that Morgan was about to be “court-martialed”
for alleged lawless exactions imposed upon people and banks.</p>

          <p>Bessie Starnes.  -  Spratling's Story.  -  His Enormous Strength saves
his Life.  -  Two Prisoners.  -  Two Dead Scouts.  -  Spratling's
Confession.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>Spratling reached the modest log house, in which Bessie Starnes
budded into young womanhood, late in the afternoon. His habits as
a scout made him cautious and watchful. He refused to sleep in the
house, not because he feared betrayal by its inmates, but capture and
death at the hands of implacable, cunning bushwhackers. These
“loyalists” ascribed to Spratling's extraordinary physical strength the
peculiar mode of execution to which the captors of the bushwhacker,
whose neck was broken by an elastic hickory tree, had resorted. The
story went abroad that Spratling, when enraged, was capable of any
terrible act of demonism. He was hated as he was feared, and never
did one suffer more unjustly at the bar of opinion. There was never
a soldier more fearless, and never one more kindly and generous or
less capable of cruelty or injustice. He condemned the conduct of the
drunken men who broke the neck of the dastardly assassin by tying it
to the bent tree, even more harshly than I who reported the outrage
at head-quarters, that the drunken malefactors might be, as they were,
severely punished.</p>
        <p>But to Spratling's miraculous muscular strength was ascribed the
horrible deed, and he knew that assassins plotted his destruction. At
night-fall he left Starnes' house, going down into the valley. Entering
the woods, he ascended the hill and slept on its summit. When he
awoke at day dawn, seeing two men get out of a light wagon drawn
by a single horse and enter the house, he went down to the road in
front of the house. They wore pistols in their belts, having no
other visible weapons. They remained in the house perhaps half an hour,
<pb id="dupre96" n="96"/>
and came out with Bessie Starnes walking very slowly and doubtingly
between them towards the wagon. Spratling could not comprehend the
propriety or necessity for Bessie's departure, seated between two
blue-coated Federal soldiers. Presenting his repeater he stood at
the horse's head, telling the two men they were “Spratling's
prisoners. Obey me, and if you are friends of Bessie Starnes, you
shall go free; if you mean any harm to her, I'll cut your throats”</p>
        <p>The aspect of Spratling when excited and when he drew himself up
to his full height and spoke with curt fierceness was even awe-inspiring.</p>
        <p>“Come, Bessie, tell me what all this means. Drop your weapons
instantly,” he continued, addressing the two soldiers in a voice of
thunder. “Bring me those pistols, Bessie. Your friends are in no
danger; but I am while they are armed. I don't understand this
proceeding, and because I love you and I see your mother wringing
her hands and crying in the house, I don't intend to let you go away
till I know why you go.”</p>
        <p>The two men had dropped their pistols and Bessie stood motionless,
staring vacantly in Spratling's face. There was no time for any
discussion of the facts. With a cocked repeater in each hand Spratling
advanced toward her. Ordering the men to stand aside, he secured
the weapons, made the men mount into the wagon while he held
the horse, and conferred with Bessie. Spratling reciting the
facts afterward, said:</p>
        <p>“I had heard Bessie speak of several Federal officers from Chattanooga
who had visited her. She had often adverted to a quarter-master
whose marked and persistent demonstrations of love and admiration
annoyed and even offended her. He made Bessie costly presents,
she loved finery only too well and could not repel the generous
‘major’ as decisively as she should have done. The ‘major’ had
learned at last that Charley Hughes, a lieutenant in Colonel Cliff's
Union regiment, was desperately enamored of Bessie and that she
lavished upon Charley all the wealth of her boundless love. Once
when this quarter-master was at Starnes' house, while Bessie was in
the kitchen, the quarter-master discovered in Bessie's table drawer a
package of well-worn letters. He hastily read one of these ardently
affectionate epistles and thinking that its possession might in some
way invest him with power over the beautiful girl, he appropriated it.
Soon afterward he conceived the plot now sought to be executed.
He forged a skillfully drawn letter from Charley Hughes. This was
the paper which Bessie held tightly in her grasp when I made the two
soldiers drop their pistols and get into the wagon.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Bessie,’ I said, ‘you must tell me what this means. Why do you
propose to leave with those two villainous-looking fellows? You know
I am your friend and even more than friend. This is not right or safe,
and unless you make me understand that it is, I will take that wagon
and those two soldiers to our rendezvous at once and have these men
sent in as prisoners of war.’</p>
        <p>“Bessie still hesitating and frightened, at length came to my side
<pb id="dupre97" n="97"/>
and placed the crushed letter in my hand. I opened it and read as
follows:</p>
        <div2 type="letter">
          <opener>
            <dateline>“ ‘HOSPITAL No. 6, CHATTANOOGA, February 2, 1864.</dateline>
          </opener>
          <p>“ ‘MY DEAREST BESSIE:  -  I was severely wounded in a skirmish on the
picket line last Monday. I thought I would be well enough to reach your
home and be perfectly blest as the object of your tender care. But the
inflammation of the wound makes it threaten my life, and the surgeon
says I cannot go to you. Will you not come to me before I die? You can
return to your home in the evening. The kind doctor lends me his horse
and ambulance, and you can trust the two men I send to guard you. Ever
your own,</p>
          <closer>

          </closer>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="chapter">
          <p>“ ‘Bessie,’ I said, after slowly reading Charley's note, ‘Charley
didn't write that letter. It wasn't written by a dying man. It don't
sound right or honest. It is too long and stiff and particular, and
those fellows in that wagon there must tell me who wrote that letter or
I will string them to the limb of that oak. There is some d-d
scoundrel at the bottom of this rascally business. Bessie,‘ I said,
‘read it over again. Are you sure Charley wrote it?’</p>
          <p>“She looked at me vacantly and then at the letter most intently.
Hesitating, and evidently doubting the genuineness of the paper, she
said:</p>
          <p>“ ‘Oh! yes; Charley wrote it. Nobody could be wicked enough
to write me such a story if it were false.’</p>
          <p>“ ‘It is false, and those men in that wagon are hired to place you in
the power of some villain in Chattanooga.’</p>
          <p>“The pair of knaves grew pale when I gazed in their faces. The
devil was in me and I wonder I had not killed them at the instant.</p>
          <p>“Just then three bushwhackers who left Chattanooga as scouts, and
had followed closely after the wagon containing the two soldiers,
came riding rapidly toward me. My repeaters were in my belt and
I held a Henry rifle in my hand. The scouts were within fifty
yards or less when I turned and ordered them to halt. They obeyed,
and then seeing at length that I stood alone with Bessie, and that two
Federal soldiers, armed, as they supposed, were in the wagon, they
began to advance. The horse attached to the ambulance had been
turned and was ready to move toward Chattanooga.</p>
          <p>“Then it was, gentlemen,” continued Spratling, “that my great
strength saved my life and prevented the seizure and ruin of Bessie
Starnes by those dreadful villains.</p>
          <p>“When the three bushwhackers suddenly raised their carbines to
their faces I shoved Bessie violently out of harm's way. She fell
almost senseless in the corner of the fence. I leaped to the rear of
the wagon and the two knaves in it struck the horse, a gaunt, bony
animal he was, thinking to expose me to the aim of the scouts. But
my blood was up. Bessie was in danger and I was savage. I seized
the rear axle of the wagon with my left hand and held the wagon as
still as if it had been anchored there from all eternity. The two
soldiers in it struck and cursed the struggling horse, and when he
<pb id="dupre98" n="98"/>
jerked and reared, standing on his hindmost legs, and fell back
helpless, they turned and saw my arm holding them fast. They
looked pitifully and helplessly into my face. They were paralyzed by
overwhelming amazement that begets nameless terror. The Federal
scouts, expecting the struggling horse to move the wagon out of the
way that they might shoot me down, stared in mute amazement at the
helpless animal. As soon as he was still for an instant, I fired, and
one of the scouts fell from his saddle. The other two turned to fly. I
shot a second, and the third alone escaped. Neither of them fired a shot.</p>
          <p>“Bessie still lay frightened and stunned by the roadside. I was not
absolutely sure that the men in the wagon had no weapons and feared,
if I turned away to raise her up, they might fire on me and drive back
to Chattanooga. Dropping my rifle and seizing the rear axle of the
wagon with both hands, I raised it suddenly  -  the horse's head was
turned down the hill toward Chattanooga  -  and overturned it, with
the men in it, upon the horse's back. The men, stunned and bruised,
rolled down the declivity; the frightened horse, with the wagon body
on his back, fled in terror. His speed down that hill was never
eclipsed. The wagon body soon fell off and the wheels took their
places in the road and the frightened horse was found dead nearly a
mile from the spot.</p>
          <p>“The two knaves were almost killed by their sudden elevation and
fall. I made them come to me and, while Mrs. Starnes attended to
Bessie, I tied their hands together behind their backs. They were
perfectly helpless because perfectly unmanned by amazement and
terror. I never saw faces full of such helpless agony as the two knaves
wore when they found I was stronger than the horse that struggled in
vain to move the wagon. It was this that struck the approaching
bushwhackers dumb with astonishment and made them stop a moment
to stare at the struggling animal. They could not believe their eyes
when they saw the venerable brute straining every sinew of body and
legs and plunging forward madly and yet fixed to the spot where I
held him. The horse trembled either from terror, or it may have
been from tremendous exertion of strength. But he shuddered
visibly. I felt the wagon tremble after each vain effort made by the
horse to move it.”</p>
          <p>“What wonderful stories the fellow that escaped told of your deeds
in Chattanooga,” said the schoolmaster to Spratling, “and if ever
those two knaves and pimps for the villainous quarter-master escape or
return to their command won't they noise abroad the fame and deeds of
Spratling!</p>
          <p>“I am almost tempted, Captain, to ask you to turn them loose. I
would, were it not that they are such infamous knaves. They were
hired by that remorseless villain, the quarter-master, to bring that
forged letter to Bessie, and take her to some den of iniquity in
Chattanooga. When tied and questioned separately they finally
confessed the whole truth.”</p>
          <p>“There's something else I want to tell,” said Spratling. “I am
<pb id="dupre99" n="99"/>
not sure that Bessie would have me tell it, but there is no harm in it,
and as I will never see Bessie again she should not care. Then the
newspaper man and the schoolmaster will never meet her or tell
anybody who will repeat it in Bessie's neighborhood, and I might as
well finish my story.</p>
          <p>“You know, Captain, I loved Bessie. I do think she is too good
and too beautiful for this world. When she came to her senses, after
that bloody work this morning and looked up so gratefully in my face
and when I was watching the color come and go in her pale, sweet
face, and the lights and shadows that fled from one another across the
great depths of her beautiful eyes  -  when she said to me in low, soft,
musical tones:</p>
          <p>“ ‘Do you know now that I owe you more than my life, and that I
am ready to give even that to you.’ She put her little brown hand
in mine, and looked up in my face with such a dreamy look of
grateful love, that I  -  I couldn't help it, Captain  -  I kissed the
pretty girl and pressed her passionately to my heart.</p>
          <p>“But I began to think, and knew I was doing wrong. I began to
recall the incidents of the morning. I remembered that Bessie was
impelled by irresistible affection to risk her life and fame that she
might watch at the bedside of the man she really loved. ‘Spratling,’
I said to myself, ‘you have no right to take advantage of this pretty
girl's gratitude. She loves another and if you really love Bessie you
must not make her wretched by inducing her to become your own
because she thinks she owes you a debt that cannot otherwise be paid.’</p>
          <p>“I stood up, Captain, and told Bessie I was an honest man, and
that I loved her with all my heart, but that I had forced her that
morning to tell me why she proposed to go to Chattanooga. ‘I can
not, Bessie, save your life in order to make it wretched. I love you
madly enough, God knows, but you love Charley, and you shall wed
Charley.’</p>
          <p>“I bade her good bye, Captain, and she wept with a pitiful sort of
smile, significant, I thought, of her gratitude, playing about her pale,
sweet face  -  gratitude because I had now given her to perfect
blessedness and to Charley Hughes.</p>
          <p>“Holding both her hands and gazing long and rapturously into those
wonderful eyes, I kissed her again and ran away.”</p>
          <p>I, who rewrite the story of the adventures of these scouts, am
impelled to say that Spratling and Bessie and Mamie and Bessie's
Federal lieutenant and the captain all met, and not very many weeks
after the occurrences just recited. How these men and women were
brought together, and what strange consequences sprang from personal
interviews, subsequent pages will tell.</p>

        <p>Spratling's almost incredible account of his sojourn at Starnes'
farmhouse begat profound silence about the camp fire. We sat gazing
moodily into the burning, glowing heap of wood and ashes, watching
intently the weird shapes assumed, and brilliant, quivering forms that
danced, and castles, towers, domes, and minarets that rose and
gleamed and fell among the living coals. The captain rose at length
and went away saying:</p>
        <p>“If everything is quiet we should sleep. We must march tomorrow.”</p>
        <p>The newspaper man said he had been writing, before Spratling
returned, an account of the woes of a poor soldier whom he had
encountered twice since the war began.</p>
        <p>“There is such an admixture of mirth and sadness,” said the
editor, “begotten of the simple facts that I cannot tell, when recalling
the incidents, whether I should laugh or weep. I was pursuing my
life-long vocation,” he continued, “when I stood upon the heights at
Columbus, Kentucky, and witnessed the descent of U. S. Grant's
brigade  -  Iowa and Illinois troops, I think they were  -  upon Colonel
<pb id="dupre101" n="101"/>
Tappan's Arkansas regiment and a squadron of cavalry encamped on
the low, flat shore of the Mississippi. Confederate official reports of
that battle did not confess the fact; but my impression was that
Grant played his cards for all they were worth, and by this first little
game of “poker” with bayonets, Bishop General Polk, being his
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">vis-a-vis</foreign></hi>, demonstrated his capacity to “hold his hand” and play it
skillfully even when R. E. Lee sits facing him, as he does to-night in
front of Richmond. After the fight, I went to the adjutant or colonel
of each Confederate regiment engaged, to ascertain the names of the
killed and wounded. It was late at night when I reached Colonel
Jem Cole's quarters. He led, in this action, raw Tennessee troops,
and several were killed or wounded. I was sitting beside him at the
entrance to the tent, and had made full memoranda for the night's
telegrams, when an old man, hat in hand, and holding a lantern close
to my face, said:</p>
        <p>“I wish, Capting, you would put me down among the dead.”</p>
        <p>“Why?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“Oh, it doesn't signify,” answered Gibbons, Cole's orderly, “but you
see, I'm gwine onto fifty yeahs or mo' and I was fool enough to
marry a nice young gal. She ain't more'n twenty-eight; she's down
to Vicksburg whar I live. Well, she kinder got tired ov me somehow
and scolded a heap, and made it hot for the old feller, sometimes,
and I didn't like her carryings-on with the boys like, and when the
drums beat and fifes shrieked in the streets, day and night, you see,
Capting, I thought mebbe Mary Ann would be sorry and kinder come
round a little if an old feller like me dressed up like a soger in fine
toggery and went to the wars and she knowed what made me go. She
knowed home wasn't comfortable. She was sorter sorry, I reckon,
when I marched away to the steamboat to come here; but she didn't
say much and she don't write to me, and I think ef you'll help me,
Capting, I can bring her. Ef you'll print in the papers that I'm
dead, she'll know she killed me. She knows I'm here because she
wasn't good to me. Will you kill me in the papers, Capting?”</p>
        <p>“I haven't the slightest objection,” I said. “You are in earnest,”
I asked, “and you want me to say that you were shot between the
eyes fighting gallantly beside Colonel Cole, and that you fell dead in
the front rank of your brave regiment?”</p>
        <p>“That's the very way to put it,” answered Gibbons.</p>
        <p>I met Bassett, soon afterward, the clever and kindly correspondent
of the Appeal. We interchanged memoranda, and Bassett, as well as I,
telegraphed the story of Gibbons' heroic death. This happened
on the night of the 7th of November, 1861, when telegraphic wires
north and south were made tremulous by the exciting story of the
first battle fought in the war between the States, in the valley of the
Mississippi.</p>
        <p>More than two years had elapsed, when, not many days ago, I
sought the quarters of General Preston Smith, that I might encounter
friends left at Columbus, Kentucky, late in November, 1861. I was
<pb id="dupre102" n="102"/>
riding along placidly enough, within our lines, occasionally
accosted by a sentinel, to whom I exhibited a passport from the
Provost Marshal, General ---. At length an aged man, stepping out
from behind a tree and looking intently in my face, exclaimed,
nervously and quickly:</p>
        <p>“Halt there!”</p>
        <p>I drew the rein and at the same instant extended my right hand
with the passport. The gray-haired sentinel only stared at me and at
length said, as if soliloquizing:</p>
        <p>“D--d ef it ain't him!”</p>
        <p>“Ain't who?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“You are the feller what killed me at the battle of Belmont, ain't
you?”</p>
        <p>Seeing that the old fellow was still living and yet talked of himself
as dead, I knew he was a lunatic, and saw that he was well armed. I
had no weapon of any description, and confess I felt anxious. He
still held his musket at a “present arms.” Constantly, through two
years, in the midst of ever-recurring excitements, of course I had
utterly forgotten that I had ever advertised any one as dead at
Belmont, and there was nothing in this rude, bent, gray old soldier to
recall the neatly clad, erect Mr. Gibbons, who was acting as Colonel
Cole's orderly in November, 1861, at Columbus, Kentucky.</p>
        <p>He still stared at me. I said to him, soothingly:</p>
        <p>“Are you not mistaken? I don't think I killed anybody in the
battle of Belmont. I only crossed the river in the afternoon and saw
the fighting at the boats, when Grant's troops were going away.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, I'm not talking about that,” said Gibbons. “You killed me by
telegraph. Don't you remember it?”</p>
        <p>I now knew that I was arrested by a maniac. The bare suggestion
of death by telegraph instead of by railway implied hopeless,
irremediable insanity.</p>
        <p>I was at my wit's end and could only suggest that I had “almost
forgotten it.”</p>
        <p>“D--n it,” exclaimed the old fellow, bringing his musket down
till its muzzle almost touched my face, “I'm Gibbons, Colonel Cole's
orderly, and you sent my death to the <hi rend="italics">Avalanche</hi>, and the <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi>, at
Vicksburg, copied it, and every other newspaper in the wurruld, I
think. I thought my wife would sorter cum round and be sorry like,
and that she'd be glad when I resurrected, and sorter went home outer
the graveyard like. But you played h--l, you did.”</p>
        <p>The fun involved in the queer facts now began to dawn upon me.
I remembered Gibbons and his supposititious heroic death, and how
poor Bassett and I slew him with our little pencils.</p>
        <p>“Mr. Gibbons,” I remarked, solemnly, “you told me to publish the
story.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, that may be, but you shan't laff about it. You played
h--l, I tell you! The news went, and kept agoin' and everybody
knowed I was dead, very dead. I was, sir, d--d dead,” exclaimed
<pb id="dupre103" n="103"/>
the old man, and he stamped the ground as if his hated corpse was
beneath it.</p>
        <p>I could not repress signs of laughter.</p>
        <p>“Look here,” exclaimed the old fellow, “I won't have any of
that. You'll be shot deader than I am, except in the newspapers, ef
you don't cork up.”</p>
        <p>He was profoundly in earnest. His eyes blazed, and I “corked
up.” I was, in fact, profoundly solemn. The musket was coming up
to my face.</p>
        <p>“I'll do anything I can for you, Mr. Gibbons.”</p>
        <p>“Well, then, git down and resurrect me.”</p>
        <p>I was again puzzled. It occurred to me that surely the man was a
maniac. How was I to “resurrect” him?</p>
        <p>“Git down,” he repeated, “and write it all out and sign your name
to it, and tell 'em it was all a d--d lie, and that I ain't dead. The
old 'omen and the infernal lawyers has done administered to my
e-state. She sold my fo' niggahs, and she was about marryin' another
feller when I last hearn from her. Be quick and straighten it all out.
When I writes, or rayther when I gits some other feller to write and I
makes my mark to the letter they sends back word, they can't be
humbugged. They knows I'm dead and that no swindling rascal can
git money outen her. I'm ben miserable, mighty miserable, ever
sense you killed me in the newspapers. I lost home, wife, property,
everything, and I am gettin' very old, and now I'm buried alive, and
out'n the wurruld, and still knows I was in it.”</p>
        <p>Tears came into the old man's eyes, his voice faltered, he bowed
his head, and I pitied him with all my heart. In broken accents, he
went on:</p>
        <p>“Last summer I got a furlow to go home for thirty days, and
took sick and lay thar in a horspital at Jackson till I only had one
day left. I staggered down, a skelly-ton, to the railroad, and rode
on the kyars to my farm, whar my wife lives sense she sold my house
and lot in town, twelve miles outen Vicksburg. I got thar about
dusk, and staggered along till I got to the house. I looked jest like a
dead man, for all the wurruld. I staggered in. The front door was
open and thar sot my wife. She knowed I was dead. She was
aholdin' a young feller's hand, and her sister was in the room. It
looked free and easy like, as if they was used to it. I stood and
looked and listened a minnit and hearn the gal say, 'Oh, he's ben
dead more'n a year and a half,' when I got mad. I knowed they was
atalkin' about me, and I stepped into the room, and stood thar
silent, holdin' up my bony hands.</p>
        <p>“Never, in all my born days, did I hear setch screams as them two
wimmin give. Both keeled over, dead; deader'n ever I was. That
ar nice young man knowed it was me. He used to know me in
Vicksburg before I died. His eyes stood an inch or two outen his
nice little head, and her riz up and stood like hog bristles, and
he wur whiter than his liver. He stared at me half a minnit, and
<pb id="dupre104" n="104"/>
then went fur the winder. I think it's more'n probable he is arunnin'
yet. He never looked back, nary a time.</p>
        <p>“Them horspital folks at Jackson had telegraphed the conscript
officer at my railroad dippo to catch me as a deserter. When I started
to get some whiskey for the wimmin and to be out of sight when they
opened their eyes that they mightent be skeered agin, I was ordered
to halt. At that very minnit here come the train. The conscript
officer tuk me with him and fetched me to Jackson, and the next
week I was sent with six more deserters under guard to my rigiment.
Noboddy seen me at home but them thar people. That feller what
was gwine to marry my wife  -  well, I know he's clean gone. He was,
perhaps, the wust scart man that has lit out anywhare sense this skeery
war begun, and cowardly legs have ben mightily imposed upon and
stretched all over these hyar states. He knows I'm a ghost, and my
wife and her sister jest swares all the time that it was my ghost which
they seed, and the nabers believed it, and that I got up outen my
grave at Columbus, Kentucky, and traveled to Vicksburg jest to keep
the old 'omen from marryin' that skeery chap. You see how very
dead I am. You must help me, won't you? I don't want to be
dead, when I know I am living, and now everyboddy swars I am
buried and forgotten at Columbus, Kentucky, and that my ghost has
been seen agin and agin. My wife has the ager whenever she hyars
my name.”</p>
        <p>I dismounted, and asked the heart-broken old man to sit beside me
at the root of the great oak, through whose branches winds sighed
sadly, while tears fell rapidly from the old man's eyes.</p>
        <p>I wrote of his griefs as I read of them now. I will publish this
story and the old soldier may yet make the world confess that, like
Daniel Webster, “he still lives.”</p>

        <p>At noon, next day, we rested on the banks of a little mountain
stream fifty yards from the country roadway we had followed, leading
towards Tunnel Hill. Two men on foot and one on horseback, as
tracks in the highway indicated, were not far ahead. Whether
enemies or friends we could not tell. Spratling went forward to
ascertain their character. What befell him and how extraordinary
was his action may be imagined when one reflects that he was now
imbued with indestructible and boundless confidence in his own
powers and in his iron muscles. And then he was reckless because
he deemed his separation from Bessie final.</p>
        <p>We were eating hard bread and broiled bacon and sipping strong
coffee when the newspaper man said he was “in Chattanooga about a
year ago, when the daring Federal Captain, Andrews, almost succeeded
in giving General Mitchell possession of the place. Generals Kirby
Smith and Leadbetter were in command, Leadbetter, a supposed
engineer, engaged in fortifying the stronghold.”</p>
        <p>“I don't think,” said the journalist, “there were more than five
hundred soldiers in the ragged, ricketty, weather-boarded town.
These were raw, half-armed, undisciplined Georgians encamped at the
end of the railroad track on the river bank half a mile from the
Crutchfield tavern, occupied by Generals Smith and Leadbetter.</p>
        <p>Here, in this Crutchfield tavern, occurred the conflict between
‘Bill’ Crutchfield and General Vaughn of which I was telling some
time ago, and in its immediate vicinity happened the most ludicrous
incident that will be illustrated in all the annals of this absurd and
ghastly war. While the word Chattanooga, signifying crow's nest,  - 
the rounded hills in the valley representing, in red men's eyes, the
<pb id="dupre106" n="106"/>
eggs of the bird,  -  is held down in its place on the map of the earth's
surface by that mighty paper weight, Lookout Mountain, this story
will be ever memorable. The news came to the Confederate generals,
by telegraph from Big Shanty, that a federal Captain, Andrews, and a
dozen gallant men, disguised as country clodhoppers, had seized the
locomotive at that place and were coming north. Three hundred
passengers, and cars with reinforcements for Chattanooga, were thus
left at Big Shanty, while Captain Andrews, coming north, was
destroying each bridge and culvert behind him. The Federal General,
Mitchell, was at Bridgeport, west of Chattanooga, intending, as soon
as he was advised of the success of Captain Andrews, to attack and
capture the feebly garrisoned stronghold. He proposed to carry it
by storm before bridges and culverts could be repaired, and before
men and munitions could be sent up from Atlanta.</p>
        <p>“Andrews failing to cut the telegraph wire when he first left Big
Shanty, full dispatches, telling what he had done, came to us in
Chattanooga. A train of platform, open cars was at once freighted
with two hundred raw militiamen and sent down the road to capture
Andrews.</p>
        <p>“I had slept through the night on a blanket, with Rolfe S. Saunders,
beside the railway at the southern end of the Crutchfield house,
afterwards burned. In an alley running at right angles to the railway
and behind the tavern, slept a sick soldier named Sim Sneed. He
was very small, short of stature, round of person, and bald-headed.
Just before the train started out to intercept Captain Andrews, coming
up from Big Shanty toward Chattanooga, Sim was suffering greatly.
I gave him a large share of the exhilarating contents of Saunders'
canteen and discovered that Sim, besides being very sick, was
exceedingly drunk. The train was now coming down toward the hotel.
Two hundred men on it rattling guns and shouting, and the roaring
of cars and locomotive, begat a mighty noise. A huge sow, weighing
quite four hundred pounds, was roused from her matutinal slumbers in
a mud-hole by this dreadful uproar. She was greatly frightened, and
came snorting and leaping along the railroad track, ahead of the
locomotive, to our resting place. Fearing that the immense brute
would run over and cover us with greasy slime, in which she had been
bathing, Saunders and I stood erect. Sim Sneed, at the instant, with
clothes wholly unloosened about him, because of the pain he suffered,
hearing the noise made by the huge hog, rose up on his knees and
elbows. He was facing the flying hog. The animal, frightened by
Saunders and myself, turned suddenly and rapidly into the alley-way.
Her nose passed under Sim's body, and between it and his pantaloons
that dropped under the hog's throat. He clasped his arms about her,
and thus, lying on his face, pinioned to the huge brute's back, he
went careering backwards down the alley.</p>
        <p>“The thoroughly affrighted beast, with her involuntary rider,
snorted like a hippopotamus. Sim's shirt floated as a flag of truce
above his back, as he hurried, wrong end foremost, down the hill.
<pb id="dupre107" n="107"/>
At the foot of this declivity, Captain Claib Kane's gallant battery
was encamped</p>
        <p>“The railway train now stood still, and three hundred men, amazed
and silent at first, contemplated the stupendous flight of that
dumfounded hog. At last the supreme ridiculousness of Sim Sneed's
attitude struck the soldiers. Many had seen him caught up on the
animal's snout and fastened on her back, and shouts and laughter
rent the air.</p>
        <p>“Chattanooga was as full of dogs and fleas as Constantinople.
These dogs all barked and howled, a fact I would not have observed
at the moment, but many of these curious curs came rushing toward
the tavern to see what had happened. Saunders, from a platform car
which we had mounted, directed my attention to a big, black cur,
with a very short tail, rushing madly along a garden fence at right
angles to the course pursued by Sneed and the Flying Childers he
bestrode. Just as the dog turned the corner, the hog reached it.
That dog had never seen any living thing whose physiognomy bore
the remotest resemblance to features made up of a sow's grim head
thrust between a man's pantaloons and body, and this body constituting
a full, white, round forehead for the unaccountable beast. When
the dog rushed round the corner, to face the hog, his hair was all
turned the wrong way; his short, stiff tail worn off by having good
Sunday-school boys of Chattanooga tie tin buckets to it, was turned
up stiff and straight, at right angles to his rigid backbone. The dog
was terribly excited when he suddenly faced the sow and Sneed
inverted. He stopped dead still; his hair and tail instantly fell; he
shook; his spine gave way; his head sank; he dropped upon the
sod, and turning gently upon his side, his legs quivered, and there
was a dead dog.</p>
        <p>“Captain Kane's battery of eight guns, one hundred and fifty
horses, and as many men, was at the foot of the hill. The great,
grim grunter, now ridden by Sneed, was well known there. She
foraged among Captain Kane's horses; but as she came down the
hill, bearing Sim upon her back, she was wholly unrecognized by
Irishmen and horses.</p>
        <p>“ ‘An', what is it, Pathrick?’</p>
        <p>“ ‘An', faith, an' will ye be afther tellin' me, Jemmy?’</p>
        <p>“ ‘An', bejazes, I niver seen the loikes of it before.’</p>
        <p>“ ‘Oh, it's the divel sure, with his face white-washed.’</p>
        <p>“Meanwhile, the echo of voices of shouting crowds reached these
artillerymen. They stood upon guns and caissons when the old sow
rushed down the declivity. Horses broke away from their fastenings
and fled in all directions, and the sow was crossing the encampment
before the artillerymen saw how Sim Sneed became a sort of inverted
centaur.</p>
        <p>“They had hardly recovered from their alarm and ceased making
signs of the cross and invoking the Holy Virgin, when the sow passed
out of sight under the negro shanty where her dozen pigs reposed in
<pb id="dupre108" n="108"/>
dusty blissfulness. As she went under, Sim's fat person struck the
sleeper of the house. The sow never halted. Sim's breeches were
rent in twain, one-half remaining on either leg. He lay some time
senseless in the dust. A comrade ran to him with a blanket, and Sim
soon afterward was furloughed by Leadbetter as an insane John
Gilpin.”</p>

        <p>While the journalist was talking, as recited in preceding pages,
Spratling followed rapidly in the footsteps of the three persons just
ahead of us. He came upon them within a mile of our resting place.
They had kindled a fire some distance from the highway and prepared
their noon-day meal. Spratling concealed himself on the summit of
the hill, watched their actions, and soon ascertained that one was a
young soldier and officer and the others bushwhackers. He said
afterwards that he was satisfied, while watching the movements of these
three men, that one was the very bushwhacker who escaped when his
two comrades fell at Starnes' home. This conviction excited a keen
desire, Spratling said, to “capture the rascal.” He had sought to
slay Spratling, and if the latter had not held the wagon, thus guarding
his own person despite the horse's exertions to move the vehicle,
he would have been shot to death by his three assailants.</p>

        <p>When the soldier and bushwhackers had appeased hunger, they
sought each a spot on which to rest. The soldier came to a great tree
hardly fifty paces from Spratling's place of concealment. The two
bushwhackers stretched themselves on blankets side by side. Within
ten minutes, all were so still that Spratling believed they slept. He
crept, stealthily and noiselessly, to the tree. One of its roots was the
soldier's pillow. Spratling, of whose strength, as we learned
afterwards, the sleeping soldier had heard marvelous accounts, leaped,
<pb id="dupre110" n="110"/>
when within a yard or two of his victim, upon the unconscious youth
and seizing his throat said in a whisper:</p>
        <p>“Be silent. You are my prisoner and are safe.”</p>
        <p>The soldier said afterward was no need for these injunctions
of silence, that Spratling's grasp about his throat almost crushed
every bone in it.</p>
        <p>In an instant Spratling raised the young soldier and held him,
disarmed and helpless as he was, as a shield with one hand, while,
presenting his repeater in the other, he ordered the two bushwhackers
to rise and hold up their hands.</p>
        <p>The man who had sought to kill Spratling at Starnes' looked up,
grew pale, and shuddering, said, in husky tones:</p>
        <p>“It's him! It's Spratling!”</p>
        <p>The name was magical in its potency. The two men rose with hands
uplifted, their guns and pistols lying on their blankets. If they had
been fearless as Spratling and resisted, one or both would have fallen
instantly and in no event could Spratling have been killed except by a
bullet that was first fatal to the young officer. The bushwhackers
comprehended the exigencies of the moment and, in obedience to
Spratling's orders, moved toward the road, fifty yards distant. The
young officer having been disarmed, was ordered to join his two
associates, and Spratling, with a cocked repeater in each hand and
his Henry rifle strapped on his back, followed his prisoners to the
creek where he had left us.</p>
        <p>We were not a little amazed when he laughingly ordered us to
“open ranks” and receive his prisoners. The trio came to us
pitifully crestfallen. They confessed in their faces a sense of shame
that they had succumbed to the tact, courage, and notorious
strength of one man. Meanwhile we could hardly conceal from Spratling
and his prisoners our amazement. We supposed he would bring
accurate information, and that we might assail these supposed scouts,
but never dreamed that he would undertake the task he had effected.
Spratling's good nature, when he discovered the chagrin of the young
Federal lieutenant, made him say that “he knew that his own success
depended upon the deprivation of the young officer of every means of
resistance and of escape. I, therefore, first disposed of him. When
he was helpless, of course the others surrendered.”</p>
        <p>The bushwhackers captured recognized the pedagogue as a former
comrade, the latter stating that he was a paroled prisoner. The
youthful officer, seeing that the pedagogue was on the best possible
terms with the captain, Spratling, and the newspaper man, said to him
that he had “supposed prisoners of war would be kept under guard.”</p>
        <p>“We have no guardsmen,” interposed the captain. “Now and
then we hold as prisoners men whom we can trust implicitly, and
Mr. Wade is of the number. I am not perfectly sure, but think it
needless to use handcuffs or cords in dealing with you. Tell me as a
man of honor and as a soldier that you will not attempt to escape and
you can go where you please. The others, I am sorry to say, since
<pb id="dupre111" n="111"/>
there are only three of us and the editor there is a volunteer
aide-de-camp, and we now have six prisoners, must be tied together.”</p>
        <p>The lieutenant, looking into the captain's face, said that his
“widowed mother's home was not far from Tunnel Hill. These loyal
scouts had agreed to guide me safely thither. If you will suffer me to
visit my home, I will promise anything. Here is my furlough. It
lasts”---</p>
        <p>A sudden light shone in the captain's eyes. He gazed into the
lieutenant's face with suddenly awakened interest and earnestness that
startled the young soldier.</p>
        <p>“Keep your furlough,” said the captain. “I know who you are and
your mother's name.”</p>
        <p>The captain rose, and walking away, said, “See the schoolmaster,
there. I accept your pledge. You can hear from Mr. Wade much
that you would gladly know. Possibly it is most fortunate that we
have met. I am engaged in serving those you love. The fact that
we are public enemies need not affect our personal relations. Our
duties and obligations as soldiers need not clash with those that rest
upon us as men. You are paroled,” continued the captain, “and I
would only advise you to remain with us and especially that you confer
with Mr. Wade.</p>
        <p>Spratling had overheard none of this colloquy. He was providing
for the security of his prisoners. When his task was done, he came
and sat near the editor, and was devouring bacon and bread with that
energy which distinguished him when marching and fighting.</p>
        <p>“Do you know, Sprat,” asked the journalist, “the name of that
handsome young officer whom you almost choked to death a little
while ago?”</p>
        <p>“No,” he answered, glancing at him and Wade, who were engrossed
in matters they discussed, “but I don't see why the captain releases
him on parole and at the same time handcuffs his comrades. He is
much more dangerous than these two clodhoppers who only know the
woods and roads and are too timid, if watched, to be murderous.”</p>
        <p>“But do you know the name of that gentleman?”</p>
        <p>“No,” answered Spratling, “and I don't care to know; but I don't
think, since it cost me so much risk to catch him, that he should be
turned loose.”</p>
        <p>“Let me tell you, Sprat. Come near that no one else may hear.
That is Lieutenant Hughes, the young man Bessie Starnes talked
about, and let me tell you further  -  Oh, sit still and don't get
excited, Sprat  -  he is Mamie Hughes' brother.”</p>
        <p>Spratling's nerves and muscles were unstrung. Bread and bacon
fell from his unconscious fingers. He slowly returned his ugly knife
to its sheath in his belt, drew the back of his hand across his face, and
straightening himself, as he sat, turned to stare at his prisoner.</p>
        <p>“Suppose,” said Spratling, as if talking to himself, while he stared
at the lieutenant, “suppose I had cut his throat, as I once thought of
doing, while he slept, or suppose I had actually killed him, as I might
<pb id="dupre112" n="112"/>
have done, when I held his throat! My God! what would Bessie have
thought of me!”</p>
        <p>Forgetful of my existence, Spratling rose, and approaching the
lieutenant, said to him:</p>
        <p>“You don't know how glad I am that I didn't kill you and how
sorry because I had to make you a prisoner. I didn't know your
name or that you knew Bessie.”</p>
        <p>A new leaf in the volume of human nature was suddenly turned by
the lieutenant. Bessie, only the day before, had told him of Spratling's
honest devotion to herself, but the lieutenant deemed the gigantic
rebel a mere animal, full of courage as of physical strength. He never
dreamed of ascribing to the rude <foreign lang="es">ranchero</foreign> and herdsman of Texas a
generosity of purpose and true nobility of character, now partially
unfolded, such as few men have illustrated in acts or words.</p>
        <p>The lieutenant rose up and, slowly extending his hand, looked
searchingly into Spratling's large, transparent blue eyes that never
faltered while the two men studied one another's virtues as written in
their faces.</p>
        <p>Spratling drew the lieutenant aside and said to him, “You don't
know how sorry I am for what has happened; but I couldn't help it.
I did not know that you are Bessie's lover. She has told you about
me, I reckon, and what a fool I was; but she told you I was an
honest man and that I would serve her or even a dog that she loved.
Don't forget that while Spratling is above ground and you are true to
Bessie, you have a friend who would storm hell if you asked it.”</p>
        <p>Two days after the events just narrated, the captain left Spratling,
the pedagogue, and lieutenant not far from our pickets, and with the
journalist and the two soldiers captured by Spratling at Starnes' and
the two bushwhackers found with the lieutenant, proceeded to General
Cleburne's head-quarters. Every leading incident of the preceding
month was here narrated, and the general, as requested, applied for
passports required for the use of the paroled lieutenant. When these
came, two days later, from the provost marshal general, the captain
returned to Spratling's bivouac. The journalist sought the encampment
of Pinson's Mississippi cavalry, having agreed to rejoin the
captain when the schoolmaster returned from East Tennessee with
Mamie Hughes. The editor was also to recover possession of his
horse and spend a week, in the interim, with the Federal lieutenant at
the home of the latter, below Tunnel Hill. Communication between
all these was to be maintained through General Cleburne's headquarters.</p>
        <p>Nothing is more intolerably irksome to those accustomed to daily
newspaper work than the incomparably stupid and monotonous life of
a soldier. Tattoo, reveille, dress-parade, drill, service on the outposts
or as sentinels, ditch digging, greasy cards, musty, hard bread
and tough beef, with no books and rarely a newspaper, are hourly
facts that invest with horror, when nearly twenty years have elapsed,
memories of life in camp. There is nothing to elevate or refine
<pb id="dupre113" n="113"/>
and everything to degrade, the intellects and tastes and brutalize
one's habits and modes of thinking. There were many educated,
excellent gentlemen, sons of rich cotton planters, acting as private
soldiers in Pinson's regiment. Even among these the journalist said
he heard stories hourly by the camp fire that shocked his sensibilities.
The great evils of war are those that result from the separation of the
sexes; husbands from wives, brothers from sisters, lovers from
sweethearts. Vices consequent upon these facts are discovered in the
homes of the people as well as in conversations on tented fields.</p>
        <p>To the very extent that woman gains potency in the church, in
society, in social life, or in government, to that extent man as an
individual and as a citizen is made worthier of God's approval. There
is a divinity in woman that may be demonized by man, but while she
remains herself she elevates, refines, and deifies our race. Her
influence would be as beneficent in law and government as war
showed it to be in social life; and woman's morals, tastes, and purity
should be injected into the ballot-box.</p>
        <p>These memoranda<sic corr=",">.</sic> made concurrently with the events of which
they tell, are now exploited that a new generation may have some
inadequate apprehension of codes of morals and tastes and habits of
every-day life that obtained everywhere in states that became seats of
war. Many generals, and countless writers of every grade of intelligence
and truthfulness have written of campaigns and battles. This
unpretending volume only assumes to tell how soldiers and people
talked and ate and slept and loved and hated when grim-visaged war
stalked abroad leaving its blackest curse upon the morals of homes
and churches and of woman. In digging graves for myriads of men
whose depravity was as steadily progressive as the strokes of Death
were violent, spasmodic, and numberless, War achieved least of its
measureless calamities.</p>
        <p>Of the character of stories commonly told by camp fires I can not
give a perfect illustration. The journalist, when he, Spratling, the
captain, and the pedagogue had again met and were seated about
blazing logs during a cold evening in February, 1864, with half a
dozen cavalrymen  -  the journalist's brother among the number  - 
assigned to temporary service as scouts  -  the journalist told a story
that smacked of the morals of the age when Mars was the god of the
people as of armies.</p>
        <p>“I was telling, some time ago, of my flight from Knoxville to
Kingston and how I was forced,” said the editor, “to win the favor
and confidence of the people by becoming a preacher. I had spent
three years at a theological college. My father proposed to make me
an educated preacher. I did not assent; but thought that I would
please him if possible. But the more I saw of preachers in embryo
the less I was inclined to adopt their profession. I left theology and
took to literature at the university, and thence, after I was graduated,
was inducted into a law school. But I never forgot the forms or
<pb id="dupre114" n="114"/>
lessons of the theological institution, or the two or three sermons I
had written with infinite care. How I pronounced one of these discourses,
and its effects, I may tell to-morrow night.</p>
        <p>“I won the confidence of a good Union methodist to such an
extent at Kingston, that, though I was a baptist, he conveyed me
in his wagon twenty miles toward Chattanooga. Burnside's cavalry
held the railway below Knoxville and I was forced to make a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">detour</foreign></hi>,
as formerly explained, by way of Kingston. My methodist friend
commended me, as a devout young baptist brother, to one Deacon
Applegate, of my church, whose guest I now became. With much
shamefacedness and most unwillingly did I repeat a prayer, night and
morning, in the presence of the household and the more was I
chagrined when I went to church and was made to occupy a seat in
the pulpit while a venerable and godly man expounded the scriptures to
his homely flock. I had begun to practice the odious deception and
wear this false character when no other course would have saved me
from incarceration of indefinite duration. Having entered upon the
wrongful and false line of conduct I dared not turn backward. I
aided modestly in the services and then was asked to remain and
witness the trial by the church of Julia Adams, a ‘good girl,’ so the
brethren and sisters said, but ‘unfortunate.’ I inquired of one of the
brethren whether Julia was to be tried for some ‘misfortune.’ He
answered, with a puzzled look:</p>
        <p>“ ‘Not adzactly; but its somehow that way.’</p>
        <p>“The baptist polity is that of a pure republic. Every church
member, white or black, male or female, old or young, is invested
with the ‘privilege’ of suffrage which thus becomes a ‘right’  -  because
of its universality. It happened, however, that the good and aged
pastor, Mr. Robinson, when the conference was opened, advised the
unmarried and youthful members of the church of both sexes to go
out. I observed that Mr. Applegate's son, about seven or eight years
of age, a handsome, intelligent child, was much excited and very loth
to obey his mother and make his exit with the rest. He had attended
a country school with Julia Adams and though the girl was eighteen
years of age, Jimmy Applegate was her sworn lover. Jimmy had heard
that Julia had loved, as the newspapers commonly have it, ‘not wisely,
but too well;’ but Jimmy, in the innocence of his nature, did not see
in what Julia was not as good and beautiful as before. Julia, unhappy
child as she was, sat beside her faithful old mother in a corner of the
little log church, crying as if her heart would break. Jimmy looked
wistfully toward her, his eyes swimming in tears, as he went out of the
door. Not many minutes later I observed that Jimmy had crawled between
two logs into the goods box of a pulpit and was quietly ensconced
where he could see Julia's sweet, tearful face and watch the progress
of the impending trial. The gray-haired preacher sat, when holding
the business meeting, at a little table in front of the pulpit. He
announced to the ‘bretheren and sisterin’ that the object of this session
<pb id="dupre115" n="115"/>
of the conference meeting is to say what shall be done in the case of
sister Julia Adams. You've all hearn about it and there's no use
talking. Thar she sits aweeping by her aged, heart-broken mother,
who loves her child and holds her hand, and cries even more bitterly
than her unhappy daughter. What have you to say about it, my
bretheren and sisterin?’</p>
        <p>“One after another the half dozen male members and saints of the
church rose and insisted that there was nothing to be said in defence
of the girl. She was a church member and forgetful of obligations
to society, to the church, and her own family and fame, had suffered
herself to be betrayed by that scapegrace, Jim Carter.</p>
        <p>“The truth is, the brethren and sisters confessed no pity for the
poor girl, and all denounced her in harshest terms.</p>
        <p>“Meanwhile Julia's grief was painful to contemplate. She threw
her arms about her aged mother's neck and sobbed aloud. She had
never before comprehended the frightful enormity of her misdeeds.
Nearly every old member of the church had spoken concurrently,
urging Julia's expulsion and the gray-haired pastor would groan out,
as each speaker sat down, a deep, sonorous, solemn ‘Amen.’</p>
        <p>“Evidently Julia was undone, and she, the mother, and the faithful
little lad in the pulpit, who loved her most ardently, were overwhelmed
by this great grief and impending and incurable disgrace.</p>
        <p>“There was profound silence and everybody watched earnestly the
slow deliberation with which Mrs. Nancy Ransom, an aged widow,
rose in her place. She removed her homespun sun-bonnet and her
long, white, unconfined hair fell down her back and over her
shoulders curved by the weight of eighty years.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Brethren and sisters,’ she began, ‘I want to say something, but
aint used to saying what I think before the church, and yet I can't be
silent when I listen to these unchristianlike speeches you have been
making. Poor Julia! with all my heart do I pity her! I always
loved the warm-hearted, confiding, generous child, and I love her
just the same to-day as a year ago. She is just as good and true and
honest to-day, as she was before this black cloud cast its hateful
shadow on her path, and before this tempest burst upon her sunshiny
home. See her bitter tears and pale, sweet face and the black sorrow
that sits on her stainless forehead.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Admit she sinned. Has she not repented? Look and see!’
exclaimed the old dame, pointing at Julia clasped in her mother's arms.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Brethren,’ she continued, ‘I don't think you read your bibles.
I don't think you know anything about the Savior. You are
governed by your resentments and not by that charity which God
taught us to practice. Don't you remember when that unhappy
widow, another poor Julia, was brought before God? When it was
sought to have Him condemn her  -  expel her from God's church and
from God's presence and from God's mercy, what was His answer?
I repeat it here to-day in reply to all that these brethren have said.</p>
        <pb id="dupre116" n="116"/>
        <p>“ ‘Let him who is without sin cast the first stone.’ Who among you
men or women dare cast the first stone at Julia?’</p>
        <p>“Here the old woman straightened herself up to her full height.
Her great blue eyes dimmed by years, blazed with the fires of renovated
youth. She shook her bony forefinger at the old preacher, and in deep
tones and measured accents, said:</p>
        <p>“ ‘Brethren and sisters, it is my honest opinion, in the presence of
Christ's example and of our own natures and of the fact that God
made us and not we ourselves, that Sister Julia's is the foremostest sin
that God Almighty will go about forgiving.’</p>
        <p>“The last were her precise, exact, earnest words.</p>
        <p>“Silence, profound and lasting, that followed, told of the effects
of her simple eloquence. The old preacher groaned audibly.</p>
        <p>“I observed that little Jimmy Applegate, as he sat in the pulpit,
was in ecstasies. He rubbed his sunburnt hands together. His long
hair was brushed away from his smiling nut-brown face. His tearful
eyes shone lustrously and lovingly while he listened and watched
intently each movement and caught every simple, earnest word that
fell from the tremulous lips of wrinkled, time-worn Mrs. Ransom.
Meanwhile, poor, unhappy Julia's eyes almost smiled through tears
that stood still at last.</p>
        <p>“Her wretched mother stared wonderingly, amazed beyond
measure that one woman had at last pitied and forgiven another.</p>
        <p>“There was protracted and death-like silence when Mrs. Ransom
sat down.</p>
        <p>“At length Dr. Joe Prewitt, a gray-haired, most influential deacon,
rose in his place, and said:</p>
        <p>“ ‘Bretheren, there is no use talking. Sister Ransom is right.
We forgot Christ. We forgot that none of us can “cast the first
stone.” I move that Sister Adams' name, she having repented of
her sin, remain on the church book.’</p>
        <p>“ ‘Amen! Amen! Bless the Lord!’ sang out the aged preacher.</p>
        <p>“The motion was carried, <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">mem. con.</foreign></hi> The doxology was sung;
the old preacher pronounced his benediction upon the assembly, and
all were going out when Jimmy Applegate ran, and grasping the
bony hand of Mrs. Ransom, kissed it. He then followed closely
after Julia. I watched the little fellow whose tenderness and fidelity
were even touching. He said to Julia, when she turned and kissed him:</p>
        <p>“ ‘The oldest and youngest of us, Mrs. Ransom and Jimmy, knew
you were good and true and we loved you, and now everybody loves
you, and you won't cry any more, will you, Julia?’</p>
        <p>“Julia again kissed her big-hearted, honest little lover, as tenderly
and gratefully as she did the aged Mrs. Ransom who came to bid
her good bye, and tell her to be a ‘good girl’ and she would never
want friends.</p>
        <p>“I am much inclined to believe, boys,” said the editor, “after
studying her sweet, pretty face and watching the tears that fell from
<pb id="dupre117" n="117"/>
her great blue eyes, that Julia Adams is still one of the best and
truest and most stainless of her sex. Her soul, if not her body, is
uncontaminated, and I must say that until I heard Mrs. Ransom's
simple, earnest defence of Julia, I had never translated liberally the
words that fell from Jesus' lips:</p>
        <p>
          <hi rend="italics">
            <foreign lang="la">“ ‘Qui sine peccato est prius in illam lapidem mittet.’</foreign>
          </hi>
        </p>
        <p>“It is hardly necessary to say that the venerable dame, Mrs.
Ransom, gave to the proper translation of these words a specific
application to the offence she discussed, perhaps wholly unwarranted.
‘He who is without sin’ can condemn the guilty. It is not asserted
that he who is guiltless of this special offence is alone fit to pronounce
sentence upon the weak, unfortunate, and fallen.”</p>

        <argument>
          <p>Death of Major General Van Dorn.  -  A True Story and Sad Enough.  -  The
Northern Version.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>The lieutenant, while we were resting at noon, was telling that he
was sent at one time on special duty and as a bearer of dispatches to
New Madrid in Southeastern Missouri. He said that, returning to
Nashville, he was accompanied by an old citizen of Spring Hill, a
village thirty miles, perhaps, southwest of Columbia, in Tennessee.
My newly made friend was a sensible, sturdy farmer, who, it seems,
had been a surgeon in the United States Army. His account of the
killing of the Confederate Major General Van Dorn greatly interested
me. I had been reading of this terrible affair in northern newspapers,
one of which stated truthfully that Van Dorn in all physical and social
respects was a perfect knight, belonging to the middle ages rather than
to modern times. He was quite young when killed,  -  perhaps
thirty-six,  -  but had been distinguished in the old army, before the
war, as a peerless Indian fighter. Marvelous statements are told of his
horsemanship and how he would ride down upon Commanches, <sic corr="Navajos">Navajahoes</sic>,
and other bands, sabering right and left.</p>
        <p>“On the field of battle he was the coolest man I ever saw,” said the
doctor. “Often when I have felt sick at the stomach and wanted to
compress my shoulders and ribs into a little space, I have seen Van
Dorn sit there under a rain of bullets, absolutely enjoying himself.
He was a knightly fellow to look at. His hair was a clear golden
color, and in natural ringlets, it fell around his shoulders and neck
and looked like a King Charles wig. He had a rich golden mustache
which sprung across the whole upper part of his face, and then he
wore a chin whisker. He had the softest blue eyes, clean-cut features,
and good teeth. He was rather below middle size and a splendid
horseman and man-at-arms. Besides, he could blush like a girl.
<pb id="dupre119" n="119"/>
This, with his winning address, made him absolutely irresistible
among women. Wherever he went, they gave way.</p>
        <p>“He was one of the few men in either army that could sing and
play musical instruments with a sweet, rich voice and accomplished
hand. He wrote poetry. In his dress he was neat as a pin. As
soon as he entered a household his bearing attracted, his address
delighted, his accomplishments made the women worship him, and I
am sorry to say that he was a lawless <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">roue</foreign></hi>.</p>
        <p>“His father was an old Mississippi judge, and I suppose of Dutch
descent. The old man was just about the son's size, and often used
to come over to our camp, and he was almost invariably full of
whiskey. One day he said to me, ‘Doctor, do you hear what some of
these chaps have been saying about me  -  that I drink a good deal of
whiskey? They don't know, doctor, what an unquenchable thirst I
have!’ Van Dorn had married in Alabama, I think, and his conduct
aggrieved his wife, although I believe she sent for his body after his
death and took it back to Alabama and buried it on her farm, in a
field, where I suppose he lies without a stone.</p>
        <p>“Doctor Peters was a practicing physician at Spring Hill. He had
married his second wife, considerably younger than himself  -  a giddy,
pretty woman. It was absolutely certain that when such a creature
should be seen by Van Dorn, and listened to him, there would be a
flirtation and perhaps an intrigue. It happened of course. Peters
was one of those silent, deadly men you meet with in Tennessee and
derivative states; he had a pair of cold gray eyes, which in ordinary
times were nearly expressionless, but would start up demoniacally.
Inflict a personal wrong on such a person and he would be worse than
an Indian. He had a lean, listless look, but turned into iron when
excited. Van Dorn came into this vicinity laboring under a bad
reputation. He had been accused of seducing two fair daughters of
Vicksburg, and it was said of him at Memphis that with the family of
a leading citizen there, mother and daughter, he had been treacherous.
Van Dorn didn't care about it. He lived in his own personality and
believed, to some extent, that all within his command was his. I
mention these facts to answer your question as to whether he was
much regarded. By those of his officers who had received his favors
and knew him intimately he was lamented, but by the general public
and by public opinion, I think not.</p>
        <p>“He rose very rapidly in the Mexican war from second lieutenant
to be a captain at Cerro Gordo and a major at Cherubusco. From
the very beginning he was one of the most dauntless officers in our
army. I think I am in error about his age. I believe he was born
in 1823. In 1858, in an attack on the Commanches, he killed fifty-six
Indians, and was dangerously wounded in four places. No man in
the old army was more intense in his devotion to slave property on
account of his family, marriage, birth, and temperament. As Early
as January, 1861, he resigned his commission, became a colonel in
the Confederate service, and took a leading part in Texas in capturing
<pb id="dupre120" n="120"/>
other regulars. He took the <hi rend="italics">Star of the West</hi> steamer, received the
sword of Major Sibley, and almost almost became a major
general, when he was put in charge of the Trans-Mississippi District.
He fought his leading battle, which was a reverse, at Pea Ridge.</p>
        <p>“Van Dorn was a favorite of Mr. Jefferson Davis, and had command
in the battle at Corinth, which was also unfortunate in results.
He was court-martialed at that time.</p>
        <p>“Afterward he had his head-quarters at Spring Hill several weeks.
I am of the belief that nothing criminal happened between himself
and this woman, Mrs. Peters, though I do not acquit him of bad
intentions. The woman, however, but recently wedded to Peters,
had sufficiently inspired his mind with the idea that a criminal intrigue
had commenced. Peters then deliberately arranged the assassination
of Van Dorn and his own escape. He established relays of horses to
carry him into the Federal lines by rapid flight. He went from his
house to Van Dorn's quarters, and, saying that he had some business
just inside the Federal lines, would like to have a pass to get through.
Probably glad to get him out of reach, with that interesting wife
behind him, Van Dorn cheerfully consented, and leaned forward on
his desk to write the pass, and signed his name to it. At this moment
Dr. Peters, leaning on the desk on his left hand, drew his pistol while
Van Dorn was leaning forward over his signature, and shot the
general through the spinal marrow at the back of the head. The
ball did not pierce the brain but produced paralysis, and he died in
two hours. Peters seized the pass, got on his horse, and was far on
the road to the Federal lines before it was discovered that Van Dorn
had been shot. One of his staff coming in, found him leaning over
the table muttering incoherently, and bleeding. They placed him on
a lounge and heard him say, ‘Peters has murdered me.’</p>
        <p>“Peters passed into the Federal lines. There it was no harm to
have killed Van Dorn. He was not molested. After the war it was
not thought proper to indict him for a murder committed during
hostilities under the circumstances. He condoned his wife's offence
at the end of the war, and took her back, and they moved to
Arkansas. In a little while the woman began to <foreign lang="fr">coquette</foreign> again, and
again aroused Peters' ire. He took her next supposed paramour by
the chin, with a bowie-knife in the other hand, and literally guillotined
him. That is the last known of Dr. Peters.”</p>
        <p>Such is the story that has been popularized in northern newspapers.
It is untrue in every respect. The assertion that Peters, after killing
Van Dorn, cut the throat of a lover of his wife in Arkansas is a sheer
fabrication. He is a quiet, sober, unobtrusive, educated gentleman,
and he and his wife have never been talked about save because of the
killing of Van Dorn. He was an ardent secessionist and had been a
leading member of the Tennessee legislature. After killing Van Dorn,
he fled to Nashville, pursued by Van Dorn's staff officers.</p>
        <p>“When he came to Nashville, I happened to be there,” continued
Lieutenant Hughes. “He was brought before General Rosecrans, to
<pb id="dupre121" n="121"/>
whom he applied for a passport to St. Louis. The general at first
refused because Peters had been a conspicuous secessionist in the
legislature of Tennessee. But Governor Brownlow and ex-Governor
William B. Campbell interposed in Peters' behalf, and the passport
was conceded.</p>
        <p>“Peters recited the story, in my presence, of the taking off of Van
Dorn. He suspected the progress of an intrigue. He knew Van Dorn's
character and Peters' wife was famed for her personal charms, exquisite
taste in dress, taste and coquetry. At Ben Weller's boarding
house, on Cherry Street in Nashville, where Brownlow and Campbell
lived, I heard Peters tell that he had suspected Van Dorn's infamous
purposes, and in order to satisfy himself as to the facts, he announced
his intention to be absent from home several days. He made every
preparation for a journey, but returned the night of the day of his
departure, and concealed himself in the ice-house, where he remained
till about midnight. He then heard Van Dorn's horse's feet and soon
afterward, the clanking of Van Dorn's heavy spurs as he came upon
the back porch. Van Dorn himself had given Peters a passport
through the Confederate lines, that he might enter Kentucky.</p>
        <p>“Peters ascended the ladder from the ice-pit, and looking out, beheld
Van Dorn's plumed hat. At this instant, as the Confederate chieftain
entered the house, admitted by the wife, Peters having a pistol in his
hand, was almost impelled to kill both the wife and her lover. But
instead, Peters only followed quietly, and telling Van Dorn, ‘Now,
you d--d <sic corr="scoundrel">scouudrel</sic>, I have caught you, but I will spare your life
and prevent gossip and the degradation of this woman and the stain
upon my fame if you will write and sign the statement that you have
corrupted my wife.’</p>
        <p>“Van Dorn hesitated, but the cold steel gleamed in Peters' eyes and
the cocked pistol was ready to do its deadly office, and Van Dorn
said, ‘I will sign the paper.’</p>
        <p>“Next morning Peters called at Van Dorn's marquee. Van Dorn
asked Peters what he proposed to do with the paper to be signed by
himself. Peters replied that its contents should never be known to
the public, but that he would take it to Richmond and learn whether
the Confederate government were base enough and so depraved that
it invested men with high offices and honors who professionally
debauched the wives and daughters of those serving the government,
however humbly, with tireless fidelity.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Van Dorn asked me,’ said Peters, ‘to wait till two o'clock, when
he would certainly execute the paper as I required. I am satisfied
now that he thought that my passion would be dispelled by the lapse
of a few hours and that he would easily escape the necessity I sought
to impose. At two, p. m., I was again at Van Dorn's tent. His
adjutant general was with him. This gentleman withdrew at once
and Van Dorn and I were alone together. I had not attempted to
kill Van Dorn in my own home and had postponed the final concession
of my exactions, and Van Dorn thought there was no risk at last in
<pb id="dupre122" n="122"/>
refusing to do as he had promised. I had the fleetest, finest horse in
Tennessee at hand. I did not know what was coming and did not intend,
in any event, to be caught by Van Dorn's stipendiaries and clerks.</p>
        <p>“ ‘When I approached Van Dorn, he said, quietly, that he had
concluded not to give me any such “G--d d--d paper” as I
required. Then I answered,’ said Peters, “You are a d-d
scoundrel,” and shot him before he rose up. The bullet, I think,
broke his neck. I rode several hundred yards before the alarm was
given. Van Dorn's staff-officers and several soldiers pursued me. I
don't think they were very anxious to catch me. I could not have
been taken alive and was so armed that I was dangerous, and they
knew it.’</p>
        <p>“But Rosecrans was finally induced, as I have stated,” said the
lieutenant, “by Governor Brownlow and ex-Governor W. B. Campbell
to grant the passport asked for by Peters, and the reason given
was that though Peters was a devout secessionist and for this might
properly be hanged, yet he had done God and the country such a service,
by ridding the earth of Van Dorn, that Peters deserved well of his
country and race. Peters did not believe that his wife was debauched
but Van Dorn's criminality was none the less. He did not even
deny his purpose. Peters' forbearance grew out of this fact and
that other that he sought to evade scandal-mongers and newspaper
notoriety.”</p>
        <p>It is needless to say that, like the lieutenant, his listeners approved
Dr. Peters' conduct; and, therefore, the people concurring with us in
opinion, Dr. Peters was never prosecuted.</p>
        <p>This story is told not made because of its reference to prominent
men of the war period; but, like many other narratives in this
volume, to illustrate the force and direction and training of public
opinion in the South.</p>

        <p>The pedagogue was a delightful <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">raconteur</foreign></hi>. Though his stories were
tinctured always, and naturally enough, with his political prejudices,
we were never offended. In fact, the old Whigs and Union men
in the Confederate service often gave expression to views never 
tolerated among officers and placeholders. With the common soldiers
the people sympathized, and when, in 1863-4, the whole country was
singing a lackadaisical, sorrowful ditty, with the refrain,</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“When this cruel war is over,</l>
          <l>Maryland, my Maryland!”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>the people were thoroughly beaten. There was nothing to commend
the horrible, dolorous ditty except its invocation of peace, and yet
every child, negro, and woman was singing it. Men went humming it
to the fields and workshops, and soldiers, catching the sickly, pitiful
melody, that over-ran more pitiful words, deserted their colors till Mr.
Jefferson Davis, at Macon, Georgia, announced, in the spring or early
summer of 1864, that two-thirds of his soldiers had deserted their
colors. It made one's heart sick to hear everywhere of the woes of
military despotism and this heart-rending cry for peace that came
welling up in this wretched song from the great fountain of popular
griefs. The vigorous, heroic verses of Father Ryan, of Lide Merriwether,
and of Harry Timrod, and John Mitchell's eloquent portrayal
of the woes of “conquered” Ireland, availed nothing. The common
people persistently sang the dolorous ditty, and the Confederacy was
undone. Spratling began to recite, “Maryland, my Maryland,” his
<pb id="dupre124" n="124"/>
deep, strong, musical voice investing the monotonous music with a
share of attractiveness, when the schoolmaster quoted the philosopher
who said that “he is master of the country who writes its songs and
not he who makes its laws.” Spratling was silenced and the pedagogue
began to tell of the marvelous campaign of moral effects to
which he had alluded in former conversations. He said that Leadbetter,
in Eastern Tennessee, a <sic corr="Confederate">Confedederate</sic> Department Commander, in
1862-3, was weak, violent, and tyrannical. The post commander at
Knoxville, Morrisette, was an artillery officer. He had been reared a
banker's clerk, was a speculator, broker, and auctioneer. He had
never fired a gun or pistol, and when appointed captain of artillery
and given in charge six, and then twelve, field-pieces, had never seen
a battery. Of course he knew absolutely nothing of gunnery or of
artillery drill and practice. He selected as his first lieutenant one
Baker, an <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">eleve</foreign></hi> of a German military school and an adept in the art of
war. I used to attend the dress parades of this “Morrisette Battery”
to watch the captain's efforts to catch the whispered words of command
given by Baker. Then Morrisette would repeat the words in the
swelling, sonorous accents of a brigadier. When the “manual of the
piece” was gone through with and duties of dress parade were discharged,
then Morrisette, arrayed in all the feathers and toggery of
glorious war and mounted on a magnificent charger, would lead his
battery, guns, caissons, and men and horses through the streets of
staring, wondering Knoxville.</p>
        <p>Morrisette told me that the “moral effect upon the disloyal population
of the place was very fine.” I used to think the moral effect of
Leadbetter's profuse administration of the oath of loyalty most
unfortunate. In this, Morrisette concurred. But Leadbetter was singularly
well pleased when Morrisette's polished guns went gleaming through
the streets in the gorgeous sunlight of East Tennessee. Bootblacks,
newsboys, and idlers about the bar-rooms swore roundly, when
Morrisette strutted by, that his was the finest, bravest battery
in the world.</p>
        <p>Morrisette would look neither to the right nor left. He was intent
on duty. His bosom was swelling with emotions of purest patriotism.
He was the impersonation of lofty aspirations, and every inch a soldier.
He was small of stature, had a huge nose and little legs, and dressed
gorgeously. While Morrisette was thus appealing to the fears of
Union men, Leadbetter was briskly imprisoning their consciences by
“swearing them in,” and East Tennessee was slowly lapsing, it
seemed, into secessionism.</p>
        <p>The jail, meanwhile, was full to overflowing. A magistrate of the
place named Tillson, a vulgar, ignorant, noisy, whiskey-drinking
fellow, became the partner of a vigorous lawyer of the town. A
cavalry commander was also interested in the cruel, nefarious business.</p>
        <p>The magistrate asserting jurisdiction in political cases, mountains
and valleys were searched and every suspected individual was arrested,
without warrant, by the cavalryman Blackburne and brought before
<pb id="dupre125" n="125"/>
the red-haired “squire.” This grave and solemn sot always advised
“culprits” to see the “great and good lawyer,” who managed to scare
simple people till they gave him all their money. Now and then he
acquired a pretty farm in compensation for arduous “professional
services.”</p>
        <p>I was at the Lamar House late in the afternoon, when Blackburne,
the lawless myrmidon of the squire, brought in twenty or more
“disloyal people.” Colonel Casey Young, now an ex-M. C. and then
Adjutant General on the staff of Brigadier General William H. Carroll,
happened to be on the street when Blackburne came with his
prisoners. He was accustomed to deliver them to Fox, the jailor,
another “good and true man” of the period, so called in official
papers at department headquarters. Dismayed and helpless, these
Union men were moving toward Fox's dungeons. Colonel Young
addressed one of them, an intelligent preacher  -  a presbyterian, I
think. I heard him say that he had been teaching school and preaching
and had nothing to do with war; that he never spoke of it, but
devoted himself to the service of God, his church, and his pupils.
Colonel Young at once instructed the guards to leave this gentleman
at the hotel. It was understood that the facts affecting his arrest
would be investigated next morning. The preacher's two daughters,
charming girls, had followed him to Knoxville. Late at night they
came weeping to Colonel Young's apartment. The lawyer and the
jailor, Fox, were in their father's room. They had given the lawyer
a thousand dollars in gold which they had brought from home to save
their father from Fox's clutches. The lawyer demanded more.</p>
        <p>Young, half dressed, went to the preacher's room. The lawyer had
disappeared, but the pug-nosed, squarely built jailor was with the
prisoner, and in the act of leading him to jail, as instructed by the
justice of the peace at the instigation of the learned lawyer. Young
ordered Fox to leave the hotel, telling him that if he imprisoned
political offenders under a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">mittimus</foreign></hi> from a state court, he (Young) would
have him shot. Fox slunk away; but the lawyer still enjoys riches that
sprang from the hard-earned $1,000 filched from these pretty
presbyterian girls.</p>
        <p>Next morning I visited the jail. Young had frightened Fox, who
was a cringing supplicant when I entered the prison yard. He was
made to understand how he was violating the law in obeying the
magistrate's decrees. Fox said that a prominent lawyer of the town
(naming him) was the magistrate's adviser, and that he, the poor jailor,
knew nothing about it. On the contrary, Fox robbed each prisoner
mercilessly, and starved those who were without money, so they
stated, remorselessly. Those suspected of having money or known to
have rich friends were consigned to the iron cage till Fox's exactions
were complied with. Mr. William Hunt, many years clerk and
master of the chancery court at Cleveland, was robbed of four thousand
dollars by Fox and his associates in the nefarious business. Mr. Hunt
said that a secessionist furnished him part of the money with which he
<pb id="dupre126" n="126"/>
finally bought his liberty. There was never a jailor so abhorred by
prisoners as this man Fox. I may do him injustice, since I tell what
I heard from his victims. I would not wrong his memory, but there
was joy in many modest homes in bright, peaceful valleys of East
Tennessee when Burnside captured Fox at Bristol and consigned him
to his own iron box in the jail at Knoxville. A few days later, when
the turnkey made his usual rounds, he found Fox dead in his cage.
Nobody seemed to care about it, and I never learned whether he
committed suicide, as was rumored, or died of terror. He feared,
when he fled from Knoxville, that the people of East Tennessee would
wreak vengeance upon him for the outrages and robberies practiced
by himself, the lawyer, the magistrate, and the cavalry leader. Hence
the story that he took poison. The magistrate of whom I tell died a
frightful death in Texas. Raving mad, tortured by visions of helpless
women begging for mercy for those they loved, pursued by
hideous phantoms to which whiskey gives birth and clothes with
nameless terrors, the wretched man cursed God and himself and was
no more. The lawyer, who profited most by the crimes of Fox and
the justice of the peace, still lives, but not in Knoxville.</p>
        <p>Among prisoners at this time in Fox's charge was William G.
Brownlow, afterward governor and United States Senator. He was
emaciated to the last degree. I remember that he showed me a
“running seaton” on his breast and said that his condition was such
that, if he were not taken from the cold, comfortless prison and
supplied with better food, he would soon die. In the same apartment
with Mr. Brownlow were many farmers, Confederate deserters, and
all classes of people, victims of Fox's cupidity. Colonel Young, in
conversing with these people, became satisfied that their imprisonment
was needless as well as lawless and wrongful. The next day there was
a general jail delivery. Brownlow himself was sent to his residence
on Cumberland Street, and not many weeks later, when his health
was somewhat improved, in charge of an escort commanded by
Colonel Young and Captain O'Brien, he was sent through Chattanooga
and Shelbyville to Nashville, then occupied by Union armies.
Curious, staring, wondering, and untraveled southern soldiers hearing
that the famous editor, preacher, and Unionist, Brownlow, was on
the train at Chattanooga, sought to discover his identity. One of
them, bolder than the rest, gained access to Brownlow's car and asked
Brownlow himself, pale, wan, and mild-mannered as he was, to designate
the terrible parson. Brownlow pointed to Colonel Young.
“Johnny Reb” stared at Young a moment most intently and then,
drawing a long sigh, exclaimed:</p>
        <p>“Well it beats Judas Iscariot, by G--d.”</p>
        <p>Brownlow laughed till his life was almost despaired of, but I never
heard that Colonel Young, confessedly good-looking as he is, enjoyed
the joke.</p>
        <p>I began this story to illustrate evils incident to military
government conducted with a view to moral rather than physical results.</p>
        <pb id="dupre127" n="127"/>
        <p>Morrisette and Leadbetter proposed to achieve the conquest of East
Tennessee by every species of moral force, in which the one would
make a parade of power, the other employing moral suasion. In both
instances there was only a grand parade. Neither ever snuffed the
breath of battle. When that fatal day at Fishing Creek dawned upon
the hapless South, when Zollicoffer fell, a part of Morrisette's battery
escaped from the wreck, but Morrisette himself was still commanding
the fort and holding it bravely one hundred and fifty miles away, at
Knoxville. When those daring, adventurous men who were hanged
in Atlanta seized the railway train at Big Shanty, below Chattanooga,
and leaving the passengers at breakfast, came north, tearing away
bridges and culverts behind them that General Mitchell might capture
Chattanooga, it being impossible to draw reinforcements from the
south, Leadbetter was in Chattanooga almost frightened to death.
He was never nearer the enemy or in greater danger than on that
occasion. Of his conduct and of a memorable incident that befell the
ragged town of that day the reader has been informed.</p>
        <p>But Morrisette and Leadbetter in Knoxville finally grew weary of
inaction. The latter found the task of ceaseless administration of
oaths of loyalty tiresome. The people had already pronounced it
exceedingly monotonous. Morrisette's battery  -  that portion of it
which did not accompany Crittenden and Zollicoffer to Fishing
Creek  -  when it went rattling and roaring along the stony streets of
Knoxville, no longer attracted the slightest attention. In this
desperate condition of affairs, Morrisette planned a grand expedition
into Chucky Valley. Along the little river of this name, were pretty
farms and delightful homes. Here, in Washington County, David
Crockett was born, and the people were devoted to the “old flag.”</p>
        <p>They had never seen the new, and loved the Federal Union as our
fathers made it. They were sons and grandsons of men who
fought at King's Mountain and Eutaw Court-House. Their prayer
was to be let alone. They were unwilling to fight their neighbors
and kindred and had pledged themselves, in private conversations at
methodist and baptist meeting-houses, never to strike down the stars
and stripes. In every house there was Weems' “Life of Washington,”
Jefferson's “Notes on Virginia,” the <hi rend="italics">National Intelligencer</hi>, and
Brownlow's <hi rend="italics">Whig</hi>. Morrisette and Leadbetter had often been told of
the charms of Chucky Valley and of the devout Unionism of the
people. The two Confederate chieftains, wielding absolute power in
East Tennessee, conferred secretly about it. With profound solemnity
and injunctions of secrecy, they held several councils of war.
They consulted Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Green, the rollicking,
fun-loving leader of a half-drilled, half-armed regiment encamped at
Knoxville. All, for one or another reason, approved the grand
scheme of Morrisette and Leadbetter, and it was agreed to show the
innocent dwellers along the banks of the bright and brawling Chucky
how great and powerful was the mighty Richmond government.
<pb id="dupre128" n="128"/>
Chucky Valley would thenceforth be ashamed that it had dreamed of
resistance to the authority of Jefferson Davis.</p>
        <p>Bill Carter was from Nashville. He was brave. He had fought
many battles, in each of which he fell, but rose again, only to fall
whenever he met his mortal enemy. Whiskey slew him at last in a
frightful conflict that occurred in Knoxville.  Bill was found dead one
morning in the gutter, his eyes bloodshot, hair matted, clothes in
tatters, and shoes, like those who gave him whiskey, soleless. He was
reared a lawyer and thoroughly educated. He was the only child of
his parents, inherited a good estate, and won a beautiful wife. Five
years afterward, Bill was as a beggar and his wife soon happily divorced
by Bill's death.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, Bill was General Crittenden's orderly. Crittenden
loved Bill for his weaknesses as well as wit. There were broad realms
of sympathy in which they met. Both worshipped Bacchus. Bill
was uglier than this god, who had distorted Bill's features. A horse
had kicked and broken the lower maxillary bone on one side of his
face, and a drunken Patlander had fractured the same bone on the
other, and the two sides of this jaw-bone had been separated from one
another until the lower part of Bill's face was a foot wide. His long
nose was pressed upward by toothless gums. He ate with difficulty
and, therefore, drank enormously. But he talked well and wittily.
The slightest provocation to mirth emanating from a hairy turtle set up
on end would surely provoke infinite laughter, and Bill's face had
been compressed and widened till one always had visions of turtle
soup while Bill poured forth the contents of an exhaustless vocabulary.
Bill, in Crittenden's absence, had attached himself, as a sort of
volunteer aide-de-camp, to Morrisette. In fact I heard him telling
Morrisette, with great solemnity that he would be his Sancho Panza in the
coming Chucky campaign.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Colonel Hugh Green had about six hundred good men.
Of these Leadbetter took command. Leadbetter insisted that he must
have artillery. Morrisette, giving him two brass six-pounders, had
four left, in charge of about one hundred men. They moved slowly
across the country from Morristown, firing morning and evening
guns. The roar of artillery, both commanders insisted, exercised a
fine “moral effect” upon a rebellious people.</p>
        <p>It may be proper to state that I did not participate in this most
eventful and disastrous campaign. I am indebted for the facts to
memoranda made by Morrisette and to recitals of those who returned
safely to Knoxville.</p>
        <p>Having reached the seat of war, Morrisette followed the course of
the River, while Leadbetter marched on a parallel and converging
line three miles from the stream. Morrisette moved along the base of
mountainous precipices next to the river, the shining guns reflected in
its crystal waters. Leadbetter and Lieutenant Colonel Green, on steeds
splendidly caparisoned, and in all the pomp and circumstance of
glorious war, went careering across the country. They were stared at
<pb id="dupre129" n="129"/>
by women, and unkempt, wondering children. Fearing conscription,
the men of the country, it was observed by the leaders of the
expedition, were never visible. It was concluded at first that they had
fled into the mountains; and, secondly, that an attack by night upon
the forces of the Confederacy was contemplated by the innocent
country bumpkins of Chucky Valley.</p>
        <p>Soon after the sun went down, the moon, full-orbed, came up in
gorgeous glory. The air is clearer in East Tennessee  -  bereft of
moisture, as it is, by mountains on every hand  -  than elsewhere in the
United States. It may be as transparent for like reasons in Western
Texas and Southern Colorado, but the stars are brighter and the moon
shines more lustrously down into the valleys and gilds the hills, and
sheds a softer, sweeter radiance upon the rivers of East Tennessee,
investing mountains and valleys with a diviner splendor, than elsewhere
in America. When moon and stars were borne away on bounding,
sparkling waves of the boisterous river, Morrisette, unconsciously
charmed by the scene and wedded to the spot, turned majestically in
his saddle and ordered a halt. The air of November was cold, clear,
and crisp, and the soldiers soon lighted fires along the perpendicular
banks of the rapid river. Twenty feet away the mountains rose up
precipitously, almost overhanging the stream. In the next valley,
two and a half miles distant, Leadbetter and Green had encamped.
It soon occurred to Morrisette, who sat like Agamemnon, gloomily
in his tent, that he had selected unwisely a spot for his resting place.
“Lincolnites,” as adherents of the Union were termed in the vulgar
partisan jargon of the time, might readily overwhelm him and even
crush his beautiful brass field-pieces by rolling stones down the mountain
sides. A bird, disturbed by the flames in the valley, rose out of its
nest, and countless stones, their number growing as they descended,
almost overwhelmed Morrisette's pretty test. He could not sleep.
That Leadbetter might know where he was, he ordered a field-piece
to be discharged.</p>
        <p>The concussion shook the hills, and countless stones came leaping
into the valley. Leadbetter, inferring that Morrisette was assailed,
fired his guns that the enemy might be aware of his presence and
power. Morrisette's guns responded; and thus, in the solemn, still,
bright November night of 1861, was the “Campaign of Moral Effects”
signalized by furious cannonading in the silent, happy valley of
Chucky. The listening people, thinking the rebels amused themselves
wasting gunpowder, slept well. But Morrisette and Leadbetter were
thoroughly alarmed. Each believed the other involved in a desperate
conflict, and both fired away furiously. At length each was silent
that he might hear from the other and profound stillness rested upon
river, mountains, and valley.</p>
        <p>It was after midnight when Morrisette's soldiers slept nervously
beside camp fires and guns. He himself was haunted by the demon
of unrest. He was not satisfied that bushwhackers were not hidden
among the stunted cedars and great stones on mountain sides above 
<pb id="dupre130" n="130"/>
his head. His nerves were unstrung, and he wandered forth to assure
himself that sentinels were at their posts.</p>
        <p>He had seen the one most distant from his encampment and was
coming away when he heard the voice of Bill Carter. He stopped
and saw Carter proffer a canteen to the sentinel. The musket
dropped, the canteen was eloquent, and Carter and the sentinel silent.
Carter's canteen thus gave the countersign. He entered, having a
dozen like it filled with whiskey and brandy distilled in the mountains.
Carter was heavily freighted, too, with fowls. Morrisette watched
him as he staggered into the encampment. He reeled along and
soon slept soundly beside a glowing camp fire. An orderly named
Villere was dispatched to Carter's resting place with instructions to
empty the canteens, otherwise half of the command would become
intoxicated before breakfast. Villere, finding Carter asleep, baptised
him and the chickens in whiskey and brandy. Carter's clothes, hair,
and whiskers were thoroughly saturated.</p>
        <p>Villere and his master at last rested, and Carter slept profoundly.</p>
        <p>Carter's baptised birds were not comfortable. They fluttered about
the fire, and at length, blue flames danced over one and then another
of the frightened, roasting poultry, fastened to Carter by cords that
confined their legs. Lambent blue lights danced at last over his
garments and played over his thick, heavy hair and whiskers. He
screamed, rose up, blinded, frightened, and dumfounded. Each
chicken was a fluttering great blue torch-light, and a column of blue
flame rose far above Carter's head. He shrieked and ran blindly
along the river's edge. Sentinels fired their guns. Every man was
on his feet.</p>
        <p>The devil, robed in flames, fresh from abodes of the damned, was
before their eyes. Carter's senses partially restored, he leaped into
the river. But the encampment was “stampeded.” Everybody
sought to be first to escape from the infernal presence. Morrisette
and Villere alone knew that Carter, wrapped in flickering blue flames
of alcohol, innocently personated the Evil One. There was no time
for explanations. “The devil take the hindmost,” was the literal
impulse that moved Morrisette's unlettered command. It was hopelessly
dispersed. All efforts to rally the discomfited soldiery were unavailing.</p>
        <p>When straggling soldiers of the dispersed battery, engaged in the
grand “Campaign of Moral Effects,” came in pairs and trios, ragged,
hungry, and foot-sore, into Knoxville, I enquired eagerly for news
from their noble commander. His soldiers were unwilling to talk.</p>
        <p>“Where is your captain? Where is your battery? What has
been the fate of the military expedition?” the first ever organized
without the remotest design of hurting anybody.</p>
        <p>I finally induced a moody, silent Irishman who had utterly
refused to talk, to accompany me to my private apartment. I gave
him a gill of whiskey, and promising another, asked him what had happened.</p>
        <pb id="dupre131" n="131"/>
        <p>The Irishman's face wore an aspect of profound melancholy. I had
never before seen, outside of the confessional, a truly solemn
Irishman. But, wiping his lips with his sleeve, and with wide open
eyes, Mike said:</p>
        <p>“Captain, we won't talk because nobody will belave us; but may the
divel saze me if I didn't see him, wid eyes like braziers, breathing
blue flames as he rose up out of the earth. He sazed the captain and
ran away wid him, and laped into the river wid him, and the water
biled. He shook the mountain, and stones and trees fell down upon
us. Nobody but these you see here got away. Our guns and horses
are all gone. The divel flew away wid 'em. The men fired at him,
and bullets made holes through him, but he walked away all the same
down the river and laped in at last, as I was tellin' ye.”</p>
        <p>I asked Mike if it were possible that a campaign planned to produce
“grand moral effects” had ended in a disgraceful drunken debauch.</p>
        <p>Mike answered that there was not a drunken soldier in Chucky
Valley.</p>
        <p>I sent Mike for his associates in flight. They came and concurred
in all that he had said. Each had seen a gigantic figure,
clothed in blue flames, countless little angelic devils fluttering about
it, rise out of the earth, shake the everlasting hills, and disappear
in the blue waves of Chucky River. I was puzzled. Twelve sane,
sober men, each examined separately, testified, with profound
earnestness and unwillingly, to the same extraordinary facts. These
men never dreaming of desertion came as frightened fugitives from a
terrible battle field. The Irishman was not free from superstition.
His religion was mystical and vague, as well as formal and ceremonial.
He was heard to say that if the devil was with the South, he would go
north. He soon crossed the mountains, and afterward, in fighting
the South, never doubted, I imagine, that he was “whackin” the
devil that appeared in Chucky Valley.</p>
        <p>Some weeks elapsed, after the return of Leadbetter and Morrisette
with the wreck of their demoralized forces, before any demonstration
of military ardor was made. Leadbetter was less vehement and less
active and earnest in administering oaths of loyalty than when
planning the Chucky campaign. Morrisette's vanity had been sorely
wounded. The people would talk and laugh. Bill Carter would
pretend to be very drunk, and hairless and whiskerless as he was, his
face terribly scarred by flames of alcohol that almost consumed his
life, sauntered about head-quarters, reciting criticisms he heard in
bar-rooms. Bill was the great sufferer. He was, too, the innocent
cause of the utter discomfiture and dissolution of Morrisette's
command. He hated Morrisette because he had ordered Villere to empty
the whiskey-filled canteens. He had witnessed the flight of Morrisette's
terrified men. Though he had been painfully, and even  dangerously
burned and thoroughly frightened, he comprehended and enjoyed
the supreme absurdity of the expedition. He sat many nights,
surrounded by half-drunken listeners, telling with infinite
<pb id="dupre132" n="132"/>
delight, of the marvelous “Campaign of Moral Effects.” Everybody in
Knoxville had laughed again and again when Bill Carter, as chief of staff
and Morrisette's Sancho Panza, recounted the story of absurd
adventures. Morrisette knew all this, and for a time shrank from public
gaze. Leadbetter was moody, violent, and silent. But the pair of heroes
finally talked the matter over. They had heard of Bill Carter's eloquent
descriptions of the overthrow of the battery and discussed the
propriety of having Carter consigned to the tender mercies of Fox, the
jailor.</p>
        <p>But this would not silence Carter. He must be shot or conciliated.
Pacific measures were preferred, and Carter was supplied with whiskey,
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">ad libitum</foreign></hi>. He advised Morrisette to put on a bold face and show that
he was unaffected by the absurd disaster. The result was that a grand
dress parade was ordered for the next Sunday.</p>
        <p>It came, a cold December morning, when church bells were ringing
and people, arrayed in the finery of peace, already fading in the
presence of war, were going in pairs along the sunny streets. Morrisette's
battery, guns, caissons, horses, and men rattled and roared over
the stony roadway from the hills in the suburbs down into the valley,
ascending Gay Street into Knoxville.</p>
        <p>Idlers in throngs sauntered leisurely along the side-walks while
Morrisette, glittering with gold lace and bestriding his gaily
caparisoned war horse, led the gorgeous column.</p>
        <p>It was a sad day for Morrisette. It was long to be remembered by
many dwellers in Knoxville. He led the battery toward University Place,
and turning to re-enter Gay Street, a caisson, filled with gunpowder and
shells exploded. What caused the disaster no one ever knew. All the
shells were not exploded at once, but forced in all directions, at
intervals hurled fragments of iron into the air and into houses.
Morrisette's men fled, as, not long before, in Chucky Valley. The battery
was again dissolved. Artillerymen leaped from horses and from
ammunition chests and hurried away. Morrisette, overcome, as he
afterward explained, by “grief” and “rage,” dismounted and in a private
residence found relief in whiskey. Two men and four horses were killed
and many persons injured, while Morrisette was so unnerved that he
was unable to bestride his steed.</p>
        <p>He had enlisted only for a year, and his term of service expiring in
1862, he retired to private life.</p>
        <p>Poor Bill! His hair and whiskers had been burned off by flames of
alcohol in Chucky Valley. His eyelids hideously red, he was of horrible
aspect. Men gave him money to induce him to leave their presence. It
was painful to look upon him, and therefore was he supplied with means
of endless inebriety. The end came, as I have stated, and Bill, not long
afterward, died in the gutter.</p>

          <p>The Newspaper Man Tells of Recent Designations of the Route of De Soto.  -  His
Apothecary's Scales and Nest of Horseshoes.  -  The Monk's Rosary.  -  Governor
Gilmer's Castilian Dagger Handle.  -  Outline of De Soto's Route Defined.  -  His Burial Place.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>“A taste for archæological inquiries was rapidly developed, even in
this country, until Dickens ridiculed its devotees mercilessly and
successfully in his Pickwick Papers; but gentlemen of taste, learning,
and leisure, like Alexander B. Meek, Benj. F. Porter, Joseph B. Cobb, and
especially the late Governor and United States Senator from this State,
George R. Gilmer, were devoted to the prosecution of inquiries affecting
primeval dwellers in America. I was reading a paragraph to-day,” said
the journalist, “in the <hi rend="italics">Tallahassee</hi> (Fla.) <hi rend="italics">Sentinel</hi>, that tells of the
discovery, two miles from that city, of a Spanish horseman's heavy spur.
On either side of the rowel, an inch and a half in diameter, little bells
dangled. Such spurs are still used in Mexico, and, I presume, in Spain.
More recently a farmer plowing in the field, and near the spot at which
the spur was found, unearthed a solid, shapeless mass, which proved to
be a bronze stirrup, of heavy, ancient pattern. It is as massive, relatively,
as the spur. This stirrup was firmly imbedded in the ground, and thick
coatings of rust enveloped it. Raised figures on the stirrup still stood
out in strong relief. Its sides are Ethiopian statuettes, facing each other,
and leaning forward till they almost meet. Their uplifted clasped hands
hold the leathern strap that attached the stirrup to the saddle. The
Florida editor says: 'So unlike are both these relics to anything known
to this generation, and, both being found near the same place, it is not
unreasonable to ascribe them to the same era and artisan. Nor is the
supposition at all improbable that one of the knightly followers of De
Soto was allured on through this then unknown region and wilderness,
<pb id="dupre134" n="134"/>
like that dauntless son of Spain, by a thirst for yellow heaps of gleaming gold
that loomed up ahead of them in vain visions and heated fancies<sic corr=".">,</sic> Here he fell a
victim to the tomahawk  and scalping-knife of the wronged and revengeful red
man; and, no doubt, some one of the “Tallahassee Tribe,” of which “Tiger Tail”
claimed to be a descendant, boasted, as he displayed at his belt a yet bloody
scalp, that he had here killed a pale-face.'</p>
        <p>“Beyond the fact that trifling discoveries of this character define with a share
of probable accuracy the route of De Soto, they have little value, and yet to
such an extent is the taste for the old and curious indulged, that I am told I
cannot secure this old stirrup and spur save at great cost. My purpose was to
send models of them to Castelar, the Spanish scholar and statesman, that he
might discover when and where such spurs and stirrups were manufactured. We
should not forget, while noting the spot at which such remains of De Soto are
found, that Indians may have stolen and lost this property of Spaniards, and it
is not impossible that some Floridian, who served in the Mexican war of 1846-47,
may have brought the spur and stirrup from Mexico. Are there such evidences
of decay that this supposition cannot be well founded?</p>
        <p>“After Governor Gilmer had served many years in each branch of the United
States Congress, he devoted his old age to the perfection of an archæological and
mineralogical cabinet. When a boy, I was often at his attractive home in the
ancient village of Lexington, Georgia. The Spanish consul at Charleston visited
the venerable statesman, who was not well enough to designate for the stranger
the wonders of the cabinet. Of this I was telling the curious Spaniard all I knew,
when he stopped me suddenly, and holding up a blood-red, beautiful carnelian
between his fingers, asked whence it came. I had heard Governor Gilmer tell that
it was plowed up by a negro in a field near Macon, Georgia. I remembered, too,
that the governor had paid ten dollars for the stone and an old musket stock
found about the same time, near the same spot. The stone was perforated
longitudinally. Its length was about five and a half or six inches, and its
transverse diameter about one and a half inches. The stone was very beautiful,
but Governor Gilmer had no conception of its design as shaped, or of its value.
He often wondered why it was so deftly carved and what old race of artisans did
this cunning work. He said it was strange that such an old-fashioned musket
stock had been unearthed near the same spot.</p>
        <p>“ ‘This,’ said the Spaniard, as I conducted him to Governor Gilmer's
private apartment, ‘is a Castilian dagger handle. Very few were ever made.
Noblemen of Spain wore them there four hundred years ago.’ Brilliant light, in
Governor Gilmer's eyes, fell from the Spaniard's lips upon the pretty carnelian.
It shone with lustrous glory as the stranger held it in the bright sunbeams falling
through the open window, and flooding the apartment. The gleaming stone
became as eloquent as beautiful, and Governor Gilmer deemed it invaluable. It
<pb id="dupre135" n="135"/>
may not be improper to say that a few years ago I caused the cabinet of
Governor Gilmer, now the property of the University of Georgia, at Athens, to
be examined by Mrs. General King, of Chalky Level, that I might photograph
the stone and publish its history in <hi rend="italics">Harper's Monthly</hi>. The carnelian
dagger handle had disappeared. It could not be used or exposed in this country.
There is not another like it. Is it not barely probable that it finally found its
way, through Charleston, back to Spain? Though I was a little boy at the time,
I remember how eagerly that courtly gentleman, the Spanish consul, with his
great lustrous black eyes devoured that brilliant stone. But any rude soldier of
this dreary age would have deported such a carnelian for its beauty and
uniqueness.</p>
        <p>“From old books gathered in the admirably well-selected and costly library
of the University of Alabama, of about 150,000 volumes, I had gathered a share of
information affecting religious creeds and 'superstitions,' as we are pleased to
term them, of Oriental peoples.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2">*</ref> I had read of the crude faith that clings
everywhere to the horseshoe as an emblem of good fortune. Our ancestors, as
do we, through many centuries, persisted in hanging old horseshoes over
gateways. Lord Nelson sailed into the battle of the Nile with a horseshoe nailed
to the masthead of his ship. Recently, the vague, undefined superstition has
gathered fresh vigor<sic corr=".">,</sic> Young gentlemen, strangely enough, have scarf pins
fashioned after horseshoes, Fairest dames, more wonderfully, knowing not
what they do, deck miniature horseshoes with brightest jewels, worn as
amulets. Old horseshoes, found in the highway, are gilded with gold and
suspended over mantels in fashionable <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">salons</foreign></hi> of wealth and taste. Hindu
maidens originally set the example. They have muttered prayers, through many
centuries, looking to the horseshoe as the vehicle of supreme delights. Who can
tell in what facts the vague, but universally accepted superstition had origin?
What does it signify, and what is this significance? The Eastern and Asian
origin of the Irish race has been asserted, because Irishmen are especially
addicted to that faith in the capacity of old horseshoes to ward off evil which
obtained among Phœnecians everywhere in the Orient. It was not a horseshoe,
as such, that won, originally, this superstitious regard. But the horseshoe either
represented the crescent moon or probably symbolized that depraved nature-
worship practiced by devotees of Siva in Hindustan. I saw Spratling pluck a
worn-out horseshoe from its deep burial place in the roadway only yesterday,
and carefully suspend it from the body of the oak beneath which he slept. He
said his father did such things, and he only followed in his footsteps.</p>
        <p>“But all this is simply a prelude to an account of two discoveries,

<pb id="dupre136" n="136"/>
supposed to define De Soto's route from Florida to Arkansas and
Texas.</p>
        <p>“William Richardson is an old and intelligent citizen of Pickens
County, in Eastern Alabama. Plowing in his field along an old roadway,
not many miles from the little village of Yorkville, and, perhaps, twenty
miles east of Columbus, Mississippi, he unearthed a package of twelve
rust-eaten horseshoes. They were superimposed upon one another in
the edge of this old roadway which was used at some period and by
some race before Mr. Richardson was born, and before his farm was
cleared and cultivated. I have what is left, by the corroding tooth of time,
of one of these horseshoes. It is quite one-half broader than a modern
horseshoe. It had no ‘heel’ and no groove or depression for the heads of
the nails. We are not told by any chronicler of De Soto's wanderings and
battles how his horses were shod or that he brought horseshoes from
Europe and I am curious to know whether horseshoes of this
description were made three hundred and fifty years ago in Spain. Since
Indians never shod ponies, and no army ever invaded Pickens County,
and these iron platings were designed for the hoofs of the largest horses
and not for Indian ponies, and Mr. Richardson and his neighbors were
always puzzled about the origin of the queer old rust-eaten horseshoes.
Dr. Alexander Agnew, a gentleman of singular learning and literary taste,
living in Richardson's neighborhood, carefully preserved the ‘relic’ which
I have. It gained value in his eves when he learned that in the same old
roadway several miles west of Richardson's and near the village of
Yorkville, another discovery had been made which
shed light upon the mystery attached to the horseshoes and to the origin
of the ‘old road.’ Indians made no roads, only ‘paths,’ and yet here was a
road evidently carved out as a wagon-way, its outlines perpetuated by
rain-falls along the hill-sides, in primeval forests and beside this old
road, at the foot of a hill, and at a bright, sparkling spring, perhaps
seven or eight miles from Richardson's farm, a pair of apothecary's
scales were found. A great chestnut tree was blown down, shown by
consecutive rings of annual production to have been more than two
hundred and fifty years old. It had drawn its life from the fountain of
which I tell, and fell that a thirsty farmer might find the scales, guarded
through centuries beneath its roots. The scales themselves and the
weights, having on them Spanish inscriptions and numerals naming the
King of Spain and the Pope of the period, and dated, if I remember
accurately, 1534, had rested two and three feet below the earth's surface,
and below the great tree, from the day the thirsty Spanish
pharmaceutist, who accompanied De Soto, drank, and ate chestnuts at
this spot. The tree sprang up. Its roots covered and guarded the scales till
the tempest overthrew this monarch of the forest. The farmer, Mr.
Alexander, who discovered the scales, took one of the weights to
Carrollton, the capital of Pickens County, that the inscription might be
translated. A Mexican war veteran said that the words were Spanish and
that it was very strange that implements
<pb id="dupre137" n="137"/>
of druggists' art, as old as these, should be found in such a spot. It never
occurred to him that De Soto's followers lost the scales and thus
designated a point in his route to the Mississippi. It can hardly be
supposed that the Indians stole or seized in battle and lost both the
horseshoes and the <sic corr="apothecary's">apothocary's</sic> scales found so near the same spot,
and I have ever believed, since I became conversant with the facts here
recited, that De Soto passed through Pickens County and crossed the
Tombecbee, of which his chroniclers tell, at Barton, a little village a few
miles above Columbus. Many persons of the neighborhood of Yorkville
saw the scales and horseshoes of which I tell. They gossiped about the
inscriptions, and this inter-state war came, and when I sought, not very
long ago, to secure the relics, the finder had moved away. His grandson,
a citizen of Columbus, Mississippi, wrote very recently that he had not
abandoned hope of their recovery. But do not forget,” added the
journalist, “that I have the oldest horseshoe in the world, and that it
belonged to De Soto. I have heard most intelligent officers and many
soldiers, since the inception of inter-state hostilities, and since we began
to march over the country in all directions, ascribe the erection of the old
stone fort in Kentucky, and of that, more wonderful, at Winchester,
Tennessee, to De Soto. General Bragg examined the ancient fortress at
Winchester, and stated when I asked him what he thought of it, that it
was constructed in accordance with the most approved rules of the
highest military art, and that with guns, even of a century ago, it was
absolutely impregnable. Who reared this massive structure, and who
carved out this stone and lifted up those enduring walls and when was
the mighty task accomplished? Great earthworks, fortifications, and
mounds in Eastern Tennessee have been ignorantly ascribed to De Soto
as their builder. He was never in East Tennessee, or at Winchester, or in
Kentucky and nobody pretends that red men of our time ever executed
these tasks comparable with works of highest civilization; and I am
persuaded that as Indians have been valueless and incapable, since 1492,
when Columbus came, even so were they always averse to toil; and,
digging few graves, were addicted to no species of industry. They were
always nomadic and homeless as the Apaches, Creeks, and Sioux, and I
have never believed that any Indian tribe, except the bearded Natchez,
ever reared mounds like that at Florence, Alabama. The Natchez alone
had beards like white men; and, claiming descent from white men, were
always, like the mound-builders, fire-worshippers. They were most
civilized of all the red race. They gave La Salle a grand festival, sitting at
tables covered with buckskin as white as linen. They used chopsticks, as
do Chinese, and were greatly frightened when the Frenchmen of two
hundred years ago drew broad, glittering knives from sheaths and thrust
them with food into their mouths. They said their original king and queen
came down from the skies, and that they were white; that they lighted the
sacred fires on the summit of the great mound just below Natchez which
would burn while the Natchez were free, and no longer. The
<pb id="dupre138" n="138"/>
French made the priests drunken, extinguished the fires, the dispirited
Natchez were easily beaten in battle, and migrated west, and became
extinct. These Natchez Indians said that their fathers, who may have
been the moundbuilders, once reigned over the whole continent, and
that the land, covered with great cities, extended, unbroken by the sea,
an infinite distance toward the east. There came a great convulsion of
nature, and the Gulf of Mexico supplanted their sunken domains which
had extended far out into the Southern Atlantic towards Africa.</p>
        <p>“When Commodore Maury surveyed the ocean's bottom from Cuba
towards the western coast of Africa, he found abrupt chasms and
shallow depressions, and there were those who believed that sunken
cities rested in the ocean's depths, and that the Natchez were not
mistaken, and that Solon and Diodorus Siculus were not misled by
Egyptian priests who told them of the sunken continent, Atlantis, lying
west of Africa. Isn't it strange that traditional lore of our red men was
conformed to that communicated by Egyptian priests, five hundred
years before Christ, to the Greek philosopher? Plutarch tells the story in
his life of Solon.</p>
        <p>“If you would listen and know what I think about it,” continued the
newspaper man, “I would designate upon the map the route of De Soto,
as I have defined it. We are constantly marching blindly over the
country, and it invests one's movements with peculiar, intelligent
interest, if we may read the history of men and battles of a former age in
geographical facts. That we may not err and ascribe to the Spanish
hero the works of primeval races found almost everywhere in America,
I will give you a succinct definition of the route pursued by the heroic
Spaniard. I was reading, even in Smithsonian papers, the grave statement
that De Soto reared those skillfully constructed ancient fortifications,
described by Edwin M. Grant, in Eastern Tennessee. The story was once
told that De Soto built the great mounds at Birmingham, Alabama, and
opened the tunnel as a means of underground communication, said by
the people of the vicinity, when Lord Lyell was there in 1846, to connect
the mounds with the spring, three hundred yards distant. The greater
Birmingham mound is a parallelogram having an area of more than an
acre on its summit. It is lifted up fifty or sixty feet above the valley in
which Birmingham rests idly in the sunshine between mountain ranges
five miles apart, of coal on the one hand and of iron on the other, each
stratum thirty feet in thickness. I visited the place, when a boy, with ‘Mr.’
Lyell, the English geologist, but gave little attention to peculiar facts now
discussed. I only know that there is nothing in books or in the
peculiarities of the ancient earth-works at Birmingham to induce the
belief that De Soto visited the spot. It is hardly necessary to suggest the
reflection that, as these greatest mounds commonly designate centers of
moundbuilders' wealth and population, so, in our time, they mark sites
of most prosperous town and cities, and we may yet discover evidences of
the use of coal and iron which must have attracted
<pb id="dupre139" n="139"/>
primeval inhabitants of the continent, if they used these minerals, to the
beautiful valley in which Birmingham reposes. Whether they did or not,
it is nevertheless true that the site of each great city in the valley of the
Mississippi was designated for our race by great mounds, showing that
the same commercial laws and facts begat aggregations of wealth and
population in the moundbuilders' age as in ours. Did they have steamers
and railways? Surely they were not modern red men who had no
commercial ideas and located towns and villages without reference to
facilities for navigation or proximity of productive districts. I have said
this that one may not confound works of primeval races with those of
the heroic Spanish knight.</p>
        <p>“Using Theodore Irving's translations of old records preserved in
Spain, and applying data somewhat vague to geographical and topical
facts familiar to those who have traversed the Gulf States as often as
most Confederate soldiers, and then cognizant of each antiquarian's
discovery that designates a spot visited by the Spanish adventurers, I
would state that De Soto left Tampa Bay, Florida, going northwest,
June 31, 1539. De Soto's route was parallel to or near the road from Tampa
to Fort King. He crossed the Withlacoochee and Suwanee Rivers. He
moved into Georgia and passed the winter of 1539-40 on the Bay of St.
Marks. March 3, 1540, he left Appalachee and following up the east bank
of the Flint River, crossed into Baker County, Georgia. The Alabama
poet and literateur, Alexander B. Meek, in his book entitled, ‘Romantic
Passages in Southwestern History,’ published in 1837, says that De Soto
passed very near the site of the present beautiful city of Macon. But
Judge Meek never heard of Governor Gilmer's carnelian dagger handle
or of the discovery more recently made at Macon, in this State.</p>
        <p>“When the place was partially fortified not many months ago, Dr. I. E.
Nagle, now of New Orleans, was sent thither to organize army hospitals
and provide for the sick and wounded. He was watching Confederate
soldiers employed in perfecting old military earthworks planned and
upheaved by prehistoric races in the suburbs of Macon. These
earthworks were made after the models used in our time and it was only
necessary to repair them. They may have been planned and built by De
Soto, but it is much more probable that he, as did these Confederate
soldiers, used here, as the latter did the mounds to resist Grant's
gunboats along Yazoo Pass, these old strongholds of primeval
occupants of the country. In any event, while the Confederates were
digging away the base of a broad, earthen wall, they came upon a grave,
its occupants' skeletons encased in rust-eaten coats of mail. Dr. Nagle
sought to secure the relics, but these were claimed and retained by the
owner of the spot, and the doctor was only suffered to have a broken
rosary twined about a skeleton's neck. This rosary adorns to-day, so Dr.
N. tells me, the walls of the priest's rooms attached to the cathedral in
Memphis, Tennessee. A part of the sword of an armored knight
remained undestroyed by time; but the armor itself was only a series of
layers of iron rust. But
<pb id="dupre140" n="140"/>
full details of this discovery may be obtained by the curious in such matters by
addressing Dr. I. E. Nagle, No. 13 St. Charles Street, New Orleans, Louisiana, as
W. B. Bryan, of Columbus, Mississippi, will tell of the discovery of the
Spanish apothecary's scales by his grandfather at Yorkville, Alabama.</p>
        <p>“Leaving Macon, where he probably fought the Indians, using moundbuilders'
earthworks, he passed near Milledgeville, and crossed the Ocmulgee and
Oconee Rivers, entering the province of Cofachiqui lying within the fork of the
Broad and Savannah Rivers. May 3, 1540, the Spaniards moved northwest
and were five days crossing the mountains of Habersham County, in the
midst of which the late Texas soldier and senator,
Rusk,  -  Houston's peer,  -  was born. In De Soto's time, this Cherokee County
was known as Chalaque. He came to Canasauga, after several days' march, on
the banks of the Etowah. June 25, 1540, the Spaniard encamped at Chiaha situated
on the upper end of an island, as described by De Soto's chroniclers, fifteen
miles in length. There is no such island in the Coosa River, but the Spaniard
probably mistook the peninsula formed by the Coosa and Chattooga for an
island, or these rivers were originally united, creating an island above the point
of confluence. Farmers of the district say that such was the case. In any event
there is no doubt that the indian town and stronghold, Chiaha, was but a short
distance above the junction of the Coosa and Chattooga.</p>
        <p>“Leaving Chiaha July 2, 1540, De Soto on the same day reached Acoste on
the southern extremity of the island. The next day he crossed the Coosa River,
marching several days through a province of that name  -  it is sometimes spelled
Cosa  -  embracing Benton, Talladega, Coosa, and Tallapoosa Counties, in
Alabama. He rested at an indian town called Cosa, till August 20, 1540, when he
began to move through Tallamuchassie Ullobali and Toasi. He reached Tallise, in
the curve of the Tallapoosa River at the site of the present village of Tallase,
September 18, 1540. From Tallise he went to Tuscaluza, on the banks of the
Alabama, in Clarke County, where he fought his most terrible battle. November
18, 1540, he moved northwardly and, in five days, arrived at Cabusto, in the
province of Pafalaya on the Black Warrior River in Green County near the
village of Erie. After a few days' anabasis, he crossed the Tombigbee in a
province called Chicasa, in a few days encamping at a town of the same name.
Northern Mississippi and Western Tennessee were dwelling places of the heroic
Chicsas or Chicasaws. We only known that after a terrific battle with these red
men, De Soto was six days in reaching the Mississippi. Whether this battle was
fought, as many suppose, near Tupelo or at Carrollton, in Mississippi, I am not
prepared to say. From either point the great river might have been reached at
Memphis after a six days' march. He crossed it forty miles above Memphis.
With much accuracy the district known as Surrounded Hill, in Arkansas, sixty
miles west of Memphis, is described by those who recited the story of De
Soto's adventures. Beyond this, it is needless to follow him.
<pb id="dupre141" n="141"/>
Except Surrounded Hill, no place of encampment or of battle west of the river
has been identified, except, as I have shown, that he was buried below
Helena, at the base of Crowley's Ridge, in the channel occupied by the river
at that date, now known as Old Town Lake.</p>
        <p>“When Arkansas and Texas and the Indian Territory are more densely
populated, and broader areas are cultivated, the plow and spade may make
discoveries to define paths as made west of the Mississippi by the daring,
resolute Spaniard.”</p>
        <p>“Will you not tell me,” asked the schoolmaster, “how you know that
De Soto was entombed in Old Town Lake. I never heard the assertion
before. I have seen many pictures of the sad burial scene, but never one
representing the locality as now identified.”</p>
        <p>The newspaper man replied:</p>
        <p>“We have heard enough of De Soto for to-night. Remind me to-morrow
evening or at noon that the story should have its proper conclusion, and I will
tell all I know of De Soto that has not been published in countless books and
magazine articles devoted to this attractive theme.”</p>

          <p>Physical and Climatic Charms of East Tennessee.  -  The Captain and Spratling
Pursued by Cavalry.  -  A Bloody Day's Work.  -  Spratling Visits Bessie
Starnes.  -  Wounded.  -  The Conflagration and Flight.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>Occasional days, even now, in February, presaged the coming of
spring. Delights of sunny latitudes were discovered in Favonian breezes
occasionally coming up from the sea, and in the ethereal mildness of
southern summer skies. Verse and book makers tell of “smiling sunlight”
and “fertilizing showers” when spring-time comes in hyperborean
regions. The imagination of weary, restless wealth and fashion is excited,
and never learns the truth that the fiery fierceness of the summer's sun
and hot-air baths of cloudy afternoons are infinitely more intolerable at
Cape May and Saratoga, than cooling winds that climb the mountains
and descend into the valleys and come toying with roses and dancing
about cottages of dwellers in East Tennessee. Each inhabitant sooner or
later falls under the spell of enchantment and is ready to exclaim, “The
fairest land beneath the sun.” Spring expands into summer, and summer
is the rest of the year. East Tennessee is poetically eloquent of the
charms of delightful valleys, the sweep of verdure-clad plains, the
witchery of beautiful rivers, and impressive majesty of environing
mountains. The face of the country is fascinating, strong, rugged, full of
character, and never to be forgotten.</p>
        <p>Glad and gracious days, through an entire twelve-month, have here
been illumined with sweetest sunlight, and shed upon us continuous
luster. Not elsewhere do flowers blossom more brightly or fruits ripen
more generously or waters murmur more sweetly or birds sing more
charmingly through all the months of the delightful year.</p>
        <p>To rise when those mountains environing East Tennessee are flushed
with splendors of earliest dawn; to traverse smiling valleys and deep
green fields while scarlet flowers clasp the gliding feet; to watch
<pb id="dupre143" n="143"/>
purple wraiths of rain haunting the fairness of the parti-colored
mountains; to see the shadows chase the sun's rays on the dusky sides
of the Blue Ridge or Smoky or Cumberland range; to feel the living light
of the cloudless day beat as with a million pulses; to go out in the luster
of the night aflame with astral splendors, until the dark still plains and
deep and darker valleys blaze like a phosphorescent sea; to breathe this
wondrous air, soft as the first impassioned kisses of young love, and
rich as wine with the delicious odors of a world of flowers  -  these, as
was written of Italy, have been our joys  -  the joys at once of the senses
and of the soul.</p>
        <p>Eastern Tennessee is the dream-land of the continent. Cold, fierce,
wintry blasts that came, not long ago, from icy caverns beneath
hyperborean snows and made us shiver on the mountain's brow, only
serve to excite stronger affection for the homes we have in deep valleys,
beneath cloudless skies, fanned by delicious breezes coming, warm with
the life-blood of the equator, and tripping away, with laps full of roses,
from rich, green fields almost tropical in their exuberance.</p>
        <p>Such was the land of which Mr. Wade, the good pedagogue, was
delighted to tell. He had revisited Eastern Tennessee. Encountering no
difficulty at the Hiwassee bridge and having passports for himself and
Mamie Hughes from General Johnston, he had complied with Mamie's
wishes and proceeded directly to Tunnel Hill and thence to Mamie's
home. Her anxiety to return to Georgia, the pedagogue said, was
infinitely heightened when she was informed by him that her brother
had preceded her to her mother's home with a safe conduct given by the
captain.</p>
        <p>“The captain, it seems,” said Mamie, “and that gigantic Spratling who
participated in delights of the dance by moonlight on the banks of the
Tennessee, are my brother's benefactors. It makes me shudder when I
think of my brother's neck in the grasp of that giant; but I can't forget
his simple, earnest, big-hearted generosity, and how he loves my
brother because this brother is beloved by his own pretty sweetheart.
How infinite must be the ardor of his devotion to that charming Bessie
Starnes of whom my brother has often written. And what an
extraordinary creature is this gigantic Spratling. Devoid of jealousy, and
in utter self-abnegation he becomes the more than friend of my brother
because he thinks Bessie Starnes would have him serve her preferred
suitor. If Bessie were cognizant of the facts and capable of measuring
and properly valuing such devotion I greatly fear she would prefer the
giant and even forget my handsome brother. I am sure I don't know how
I could withstand such assertions of devotion made by such a soldier as
you describe when telling of the daring deeds and generous acts and
words of this wonderful Spratling.”</p>
        <p>“Instead of coming out on foot through Sequatchie Valley as I
proposed,” continued the schoolmaster, “of which I spoke in order that
the captain might be prepared for the worst, we traveled very
<pb id="dupre144" n="144"/>
comfortably and very safely in a condemned ambulance given me by a
quarter-master. Mamie, instead of the <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">role</foreign></hi> of a rollicking country boy,
enacted the part of a staid country dame. I had no difficulty in
distinguishing rebel from Union scouts, and was provided, as you
know, with papers eminently satisfactory to either. I am here, now, on a
mission of peace and instructed to invite the captain, Spratling, the
newspaper man and his brother to spend a day or weeks with the
lieutenant at his mother's home.”</p>
        <p>Very certainly no message ever gave greater satisfaction. Spratling
alone failed to assert his glad acceptance. He became moody, and was
silent. He said, at last, that before going to Tunnel Hill, we must go in
the opposite direction toward Chattanooga. We must know what the
enemy are doing, and that no great movement is on foot, before we
devote a day to idleness.</p>
        <p>There was no evading the necessity and yet we suspected that the
suggestion sprang from Spratling's anxiety to meet Bessie Starnes. But
armies could not remain idle. The sun was shining brightly, and now
and then, we caught faint breathings of dawning springtime.</p>
        <p>Next morning, at day-dawn, the captain and Spratling set out on foot
to traverse the distance between the two armies. Their purpose was to
go as far as Chattanooga Creek between Rossville and Chattanooga,
and, returning, spend the night at Starnes'. They would not be absent
more than three days and on their return we proposed to accept the
hospitality of Lieutenant Hughes. We knew well enough that the
expedition, now entered upon by the captain, would be as speedily
ended as possible.</p>
        <p>It lasted just three days and none fuller of grave incidents ever befell
the two scouts. They said, when they returned, Spratling severely but
not dangerously wounded by a bullet that pierced his left shoulder, that
they were induced by anxiety to learn what movement was
contemplated by the Union army, to cross Chattanooga Creek not far
from Rossville. They were greatly fatigued and had mounted, each, an
ill-used, emaciated horse, purchased for a trifling sum from an innocent
countryman, who had certainly stolen the animals. When they had
turned back, and were within five miles of the creek, flooded by recent
rainstorms, they discovered that a squad of Union cavalry followed.</p>
        <p>Flight and pursuit were instantly begun. The worn-down horses soon
began to flag. Fleet enough at first, and out-stripping pursuit, it was
found at the end of two and a half miles that the horses must be
abandoned.</p>
        <p>The two flying scouts had entered a long, narrow lane. Some distance
ahead was a carriage occupied by a gentleman and his wife. This was
overtaken. There was no other recourse. The captain said to Spratling:</p>
        <p>“Tell the gentleman we must exchange horses, and that a fair
exchange, under such circumstances, is no robbery.”</p>
        <pb id="dupre145" n="145"/>
        <p>Spratling having the better horse was slightly ahead. He rode beside
the carriage, a negro driving it, and apologizing for the necessity,
ordered a halt. The frightened negro leaped from his seat, and Spratling,
when the captain came up, had cut the ‘hame strings’ and thrown the
harness from one horse. This the captain mounted. Looking back, he
beheld the flying cavalry enter the lane. In an instant the other horse
was stripped. There was no need for saddles, and the captain and
Spratling on fresh horses outsped pursuit. Protected for a time against
shots of the enemy by the carriage and its occupants, they fled, at last
under fire, down the long lane. The aim of men pursuing, at men
pursued, all on horseback, is not accurate; and firearms, thus used, are
not dangerous; but when twenty or thirty bullets come, in successive
showers, designed to fall upon a fugitive's unprotected spine, he is much
inclined to be uncomfortable. He imagines there are holes in his back.
He thrusts his hat on the back of his head and will lie down on his
horse.</p>
        <p>“Much heroism is required of him,” said Spratling, when telling of
this race for life, “who sits perfectly erect under such painful
circumstances.”</p>
        <p>The foremost of the enemy were within fifty yards when the captain
and Spratling sped away on the horses taken from the carriage.
Within a mile the fresh steeds added steadily to the distance from their
pursuers, but that ridden by the gigantic Spratling bore two hundred
and thirty pounds. Its limbs grew weak and Spratling said to the captain
that he must soon abandon it. They exchanged horses. The captain
weighing only one hundred and sixty-five pounds, the more weary
animal again moved rapidly, keeping pace with the other.</p>
        <p>They were drawing near the flooded creek when the weaker horse,
bearing the captain, faltered and fell. The cavalry were now within two
hundred yards and the creek, swollen by recent rains, was about the
same distance ahead. The weary horse rose up and making a desperate
struggle reached the precipitous bank of the creek. The bridge had
disappeared. Neither rider checked his courser. Plunging in over the
precipitous bank, they sank, to the riders it seemed an infinite distance,
down into the depths of the roaring torrent. When they came to the
surface they were rapidly borne down the stream by its angry force. The
captain's weary horse, incapable of exertion, could not sustain the
weight of the armed rider. The captain dropped into the current, and
holding the mane, floated beside the animal, following that bearing
Spratling. They had descended the stream perhaps one hundred yards
when Spratling guided his horse to a place of possible exit on the
eastern bank. Making a desperate effort the powerful animal escaped
from the raging torrent. The captain was not so fortunate. His weary
steed had not the strength to make the ascent. Struggling desperately,
the soft clay of the steep bank yielded and the horse rolled backward,
and drowning, was swept away by the
<pb id="dupre146" n="146"/>
angry waves. The captain clambered up, holding to the limbs of trees
that grew at the water's edge and swept the water's surface.</p>
        <p>If the pursuers, now halting where the bridge had stood, crossed the
creek, the scouts were lost. Hurrying to the crossing place and using
water-proof cartridges scouts began firing upon the cavalry.</p>
        <p>Spratling and the captain, from behind trees, delivered fatal shots,
while volleys fired by the mounted men were harmless. The lieutenant
in charge of the squad soon ordered a retreat.</p>
        <p>The result of the flight and fight was the death of three or four Union
cavalrymen and the wrongful acquisition by the Confederate scouts of
an excellent horse.</p>
        <p>“Spratling, terrible as had been our exertions and exciting as was the
flight and incapable of effort as we were after such a struggle for life,
was anxious,” the captain said, “to move rapidly towards Starnes' place.”
He proposed to walk, surrendering the powerful horse wholly to the
captain. The latter objected. “Then,” said Spratling, “I will have a horse
of my own.”</p>
        <p>At a little farmhouse, hard by, Spratling called. The owner came
affrightedly to the door. Spratling said to him:</p>
        <p>“My name is Spratling. I am a Confederate scout. I never told a lie,
that I know of, in my life. I want a horse. I will ride him only ten miles.
Then he will be returned unharmed to you.”</p>
        <p>The farmer was silent.</p>
        <p>“Come,” said Spratling, “I have no time for words. Bring me a horse
within ten minutes and you shall lose nothing. If you fail, or send
Yankees or bushwhackers after me I will burn your house and destroy
everything. Do as I ask and you will lose nothing.”</p>
        <p>Spratling, bestriding a good horse, soon joined the captain. The two
scouts, within two hours, were near the modest home of Bessie Starnes.</p>
        <p>“Bushwhackers will be on our path to-night. That cowardly, silent,
surly little fellow from whom you borrowed that horse,” said
the captain, “will set a squad of murderers on our track. He has
summoned them already and that may be the costliest animal a Texan ever
bestrode. I know you must see Bessie and tell her how you came to
capture her lover, the Yankee lieutenant, and my prospective brother-in-
law. You would tell Bessie how sorry you are and that you did it
ignorantly and then you will tell her how you and I and the editor and his
brother and the schoolmaster are going to spend a <sic>a</sic> delightful week at the
young lieutenant's home. Then Bessie will hardly know whether she loves
you or the lieutenant, and you and she will talk and dream and talk again
even until sunrise.</p>
        <p>“I will rest on the hill-side that looks down on Bessie's home. Bring me
bacon, eggs, and bread when you bring your horse to my resting place. I
am hungrier than a famished wolf. It is not well that those who may soon
follow us should know where I am. The man from whom you borrowed
the animal did not see me. I thought it best to remain concealed while you
were negotiating for the horse.
<pb id="dupre147" n="147"/>
If we are pursued the enemy will have only strength enough to assure
success in a conflict with you. We are lucky in this,” continued the
captain, half soliloquizing, as he left Spratling following the dim
roadway, while he turned into the woods to ascend the hill beyond and
in front of the house.</p>
        <p>Spratling was warmly welcomed. Mother and daughter were alike
devoted to the honest, fearless Texan. Deeming Bessie the betrothed of
the lieutenant, Spratling was much more formal and reserved in his
bearing than when last he met the pretty mountain girl. When she
asked why he was thus reserved he gave the reasons with refreshing
simplicity and perfect truthfulness, and then told Bessie how he came to
capture her lover. When he narrated with painstaking, honest
minuteness each incident of the event, how he crept to the tree beside
which the lieutenant slept, his head resting on its roots, and how he
silently and noiselessly grasped the helpless lieutenant's throat,
whispering the word “Spratling” in his ear, Bessie grew pale and
shuddered.</p>
        <p>“Oh! I knew you would hate me for it,” exclaimed Spratling, “but I did
not know he was your lover. I did not know he was Lieutenant Hughes!
How could I help it? You ought to love me that I spared him. It's a
wonder I had not killed him. But he knew me, and that resistance was
useless, and then he was helpless.”</p>
        <p>Bessie insisted that she was glad the lieutenant had fallen into the
hands of those who served him so well and that she esteemed him none
the less that he had captured her lover.</p>
        <p>When Spratling, that she might wholly forgive him, added that he
would have died rather than wrong or harm the man Bessie loved, and
because she loved him, Bessie stared wonderingly into Spratling's great
blue eyes. She did not then measure or comprehend the depth, dignity
or worth of Spratling's self sacrificing devotion. But when the earnest
soldier frankly said, “I would rather die, Bessie, than harm even a dog
that you loved,” her bright eyes sank to the floor, and pearly tear drops
of gratitude were priceless jewels proffered in exchange for treasures of
affection exposed to her vision by the ardent, honest, magnanimous
soldier.</p>
        <p>Bessie hardly knew whether she loved more the handsome, lithe,
graceful, gallant lieutenant or the self-reliant, honest, frank, and fearless
scout. She was now endeavoring, in the solitude of her little bed
chamber, when Spratling slept soundly in the adjoining room, to solve
the vexed problem. She had seen first and first loved the fascinating
lieutenant who was passionately fond of her. He had constantly written
to her. When he came to Chattanooga he at once sought her presence.
He had endeavored to make her confess the charms and comprehend
the intellectual and personal virtues of his sister, Mamie, who, he said,
was to become Bessie's sister. But in his absence, and when she
measured the wealth of the unselfish Texan's affections lavished upon
her and confessed the grand simplicity of his character and personal
worth, she confessed for him a
<pb id="dupre148" n="148"/>
degree of admiration and gratitude that almost lapsed into love.</p>
        <p>The events of the day followed by those of the evening, the long, hard
ride, the flight, the passage of the creek, the fight at the wrecked
bridge, and protracted interview with Bessie, were exciting incidents,
and Spratling, utterly exhausted, slept profoundly.</p>
        <p>He was aroused by hearing his name pronounced by some one at the
door demanding admittance.</p>
        <p>“Who are you? ” asked Spratling.</p>
        <p>“I've come with friends to get my horse,” was the answer.</p>
        <p>“I promised to return him in the morning and nobody ever accused
Spratling of breaking his word. Leave the house or I will shoot you.”</p>
        <p>“Come out or we will burn this house as you did Mrs. Shields', and
we will suffer none to escape. Come out, like a man, and spare the pretty
girl you pretend to love.”</p>
        <p>The captain was now aroused. On the hill side looking down upon the
house, he was impatient for the disappearance of morning mists that
partially obstructed vision making it impossible to select victims for his
rifle and repeaters. The weary horses were tethered just beyond the
brow of the hill and the captain was ready for the impending fray. His
enemies little dreamed of danger and only feared that the powerful
Texan, by some means might escape in the dim, misty twilight. Spratling,
fearing that the captain slept, sought to temporize. He thought that
day-dawn would serve the captain well and therefore asked his untimely
visitor why he called so early.</p>
        <p>“Did I not tell you,” asked Spratling, “that I would deliver your horse
to-day.”</p>
        <p>“Yes” was the answer, “but I knew you lied.”</p>
        <p>The captain, overhearing this reply, said, when telling, afterward, of
the event, that he knew that the conference was at an end  -  that a shot
would follow that word.</p>
        <p>“I watched and waited,” he said, “only a moment. Spratling knew that
his interlocutor was not alone. Instead of opening the door he suddenly
thrust aside the window-shutter, and, as he anticipated, found four men
in the yard silently watching and waiting at the doorway. Spratling fired.
By the flash of the pistol I was shown the object of his hate. I fired into
the little group. Two at least were fatally wounded, but one, who was
unharmed, fired at Spratling, the shot taking effect in the brave fellow's
shoulder. It must have paralyzed him for a time. He withdrew from the
window and then the fog rolling down the high hill grew so dense that
even the house was invisible. I was helpless, and could only await the
course of events. I could hear the conversation of the bushwhackers,
but distinguish only now and then a word spoken. Their attention had
been so riveted upon Spratling's movements that they did not dream
that my rifle laid low one of their number. This was the more wonderful
since Spratling had not fired simultaneously. The light from the flash of
Spratling's pistol had given fatal direction to my
<pb id="dupre149" n="149"/>
bullet. But strangely enough the intent bushwhackers had neither seen
the flash of my rifle nor heard its report. They ascribed the sad havoc to
Spratling's diabolical pistol. Satisfied, too, that he was alone they were
resolved to capture and destroy him. The farmer whose horse Spratling
had taken, was heard insisting that the house should be burned.”</p>
        <p>As Spratling told us afterward, he had lain down without undressing
himself, and slept instantly, unconscious even of his own existence, till
he heard his name pronounced. When shot, he staggered away from the
window. Bessie, meanwhile, was dressed and watching and listening at
the doorway leaning from Spratling's into hers and her mother's
apartment. She could see Spratling when he fired upon his assailants
from the window and when he started back she knew he was wounded.
He called her and telling her to be quiet, said:</p>
        <p>“I am shot in the shoulder. I am not hurt. I can still raise my arm. Stop
the bleeding. Tie it up tightly and quickly. Then let me have another
shot at the rascals.”</p>
        <p>While he was saying this he tore the sheet on which he had slept, in
strips, and Bessie and her mother bound them tightly about the armpit,
closing the orifices of the wound in front and rear with cotton. The
bullet had pierced the flesh and muscles beneath the shoulder joint.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile gray mists of morning had disappeared and the captain
could see that only three men were left to capture or kill the Texan. At
any moment he could reduce the number by one but deemed it prudent
to await developments. He supposed that Spratling was not idle and
had good reasons for inaction.</p>
        <p>The captain saw one of the bushwhackers leave the rest who stood
behind trees some distance from the house. They were perfectly
exposed to the captain's aim but could hardly be harmed by Spratling.
Soon the plans of the bushwhackers were developed. Flames first
ascended from a “fodder-stack” in the rear of the house and then from
the dairy hard by the residence. Firebrands were thrown upon the
adjoining kitchen.</p>
        <p>The captain could endure inaction no longer. He fired upon the
bushwhackers, wounding one just as he or his comrade had wounded
Spratling. The fellow shrieked, “I'm shot!” and fell. The captain rushed
shouting down the hill and with his pistol fired at the flying
bushwhackers.</p>
        <p>Spratling's arm was now cared for. He opened the door, a pistol in
each hand, to find inextinguishable flames enveloping the kitchen
attached to the wooden residence.</p>
        <p>Maddened to a degree never known before, Spratling rushed into the
yard. While the captain pursued the bushwhacker Spratling hurried
down the road along which the owner of the horse he borrowed was in
full flight. Spratling was fleet as he was incomparably strong. He leaped
the fence. His strides were of incredible length as he went headlong
down the road. The wretched little farmer looked
<pb id="dupre150" n="150"/>
back. He beheld his doom in the giant's coming. He leaned forward,
straining every nerve and muscle and finally fell breathless and helpless.
Armed, as he was, he forgot his pistols in his terror.</p>
        <p>Spratling ran beyond the helpless wretch. As he turned back fires of
infernal hate and vengeance were lighted up in his face by the flames he
beheld consuming the home and all the wealth of Bessie Starnes.
Spratling beheld in the miserable, cringing wretch only an incendiary
and assassin. He had followed as a murderer on Spratling's tracks<corr>.</corr> He
had said that Spratling lied, an offence to be punished, in accordance
with the code of morals under which Spratling was reared, with death.
He had fired the home of Bessie Starnes. In Spratling's eyes the
miscreant's deeds were worse than infernal. At the moment, while Bessie
and her mother stood in the roadway contemplating the destruction of
all their wealth and of their home, Spratling was infuriated  -  a very
fiend. He set his foot upon the fallen coward, and stamped and kicked
him. Bones, ribs, and skull were crushed. He thrust his foot beneath the
limp, lifeless body and hurled it from the roadway.</p>
        <p>The bushwhacker escaped from the captain. When he returned from the
pursuit he was conscious, as when Mrs. Shields' house was destroyed,
that instant flight was an urgent necessity. Bessie and her mother would
find a safer home after these terrible events, south of the Confederate
lines, than in the vicinity of Chattanooga. Spratling was made to
comprehend the necessity for immediate action. Bessie was to be cared for
and her mother made comfortable, and Spratling had no opportunity to
indulge in harrowing thoughts and self-accusations.</p>
        <p>Household effects saved from the conflagration were deposited in a
wagon, the two horses of Mrs. Starnes were attached to the vehicle, the
ladies drove the team, Spratling saddened as never before, by the
mishaps of an eventful day, rode rapidly away and without an accident,
at nightfall, the party reached our camp. An apartment for Mrs. Starnes
and Bessie was secured in a neighboring farmhouse, and again stories
of adventure were told at night by the camp fire.</p>
        <p>Spratling was interrogated and confessed, with every evidence of
keenest anguish, that his acts had caused the wreaking of devilish
vengeance upon those he loved. He said it became his duty to replace the
home of Mrs. Starnes and that at last he had a purpose in living.</p>
        <p>From that day forth he became the self-constituted guardian of Bessie.
Affectionate, kind, and of matchless generosity, as he was, he seemed to
have forgotten that three or four men, within four days, had lost their lives
at his hands. He never seemed to doubt for a moment that the miserable
wretch whom he killed by crushing his chest beneath his hob-nailed boot,
deserved his fate. Spratling's conscience had been educated in the school
of war. It was wholly right to kill if the fallen had a fair opportunity to kill.
An Indian's methods of ambuscading, if the enemy's superior strength made
<pb id="dupre151" n="151"/>
fighting under cover necessary, were perfectly justifiable. No qualms of
conscience would have disturbed Spratling's repose if he had hurled the
wretch who had sought his life and burned Bessie's home, over visible
battlements of eternal perdition. Spratling's dreams were never disturbed
by the crackling of the breaking ribs and skull of his helpless victim.
Human life and anguish, in a soldier's as in a practiced surgeon's eyes,
has no value. It is only necessary that it be taken or given “in the
regular course of trade.”</p>

        </argument>
        <p>The captain was telling Mamie one evening, some time after events here
narrated, of the devotion and courage of a boy, when traversing the country
below Dalton. Gillehan was not fifteen years of age; but his sinews were
toughened by toil and exposure, and piercing bright eyes significant of pluck and
keen intelligence. His home was in Tennessee in 1863-64, but he now lives in
Navvarro, Texas. He and the captain had been making a long journey, and noting
the steady movement of the whole Federal army, now slowly advancing, its
wings moving forward more rapidly to outflank General Joe Johnston on
the east and on the west. It threatened to encompass him and cut off his
communication with Atlanta, thus forcing him again and again to retreat. But
Johnston's army was growing daily in numbers and confidence, and especially in
sublime confidence in the adroitness, seeming omniscience and caution of
General Johnston, who never sacrificed a man if human skill and watchfulness
could obviate the necessity. Therefore was he beloved, as well as trusted, by his
soldiers. They believed he would not fight needlessly and only when victory
was assured. His fighting force, when he assumed command near Chattanooga,
was less than 35,000 men, and, though fighting every day, it exceeded 50,000 when
he reached Atlanta, in July. Deserters became numberless when Johnston was
about to occupy the heights environing Atlanta, and when President Jefferson
Davis, impatient and nervous, and tortured by Richmond newspapers, and by
property-holders of Atlanta, and by subordinates of Johnston who had
displaced Bragg, and now yearned for Johnston's position and power, removed
Johnston and substituted Hood.</p>
        <pb id="dupre153" n="153"/>
        <p>“I was sleeping on the floor of a little cabin, beside Major-General William B.
Bate, near the southern banks of the Chattahoochee river, and within a few miles
of Atlanta, at three o'clock on the morning of the 19th of July, I think it was,
1864,” interposed the newspaper man, “when a courier came. I was awakened by
the clatter of the horse's hoofs. The speed of the animal told of the excitement of
the rider. I received the dispatch, lighted a candle, and handed the paper, without
saying a word, to General Bate, who had been sleeping soundly. ‘My God!’
exclaimed Bate, ‘have you read this order from Richmond?’ I nodded assent. He
sat on the blanket on which we had been sleeping on the floor, with his head
resting upon his hands and knees. How long I do not remember. But death-like
silence, broken by the echoing hoofs of the flying courier's horse, pervaded the
resting place of fifty thousand men.</p>
        <p>“ ‘I don't know what will be the result,’ said General Bate; ‘but this order
means that we will fight to-day. Hood and battle are convertible terms. Tell the
members of my staff, and let the soldiers know what is coming.’</p>
        <p>“Within half an hour I heard the hum of fifty thousand voices, sorrowfully,
and in the dead hour of the night, discussing <sic corr="and">aad</sic> deploring the substitution of
Hood for Johnston. At sunrise we were moving, and moving sadly and silently
as a funeral train, towards the battlefield of Peach Tree Creek, five miles north
of Atlanta. Of this bloody event, history tells. Therefore, I would only recall an
incident of the memorable day, illustrative of the devotion of common soldiers
to General Joseph E. Johnston. Our division moved, just after sunrise, along the
country road in front of the little farmhouse occupied by him. Soldiers, at
the head of the column called for him. He came out bareheaded, and stood on
the piazza looking at us. Bate and his staff removed their hats, while rude,
rugged, dust-and-sun-embrowned soldiers asserted infinite love and reverence
for the gray-bearded, degraded veteran.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Good-bye, old Joe; God bless you!’ said one.</p>
        <p>“ ‘We love you, and will never forget you!’ shouted another.</p>
        <p>“ ‘This is the darkest day that ever dawned on the Confederacy!’ exclaimed a
sergeant near me, and then a thousand or more cried out at once, asserting
affection and grief.</p>
        <p>“Then the masses of men, accumulating in front of the house, broke ranks,
thrust the palings of the enclosure aside, and gathered about the general. Those
nearest seized his hands, and it was with difficulty that he escaped from the
excited multitude. He was wholly unmanned by this demonstration of affection,
and tears fell from his eyes, while bronzed, bearded soldiers wept as if they
were children. General Bate and staff sat upon their horses, and though, before
the sun went down we rode heedlessly over the dead bodies of many then
weeping around their displaced leader, we, too, discovered that unconscious,
unbidden evidences of deepest sympathy with these soldiers bedewed our
faces. General Johnston disappeared in the house.</p>
        <pb id="dupre154" n="154"/>
        <p>“ ‘Fall in, men! Forward!’ And then no other words were spoken, and
the steady tramp, tramp, tramp of armed legions moving to victory or
death, shook the earth. Seventy men from a single brigade of
Tennesseeans had already deserted their colors that fatal morning, and,
crossing the Chattahoochee, entered the Federal lines. In portions of the
army mutiny was threatened, and if Joe Johnston had not been so
thorough a soldier, obeying as he exacted obedience, he would have
remained at the head of the magnificent army he had created. These
soldiers believed it to be invincible, and knew it would be when General
Johnston chose to test its heroism. Its gallant deeds, even when
beheaded, on Peach-Tree Creek, and two days later, when McPherson
fell, and later, at Nashville and Franklin, only serve to show how brilliant
would have been its achievements with Joe Johnston demanding an
exhibition of its worth and illustrations of its valor.”</p>
        <p>But the captain, when the newspaper man interposed, was telling of
incidents that occurred four or five months earlier at Dalton. Gillehan, the
brave youth and guide whom he had been commending to Mamie Hughes,
and the captain were plodding, foot-sore and weary, toward Dalton, then
occupied as General Johnston's headquarters. They were to go west about
eight miles, and as many north, in order to learn what changes had been
made during the week in the position of the Federal army. Gillehan's feet
were very sore. He even complained that his sufferings became
intolerable. We saw two Confederate cavalrymen tie their horses in
front of a farm-house, and leaving them absolutely unguarded, go down
the hill behind it to secure accustomed supplies of buttermilk for their
commander, General Martin, of Arkansas.</p>
        <p>“It can't be helped, Captain,” modestly suggested Gillehan, “but we
must have these horses or give up this expedition. I can't walk any
farther.”</p>
        <p>“It can't be helped then,” I answered, and while two women and half
a dozen tow-headed, half-naked children screamed and called for the
“buttermilk cavalrymen” at the spring, Gillehan and I rode rapidly away.</p>
        <p>“The children and dogs and the women, the latter with yellow mops
in their mouths, pursued us only a short distance. They could only say
we were Confederate soldiers. Knowing that we must return to that point
during the night, we informed the pickets of the fact, and since we might
be pursued by the enemy's scouts, that we did not wish to be shot at.
Orders were given accordingly. This provision for our safety proved to
be the cause, as will be seen hereafter, of terrible dangers and anxieties.</p>
        <p>“General Martin, when he heard that his buttermilk supply train had
been ruthlessly deprived of its horses by Confederate scouts, was filled
with wrath. He swore that military law should be enforced and the
thieves shot. With his staff, he rode along the lines to ascertain at what
point we came in. When he found that we had gone out and had not
entered, he waxed exceeding wroth. But when he learned
<pb id="dupre155" n="155"/>
from the captain on duty at the outpost that we would soon return and
be sent under guard to the provost marshal, General B. J. Hill, Martin left
with this captain enveloped charges and specifications, signed by
himself and sworn to by his robbed agents. This paper, if it reached
army headquarters, would be fatal, as I well knew, to Gillehan and
myself.</p>
        <p>“After learning that which we sought to know, Gillehan and I returned
to the point on our lines, to be sent, of course under guard, to
headquarters. The sun was rising when we asked for the guard. We saw
that something was wrong when five, instead of two, men were detailed
for this service, and I saw the officer on duty give the sergeant in
charge of the squad a large sealed envelope addressed to Provost
Marshal General Hill. How to get possession of that paper and its
contents was the question. The sergeant was a rude, dull soldier. He
knew nothing of the purpose of these papers. None knew my name or
Gillehan's. I would have committed any act of violence less than murder
to prevent the delivery of that envelope.</p>
        <p>“General Hill occupied a square, framed house in Dalton, having a
veranda in front. A railing was extended across the hall to exclude those
not invited to enter; but scouts were ordered to enter instantly and
report at any hour of the day or night. I preceded the sergeant to Hill's
doorway. I entered. The guard ordered the sergeant to halt. I turned and
said to the sergeant, ‘Give me the envelope addressed to General Hill,
and I will deliver it and get a pass that you may return to your command,
and then you can go.’ The unthinking soldier gave me the invaluable
package. I thrust it beneath my blouse, and entering, greeted Hill's
adjutant general, Miller. Miller asked, eying me suspiciously, ‘Why is
such a strong guard sent with you this morning?’ I answered, hesitating
just a little, ‘O, I don't know, but several of the boys wished to come into
Dalton, and this duty of guarding me served as a pretext.’</p>
        <p>“Miller wrote and signed the pass, and I was delighted beyond
measure when I saw the stupid sergeant and his ragged followers gallop
away. General Hill, deeming my statements with reference to the
movements of the wings of Sherman's army important, sent me to
General Johnston that I might report in person. I left Gillehan at the
tavern in Dalton, instructing him to tie the bridle reins to the saddles on
the two horses and start them towards Martin's camp. Horses herded
together in a battery or cavalry command become as thoroughly
identified, in feeling and attachments, with one another as do their
riders. Trained horses, after their riders have fallen in fierce conflicts,
never desert their colors. I knew that the horses we had appropriated,
when set free, would return to their masters.</p>
        <p>“The first man I met at General Johnston's headquarters was General
Martin. He eyed me suspiciously, but said nothing. He supposed, of
course, that the thieving scouts were already incarcerated. But nobody
knew my real name at headquarters except General Johnston and
Adjutant General Harvey. I recited my
<pb id="dupre156" n="156"/>
story, received my instructions, and when I emerged from General
Johnnston's presence, again encountered General Martin. He was telling
Colonel E. J. Harris, Colonel Miller, and General Harvey of the ‘infernal
daring theft of two horses practiced by two scouts.’ Miller gave me a
most significant glance, but I made no sign. I heard Harvey, General
Johnston's adjutant general, say, ‘They can't escape. There is a pair of
them, you say? and you sent up the charges with the guard?’</p>
        <p>“ ‘O, yes; d--d them!’ answered Martin.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Then,’ replied Colonel Harvey, ‘they can't escape. They will be in
the guard-house before night and under the daisies to-morrow
morning.’</p>
        <p>“Miller looked at me pitifully again. He evidently knew that I had
appropriated Martin's horses and stolen the ‘indictment.’</p>
        <p>“I did not feel comfortably, and silently beckoned Miller to follow
me. He and I went to the tavern. I had brought in a few Yankee luxuries,
and Miller loved delicious beverages. Gillehan had prepared dinner, and
I produced a bottle, and then expounded General Martin's griefs. Miller
laughed till he suffered mortal anguish. We drank again, and as he
advised, I hurried away to execute tasks imposed by the latest orders of
General Johnston.</p>
        <p>“Then other scouts came in from different directions during the day.
General Martin still lounged about headquarters. He knew his indictment
had been sent up and that the scout it accompanied would be arrested.
General Harvey so advised him, and so did General Hill. But no arrest
was made. Late in the afternoon, Martin hurried out ten miles to see the
officer who had sent me in under guard. This officer could only say that
a scout had gone forward with a sergeant and five men and that the
sergeant had the papers to be delivered at headquarters. Martin hurried
back to General Hill, to be informed that three scouts only had reported
during the day and that no papers came with either. Then Martin rode
back to see the sergeant. He heard the simple story that the papers were
delivered to the scout himself at General Hill's door. Again did Martin fly
to General Hill's, to find that the bird had flown.</p>
        <p>“I was already bending my steps towards East Tennessee to
discharge a service requiring an absence of two weeks. General Martin
was now advised that, though I was a horse-thief, I had returned the
property, temporarily appropriated, and that my recall was impossible.
Colonel Miller explained the facts to Generals Johnston and Hill, and I
would gladly tender this apologetic statement to General Martin.</p>
        <p>“By the way,” continued the captain, “I have here a northern
newspaper, the Cincinnati <hi rend="italics">Gazette</hi>. It tells of terrible events that
occurred in Texas in 1861. Mankind can never understand it, but it is true
that there was a share of justification for most horrible deeds ever done
in Kansas, Missouri, and Texas.<sic>.</sic> A Federal colonel in Missouri, McNeil,
caused a dozen or two men to be shot, at Palmyra in that State, in cold
blood. When we learn why this was done the
<pb id="dupre157" n="157"/>
crime is so mitigated that many have approved McNeil's deeds. So it was
as regards terrible tragedies that marked these first days of dreadful
revolution in Texas. It was then a sparsely populated border State. The
worst elements of eastern society, fleeing from minions of outraged law
in older States, sought refuge in Texas. In many districts few bonds of
society or of good government were recognized. Security for life and
property depended on each strong arm. Men differing in reference to
pending political questions naturally sought proper affinities, and
Unionists were organized, as were secessionists, and each dreaded and
hated the other class. There was not in Northwestern Texas a more
highly esteemed gentleman than William C. Young. He had filled the
office of district-attorney with distinguished ability, and was known and
beloved everywhere. He and James Bourland, his devoted friend, were
riding on horseback from Gainesville, Texas, to Bourland's home. Both
were ardent secessionists, and Bourland was deemed the most
influential and, perhaps, the best and oldest citizen of Northern Texas.
Colonel Young was shot down by an assassin.</p>
        <p>“The killing of Young was the beginning of a series of vengeful
enormities. Murder and arson were incidents of everyday life. It
was ascertained that a plot was concocted involving the destruction of
towns and villages, and the taking off of Bourland and of each
prominent citizen of the country. Bourland and his friends knew this to
be a fact, and the end came after forty-one of the conspirators were
hanged to the great elm tree at Gainsville. Thirteen were hanged, after a
fair trial, before a Judge-Lynch tribunal, in Hopkins County; and three, I
have been told, under the same circumstances, and after full proof of the
criminal purposes of the accused, at Austin. When Federal generals
came into power in Texas, after inquiring into the facts affecting these
wholesale executions by mob law, they deemed it proper to ignore
offenses of Bourland, and of others like him, and punishment, after
peace, was never inflicted for terrible deeds, justified perhaps by
dangers that begat them. If the editor of the <hi rend="italics">Gazette</hi> had lived at the
time in Texas, he would surely forgive, if he could not forget. The people
were not so bad; but the times were sadly out of joint and extraordinary
dangers demanded, in frontier communities, extraordinary securities.”</p>
        <p>The newspaper man said that Bourland did not hang forty-one men to
the elm tree at Gainesville because these were Unionists, but simply
because internecine war demanded the extirpation of one or the other
local party to the conflict. The Federal general, Curtis, was coming down
from the Indian Territory, it was thought, into Texas, and conspirators at
Gainesville, in Hopkins County, and at Austin, had concerted plans to
be executed when Federal armies appeared, involving the extirpation
of secessionists. The discovery of plots of this character
impelled Bourland and others to adopt desperate remedies for dreadful
evils.</p>
        <pb id="dupre158" n="158"/>
        <p>“When I was in Richmond, not long ago,” said the journalist,
“and was clerk of a congressional committee, I ascertained that quite
forty thousand Federal soldiers had gone out of East Tennessee, and,
from states south of the Ohio, not less than two hundred thousand men
had entered the Federal service. Suppose you deduct two hundred
thousand from Grant's and Sherman's armies and add two hundred
thousand to those of Jefferson Davis. There is instituted an equivalent
of four hundred thousand men added to Confederate strength. With this
we would surely defeat the North and have on this continent that 'double-
barreled' Union for which Davis and Yancey pray. For office-holders, I
confess, it would be well, but I don't see in what the people are to be
gainers. Duplication of governments signifies quadruplication of taxes;
and governments are only taxing, plundering schemes of
law-administration; and that which is cheapest, and governs least, is
commonly best.”</p>
        <p>Mamie and Bessie were intent listeners, and Spratling gazed
abstractedly into the fire-place when the newspaper man continued:</p>
        <p>“Our stories have been drawn mainly from Tennessee and the Gulf
States. While I am dreaming of the results of this fearful war I would tell
Bessie and Mamie of a little episode in the history of progressive, grand
events which they will never forget. I had been some days in Richmond,
nearly a year ago, when the starving and half-clad women at the market  - 
most of them widows of soldiers in Lee's army  -  finding that the money
supplied would no longer give them bread, moved in a body to the
Capitol. They proposed to appeal for relief to Governor Letcher. It was
an unique and dangerous mob of three or four thousand reckless,
desperate, hungry, poorly clad women.</p>
        <p>“Hearing the shrieks and screams of the multitude, I ran from my
room to the Capitol. When I entered the building the women were
swarming into the open space between Clay's statue and the
monuments reared in honor of Jefferson and Henry, and Governor
Letcher's red head was visible amid the throng rapidly gathering upon
the portico of the state-house. I heard his friends ask, ‘What can we do
with them?’</p>
        <p>“ ‘Soldiers are helpless and useless,’ said the governor, ‘we can't fire
into that mob, and the women know it.’</p>
        <p>“I said to the Governor that ‘a steam fire-engine, guarded by a military
company would put the poor creatures to flight.’</p>
        <p>“But the governor relied upon fluency of speech and gentle
persuasiveness and perhaps upon his good looks. The uglier a
red-haired, red-visaged man, the handsomer he esteems himself. His
Excellency's graces of person and manner and genuine eloquence
availed nothing.</p>
        <p>“There was a gigantic, red-haired woman  -  she looked like another
Letcher, in a homespun frock  -  who led the vociferous, shrieking
throng. She shouted:</p>
        <p>“ ‘We want bread, not words! Let us help ourselves! Follow me!’</p>
        <p>“She went rapidly, throwing her hands wildly above her head,
<pb id="dupre159" n="159"/>
and shouting words of encouragement and exasperation to her lean, lank,
meanly-clad, reckless, starving followers. They entered Main Street and
desolated it. Storehouses were ransacked. They burdened themselves
with every description of trumpery with which poverty-stricken
trades-people filled wretched shelves. They moved to the quarter-master's
depository of army supplies, and expelling clerks and guards, freighted
themselves with bridles, saddles, and wagon covers. I saw a dozen
women emerge from the building with saddles on their backs. When, at
length, they discovered the commissariat, they threw aside everything
they had appropriated at other places, and gathering up their outer skirts,
filled their laps with flour and sugar. Each sought to take away, in this
manner, the largest possible quantity, and when each had freighted her
uplifted dress with all she could carry, she started, bare-legged, for her
home. The spectacle became as ludicrous as it was pitiful. Merchants
and soldiers followed in the train of this army of hungry women
gathering up their scattered wares and public and private property. No
great losses were sustained, and the incident only led to the adoption of
measures by the public authorities designed to prevent the recurrence of
such dangers. Food was issued to the poor wives and widows of
soldiers themselves. But the rich and those in authority in Richmond
never knew or measured the woes and miseries of the poor. I am sure an
illustration will interest Bessie and Mamie.</p>
        <p>“One Sunday, while in Richmond, a few days before the battle of
Chancellorsville, I went to Hollywood, the famed cemetery of Richmond.
Time, when peace is restored, will make it an attractive spot. Though the
site is admirably chosen, and many of the monuments costly and
tasteful, yet the grave-stones are all of recent date. I never cared to
wander through a grave-yard in which there are no old tombstones. Men
just buried are too nearly allied to the living. The gulf that separates us is
neither deep nor wide enough to excite those strangely sad emotions
experienced when we decipher time-worn epitaphs, ascribing to ashes
beneath all the virtues of our race. Two ex-presidents sleep in
Hollywood; and not far away there are countless graves of soldiers of
the South, the victims of insatiate revolution. Monumental marble will
designate the resting places of statesmen who achieved all the ends of
human ambition, but the graves of soldiers who gave their lives, as they
believed, for their country's emancipation, have no marks to distinguish
burial places in which truest representatives of unselfish patriotism have
returned to dust. When war no longer desolates the land, when
prosperity reigns, and a grateful people would honor the illustrious dead,
there will not be wanting a mausoleum to tell posterity that Hollywood is
consecrated in a nation's heart. There they lie, beneath those little
hillocks, with rude boards as head-stones, the gallant men who fell in all
the battles around Richmond. There, too, are those whose lives went
away from bodies racked with pain in Richmond hospitals. Mothers and
wives and sisters shall visit Hollywood through many coming years,
from all
<pb id="dupre160" n="160"/>
the Southern States, that they may view the spot where the loved and lost
repose in undistinguished graves.</p>
        <p>“I stood upon holy ground.</p>
        <p>“The funeral train of poverty came in at the gateway as I was going out. A
market wagon contained a little coffin of rough boards. A gray-haired negro was
the driver, and three women, an old man, and half a dozen thinly-clad little girls
and boys followed very slowly  -  all with measured steps and sad faces. As I
was going out a little girl, eight or nine years old, poorly clad, was closing the
gate. Her face was pretty, and her large lustrous eyes grew bright when I asked
the name of the occupant of the coffin. She seemed to think that everybody
should know that ‘Mary’ was dead.</p>
        <p>“ ‘It is strange you did not know Mary. I thought almost everybody knew
her. She was so good, and gentle, and kind, and she was her mother's only child.
I went to school with Mary.’</p>
        <p>“The simplicity and earnestness of the child interested me. I wished to know
more of Mary and of that poor, heart-broken woman, so meanly attired, who
was following with unsteady steps her only child to the grave<sic corr=".">,</sic> I cannot, of
course, give the language of the little girl, but she said:</p>
        <p>“ ‘When I used to look at Mary I wondered how people could ever call her
homely; there were so many shades of color in her eyes when I was talking to
her, and the blood would come and go in her pale cheeks. She used to help the
little children across the muddy streets and give away her scanty meal to some
poor child who was hungry at school. She would teach me, too, the hard, long
words in my geography. When the other girls made fun of my dress because it
had holes in it, and my mother there, who is poor, like Mary's, could not buy
me another, Mary used to put her arms around me to conceal the rents. I used to
think there was a pretty light around Mary's sweet face, like that which mother
showed me in the picture of our Savior. Those who did not know Mary well,
did not think she was so beautiful, but we little children did. She was kindest
and gentlest to the poorest of us.’</p>
        <p>“I had never listened to an eulogium upon the dead more touching than this
which fell from the tremulous lips and tearful eyes of Mary's friend.</p>
        <p>“She is not homely now. The bright sun when it goes down again upon the
little childish group who come tripping out of the old school-house shall not add
luster to the changeful eyes and pale cheeks of Mary; her seat in school is
vacant; her satchel lies idly on the shelf. The spider will weave his busy web
upon the wall in Mary's garret, but there are no lustrous loving eyes to watch
him. The heart-broken mother shall often dream that she hears, and listen in vain
for the soft, sweet accents of little Mary's voice; she shall see Mary, not here,
and many like her of whom the earth was not worthy.</p>
        <p>“How coldly and rudely the clods that struck Mary's coffin fell upon that
mother's heart! A piercing shriek escaped her lips. Then
<pb id="dupre161" n="161"/>
all was still again, except the falling of the dull, heavy earth with
which the old man filled the shallow grave. When all were leaving
the place, I asked the school-child friend of Mary how she came to die.</p>
        <p>“ ‘I don't know,’ she answered; ‘Mother said that the war took bread from the
poor in Richmond, and Mary's mother is very, very poor.’</p>
        <p>“I never think of these facts or of the miseries and vices of our race
precipitated by this wicked, needless, fratricidal war that I do not involuntarily
ask whether they who deem themselves statesmen, and as such inaugurated this
conflict or made it unavoidable, will not be consigned to deeper depths of
perdition by an outraged God of goodness than that which must be fathomed by
common soldiers like ourselves. William L. Yancy, Jefferson Davis, A. G.
Brown, Toombs, Wigfall, and the many like them, who followed in Yancy's
wake, constituted the dragon of the Apocalypse with seven heads and ten horns
whose tail drew after it ‘the stars of heaven and did cast them to earth.’ I do not
question their honesty or patriotism, mark you; but only ask whether they have
not outrivaled a De Golyer in paving hell with good intentions.”</p>

        <p>The very day that the captain and Spratling returned to camp, Tunnel Hill
and Dalton were evacuated by the Confederates and our way was open to the
home of Mamie Hughes. There Bessie and her mother were gladly welcomed.
Their purpose was to remain only a day and then go further south to their old
home in Oglethorpe County.</p>
        <p>Mamie said, when she and Bessie met, “that the invitation, sent long before,
had been accepted most unexpectedly. I am glad,” she continued, “that you are
here, but deplore the calamity that sent you to our home.”</p>
        <p>Bessie's father had gone to Oglethorpe and could not return because of the
intervention of our army. It was necessary to communicate with him, and Mrs.
Starnes was persuaded to remain with her newly-made friends until she could
advise her husband of misfortunes that overwhelmed her.</p>
        <p>Such calamities were too numberless to excite sympathy, and, of every-day
occurrence, were borne as complacently by the immediate sufferers as by their
friends. People soon forgot the fallen when each day's list of the dead was
countless. Death, in war, has no terrors, save for the dying. Hunger and suffering
are laughed at because death, the gate-way of escape, is so accessible. Courage, in
such an age, is the only virtue worth the having; and he who shuddered when
wealth became indigence, was the veriest of cowards.</p>
        <p>“When the Confederacy rises in the ruins of Lincoln's empire,”
<pb id="dupre163" n="163"/>
said Mrs. Starnes, “I will still own the farm, and Mr. Spratling says he will

        <p>Spratling, now an unwilling <hi rend="italics">quasi</hi>-invalid, was confined to the house by the
imperious edicts of Bessie and Mamie. His neglected wound was painful, the
shoulder swollen, and left arm useless. Wholesome food and women's watchful
care wrought a speedy change, and when dancing at night and hunting by day
and stories of army life during the long evenings were indulged, delicious odors
of pine and cedar wood fires perfuming the commodious country house,
Spratling rapidly regained his wonted vigor.</p>
        <p>The captain could not abandon Spratling; the editor and schoolmaster were
free to depart or remain; the editor's brother, like the Federal lieutenant, Hughes,
had a month's furlough.</p>
        <p>A trusted negro servant was dispatched for Mr. Starnes, to Lexington, in
Oglethorpe County, the most venerable in its apparent antiquity of all the
towns of Georgia. Green moss, on great boulders along white sandy roadways
leading into the ancient town, is growing gray. Myriads of pebbles in the
long-used streets are worn perfectly round by gliding feet of successive generations,
and Sunday-school “scholars” are relieved of the necessity of buying marbles.
Bob Toombs and Chief Justice Joseph Henry Lumpkin used to live in
Lexington; but when the antique metropolis of Oglethorpe, fifty years ago, was
finished and fenced in, they were left outside and migrated. They grew great;
Lexington stood still. The venerable village could not contain them. In years long
agone, William H. Crawford  -  deemed by the great Napoleon the greatest of
Americans  -  had his home at Lexington.</p>
        <p>“There,” said the newspaper man, “I saw this grand old man in extreme old
age after he had been almost President of the United States, having competed for
the office with Jackson, Clay, and Adams  -  I saw this gigantic old civilian, in
my childhood, sitting on the circuit bench and determining a criminal
prosecution in which Joseph Henry Lumpkin appeared for the defendant, an
aged man, accused of stealing a sheep. He was palpably guilty; but Lumpkin's
matchless eloquence won an acquittal, when Crawford, chiding the jury for its
tears and weakness, set aside the verdict and ordered a new trial.</p>
        <p>“This William H. Crawford was the only American, perhaps, who knew the
great Napoleon, personally and intimately. Among his private papers there
were found, after his death, kindliest letters, I am told, from the great emperor.
Napoleon could afford to deal with the great American as an equal and as a
friend when state policy would not suffer him to unbend in the presence of a
subject.</p>
        <p>“The other great man of Lexington, Joseph Henry Lumpkin, was the
unrivaled barrister till he became the matchless judge. His learning, genius, and
logical acumen compelled his professional elevation. He was a native-born
abolitionist. When at college, at Princeton or Yale, he adopted and expressed
opinions on the subject of negro servitude that enabled his pro-slavery rivals to
defeat his honorable
<pb id="dupre164" n="164"/>
aspirations. But such were his unapproachable forensic abilities that the
lawyers of Georgia were forced to remove him from their sphere of
action. No sentence of death could be pronounced if Joseph Henry
Lumpkin appealed to the jury, and, therefore, the orator was merged into
the judge. His opinions, as Chief Justice of Georgia, are as admirable
specimens of rhetorical logic as the finest that ever fell from the lips of
the greatest Lord Chancellor.</p>
        <p>“But I may be impelled to speak by the prejudices of my youth,”
continued the editor. “I was not four years old when I saw the aged
William H. Crawford sleeping on the wool-sack in Lexington, while
Joseph Henry Lumpkin flooded the court-room with tears because a
gray-haired country bumpkin was forced by pangs of poverty to steal a
sheep.</p>
        <p>“George R. Gilmer, when I was a boy, still lived in Lexington.
He, too, was then very old. In another place I have written of his
archæological tastes and pursuits, and of the care and toil and money he
devoted to the collection of antique and other curiosities of taste and
learning. He had been governor and served in both branches of the
United States Congress. He was the kindliest, most generous of men. I
would never have violated a moundbuilder's tomb or traced De Soto's
devious path across the Gulf States if I had not heard Governor Gilmer
descant upon dim outlines of giant figures that peopled realms of his
fancy with splendid visions of war, peace, homes, and cities of extinct
races.”</p>
        <p>The schoolmaster had been listening intently while the newspaper
man was reviving phantom figures of departed greatness and when the
fire burned low, and kettle lid rattled and escaping steam sang a lullaby
that begat silence and somnolency, the pedagogue said that, in 1832, then
a very young man, he taught a country school near Carter's Hill, in
Montgomery County, Alabama.</p>
        <p>“Ingrams, Carters, Floyds, Barnets, Lees, Wares, Mooneys, Gilmers,
Merriwethers, and Du Pres were household names and words in the
modest log-cabin in which I flogged limited learning into tow-headed
urchins. I am induced to refer to these facts because I remember that one
of my ‘patrons’ was induced by another to convey a letter enclosing a
one thousand dollar United States bank-note to Governor Gilmer. Mr. D.
delivered the letter to Governor Gilmer, telling him of its contents, and he
remembered that the governor threw it <sic corr="carelessly">carlessly</sic> into a desk. Two years
elapsed. Governor Gilmer demanded payment by letter. The debtor wrote
that he had sent the money by Mr. D., his neighbor, an honest man. The
governor answered that he had never received it. Mr. D. mounted his
horse  -  there were no railways in those days  -  and went to Lexington,
more than three hundred miles. Governor Gilmer, when his old friend
came, had no recollection of the letter; but Mr. D. had forgotten nothing.
He went to the room in which the governor was sitting when he
delivered the bank-note two years before; he caused the desk
<pb id="dupre165" n="165"/>
to be opened and there found the letter, its waxen seal unbroken,
containing the money. Governor Gilmer's chagrin was painful and
lasting, so my friend, the Alabamian, informed me. Whenever, afterward,
the Alabamian visited his kindred about Lexington, he was always
entertained at a festival given by Governor Gilmer.”</p>
        <p>The newspaper man left his seat and stood facing the schoolmaster.</p>
        <p>“Do you know,” said the writer for the press, “that he was my father
who bore that letter to Governor Gilmer? I was not old enough to go to
school when you taught near Carter's Hill, but I knew afterward, all the
people you have named. I remember when the Creek Indians burned the
houses and slaughtered the people of the neighborhood. I remember
how they slew eight of nine passengers on the stage coach just after it
left Montgomery.”</p>
        <p>Of course the pedagogue had forgotten nothing of facts to which the
journalist adverted. He confessed a fresh bond of union between himself
and friend and said that “churches, newspapers, and schoolmasters had
done a great work in Alabama in a brief period. Red men have
disappeared, there are free schools and free churches and people
everywhere, and railways and steamers and the highest progressive
intelligence and civilization. Less than thirty years have passed, within
which all this has been achieved. Montgomery, the wretched little
village of one hundred cabins when I first saw it, has fifteen thousand
inhabitants.</p>
        <p>“But they were a rude people when I wielded the birchen rod in the
log cabin near Carter's Hill, ten or twelve miles from Montgomery. I saw
a farmer sell his good-looking wife, a pretty white woman she was, for a
thousand dollars to a richer neighbor; I saw Kin Mooney playing poker
with a friend, at five dollars a game, in the log church, which was also
the schoolhouse, on Sunday, while the good Baptist brother, Jack
Robinson, expounded the scriptures in this sanctuary. I saw a savage
overseer tie a negro slave, Patrick by name, to a log and draw a wild
black cat, by the tail, down the negro's naked back, from his shoulders to
his heels. The infernal process was thrice repeated. Patrick shrieked and
swooned. A strong solution of salt and vinegar was then poured over
the senseless negro's back. When he recovered his senses he was
gagged. He wore the gag, constantly moving it to one side, till it carved
a slit in the corner of his mouth. The hapless negro could talk a little and
drink a little, still wearing the gag. It was made of iron, having hinges,
and was locked behind his neck. A flat piece of iron, projecting inwardly,
from the rim, entered the mouth. I describe it because, having lived
always in the South, it was the only ‘gag’ I ever saw. When Patrick could
talk, eat and drink, wearing the gag, the overseer belled him. An iron belt
about the body and another around the neck sustained an iron rod
extending along the spine, three feet above Patrick's head. To the end of
this rod a bell was attached; and, wearing all this machinery of iron,
Patrick was forced by the fiend incarnate to pick cotton. The incentive to
this cruelty was jealousy of Patrick's influence with his
<pb id="dupre166" n="166"/>
master, then absent. When he came home, Patrick, of course, was liberated,
given a gun, and instructed to settle with the overseer. He, hearing of the course
of events, fled to Texas.</p>
        <p>“There was African <hi rend="italics">slavery</hi> in those days. It is African <hi rend="italics">servitude</hi> now. The
relations of the races, as seen in the conduct of those about us, even now
listening to what I say, and shuddering while I tell of the woes of Patrick, show
that African <hi rend="italics">slavery</hi>, even if party leaders had never organized war in organizing
secession, was no more. African ‘slavery’ does not exist, and only African
‘servitude.’ Within these brief thirty years the institution has been wholly
changed with the relations of the two races. Providence, it seems, prepared
whites and blacks, by slow, inscrutable processes, for the social conditions and
facts of to-day. On the statute-books of states, slave codes remain unrepealed;
but they are obsolete, and have been for years. Politicians rave and roar, and
abuse one another, and excite infinite sectional prejudices.</p>
        <p>“Fearing they may be reviled as abolitionists, our party leaders dare not
reform barbarous slave codes, and these have slowly lapsed, unrepealed, into
desuetude. The law inhibits books and yet negroes are everywhere taught to read
and write. Preachers are hired everywhere to preach especially in negro churches,
and the story I tell of Patrick's woes, which I witnessed, could gain credence on
no southern plantation of to-day.”</p>

        <p>How thoroughly a soldier becomes part and parcel of a great mass, losing
consciousness of individuality, we have seen, and how, therefore, <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">esprit de
corps</foreign></hi> supplants personal heroism, and how one strong man, of any race or
latitude, becomes as valuable as any other of equal strength, was often asserted
and illustrated when Major-General Pat Cleburne and many others of the best
and wisest soldiers and statesmen of the South, in 1863-64, urged the enlistment as
soldiers, and liberation as men, of the negroes of the South. Destiny and
Jefferson Davis interposed and Africa was freed by the North and not by the
South. Thus the negro, an inseparable adjunct of southern industry, civilization,
and government, loves, obeys, and serves the North, and always, in affairs of
government, involving freedom and slavery, obeys the injunctions of northern
party leaders.</p>
        <p>At Mamie's home there were more than three hundred slaves. Until
Lieutenant Hughes and his friends came, the helpless household had no other
guardians than these negroes and none could have given more perfect security.
They were devoted to the persons and interests of their white owners, and never
was a suspicion entertained, even when <sic corr="detachments">detatchments</sic> of Federal cavalry
traversed the country in all directions, and these negroes knew how thoroughly
“the shell of the hollow Confederacy was broken,” that negroes plotted against
the security of the whites.</p>
        <p>It happened, at the period of which these pages tell, that the Confederate
forces were slowly and constantly retreating. Even while the captain and his
friends were guests of Lieutenant Hughes, and while pretty Bessie Starnes, half
crazed by her affection for the Lieutenant and admiration and love of Spratling,
the Confederate army
<pb id="dupre168" n="168"/>
was slowly and sullenly moving south toward Resaca and Adairsville,
leaving this summer residence of the Hughes family within the Federal
lines.</p>
        <p>Of the retrogression of the Confederate forces, inmates of the Hughes
household were first advised by the appearance at the place of four
mounted men in blue overcoats. A breathless, excited negro, entering
the breakfast room, where the family were seated at table, announced:</p>
        <p>“Missis, de Yanks is acummin' down dar in de road. Dere won't be
nary chicken left on de place!” and Jack rubbed his hands together, and
amazed by the excitement he begat, set his back against the wall, and
grinned and twisted his body and looked from right to left, and when
asked again and again, “How many Yanks are there?” he only stared
vacantly in the faces of his inquisitors.</p>
        <p>Spratling forgot his wound, and with the rest, armed himself, and went
out. The prowling cavalrymen did not propose to encounter a number of
men greater than their own, and at once retired. No shots were fired, but
the Confederates knew that these four would be fifty Federal soldiers
when next a descent was made upon the plantation of Mrs. Hughes.</p>
        <p>“Three or four days hence,” said the captain, “these scouts will have
returned to camp and told of our presence here. A force will be sent to
capture such stragglers as we are and to gather in deserters voluntarily
remaining at points recently occupied by Confederates. We must move
at an early day.</p>
        <p>“Lieutenant,” he continued, addressing Mr. Hughes, “I don't know
whether I will regret more the termination of this delightful visit or the
necessity which requires you to accompany us. If I can, when I return to
General Cleburne's head-quarters, I will make some arrangement by which
you may not be sent to a prison-pen. No exchanges are made; the
Confederacy is starving; its soldiers are often half fed; and the
condition of prisoners of war must be horrible. Soldiers are
worth more to us than to you, and you can not afford to exchange, when
your resources are infinite as humanity and ours are restricted to sparse
populations of the Gulf States. It is a great pity that the cartel is
suspended; and I must confess that, while we are delighted as your
guests, we are grieved that you are our prisoner. By remaining, we can
not serve you or those dear to you. Our presence will only invite attack.
If we won at first, we would surely be overwhelmed at last. This might
involve the safety of women and destruction of your delightful home.</p>
        <p>“We must soon march.”</p>
        <p>This was said in the presence of the household gathered in the
hallway. Mrs. Hughes gazed tenderly in the face of her son. She
deplored his fate from which there was seemingly no escape<sic corr=".">,</sic> He was
paroled and could not fly, even if an opportunity were presented. If
captured by Federal soldiers, he could save himself and guard his home,
with those he loved. He was silent and helpless as the mother.
<pb id="dupre169" n="169"/>
Neither Bessie nor Mamie lifted their eyes from the floor. Bessie knew
that Spratling and the lieutenant were studying her face, and Mamie
could only listen, while the color fled from her cheeks, as measured
words fell slowly from the captain's lips, announcing her separation from
him and from her brother.</p>
        <p>“In times like these, when we part, we can never hope to meet again,”
said the tearful Mrs. Hughes. “Some one or more may return, but all of
you, never! never! It is dreadful to think, but when I see you strong men
going out of my door, I see you stepping down into your graves. I am
grateful because you have been so generous to my son, and it is no fault
of yours that he must leave me. My prayers and blessings will follow
you.”</p>
        <p>Death-like pallor swept over the faces of Bessie and Mamie. The facts
of the moment were too painful for their contemplation. Mamie caught
Bessie's hand and drawing her to her side, both, with bowed heads,
hurried silently away. Mrs. Hughes followed, and the sad convocation
was slowly dissolved.</p>
        <p>When we sat, that cool winter evening, about the broad, blazing
hearth, the schoolmaster said “he had been studying the character and
conduct of negroes all his life. While they do no violent deeds and
share, as a race, in none of the toils or dangers incident to their own
deliverance, they rarely fail to show, when the test is applied, that they
prefer freedom to servitude.</p>
        <p>“They have uniformly forgotten personal attachments, such as
subsist between your servants, Lieutenant, and yourself, to show that
they prefer freedom to slavery. They uniformly betray the Confederates
and however earnest in assertions of personal devotion to their owners,
are privately and really loyal to the Union. I have found, to the extent
that their intelligence may make them trustworthy, that they are useful
and efficient spies. They never fail to disclose places of concealment of
persons and property, and evince, always, to the extent that they deem it
safe, unmixed loyalty to the ‘Stars and Stripes.’ I tell you this because I
have seen how this family is disposed to trust, implicitly, the asserted
fidelity of these negroes. I tell you, Lieutenant, your mother will be
betrayed by them. She will lose every valuable article she conceals if
these ‘devoted household servants’ suspect the place of concealment.
The poor negro thinks to aid and thus win favor in the eyes of
blue-coated patriotism by betraying these confidences. The blue-coat
never shares the spoils with the negro. The negro does not ask it. His
impulses are higher and nobler than those of the white man. He would
only serve the cause this white man espouses. The white man  -  the
camp-follower and not the soldier  -  is content if he may fill his purse.</p>
        <p>“Did it ever occur to you that you may direct any genuine bullet-
headed African to do any three acts, and that he will obey, but never
discharging the three tasks in the order in which you name them? His
head is too thick for him to think consecutively. He never recks of the
morrow. He is always perfectly blest in the abundance of
<pb id="dupre170" n="170"/>
to-day. Is not this race-peculiarity to be ascribed to race-habits, the
outgrowth of countless centuries of slavery? They have never been
subjected to the necessity of providing for present or future wants.
Their own needs have never shaped their actions; and, therefore, their
boundless unselfishness, and their heedlessness and incapacity to think
for the future. Their round, thick skulls and brain-forces are
conformed to facts and necessities of centuries.</p>
        <p>“It is true that in wide districts of the Gulf States, denuded by
conscription of arms-bearing whites, negroes outnumbering whites as ten
and twenty to one, there has occurred no negro outbreak. There is no
negro criminality, and perfect order, peace, security, and industry are
maintained. Confederate armies are fed and clothed and kept in the
field by negro industry; but let me assure you that each negro, the old
and the young, seeks freedom, and prefers it even to this serfdom or
peonage subsisting on this estate, or <foreign lang="es">ranche</foreign>, as termed in Mexico.
Wherever liberated they have never consented to re-enslavement, and it
is most fortunate that they have been gradually elevated by ‘slavery,’
which has become ‘servitude,’ and then serfdom, while local statutes
remained unchanged and unenforced. The frightful quarrel between the
abolitionists and secessionists made local statutory law irrepealable, but
the negro code, like the fact of original African slavery, fell of its own
bloody, barbarous weight into desuetude. The age of preparation is
passed, and that of realization, perhaps, is come. Who can fathom
the mysteries of God's providence in His dealings with races and
nations?</p>
        <p>“Wherever liberated, as I have seen in Tennessee and Kentucky, these
creatures have wandered away at once from their homes. They can not
otherwise realize the fact of absolute freedom. They could not
otherwise enjoy it to their full bent. The 'old massa's' presence
and supreme authority was still confessed in the old cabin occupied
through a lifetime of servitude, and they could only divest themselves
of its influence by going into exile. But, wherever freed, they have
sought supposed delights incident to freedom, which never come.
They are still slaves; not of the white man, but of hunger and thirst
and cold.</p>
        <p>“The forty acres and a mule have never descended, as did the
beasts of the fields in a curtain suspended before St. Peter, from the
opened heavens, upon the hapless African. After a time these
liberated blacks will realize exactions imposed by nature's laws, and
there is not on God's footstool a better laboring population, or one
more simple and kindly, more contented or law-abiding. As we see
them in the rich cotton and sugar producing districts to-day, where
they are still slaves, so will they be when freedom strikes shackles
from their souls. Such masters as you, Lieutenant, can lose nothing
by the extinction of the <hi rend="italics">law</hi> of slavery; the practical fact, if it be a
fact here to-day, will still subsist.”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” interposed Spratling, who had been listening drowsily to this
soliloquy of the pedagogue, while the captain on one side of the
<pb id="dupre171" n="171"/>
room with Mamie, and Bessie and the lieutenant on the other,
spoke at intervals, in subdued tones,  -  “Yes,” said Spratling, “I
asked that black rascal who pretended to be so badly scared this
morning when the Yankee scouts came, what he proposed to do when
he was set free.</p>
        <p>“ ‘I dunno, massa,’ he answered, ‘but I'z gwine to sleep in de sunshine,
ropped up in pancakes, en yaller-gal angels, dey'll pore lasses
ober me.’ ”</p>
        <p>“There's a heavenly picture of perfect negro beatitude, and its
realization is coming,” said the schoolmaster.</p>

        <p>“I am sure that people in future years and centuries will be amazed by
accounts of our present modes of living. We journalists,” said the editor,
“have been reduced to the utmost straits. I printed two issues of my
<hi rend="italics">Register</hi> on pretty wall-paper, using only one side of each sheet. It
happened, possibly, because the Confederate Government was getting
out a new issue of notes and bonds and monopolized the service of the
paper-mills. My only resource was wall-paper owned by a cheerful
Hebrew, and the reading matter of the striped sheets was confined to one
side of each. It was a queer show when the people, having supplied
themselves with accounts of the latest battle, sat along the curbstones
and in their doorways holding up the ugly striped, red, white, blue,
black, and figured sheets before their eager faces. I was
employed, when its editor, John B. Dumble, an Ohio Democrat, was
sick, to conduct, for a short time, a daily paper in Atlanta. Sam C.
Reid and Dr. I. E. Nagle, two army correspondents of my own
newspaper, were in Atlanta at the time. It happened that a
blockade-runner had entered Wilmington and supplied us abundantly with
Jamaica rum. I paid eighty dollars a gallon and was not aware of the
fact that each newspaper of the place, and there were four <sic corr="dailies">dalies</sic> then
published in Atlanta, was in like manner conciliated by the generous
importer. There was a famous restaurateur in Atlanta. He drew his
supplies of early vegetables and fruits from Florida and commonly
spread, though he paid forty cents per pound for salt, a very attractive
table. He had no wine, and only the white country whiskey of
the period. I discovered my opportunity in the possession of the Jamaica
rum, and therefore ordered dinner for eight newspaper men. What
<pb id="dupre173" n="173"/>
was my <sic corr="astonishment">astonisment</sic> when I went to dinner, that I encountered no
members of the ‘press-gang’except Ried and Nagle. The absentees did
not even deign to send apologies for the non-acceptance of my
invitation. Nagle and Reid had each seen, during the morning, two of the
noble profession, and we inferred, from the condition of these two, that
all the rest, as fortunate as I had been, had received a gallon, or even
more, of the delicious product of <sic corr="Jamaican">Jamaician</sic> distilleries. We three sat
down to drink the rum and dispatch the viands before us.</p>
        <p>“It was finally proposed and agreed that each of us, and each absent
journalist, should contribute a ‘rousing dinner-table speech to the
delights of the rum occasion.’ We sat to work, and each furnished, within
three or four hours, two columns of matter for my friend's and my own
newspaper. We wrote and published our own and supposed speeches,
as genuine, of all the invited editors. We made the ancient and venerated
McClanahan pronounce a heartfelt eulogium upon Andrew Jackson
Democracy. We reproduced, as Watterson's harangue, the substance of
his unique and inimitable delineation of Parson Brownlow's character. It
was believed that the parson had died a few days before. Dumble's
incisive logic characterized his dinner-table talk. Dill was made to utter
a few sentences laudatory of the women of the time, and the whole of
these speeches appeared next morning. Readers of the <hi rend="italics">Appeal</hi> and of the
<hi rend="italics">Register</hi> supposed that the dinner was enjoyed by many guests, and
that the speeches were welcomed with loud applause. This was natural
enough; but Nagle, Reid, and I were especially dumfounded when we
met, three days later, to find that each editor, but one, supposed his
published speech genuine; that he had made it as stated, and that his
obliviousness of the incidents of the occasion was wholly due to the
overpowering influence of Jamaica rum. I congratulated McClanahan
next morning after the supposed festival, on his eloquent tribute to the
rock-ribbed secession Democracy. He looked at me doubtingly. I said:</p>
        <p>“ ‘Mack, you were a little intoxicated, you remember, but you had your
wits about you, and your talking tackle was never in better condition.’</p>
        <p>“I produced a copy of McClanahan's own paper and pointed out
passages in his speech which I especially approved.</p>
        <p>“Still wearing a puzzled look, and rubbing his eyes, McClanahan at
last concluded that he had been unconsciously ‘the orator of the
occasion.’ When soon afterward congratulated by Nagle, Mack never
hesitated a moment, but replied:</p>
        <p>“ ‘Yes, Doctor, I had been taking a little rum, but made a --- ---
good speech; didn't I?’</p>
        <p>“Congressmen print speeches, written but never delivered, and
distribute them among their innocent constituencies, and Congressmen
have speeches written for them that are delivered as their own; but here
we see that editors not only have speeches written, but delivered
<pb id="dupre174" n="174"/>
and printed as their own, of which they never heard or dreamed. But the
editors deserved the more praise and less censure in this, that each
honestly supposed he made the speech ascribed to him, and each
earnestly congratulated the other because of his triumph, and the
innocent people were not sought by the journalists to be humbugged.”</p>

        <p>Lieutenant Hughes was not loquacious. His position as host and as
our prisoner, and, possibly, his doubtful acceptance as a professed
suitor of Bessie Starnes, silenced him. His conduct toward her while she
was beneath his roof was, necessarily, in his eyes, most guarded. She
was his sister's friend, and, as such, his guest. He was, as we beheld
his action, studiously formal. He seemed no more desirous of amusing and
entertaining Bessie than others of his guests. He said, with abstracted
manner, one evening, that stories we had been telling recalled an
incident that befell him when, detailed on special service, he went to a
little town, New Madrid, in Missouri.</p>
        <p>“With one hundred men, I was sent eight or ten miles southwest of
the place to capture or destroy a guerrilla camp. A bright, good-natured,
grinning negro, very black, came to our headquarters on the low plain, in
the rear of New Madrid, to tell me that one Captain H. E. Clark, a rude,
energetic rebel, who had been capturing our scouts and cutting off
foraging parties, might be easily taken prisoner or destroyed. The negro
said that Clark had done him some grievous wrong, and that he
proposed to avenge it. I applied to the commanding officer of the post,
to whom this ‘contraband’ recited his story as he had to me. I must
confess that now and then I had doubts of the negro's veracity, and
vague apprehensions of betrayal were suggested; but negroes had been
found faithful always, and I could not well see how one would have the
courage to attempt treason to truth, and to himself, and the cause of his
own freedom.</p>
        <p>“In any event, I was instructed to take one hundred chosen men and
capture or destroy Clark and his freebooters.</p>
        <p>“It is a wonderful country just west of New Madrid. The streams
<pb id="dupre176" n="176"/>
occupy deep channels, or crevices, carved out by the earthquake of
1811-12. The water flows through densest weeds and cresses. Brightest
flowers bloom and blossom above the surface, and these strange, deep
creeks, emptying into the murky Mississippi, are of pellucid clearness.
When crossing these streams, we could see fish disporting themselves
ten feet below the surface. The country had been lifted up by the
<sic corr="earthquake">eathquake</sic> shocks of 1811-12 so that artificial drains, said to have
connected the Mississippi with the St. Francis and White, lateral and
tributary streams, were broken by this upheaval of the land, and the
superabundant water of the great river was left to follow the river's
main channel, and submerge farms and houses along its resistless course.
States have constructed mighty earthen walls to confine it to its deep
and tortuous course; but it defies every obstruction, and carves out its
path along the highest ridge between the parallel highlands, fifty miles
apart, extending from Cairo almost to the sea. When the water first leaves
the overcharged main channel, it holds most mud in suspension, and
then, too, this water moves most slothfully, and, of course, at that
moment it deposits most mud and most rapidly. Therefore, the banks are
highest at the river's edge, and therefore you hear people say they
descend the Mississippi in steamers and look down upon the tops of
planters' residences and mills hard by the uplifted ‘inland sea.’
Therefore, the terrors of a crevasse and frightful force of the pent-up
flood-tide when a crayfish, or malicious person, or the slow abrasion
of the soil has given vent to the accumulated waters. I saw the levee
break one morning late in May, a year ago. Houses and fences disappeared
as if swallowed by a maelstrom. The people fled as from ‘the wrath to
come;’ and when the resistless torrent reached the forest, one hundred
yards distant, mightiest trees, the growth of centuries, went down as did
the reeds of the canebrake. The roaring of the rushing flood, and crashing
and breaking of falling cypresses, two and three hundred feet high, shook
the earth, and no tempest's roar was ever comparable with this echoing
thunder of the drunken mighty ‘father of floods.’ Here it carves out for
itself a new channel and slowly renews the process of upbuilding its own
banks. In this it is only aided by the construction of levees, those frail
earthen walls designed to hedge it in. It rises with successive floods,
higher and higher above the marshland plain, until accident or resistless
inertia of heaped up floods breaks down all barriers, and pretty homes
and redundant crops are again overwhelmed. But standing at any time or
place on the shore of the Mississippi, and listening to the sullen roar of
its tawny waters, one always confesses the sublime majesty of the
mighty river. There is no such impressive embodiment of the ideal of the
River of Death, forever sweeping countless myriads into the ocean of
eternal rest, as this, which chants forever a sonorous melancholy requiem
over graves of nations and cities, and of unknown, forgotten races, that
once dwelt along its shores. There is infinite sadness in sombre forests
of impenetrable gloom and density lining the low, flat shores, and
shutting out the sun's rays. It trends
<pb id="dupre177" n="177"/>
away to one or the other side of its earthen prison walls, and, leaning
lazily against it, groans and roars as if its sluggish movements of
measureless force were painful to the monstrous river. When weary of
resting against the eastern, it slowly moves to the western side of its
ever-changeful channel. Its wayward lawlessness is as marvelous as
memories of pilots who watch, beneath moon and stars and mocking
dancing shadows of the night, its ever-varying courses and measure by
miniature whirlpools on its surface, the depth of boiling billows.</p>
        <p>“But I was going to tell you of a negro's treason to the Union. It is a
single confessed instance, and I was its victim. Of course the black
rascal was my guide to the guerrilla Clark's hiding place. My force was
compelled to follow a narrow path across the swamp. Any deviation
from the track, only wide enough for one horseman, was almost certain
death. Quagmires were bottomless. I became interested, as we were
going out of New Madrid, in a description a raw recruit from Tennessee,
named Tillman, was giving me of Reelfoot Lake, and of its strange origin
on the eastern side of the river, and made the intelligent youth promise
to recite the whole story as soon as we had leisure, by the camp fire.</p>
        <p>“Meanwhile, it occurred to me that we had traveled ten or fifteen,
when the negro had said we need only go eight miles. I caused the
command to halt. The negro was brought into my presence. I stated to
him that his integrity was questioned, and that if he did not lead us at
once to Clark's den I would have him shot. I ordered a trustworthy
sergeant to ride beside or near the negro, and shoot him if, within the
next half hour, we were not at Clark's hiding place. Within twenty
minutes I heard the report of a pistol, and riding rapidly forward I
encountered a corporal, who said that the negro had taken advantage of
his perfect knowledge of the paths through the swamp, and of the
different appearances of the miry and of hard ground, and had separated
himself and the sergeant from the main body of my command, and that
the ‘black rascal had shot the sergeant dead and disappeared.’</p>
        <p>“Fortunately, it seemed, we could see an ‘opening,’ as woodsmen term
a ‘clearing,’ half a mile ahead, and moved rapidly toward it. Instead of a
barn, we found a ‘gin-house.’ Its body rested on pillars  -  great trees
hewn square  -  twelve feet high. Within the building, above these
pillars, was the gin that separates the seed from the cotton, and below,
on the ground and inside the pillars, was the great cogged wheel and its
lever, to which mules are attached, that the gin may be driven to do its
office. Here we camped for the night.</p>
        <p>“Knowing Clark's strength, I was not apprehensive of an assault; but
I posted a strong picket force, and taking with me the youthful
Tennesseean recruit who had interested me during the day, I ordered my
men to destroy no property, but make themselves comfortable under and
about the gin-house. In compliance with an invitation from the widowed
owner of the estate, I went to the ‘big house,’ as designated by the negro
who had brought the note of invitation. The
<pb id="dupre178" n="178"/>
widow first appeared. After tendering me the hospitalities of her
delightful home, she introduced her daughter, a pretty maiden, blushing
into perfect womanhood. I was charmed by the confiding kindliness of
the widow, and fascinated by the bright eyes and dewy lips and
winsome smiles of the pretty daughter. The widow devoted herself to
the youthful Tennesseean, while the daughter was evidently most
willing that I should be well pleased.”</p>
        <p>It may be proper to add, parenthetically, that Bessie Starnes was
silently listening to this recital as made by Lieutenant Hughes, and I
could not help watching the color come and go in her changeful, tell-tale
face. Her eyes were fixed upon the blazing logs in the broad,
deep fire-place, while she listened intently to the story, and whether
the more because of dangers that threatened the lieutenant at the
hands of armed men, or of a woman, bending every energy to achieve
a perfect conquest, I could not divine.</p>
        <p>The lieutenant said that he was hungry, and that it occurred to him
that the meal which he had been invited to share was unaccountably
delayed.</p>
        <p>“I looked at my watch,” said the lieutenant, “and found it was nine
o'clock. I did not see the reason for this tardiness, and became a little
restive. My camp was half a mile away, and I said to the mistress of the
house that I would walk down the road a short distance and learn that
everything was quiet at the gin-house. The Tennesseean accompanied
me. Going out, I observed a spur, freshly worn, lying on the ground. I
said to the Tennesseean:</p>
        <p>“ ‘Some one left hurriedly when we came, losing this spur. Perhaps he
was a courier sent to Clark's hiding place to advise him of our presence
here. Perhaps supper is delayed that we may be detained till Clark may
come and capture us. He spares no prisoners I am told. He is a lawless
fellow, and his followers are yellow-faced dwellers in these malarial
swamps. Ignorant and murderous as they are, I am not willing to fall into
their hands. Do you ride back to our camp, taking my horse with you,
and return instantly with thirty men, stationing them in the verge of this
grove, within fifty yards of the house. Send no pickets to the edge of the
swamp. Let Clark come. Tell Lieutenant Bradly, my second in command,
to be watchful, and do you let none of Clark's gang escape. I will come to
the door occasionally, only to listen, of course, and thus know that
everything is quiet at the gin-house. When I am sure danger is imminent,
a white handkerchief will be shown by me, and you must advance.’</p>
        <p>“I was quite sure that the widow had instituted signals by which she
advised Clark's men when to approach the house, and I instructed the
Tennesseean to ascertain whether the widow placed a light in any
window that could be seen from the swamp.</p>
        <p>“I re-entered the house, and telling mother and daughter that
everything was quiet at my encampment, I stated, carelessly, that the
night was beautiful, and moon and stars shone brilliantly. I then added
that since everything betokened a night of perfect repose, I
<pb id="dupre179" n="179"/>
had discharged my orderly and sent my horse to the gin-house. The
ladies smiled approvingly, while I was only fearful that Clark's gang
might make a descent upon the house before my orders could be
executed. In fact I began to suspect that the house would be surrounded
by my enemies while I was at supper, and therefore the delay in inviting
me to the table. I was certainly very hungry, but was never less anxious
to appease hunger. I supposed that half an hour would elapse before my
men would occupy the grove in front and west of the residence, while I
believed that Clark would approach stealthily from the swamp, east of
the farm and half a mile distant. My anxiety was two-fold. I feared I might
be captured, and then that I would fail to capture Clark, whose force I
was ordered to ‘capture or destroy.’ But the widow and daughter still
exerted themselves, nervously, as I imagined, to entertain me, and still
no allusion was made to the meal I had been invited to share. I was
morally certain, as the spur at the doorway indicated, that when I was
invited to occupy an apartment in the house, a mounted messenger had
been dispatched to Clark.</p>
        <p>“Anxious and watchful as I was, I became profoundly interested in
the good dame's intelligent account of her sojourn in New Madrid.</p>
        <p>“‘This is a wonderful country, with a wonderful history. These deep
streams, enclosed within precipitous banks, all appeared in one night.
My father told me that when he went to bed one night in his cabin, that
stood fifty yards from this spot, in the winter of 1812-13, there was no
running stream between this farm and the prosperous trading village of
New Madrid. The whole country, of an area fifty miles square, had been
conveyed by the United States Government to General Morgan for his
services in the old revolutionary war. He never parted with the title,
except that he gave many farms and town lots to his friends. The rest is
simply held by that right, as I am told, which possession gives. But the
town prospered till the country, as my neighbors say, “tuk the ager,” and
sulphurous flames issued from the earth, and heaps of stone, coal, and
sand were forced to the surface, and the whole country west of us for
one hundred miles was lifted up eight or ten, and in some places, twenty
feet. Transverse streams, said to have been artificial, that used to
connect the Mississippi with the head waters of the White and St.
Francis Rivers, preventing the submergence of the intervening land by
the Mississippi's greatest floods, were upheaved and broken. Great
lakes, said to be fathomless, were formed. One I have visited on the other
side of the river is ten or fifteen miles long; and, looking down into its
transparent depths, I could see the tops of trees standing erect far below
the surface, that had once towered two and even three hundred feet
above the lowlands. The country went down and pellucid water came up.
It is only the visible portion of a great underground sea into which the
underground rivers of Mammoth and other Kentucky and Tennessee
caverns discharge themselves. I have slept in Union City, not
<pb id="dupre180" n="180"/>
far east from the Mississippi and near this Reelfoot Lake. When railway
trains come by at night, I have fancied, when the earth was shaken until
the candle fell from the mantel, and when I could hear the hollow,
cavernous roar seemingly far beneath my feet  -  I have fancied that
Union City rested above a mightier than Reelfoot Lake and deeper than
Mammoth Cave, and that I might awake some bright morning afloat in a
newly discovered Mediterranean as fathomless as Reelfoot Lake. On the
fatal night of which I was telling, when New Madrid was destroyed, the
Mississippi lost its reckoning. The current of the river was turned
backward, and Neil B. Holt, who now lives in Memphis, then
descending the river in a flat-boat, was brought backward towards Cairo,
forty miles. The mighty drain of the continent absolutely changed its
course. It must have discharged itself, when this whole region was
upheaved during that convulsive night, into these underground seas
and lakes, and thus the covering of Reelfoot Lake was lifted up by
superabundant water; and when the river resumed its course towards the
gulf and the surcharged lake was relieved, the lid fell in, and this famed
resort of fishermen, with its pellucid water wholly unlike that of the
Mississippi, for the first time mirrored dense forests and sun, moon, and
stars in its transparent bosom. But the Mississippi is always going east,
while the great rivers of Europe, that run north and south, move their
channels toward the west. Why this difference, I cannot tell; but the
Mississippi may yet enter and discharge itself into these seas underlying
portions of Tennessee and Kentucky, and I hope to live long enough to
see the result. I am sure they have to-day no connection with the
majestic, visible drain of the continent. Suppose the Mississippi find its
way into Reelfoot Lake, and disappear forever?</p>
        <p>“ ‘But I was going to tell of ludicrous and terrible incidents I
witnessed when Bishop General Polk landed here, late in the summer of
1861, with five or six thousand men. He came on all sorts of steamboats
and on flats towed by steamers. I went to the river bank to witness the
landing of this mighty army. Living always in these solitudes, I had
never dreamed that there were as many men on the face of the earth as
came from these living, floating hives. There was moored in the midst of
the fleet, and just at my feet, a little steamer, which I was told
contained all the gunpowder and ordnance-stores for this mighty army.</p>
        <p>“ ‘The army had disembarked and lined the shore. There were not more
than twenty or thirty persons on each of twenty or more steamers
moored side by side. This vessel, which was freighted with gunpowder
and fixed ammunition, was discovered to be on fire in the rear of its
wheelhouse. I never witnessed such an exhibition of terror. The army
recognized, as I did not, the hazards of the moment. I saw everybody
running. Boats half secured at the shore were left to drift down the
current. They began to collide with one another. I saw Dr. McDowell, a
very tall, slender, white-haired man, flying for life down the main
street of the town. When I asked, “For God's sake,
<pb id="dupre181" n="181"/>
Doctor, what's the matter?” he exclaimed, “New Madrid will be in hell, in
less than a minute!” and he fled far beyond the confines of the devoted
town to the encampment of Bankhead's battery. Everybody followed in
the wake of the elongated, flying doctor, and the devoted place was
wholly evacuated. Meanwhile two of the bravest men on God's footstool 
-  the one, Frank Cheatham; the other, Oliver Greenlaw  -  while I was
looking at them, went on board that burning steamer, and with buckets,
and before my eyes, drawing up water from the river, extinguished the
flames. The planks on the rear of the wheelhouse were torn off by
Greenlaw and he and Cheatham triumphed. I had learned, when they ran
on board the little steamer, what frightened the multitude, but was so
fascinated by the conduct of these daring men  -  one, Greenlaw, a
private citizen; and the other, then a Brigadier-General  -  that I was
wholly unconscious of my own, while contemplating frightful dangers
they despised.</p>
        <p>“ ‘I was standing at the bow of the boat when the two men came
ashore. I knew them both well. Both were pale and thoroughly exhausted
as if they had discharged Herculean tasks. But it was only the
superhuman effort of will that broke them down. I ran to a house hard-by
and returning, gave them an invigorating draught, and they rested pale
and weak upon the bank in perfect solitude, till fugitives began slowly,
one by one to return, each giving some ludicrous account of
manifestations of terror by some friend or acquaintance. Dr. McDowell's
fright and flight became historical because he was a famed lecturer,
inculcating theories, and in this instance, the practice, of immediate,
violent “secession.” ’ </p>
        <p>“I don't know,” continued the lieutenant, “when the good dame
would have been silenced, but the daughter, who had gone into the
dining room, returned, and with a significant glance at her mother,
announced that supper was ready. The hostess asked me to accompany
her. I said, ‘In a moment, madam.’ She watched me nervously when I
went out. In the hall I replaced my pistols in my belt, and standing
in the doorway, raised my handkerchief above my head. I was morally
certain that Clark's guerrillas were at hand and that my loquacious
hostess knew it.</p>
        <p>“We sat at table and I was in the act of sipping coffee, when, glancing
at the window, I beheld, distinctly outlined and pressed against a pane
of glass, the black face of the traitorous negro guide who had proposed
to deliver Clark's marauding guerrillas into our hands. He was surveying
the interior of the dining hall, and withdrawing instantly, I suppose was
satisfied that he had ‘bagged his game.’ Of course I made no sign; but,
saying to mine hostess that I heard the clatter of horses' hoofs and
feared that some mishap had befallen my command, and that I would
stand in the doorway and listen, I went out.</p>
        <p>“It is needless to say that I walked rapidly. I actually leaped from the
front door, and drawing and cocking an army repeater with my right
hand, threw up the white handkerchief with my left. I reached
<pb id="dupre182" n="182"/>
the yard gate, twenty steps from the house, and was flying for life, when
a bullet from that rascally negro's pistol whistled by my head. He was in
advance of the squad sent by Clark, and guided by the good widow's
son, to kill or make me a prisoner. The widow and daughter were to
fascinate and detain and the daring, devilish blackamoor to assassinate
or capture me.</p>
        <p>“But the youthful Tennesseean, Tillman, had failed in nothing. I
heard him, at the very instant the pistol was fired, exclaim, ‘Charge
them, boys!’</p>
        <p>“To escape shots coming from both directions, I fell upon my face.
When Tillman was dashing by, I rose up and said, ‘Kill or catch the
black traitor and spy who escaped from us to-day.’</p>
        <p>“My assailants had left their horses a hundred yards away. Before
they could recover them and get into their saddles, we had killed or
wounded four, and captured the rest, of the guerrillas, except the twelfth
man, the daring negro, who ran as fleetly as a grayhound. Tillman was
riding my horse and resolved to execute my orders. Two men followed
him closely. The negro made no effort to secure his own steed, but fled
towards the nearest woods. Twice he turned and fired at Tillman, who
was lying flat on his face, while my spirited animal rushed forward as if
he comprehended his rider's purposes and shared his fearlessness.
Luckily for Tillman, when he came up with the negro, his comrades were
close at hand. Both fired at the fugitive and his right arm was broken.
He came sullenly into my presence, and when I said that he deserved death
and would be hanged as a spy, he looked vengefully in my face, and
grinding his teeth together, said, ‘And I'll die weeping because I didn't
shoot you at the supper-table; but I was chicken-hearted, and didn't
want to scare two women.’</p>
        <p>“I never saw such a negro as this reckless dare-devil. His name was
Charley Dicks. He had been liberated many years because of his fidelity
to his master; and though the code of Tennessee prohibited the
immigration of free negroes, the law was never enforced, and Charley
was not only a citizen of Tennessee, but a slaveholder. He loved money,
and therefore hated the Abolitionists. His slaves were his wealth. Thus
he became a fierce secessionist. Prior to this, he had been employed by
Bishop General Polk as a spy in Cairo. There he shaved General Grant in
a Cairo barber-shop, and that night, crossing the Mississippi in a
dug-out, he sent to the Bishop General, a full report of his interview
with the kindly brigadier of that early period in the progress of
inter-state hostilities.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref3" n="3" rend="sc" target="note3">*</ref></p>
        <p>“But it is growing late, and my story, perhaps, tedious. I'll tell at
another time how Charley escaped from us, and how we punished the
bad faith of the bright, buxom widow and of her pretty daughter.”</p>
        <p>Then we bade one another good night.</p>

          <p>General Grant Talks Somewhat.  -  Sam McCown.  -  The Frightful Demon of
the “Inland Sea.” -  Bickerstaff's Memorable Ride.  -  Patlanders of Pinch.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>The latest hours of the evening were made delightful by stories recited
by Lieutenant Hughes, who said he reproduced them as originally given
by Tennesseeans captured near Fort Pillow, above Memphis on the
Mississippi, and brought to New Madrid while he was stationed there.
These prisoners insisted that the Mississippi itself was waging war
against the Confederacy. “It seems to concur in purpose with General
Grant, who said, just after the battle of Belmont, in November, 1861, when
exchanging wounded prisoners with the Confederate General McCown,
on the old steamer <hi rend="italics">Ingomar</hi>, that he had originally started out simply to
open the Mississippi from Cairo to the sea. I heard him say this while he
and McCown, at a table decorated with sundry glasses, revived
memories of by-gone days, when they served under the same flag in the
old army on western plains. They had been classmates at West Point,
and were devoted personal friends. Grant insisted that the river was an
indivisible unit, and that McCown, as a representative of the
Confederacy, had no right to dam it up at Columbus or Cairo. ‘It belongs,’
said Grant, ‘to the Northwest as wholly and thoroughly as to the Gulf
States. You have been firing into our steamers at Vicksburg, and General
Pillow, I am told, has absolutely stretched a great iron cable across the
river at Memphis that free navigation of this stream, which your prophet,
Calhoun, pronounced an inland sea, may be divided between the North
and South. It is simply absurd,‘ continued Brigadier-General Grant, “and
I am now on my way to New Orleans, and I will never stop till I get there.
I used to be a Democrat, Mack, as you know. I didn't care or think much
about parties or politics, but I was a Democrat. Let me tell you that I
have changed my mind about it. I can't go with a party whose leading
thinkers and theorists have undertaken to
<pb id="dupre184" n="184"/>
destroy the Union and dam up the Mississippi. That absurd Kansas
squatter-sovereignty abstraction does not concern me. Party leaders
used it down South to delude innocent country bumpkins and divide
and destroy Democracy in the South that Lincoln might be elected
and secession accomplished. It signifies nothing now that war is
inaugurated, and I think you are wholly wrong. I am <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">en route</foreign></hi> to
New Orleans.”</p>
        <p>“McCown was no talker, but devoted to Grant personally. I heard him say
afterward that Grant's hard horse-sense was always unanswerable and always
victorious.</p>
        <p>“But I was telling you,” continued the lieutenant, “that the
Mississippi made war on the Confederacy. Every fortification on its banks
erected by the rebels was speedily swept away. The navy-yard at
Memphis, the heights at Randolph, at Fort Pillow, and at Columbus,
and works at Island Ten have been removed by the resistless forces of
the mighty drain of the continent. Within a very brief period there
will be no vestige of an earthwork reared along the river to shut out
northern commerce from the South. The Mississippi itself will not
tolerate them. Like the Rio Grande, this great arm of the sea, is
constantly moving bodily toward the Atlantic. It carves away the hills
forever along its eastern shore. When De Soto died, three hundred
and twenty-two years ago, as the newspaper man was telling us, the
river ran along the base of lofty bluffs, just below Helena, in Arkansas.
To-day the river touches no highlands on its western side from Cairo to
the Gulf. Neither the unity of the river nor its ownership was designed
by Nature to be disrupted. Pillow's mighty chain was broken
again and again by the forces of the resistless current, and the
Mississippi can no more be fettered by manacles or confined within
prison-walls by levees than free people and states along its shores. When
Xerxes attempted to close the Hellespont with cables of iron, these,
his bridges, and ships were destroyed by the rebellious waters. The
freedom of rivers and seas should never be violated. Yazoo Pass,
making Vicksburg accessible from the east, was closed by a mighty
earthen wall. Grant cut it and the Mississippi thrust out a great arm,
bearing Grant and his gunboats and army even to the rear of Vicksburg.</p>
        <p>“The Confederates devised a costly vessel, so ingeniously and strongly
built that it was indestructible by shot and shell. It swept every
Federal gunboat from the river, and was going confidently and victoriously
to New Orleans to destroy the northern navy that had entered the
Mississippi. There was never a more terrible engine of war than this
ram, the <hi rend="italics">Arkansas</hi>. At its sharp bow or prora there was a rostrum or
beak of iron, like those of Roman and Carthaginian war-vessels,
weighing forty thousand pounds. Its strength was such that the
toughest, strongest ships were crushed by its blows. A long steel rod was
projected over and beyond this. To its end was attached a shell to be
fired by an electrical battery from within when in contact with an
enemy's boat. The <hi rend="italics">Arkansas</hi> was roofed with railroad iron. Over
<pb id="dupre185" n="185"/>
this was a layer of solidly-compressed cotton-bales, and over these
another of heavy railroad iron, which could only be stricken by a ball
impinging against it at an angle of forty-five degrees. The <hi rend="italics">Arkansas</hi>
was simply the masterpiece of gunboat builders. Commanded by the
most skillful of seamen and bravest of officers, it reached Baton Rouge,
after many frightful and destructive conflicts with ships and gunboats,
unharmed. Victorious again and again, its officers confident of the
extirpation of the fleet at New Orleans, it became the prey of
the mighty river. Mud was injected, with the water on which it floated,
into the machinery of its life. It became unmanageable and helpless, and
was at last blown up by orders of its own commander, and when Vicksburg
fell, Grant's way to the sea was unobstructed. But the strongest
and stanchest vessel that ever floated on the Mississippi, or elsewhere
in the world, my rebel friends insisted,” continued the lieutenant, “was
this dreadful ram, the <hi rend="italics">Arkansas</hi>, built by John T. Shirley, at Memphis.</p>
        <p>“I was told of a most ludicrous mishap which befell a learned and
able lawyer of Memphis. This distinguished jurist bore the honored
name, Bickerstaff. He was wonderfully tall and slender, and must
have encountered Washington Irving at some period in his earlier years,
or the matchless story-teller never could have drawn with such
precision and clearness, outlines of that ever-memorable picture of
Ichabod Crane, which, never painted save in words, stands out before
our eyes as sharply and distinctly defined as the strong, solemn face of
Washington, or honest, earnest, ubiquitous physiognomy of U. S. Grant.</p>
        <p>Bickerstaff, a most logical reasoner and perfect master of his
profession, was singularly careful in his dress, as in the preparation of
his speeches. He was an Indianian by birth, and by early training as a
pedagogue. Of course he was an inflexible, but silent, Unionist. He
was conscious of his physical peculiarities, and, though an attorney,
and rich withal, was never known to speak to a woman. Still, he
dressed himself with painstaking care, always obeying the injunction,
‘Let thy dress be costly as thy purse can buy.’ His nose was of
extraordinary height and length and thinness, and like a dromedary of
two humps. His face was thin, sallow, and long; his eyes bright,
keen, and penetrating. His neck was of extraordinary longitude, and
therefore he always wore a standing shirt-collar. Bickerstaff, six feet
three and a half inches high, rarely rode on horseback. His
long, slender legs did not present a seemly aspect, while his big feet
dangled out into the stirrups from loose, baggy breeches legs. Therefore
he went from Memphis, nine miles, to Raleigh, to attend county court in
a vehicle drawn by a beautiful and valuable horse. Returning about
noon, on the coldest day, perhaps, ever known this century in this
latitude, the first of January last, he encountered a dozen rebel
guerrillas. He was recognized, of course. No citizen of the country
was more widely known or esteemed as a man and as a lawyer; but
guerrillas are no respecters of persons. One of them walked deliberately
around the buggy with an axe, breaking the spokes in the wheels until
<pb id="dupre186" n="186"/>
the body of the vehicle rested on the ground. The horse, of course,
was appropriated by the highwaymen, and Bickerstaff's clothes were
thoroughly searched. The horse was assigned by the captain of the
thieves to one of his men, who bestrode a hideously ugly, long-haired,
emaciated mule. The captain remarked, ‘That mule, Mr. Bickerstaff,
drew a dray twenty years in Memphis. We stole him at night,
when we couldn't see. He will go back rapidly.’ Bickerstaff was
about to set off on the mule, congratulating himself that <sic corr="he">be</sic> had escaped
so fortunately, when the little, short, round thief who now held
Bickerstaff's horse, said that he ‘must have the great lawyer's clothes.
You won't have time to freeze in mine. That old mule has been trying
to go towards Memphis all day. You'll travel when you start; but
I must swap clothes with you. My coat and breeches are nearly worn
out. Git down and shuck yourself; I can roll up your sleeves and
trowsers and have a perfect fit.’</p>
        <p>“The captain of the squad interposed. ‘Dismount,’ he said; ‘you have
only five miles to ride, and will go a-Gilpin, I think. Swap with
that young man; I want to see how you two will look when you've
exchanged drygoods.’</p>
        <p>“The freebooters were half drunk. Bickerstaff hesitated; but the
captain was relentless, and there on the dreary roadside, shivering in
the cold wind, the dignified and learned lawyer thrust his long legs
through the short, rusty breeches, and his interminable arms through the
contracted sleeves of the round little rebel's ragged roundabout.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Here's your mule, mount him and go,’ said the captain of the squad
to Bickerstaff. ‘Go! I tell you. We wish to see you start. Oh! you are a
beauty! The fit of your clothes and your shape are charming. You will be
sending out a cavalry force to recover your property as soon as you get
into Memphis, and we must march; but I would first see how fascinating
you are. If I'm caught, don't forget that you are my lawyer. They'll hang
me if they can. Remember, Judge, that I've given you that mule and them
pretty clothes as a retainer.’</p>
        <p>“Bickerstaff, with most sorrowful visage, rode away. The robbers
could not restrain themselves. Cold as they were, and miserable as was
poor, shivering Bickerstaff, they laughed till his nose, blown like a
weathercock to the right or left by the pitiless winds, and the jogging
mule, whose bones rattled as he trotted away, were no longer visible.
Bickerstaff felt badly. One yard of each leg was covered by socks and
drawers only. There was a vacant space, overspread by white linen alone,
of almost a yard, between the lower hem of the rusty, ragged roundabout
and the upper rim or waistband of the greasy, copperas homespun
breeches. That he might not freeze, Bickerstaff kicked vigorously and
threw his arms violently about his head, and jogged along rapidly. He
drew his fur cap tightly down to conceal his nose and face, and went,
bent forward, kicking, and cursing his luck, into the city. The few
wayfarers on the street stared at him in unutterable wonder. He only
pulled down his cap and kicked the mule's ribs and bent forward till his
shirt, no longer reaching his pants,
<pb id="dupre187" n="187"/>
fluttered in the icy breath of January 1, 1864. He entered Pinch, the
densely populated Irish district. Ireland loves fun. Even the women
turned out. Bar-rooms were emptied, and hot whiskey was forgotten.
A great mob, from a quarter of the city which produces annually three
thousand Democratic votes, and in which there was little sympathy with
the woes of the Whig and Unionist, Bickerstaff, was soon gathered
about the woe-begone mule and its luckless rider.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Isn't he a beauty, Bridget?’</p>
        <p>“ ‘Oh! the swate crayther; its the mon I mane, and not the dirthy
baste.’</p>
        <p>“ ‘An' the tailor that made thim coat and britches, wasn't he sparin' of
the cloth? Me old mon is hard-up and it will give him a job.’ And yells
and shouts of laughter rent the air. The mob grew apace, and while the
chagrined, maddened Bickerstaff kicked and cuffed the ancient, bony
mule, the hooting, roaring throng accompanied him in grand triumphal
procession to his office in the centre of the city. He escaped at last,
his friends, in a body, moving to his relief, and bearing him in
a swoon of horror and cold from the mule into his private apartments.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Poor Bickerstaff,’ said the prisoner who told me this story, ‘never
recovered from the effects of exposure, chagrin, and shame resulting from
this pitiful adventure. He did not long survive it. A numberless, tearful
procession of friends and admirers followed his elongated coffin to the
grave. The endless throng, as it moved slowly and solemnly to the famed
and beautiful cemetery of Elmwood, about which the newspaper man
once wrote a book, talked of the kindly Bickerstaff in soft, low, pitying
undertones. Genial smiles at first shed sunshine over the multitude; but
as coincident facts were recalled and recited, the mirthfulness of the
procession grew in force<sic corr=".">,</sic> It was the more violent because of the
necessity for its repression. The very sadness and solemnity of the
occasion gave force to ridiculous stories then reproduced, and the
absurdest and jolliest procession that ever entered a graveyard, these
Tennesseeans said, went roaring with laughter, when poor Bickerstaff
was entombed, into Elmwood.’ ”</p>

        <argument>
          <p>An Extraordinary Escape.  -  We Take Water.  -  A Voice in the Wilderness.  -  Was it a Spirit?  -  A True Man and Heroic Wife.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>“You know,” the captain said to Mrs. Hughes, while we were seated
the next evening about her broad fire-place, “the farmer, Willingham,
who lives perhaps five miles north of your upper plantation? I had
information that induced Mr. Spratling and myself to call to see him at
his modest home. He has a good face, and, after a brief interview, I said
to Spratling that I was almost unwilling to arrest such a man charged
with so heinous an offence. That he had deserted his colors, we knew to
be a fact, but when I saw his bright, busy little wife spinning cotton
threads inside the cabin door, while three pretty children rolled about in
the yard, I could not help thinking that such a man, with such ties, and
such duties imposed by God's laws, should not be put to death for
desertion of a cause, which, even if defensible in law and morals, is
rapidly and palpably becoming almost hopeless.</p>
        <p>“But my duty was plain and its exactions inexorable. I ordered
Willingham to leave his plow in the unfinished furrow and presenting
handcuffs said that he must accompany us to the quarters of the
Provost Marshal General. The poor fellow shrank back aghast. His face
was of ashen hue. His limbs shook. He sank, at last, helplessly upon the
ground. But his cowardice was redeemed by generous, unselfish
devotion to his pretty, little, unsuspecting wife who had told us where to
find him. His first low, half-sobbed exclamation was:</p>
        <p>“ ‘And what will become of my helpless wife and children? And then
that I should bring down upon them this inexpressible sorrow and
disgrace!’</p>
        <p>“I confess I was almost unmanned by the anguish of the hapless
wretch, and it occurred to me to devise a pretext for his possible
<pb id="dupre189" n="189"/>
escape. I had forty dollars in gold, given me by General B. J. Hill, the
Provost Marshal General, that I might obtain articles, greatly needed,
from Federal stores in Cleveland. I said to Willingham that he had taken
the ‘iron-clad oath,’ and that his loyalty to the ‘old flag’ was not
questioned, and that if he would go to Cleveland that night and the next
day, and meet me at the great oak that had fallen across the main road at
the mill on Coahuila Creek, bringing with him the articles wanted by
General Hill, that he, Willingham, should be liberated and unharmed by
the Confederate authorities.</p>
        <p>“Willingham assented, received the forty dollars, and Spratling and I,
as you remember, returned to this place. I never doubted Willingham's
integrity of purpose. But <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">l'homme propose, et Dieu dispose</foreign></hi>. Two
cunning bushwhackers had traced Spratling and myself to Willingham's
house and witnessed, at a safe distance, our interview with him. We were
hardly out of sight, as we learned only yesterday evening from the wife,
when these two men, by threatening to declare at the nearest Federal
outpost that Willingham had been seen in close consultation with two
most murderous and daring Confederate scouts, compelled the
frightened Willingham to divulge all that had been said and agreed upon.
The bushwhackers at once forced Willingham to accompany them. He
was only given time to enter his house, change his apparel and make his
little wife cognizant of his agreement with us. He instructed her, in case
he did not return in time, to meet us at the fallen oak, and warn us of
possible danger and tell of his own capture and helplessness. Of course
we knew nothing of all this till yesterday evening.</p>
        <p>“When the day came for the meeting with Willingham, as you
remember, Spratling and I left here about three o'clock. There was ample
time in which to reach, at sunset, the place of rendezvous. We trudged
along leisurely enough, and were passing through a dense wood two
miles or more from the great fallen tree beside the field at which we were
to meet Willingham.</p>
        <p>“I am not superstitious. I never encountered a ghost, though I once
thought differently, when, as I was telling some time ago, the unhappy
woman rose up out of the newly-made grave at the little church not far
from Mrs. Shields'. But as Spratling and I moved along quietly towards
the rendezvous, two miles distant, I heard, with perfect distinctness, a
clear, soft voice, telling me, ‘Don't go, oh! don't go!’ I stopped and asked
Spratling, ‘Didn't you hear that woman's voice? It reminds me of the low,
sweet, childish tones in which Willingham's little wife told us where to
find her husband.’ But Spratling heard nothing. My senses were
wonderfully acute. Some inscrutable inspiration was telling me, at every
step, that we should not go further. A somber melancholy was shed
over the dense woods by the sun's pale rays, hardly penetrating mists of
the wintry afternoon, and diffused like gold dust over the yellow leaves
of the lowly-moaning trees.</p>
        <p>“Again I heard the soft, low wailing of a woman's voice, clear and
<pb id="dupre190" n="190"/>
distinct, but seemingly a long, long way off. It only repeated the words,
‘Don't go, oh! don't go!’</p>
        <p>“I could not shake off the effect of the unaccountable supplication. I
repeated it again and again to Spratling, insisting that I heard in
the remote distance the wail of sorrow of poor Willingham's wife. She
was surely begging us not to meet her husband at the fallen oak. ‘Of
course,’ I said musingly, ‘it is impossible; but the words do come with
perfect distinctness, and I was not dreaming, when I first heard them, of
the woman or of any probable danger.’</p>
        <p>“When the mysterious warning was again repeated, I said to
Spratling, ‘I wish to go back; let us respect this strange invocation. I'll
tell you that the spirit of the good little woman who asked us to eat at
her table, and brought us so cheerily that great gourd full of refreshing
spring-water, and directed us so smilingly to her husband in the field  - 
I'll tell you that she or her wraith is somewhere in these woods to save
us from some great peril.’</p>
        <p>“Spratling answered me that if I had not talked about ghosts and
strange voices in the air, he might have been persuaded to turn back;
but to be cowards, and cowards for such a reason, because we thought
we heard a woman crying, who was certainly five or six miles away, was
a proposition too ridiculous to be entertained. ‘We would be laughed
out of the army about it.’</p>
        <p>“I could only assent; and yet faintly, more faintly, dying away at last
among the gentle sounds made by the pale leaves, that rattled softly
when the trees were swayed by the cold breath of the silent afternoon,
did I hear the woman's clear, low, distinct words, ‘Don't go, oh! don't go!’</p>
        <p>“We were now within a few hundred yards, as we thought, of the
rendezvous, and, of course, moving very slowly and watchfully. The sun's
slanting rays only touched the treetops, and the shadows of a misty
February evening were gathering slowly about us. We were not sure of
our precise distance from the fallen oak, where Willingham was to meet
us, or deposit the articles bought for us in Cleveland. My senses were
wrought up to the highest tension, and again did I tell Spratling, in a low
whisper, ‘Listen; don't you hear the tender, earnest wailing of that little
woman? It is far away. but seems borne along the ground and clasps my
feet.’ I stood still, and a cold tremor ran over me. My senses were never
so acute. ‘Stop,’ I said; ‘see there!’ And yet Spratling saw nothing and
heard nothing. But I did; I saw the pale light of that cold, silent afternoon
flash from a gilded button in the dense thicket, a hundred yards away on
our right. At the same instant, as I believed, I beheld the sudden
movement of a woman's ghostly apparel in the same dense woods. I
grasped Spratling's arm, and both stood still, while I whispered of what I
heard and saw.</p>
        <p>“We crossed an open space, and were, perhaps, a quarter of a mile
from a fence on our left, enclosing a long, narrow field beyond it, two
hundred yards wide. Far away on our right was the dense thicket.
<pb id="dupre191" n="191"/>
“ ‘Look,’ I whispered to Spratling, ‘don't you see men lying on their
faces along the verge of the thicket?’</p>
        <p>“He answered, ‘I see nothing; you have surely gone mad.’</p>
        <p>“Just then a dismounted cavalryman rose up. In sonorous accents he
ordered us to ‘Halt, there!’ Twenty figures sprang from the weeds and
grass and low bushes along the road, and mounted men were visible
ahead of us. Time for reflection was brief, and questions of policy few. If
we surrendered, we would be shot or hanged on the spot. If we fled, by
bare possibility, we might escape. Of course, flight was instantaneous.
We did not run directly from our pursuers, but diagonally across the
open space towards the field. Men using rifles or pistols know how
certainly they kill a bird flying directly from them, and how certainly they
fail when the bird flies diagonally across the line of the shot. Spratling
and I ran so that our backs were not exposed to the shots of pursuers. A
bullet passed through my cap, and left its hot breath on the crown of my
head. Spratling's baggy breeches were pierced, a bullet leaving its mark
on his knee-cap. We heard bullets sing merrily while we ran furiously
towards the fence. We climbed or leaped it. It was no obstruction in this
maddening race. We had crossed half the width of the field when a bullet,
piercing the dense folds of my blanket, which was rolled and wrapped
over one shoulder and under the other, cut the string confining its ends.
It fell and I left it. We were still unharmed and nearing the woods, when,
through the growing shadows of the evening, we saw that mounted men
had passed round the little field to intercept us. Our struggles were now
superhuman. We had outstripped those on foot and knew, at a glance,
that if the horsemen met no obstruction, we could hardly precede them in
entering the woods. Spratling and I kept far enough apart to prevent the
death of both by one bullet. There is as much skill, courage, and coolness
illustrated in flight as in attack.</p>
        <p>“A little creek ran across the field into a larger stream, the Coahuila.
The cavalrymen, seeking to intercept us, were retarded by this
obstruction. They fired at us, but, their horses at full speed, of course,
harmlessly. We crossed the fence and entered the dense woods, in the
verge of which ran the larger stream.</p>
        <p>“ ‘What was our horror, reaching the creek, to find the further shore a
precipitous height, which we could not ascend. The cavalrymen were
hard by. Entangled among vines and dense undergrowth, they swore
vigorously. We heard the shouts of our other pursuers at the fence we
had last surmounted.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Caught at last,’ I said in a low tone to Spratling, as we stood in the
dim twilight and dense shade of the forest on the banks of the mountain
torrent. A tree had fallen into the creek, lying low along the water's
surface, and partly submerged.</p>
        <p>“ ‘There is no help for it,’ I whispered, ‘we must enter the water and
get beneath that tree.’ After such a race, the water seemed of icy
coldness. The tree's body was slightly curved, and upheld along
<pb id="dupre192" n="192"/>
its length by its great branches. There was a space, at one point, of four
or five inches between it and the water's surface. We immersed
ourselves, and stood half erect in the stream beneath the fallen tree. The
cavalrymen rode up and down the creek, seeking in vain for a crossing-
place. They uttered horrible imprecations. They had recognized my <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">fidus
Achates</foreign></hi>, Spratling, and supposed at last that he had climbed the
precipice, carrying me upon his back.</p>
        <p>“When men on foot reached the spot, two crossed the creek on the
log beneath which we shivered in unutterable iciness. Men never
suffered more in moments that seemed an age of anguish. But when
these weary soldiers went back and forth above our heads, we were
resting securely veiled beneath the first deep shadows of nightfall. The
last soldier who stood above, and within two feet of my head muttered
maledictions, leveled at Spratling and myself.</p>
        <p>“Motionless awhile, and looking up and down the precipice, evidently
wondering how we climbed it, he pronounced a few homely oaths,
significant of disappointment, and went slowly away. How slowly, none
can imagine save Spratling and I, almost dying in this intolerably cold
bath.</p>
        <p>“Never doubting that we had crossed the creek, and were far beyond
it, the Yankee captain of the squad soon gathered his men in the field.
They were weary and hungry, and when we, half dead and shivering,
reached the enclosure, we heard the order, ‘Fall in, men;’ and then,
finding that none were missing, came the words, to us most grateful,
‘Forward, march!’ We entered the field and found my dry blanket on the
yellow grass. We cut it in two and substituted it about our freezing
bodies for wet clothing. Then we set out for this place.</p>
        <p>“But the memory of those strange words, ‘Don't go, oh! don't go!’
made me hesitate. I reminded Spratling of what I had surely heard. ‘No
impression made by events of to-day will last as long,’ I said, ‘as that
wrought by the mysterious, womanly voice to which I listened late this
afternoon. I cannot leave this place till satisfied that Willingham's little
wife is not here.’</p>
        <p>“ ‘How absurd,’ insisted Spratling, ‘that you should have heard her,
when we have never been within half a mile of the fallen oak, where we
were to have seen her husband. She surely did not accompany him; on
the contrary, he betrayed us, and neither he nor his wife are here.’</p>
        <p>“ ‘I can't help it,’ I answered; ‘you may leave me, if you like, but,
suffering as I am, I must go to the fallen oak.’</p>
        <p>“We turned towards it. It lay at the end of the field near the creek,
and more than half a mile from the point at which the pursuit and flight
had been begun.</p>
        <p>“At the root of the tree, sure enough, on the cold ground, lay the
brave little woman. She was moaning in her seemingly broken sleep. We
could catch no words. The side of her face was swollen and black. We
read at a glance, even by the light of the stars, what had
<pb id="dupre193" n="193"/>
befallen her. I was never so enraged, but was silenced by Spratling's
imprecations. Cold as we had been, we had not exhausted a capacious
flask of brandy which always accompanied us. I raised the almost lifeless
body very tenderly while Spratling, from the little cup that covered the
stopple, administered the brandy. A tremor ran over her frame; and at
last she opened her eyes, and looking up into our faces, closed them,
evidently to shut out visions of a supposed dream. She drank again, and
then asked who we were and ‘Where am I?’ and ‘How did I get here?’
We slowly reassured her. At length she stood up, and then she began
to recall and recount the events of the terrible day.</p>
        <p>“As we bore her in a hammock made of Spratling's blanket, I holding
one and he the other end, to her home, she recited the story of her
adventures. Her husband was imprisoned at Cleveland, and she came to
the fallen oak to warn us of danger. She had brought the forty dollars in
gold to return it to us, and even then had it concealed on her person. She
went near the fallen oak, and finding soldiers already there, wandered
about the woods, in growing anxiety and alarm, as night was coming on,
till she was insane with terror. She said, ‘I remember begging you not to
go to the fallen oak, and that while I was saying, “Don't go! oh, don't go!”
I was silenced by a great, rude soldier who came suddenly out of the
bushes and knocked me down. He thought he had killed me; for I saw
him no more, and only remember saying in the dreams that afterward
came, “Don't go! oh, don't go!” I thought I was talking to you two
soldiers who had been good to my poor husband.’ ”</p>
        <p>The fire was burning low when Spratling said:</p>
        <p>“We bore the little woman safely to her cabin and made her retain the
gold fairly lost by the Provost Marshal-General, as he will confess when
we tell him of our adventures of yesterday.”</p>
        <p>“Meanwhile,” interposed the captain, “I would gladly have Mrs.
Hughes and Mrs. Starnes, or the philosophic Mr. Wade and the
newspaper man, tell me how I heard, through the woods and in the air
and creeping along the earth, the strangely muttered words and prayers
of the earnest, brave little woman when she warned me, ‘Don't go! oh,
don't go!’ She was probably two miles from us when I first caught the
sounds, and most distinctly, ‘Don't go! oh, don't go!’ We found her cold
and senseless more than half a mile from the path we trod. Does that odic
and phrenic force through which one brain is said to communicate with
another, like two distant telegraphic stations, also reach the external
senses? I know I heard the very words and listened to the low, sweet
voice of the brave little women when she was two miles distant, and I
know that Spratling thinks that God is in it.”</p>
        <p>The fire had burned very low and ashes covered the living coals and
dead fagots had fallen over the andirons when we bade one another good
night.</p>

        <p>The sun was rising when the faithful, watchful negro, Jack, made watchful
because he discovered that either Spratling, the Captain, or the Mississippi
cavalryman was pacing back and forth in the front yard through the night, was
heard at the door.</p>
        <p>“Mistiss! mistiss! De Yanks is cummin! Deas a eben duzzen. Dis nigga
counted 'em dis time.”</p>
        <p>There was wildest confusion in the residence and among the negroes. The
Captain, Spratling, and the Mississippian, trained soldiers, and accustomed to
war's alarms and surprises, were cooly intent on preparations for defence.</p>
        <p>“See,” said the Captain to Spratling, “that the schoolmaster and Lieutenant
Hughes remain in their room. They cannot share in this fight. We need only
knock three or four of those gay fellows out of their saddles and the rest will run
away. They are not crazy to fight and only want plate, gold, jewels, and
pictures. Four of us can make it impossible for them to come near enough to
apply a torch and burn us out; that is the only danger.”</p>
        <pb id="dupre195" n="195"/>
        <p>A gaily dressed subordinate officer was in command of the assailants.
Spratling, watching from a window the approach of the enemy, said:</p>
        <p>“I don't like the signs out there; I never saw a vain fellow, tricked out in gold
lace and feathers as gaudily as that young ape, who would not fight
desperately. Vanity stimulates and makes his courage drunken. That fellow will
give us trouble.”</p>
        <p>Doors were barred and bolted, and windows closed in apartments below,
occupied by Mrs. Hughes and other inmates of the household, and
everything was ready for action.</p>
        <p>“Didn't you hear the Captain order my brother and Mr. Wade to remain in
their room? It is just over ours,” said Mamie. “Let us join them; I would die
here of mortal anxiety, seeing nothing, and hearing firearms and quick, sharp
words of command, and not knowing who has fallen.”</p>
        <p>“Of course,” answered Bessie; “we will disobey orders. I am skillful as
yourself in the use of a pistol. Mr. Spratling gave me a beautiful weapon and
taught me how to use it. The good schoolmaster told us how you learned to
handle guns and pistols in East Tennessee.”</p>
        <p>Spratling was looking from the window in the front room when the two
girls, unseen, entered the apartment at the head of the stairway, occupied by
Mr. Wade and Lieutenant Hughes. The mothers of the girls followed, more
frightened than Mamie, and infinitely more than fearless Bessie Starnes, whose
constant contact with soldiers, through months, and even years; whose modes of
life, such as are led by the people in the wild country about Chattanooga, and
whose habits of thinking, induced by stories told by Spratling, and countless
men who frequented the country in which she lived, had inculcated lessons not
without value at a time like this. Bessie knew little of books, but everything of
country life, and everything of which soldiers talked.</p>
        <p>She told the lieutenant to assume his uniform. “You can't fight, and if we are
whipped, you can save us. But there is no use in our being whipped. Mother and
I have kept drunken soldiers out of our house when they threatened to plunder
and destroy it. To be shot from behind a brick wall like this, and by a woman, at
that, isn't comfortable. These wandering Yankee soldiers may be the bravest of
the brave; but there is no need to show heroism here, where nobody sees it, and
where nobody will know of it if they run. They only want Mrs. Hughes' silver
and jewels. These Mr. Spratling has concealed, and he will fight for their safety
with ten-fold the pluck of men who only wish to rob him. Our danger,” added
Bessie, who sought to reassure Mrs. Hughes, “would be much greater if these
soldiers coming up the avenue knew that two pretty girls were looking at them.
They wont fight after they have learned that it is Spratling and the captain they
have hemmed in. All these scouts have heard of Spratling; but they don't know
him as well as I do. They never saw but
<pb id="dupre196" n="196"/>
one side of him. There isn't a Yankee scout in the Yankee service who
hasn't heard how Spratling killed the bushwhacker by stamping him
into the earth at our house, and not one who hasn't heard how he held a
powerful horse, struggling to go forward, still as death in the road with
one hand, grasping the hindmost axle of the wagon, while he, protected
by the wagon-body, fired and killed two out of three assailants. They all
know how terrible he is; but they don't know how good, and gentle, and
truthful, or what a big heart he has.”</p>
        <p>Bessie had forgotten herself, or had only become her real self, and
talked freely, when excitement and dangers of the moment rendered
others silent and incapable. She glanced at the lieutenant, and
expressions of admiration for Spratling's conduct and character were
instantly silenced. The listening lieutenant's face was flushed, and when
his eyes met Bessie's they were suddenly averted. She was not sure that
he suspected her fidelity to himself or her devotion to Spratling, then
almost confessed. She imagined at the moment that he did doubt her
honesty, and that questioning glance, never forgotten, was reproduced
before Bessie's eyes whenever the face and form of her affianced lover,
in after years, rose up from the dreamland of memory.</p>
        <p>The Yankee marauders approached the residence very warily. A negro
had informed them that Spratling was shot through the shoulder and that
the four Confederates held two prisoners in the building. Spratling's
supposed helplessness, and the fact that there were, as they understood
the facts, only three fighting men within, and that one of these was
required to watch the two prisoners of war, induced the marauders to
make the assault. The Captain and newspaper man occupied a window
each in the room on the right, and Spratling and the cavalryman on the left, of
the building. The assailants advanced slowly, five of them going, when
within one hundred yards of the house, on the right of it, and five to the
left. They seemed to think that the inmates would seek safety in flight.</p>
        <p>“Oh, the rascals!” said Spratling. “What fools and cowards they
think us? Why suspect us of the purpose to run? What's to be made by
it? It is time enough to run when we can no longer fight, and when we
run we must fight at last, and then, unguarded by these strong walls;
and then, after fighting, I think there will be fewer to pursue us, and of
these a few will be lame. Of course we will fight.”</p>
        <p>The Captain need not have said it, but he ordered us to take good
aim. “Make ready,” he said at length, as if we were duelists; and then
came the word, “Fire!”</p>
        <p>The enemy were within sixty yards. Three saddles were emptied, and
the leader's horse fell, the rider seemingly unharmed. He was a gallant
little fellow. His gorgeous gold lace glittered when he rose up and called
to his men, “Follow me!” He ran to the porch, one story in height, and
was secure beneath its roof. His men followed at full speed. How they
escaped, we could not tell; but only one
<pb id="dupre197" n="197"/>
was unhorsed by our bullets, though others were wounded. Horses
were turned loose. The door was broken from its fastenings, and the
hallway below occupied by men who evidently knew how and intended
to fight.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Hughes and the schoolmaster, confined in an apartment
with women, were most restive. Accustomed to danger, and wholly
fearless, they were most impatient of this restraint. Their sympathies, of
course, were with the defenders of the residence. As Davy Crockett,
shut up in the Alamo, when accustomed to fight beneath the open sky
and in the open woods, begged to be led into the open plain to
encounter the overwhelming force of Mexicans, so the schoolmaster and
youthful Union soldier were impelled to violate orders. When the great
door gave way in the hall below, and the marauding assailants rushed in,
the lieutenant could not restrain himself. He and Mr. Wade, armed with
pistols, rushed to the head of the stairs. The lieutenant leaned over the
railing, and looking down, was instantly shot. The bullet pierced his
body. He was borne bleeding into the apartment he had just left.</p>
        <p>“Perhaps he is dying,” whispered the schoolmaster to Bessie. “I
must avenge this. See the anguish and dismay written in the eyes and
pale faces of the mother and sister? I am a rebel now.”</p>
        <p>He placed the dying youth upon the bed, the mother and sister and
Bessie looking on, horror-struck and helpless.</p>
        <p>All of us, with Mr. Wade, leaving the lieutenant to the care of the
women, were now at the head of the stairs. Spratling came last. He held
uplifted, forgetful of his wound, a long, heavy marble slab, taken from a
bureau.</p>
        <p>“Stand back!” he exclaimed; “this will protect me and destroy them.
Stand back! I will crush them. Let them start up the stair-way!”</p>
        <p>The gallant little Yankee popinjay was heard to say, “We have killed
one of them; I hear women's wailing. There are only two fighting men
left. There are six of us almost unharmed. We must kill or capture that
wounded giant, Spratling, and his cunning captain.</p>
        <p>“Follow, boys!” he exclaimed.</p>
        <p>They started up the broad stairway. Spratling stood still. They were
on the staircase, when he suddenly leaned forward, pitching the
ponderous stone edgewise and endwise, with tremendous force, down
the stairs. Bullets came up from pistols below, only to strike the lower
surface of the descending stone. The leader and three others of the
assailants fell beneath the shock and weight of the marble slab. The rest
withdrew to the front door. While they looked after their captain, with
his broken skull, and others killed and wounded, we learned from Bessie,
whose courage never faltered, that the lieutenant, she thought, must die.</p>
        <p>“He is bleeding internally,” said Bessie. “He told me so, and bade
his mother and sister stand aside, that he might tell me this and
<pb id="dupre198" n="198"/>
other facts he did not wish to hear. I will tell you some day,” said Bessie
to the schoolmaster, “but not now;” and she turned towards Spratling,
whose arm was bleeding afresh. She ran to his side, and looking up
sadly but lovingly into his face, made him sit down, while she bound a
handkerchief tightly about his shoulder.</p>
        <p>The Captain's fitness for his position consisted not more in his
courage, endurance and cunning, than in rapidity of thought and action.
He went to the window and called for the man in charge of the Union
scouts.</p>
        <p>“See here,” said he, “this place and this house which you propose to
set on fire, in order to expel us, is the home and property of a Union
officer. He is here our prisoner. Accidentally you have shot him. He will die if
you do not have a surgeon sent to his relief. It may go hard with you.
Ask the negroes there in that cabin; they will tell that all I say of
Lieutenant Hughes, of Colonel Cliff's regiment, is true. There are four of
us rebels. We will never be taken alive, as you have reason to know; but
these people have been kind to us, and served one of our number who
was wounded some time ago. We have no business here and no desire
to remain. Your Captain, who is not dead, as well as Lieutenant Hughes,
needs a surgeon. If you will agree that this family shall be protected as it
must be when you know that Lieutenant Hughes is its head, we four
rebels will leave. Go out of the house. We will not fire upon you, but
propose to leave in twenty minutes. If you consent to these terms, start
one of your men at once for a surgeon. Send the negro, Jack, for the
country doctor whose office is three miles distant.”</p>
        <p>“All right,” a voice from below soon responded, and the Federal
scouts went out. We counted them from the window. Four seemed
unharmed. Two others were bleeding, and another had a broken arm.
The rest of the twelve were dead or helpless.</p>
        <p>“It's a pretty good day's work,” said Spratling. “I would be well
pleased if it wasn't for the poor lieutenant lying there, his young life
going away so slowly but so surely that while he suffers not at all
he feels the blood, he says, gradually filling his body. The mother and
sister are dazed by the shock. The only one of us who, as we thought,
could incur no danger and was perfectly safe, has fallen, and  -  poor
Bessie! poor Bessie!” And then Spratling drew his hand across his
eyes, and after a moody silence, added very slowly, “What is to become
of Bessie?”</p>
        <p>His eyes were fixed on vacuity.</p>
        <p>The Captain went to the Lieutenant's bedside. Neither uttered a word.</p>
        <p>“I never saw the Captain,” said Spratling, telling the story in after
years, “so cast down. Mamie was at the foot of the bed gazing into the
pale face of her dying brother. The mother and Mrs. Starnes knelt side
by side. Unconsciously I had taken Bessie's hand and was drawn to the
Captain by a force of sympathy I could not resist.
<pb id="dupre199" n="199"/>
“While tears, the first I ever saw the Captain shed, streamed down
his face  -  it was Mamie's presence and grief that unmanned him  -  he
took the cold hand of the lieutenant and kissed it. He turned and was
going away, when Mamie ran to him saying, ‘You must not go. We
cannot spare you.’</p>
        <p>“ ‘Yes,’ he answered; ‘if I and my men do not leave, re-enforcements
will come to these intruders below, and the house will be burned and
there will be no help for your brother. The surgeon will come. I have
sent for him. I will return. In the presence of your dying brother,’ he
whispered, ‘I pledge you deathless fidelity.’</p>
        <p>“He drew her outside the doorway, and while tears streamed down
their faces, kissed her.”</p>
        <p>We bade <foreign lang="fr">adieu</foreign> to the good and brave schoolmaster, instructing him
to communicate with us through General Cleburne. Spratling said good
bye to Bessie, telling her that he was her guardian; that he would meet
her in Lexington; and that the schoolmaster would bring him her letters,
telling her how to address him. She followed Spratling to the door
leading into the yard and kissed him as confidingly and affectionately as
if he had been her father. He was thrilled by it. Her face was flushed
when she detected it and turned away, with tearful eyes, to re-enter the
chamber of death.</p>
        <p>Of the fortunes of the Captain and of Mamie Hughes, who is rearing a
family in Arkansas, her home in Georgia having been destroyed and
property swept away, the writer of these pages may tell hereafter.</p>
        <p>Spratling's love of adventure grew inversely with his devotion to
pretty, blithesome, winning Bessie Starnes. He prized Bessie's life so
extravagantly that he began to set a higher value upon his own. He was
surrendered with the wreck of General Joe Johnston's army in North
Carolina; and when last heard from, was reciting, beside the hearthstone
of his modest ranch in Callahan County, Texas, the very stories here
recorded. Bessie, the heroine, save when a baby cries, is the intentest
listener.</p>
