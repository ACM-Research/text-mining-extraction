        <head>INTRODUCTORY NOTE</head>
        <p>The following is the diary of a North
Carolina farmer, Bartlett Yancey
Malone, who fought during the American War of Secession from July,
1861, to November, 1863, when he was captured
and made prisoner. He
entered the Confederate Army at the age of twenty-three as a private
and rose to the rank of a sergeant, being a
member during his active
service of the 6th North Carolina Regiment. As he said, this regiment at
the time of his capture in battle on the
Rappahannock River belonged to
“General Hooks (Hoke) brigard Early Division
Ewels Corps Leas Armey.” As his story shows, Malone
participated in most of the great battles
and campaigns in Virginia, Maryland and Pennsylvania. After his
capture, November 7, 1863, he was imprisoned at Point Lookout,
Maryland, where he remained until February 24th, 1865.</p>
        <p>An inquiry as to the justification for the publication of this
document would be pertinent, for on a cursory reading it seems little
more than an extended weather report. Mr. Malone performed no
extraordinary feat of heroism, at least none such was recorded; he
participated with individual distinction in no political movement of
importance; he played no role which would cause historians to single
him out for particular notice. His diary is reproduced here as a document
of human interest which reveals, with much quaintness of expression,
the thoughts of a simple soldier of the ranks  -  the thoughts, it is to be
presumed, of a mass of men, which have oftentimes been inarticulate.
There is a frankness about this diary that conveys inevitably, I believe,
the conviction of sincerity. And there is a lack of emotion  -  as when in
remarking on an event which, we are told, caused the soldiers great
grief, the death of Stonewall Jackson, he merely said, “And General
Jackson died to-day, which is the 10th day of May”  -  an absence of
bitterness and of complaints which, considering the provocation of
circumstances, make the diary of almost as much interest because of
these omissions as because of what is included. Perhaps the most
conspicuously absent feature
<pb id="malone6" n="6"/>
is that of any statement of the Southern cause for which he was
fighting. Not only does the writer refrain from criticism of the
North, but he omits to tell why he is fighting for the South. He
assumes the Southern cause tacitly and of course. Mr. Malone
was chiefly concerned with his job of being a soldier and, as there
was no passion nor rancor in his story, there was likewise no
exaltation nor fervid declamation. He asserted no particular
knowledge of military events nor predicted the result of any
engagement. “What the result is to be is more than
I no.” He did
not seem to have been especially elated by victory, and he was
certainly not demoralized by defeat  -  not even that of
Gettysburg. He committed himself on rare occasions to
expressions which manifested a confidence in the ultimate
outcome, as after a successful battle he said: “We whipt them like
we aulways do.” He was unconsciously a brave man who took a
sober sort of joy in fighting. On one occasion, when alluding to a
battle of more than four hours in length, which began about three
o'clock in the afternoon, he remarked: “we had a wright nice time
of it from then on tell dark.” There is no notice taken of the
horrors of war, of bloody scenes which he must have witnessed
on the battlefield; nor were there any complaints made of the
pains of the wounds he received. His attitude toward the enemy
was unemotional, almost indifferent. He sometimes referred to the
federal soldiers as “the Scamps,” which, in view of the heated
controversies of the time, must certainly be regarded as a mild
term of reproach. It is true that he designated General Benjamin
F. Butler as the “Yankee beast,” but that was an expression then
so current in the South as to be conventional so far as Butler was
concerned. Having done with these negative, though very
significant, aspects, it might be said that, judging from the diary,
Malone was chiefly thinking  -  possibly from a farmer's habit  - 
of the weather with its attendant pleasures and discomforts and
about food.</p>
        <p>One persistent habit of Malone was to record the texts of
sermons which he heard, together with references to their biblical
sources. This practice, in addition to revealing some interesting
evidence as to the nature of Civil War sermons, will remind some
<pb id="malone7" n="7"/>
readers of the time when it was considered a cardinal sin to be
unable to quote and cite the preacher's text. Religion affected
him in this way not only, but it influenced his poetry.</p>
        <p>That part of the diary which describes Malone's experience as
a prisoner at Point Lookout is, I think, an important and valuable
addition to the limited, first-hand material dealing with
Southerners in Northern prisons. It was when writing his
reflections on prison life that the first note of despair comes into
his journals. His criticism of the treatment of prisoners there may
be summarized under four heads: First, there was not food
enough. “Our rations at Point Lookout was 5 crackers and a cup
of coffee for Breakfast. And for dinner a small ration of meat 2 
crackers three potatoes and a cup of soup. Sugar we have non.”
Later he described the food supplied by saying, “Our Rations
gets no better we get half a loaf of bread a day a smal slice of
Pork or Beef or Sault Beef for Breakfast for dinner a cup of
Been Soup and Supper we get non.” Coffee and sugar, which
last commodity had for a time been supplied, had been taken
away. At one time his friends caught, cooked and ate a rat.
Secondly, he wrote of the poor protection against the cold
afforded the prisoners. Many had to sleep on the ground with
only one blanket. “All the wood we get at Point Lookout is one
sholder tirn of pine brush every other day for a tent. 16 men to
every tent.” He recorded that five men froze to death on one
night. Thirdly, he mentioned the frequent shooting of prisoners by
the guards for trivial reasons. At one time he states that a
prisoner was shot and killed by the guard “for no
reason attall.”
Fourthly, he rather bitterly resented the placing of negroes as
guards over him.</p>
        <p>It will seem strange to some that the writer of this diary
should have spelled General Lee's name, which undoubtedly was
very familiar to him, as “Lea.” This spelling
of the famous name
may be explained by the fact, of which I have been informed, that
in Caswell County there were a number of people who spelled
their name “Lea,” as, indeed, did an officer of Malone's
regiment. This and other orthographic curiosities must
<pb id="malone8" n="8"/>
be considered in the light of the fact that he was a graduate of
the “corn field and tobacco patch” university.</p>
        <p>No serious editing has been undertaken. Outside of an
occasional attempt to indicate in some cases the accurate form of
certain proper names and places, the diary has been allowed to
stand without comment as written.</p>
