        <head>REMINISCENCES OF THE CIVIL WAR</head>
        <p>My father, Thomas Leeds Mitchel, of Groton,
Connecticut, was a cotton merchant in
Apalachicola, Florida, a small but important city at
the mouth of the Chattahoochie River. As there
were few railroads, all the cotton raised in the
interior was shipped down the river to be
compressed and taken down the bay, where
steamers and sailing vessels were waiting to carry it
to England or the Northern States.</p>
        <p>Father was one of the earliest settlers, and held
important positions of trust in city and church. His
wife, Sophia Brownell, of Providence, Rhode Island,
a woman of strong character, was well fitted to
stand by his side
<pb id="mitch4" n="4"/>
and help him establish a home in an almost new
country.</p>
        <p>The society of Apalachicola was unusually
good. A number of Northern families who had
been drawn there as my father had, and families
from Virginia and other Southern States, brought
together elements of culture and refinement unusual
in so small and primitive a town.</p>
        <p>Father, being a Northerner by birth and training,
was essentially Northern in his sentiments. He did
not believe in slavery. While he employed many
negroes, he owned only three, and they had come
to him imploring him to buy them, as otherwise
they would be sold in the open market. They were
faithful, valuable servants, and became real
members of our family. One of them, “Uncle
Young,” as we always called him, was sent as a
representative to the State Legislature after the
war. But he never
<pb id="mitch5" n="5"/>
forgot the old times, and not long before father
died, he received a letter from him which began,
“Dear Mast' Tom.”</p>
        <p>I well remember the excitement when war
seemed imminent. Though only a very young girl, I
was allowed to go to a mass meeting. I felt the
thrill of it all, and though too young to enter into the
merits of the question, was carried along by the
general excitement and influence.</p>
        <p>Father was a good deal of a philosopher, and,
always looking on the bright side, was convinced
that the war could not be long, and peace would
soon be restored. As he had large properties in the
South as well as his business, he decided not to go
North, for he well knew everything would be
confiscated if he did.</p>
        <p>Our little city felt the shock of the first gun, fired
on Fort Sumter, and almost immediately warlike
preparations were started.</p>
        <pb id="mitch6" n="6"/>
        <p>Being on the coast, the town was supposed to be
in danger. Companies were formed and drilled.
Batteries of sandbags, armed with cannon, lined that
part of the town exposed to invasion from the bay,
and there was much coming and going. Ladies met
to embroider banners, and the ceremonies of
presentation seemed to me most glorious and
exciting events. Companies of young soldiers came
down from the interior, and to my childish mind it
seemed as though our part of the country was to be
the seat of war.</p>
        <p>This was in the spring of 1861. My oldest sister,
Floride, was to be married early in the autumn, and
mother wanted to go North to see her father and get
my sister's trousseau. It was a hurried and
hazardous trip, and she returned with much
difficulty, being almost the last let through the lines.
We were indeed glad to have her return safely,
bringing the precious outfit. I feel sure no
<pb id="mitch7" n="7"/>
one else could have accomplished it, but she was a
woman of indomitable will and courage.</p>
        <p>My sister's marriage took place soon after, and
as I was one of the bridesmaids, war and all its
consequences were naught to me for a while.</p>
        <p>My next recollection was that Apalachicola was
to be abandoned as an army post. The blockade had
shut up the port. All the soldiers were sent to the
interior except a company of scouts, which was
stationed about twenty miles away, near some
“dismal swamps,” and used to keep an eye on the
coast, and report any unusual occurrence.</p>
        <p>Of course, business was at a standstill, and many
moved up to Columbus, Georgia, and other towns on
the river. My brother-in-law decided to go to
Columbus, and I was sent, too, in order that I might
go to school.</p>
        <p>The steamboat was crowded and, as it was at
the time of a great flood, there was
<pb id="mitch8" n="8"/>
much to see and remember. The banks of the river
were entirely under water, and sometimes the river
was a large and continuous lake. Only those who
have traveled on one of the Southern rivers can
understand the romance and beauty of it all. The
huge, moss-draped trees, the landings at night,
with the negro crew singing their weird songs while
unloading by the light of pine knots burning in wire
cages. The trip was none too long for my excited
fancy. My life in Columbus has always been a
happy recollection. I loved my school and teacher,
and the thrilling and dreadful events that took place
touched me very lightly.</p>
        <p>The next event of importance was that a brother
two years older than I had been taken from the
schoolhouse in Apalachicola by a detachment of
soldiers, and conscripted into the Southern army.
He was not allowed to go home even for a change
of clothing.
<pb id="mitch9" n="9"/>
He was below the age limit, which limit had been
lengthened at both ends since the beginning of the
war.</p>
        <p>My parents were greatly distressed and
besought the colonel to release him, but without
avail, and he was hurried off to the camp.</p>
        <p>Fortunately, he had some friends in the
company who gave him food and cared for him as
well as they could. The colonel said he had “no
food for conscripts.”</p>
        <p>Not many months after this he came up to
Columbus on a furlough, his health having broken
down under poor food and the malarial air from
the swamps. He was much changed from the
rugged, healthy boy I had left behind in
Apalachicola. We did all we could to repair
damages in the short time allowed him, and were
very sorry to have him leave us and go back to the
privations of the camp.</p>
        <pb id="mitch10" n="10"/>
        <p>The war progressed, but being so far from the
scene of conflict, I was affected mainly by the
troubles of my friends who had members of their
families in the active army. Occasionally a father or
son would be home for a while, and often the news
of friends being killed in battle would shock the
community, so there was little rest or happiness. I
remember a feast gotten up for some Southern
soldiers going through Columbus to join the army,
and enjoyed waiting on the table. Though food was
scarce and costly, every one gave of their best, and
there was much cheering and enthusiasm. Quite a
contrast to this, was our going down to the station to
see a load of prisoners being taken to Andersonville.
I saw no food or drink given them. They were
huddled as close together as was possible, and all I
could do was to pity their forlorn condition. It
seemed only one of the natural conditions of war.</p>
        <pb id="mitch11" n="11"/>
        <p>One day, coming home from school, I was met
with the astounding news that my father had gone
down to the blockading vessel in the harbor, taking
my brother with him, and both were on their way
North! The world seemed upside down for a while,
and I was conscious that my eyes grew big with
wonder and amazement. At last more tidings came,
and we realized the whole situation.</p>
        <p>My brother had had a very severe relapse of the
fever, and his life had been in much danger, but the
kindness of his fellow soldiers and his strong
constitution had pulled him through; and when able
to be helped to his saddle, he was told he could have
a few days' furlough, to go to his family in
Apalachicola. When he arrived after two days'
riding and resting, he looked so very ill that it was
evident he could not go back to camp, for the boy's
life would be the penalty. Father's decision was
quickly made. “How
<pb id="mitch12" n="12"/>
long can you stay here?” he asked. “Two nights.”
“We will see about that,” was the answer.</p>
        <p>Father knew that it would never do to let him
return, and the only alternative was to take him
North by the way of the blockade. Everything had
to be done with the utmost secrecy, for the lives of
all concerned in the transaction were at stake. If
any small detail miscarried, the consequences were
fatal. The most difficult item was getting some one
to row them down the bay. Once on board the
blockade, they were safe unless the ship should be
captured.</p>
        <p>Father was so loved and respected in the town
that he was able to overcome even this difficulty,
and two men promised to be ready at the wharf at
a certain time. These men had been in the habit of
going down for oysters and fish, so their
movements were not noticed. They had been
suspected of
<pb id="mitch13" n="13"/>
helping others off, but it could not be proved.</p>
        <p>The next day was devoted to preparations. The
trunk was wrapped in many folds of bagging and
taken down in a wheelbarrow after dark. Later on
my father and brother strolled down separately,
each having nervous shocks.</p>
        <p>Father met an old friend just as he arrived
at the wharf. As father had been ill for
some time, Mr. Ormand was much surprised
at seeing him out at that time, and asked
why he was there. Father said, “Yes, indeed!
It is entirely too late. I must go
home immediately.” And walked back up the
street, returning later, and reaching the boat
unobserved.</p>
        <p>Colby, when halfway down, heard some one
running behind him. He was too feeble to run, so
turned, to face his younger brother bringing
something that had been forgotten.</p>
        <pb id="mitch14" n="14"/>
        <p>They were finally off, and met with no other
adventure during the five miles' ride.</p>
        <p>The next morning mother stood at the back gate,
and the man who had rowed them down the bay
passed by. Neither appeared to greet the other, but
he whispered “All is well.” That was a great relief,
but she did not hear of their safe arrival at the North
for several months. The captain of the blockader
treated them very kindly, and sent them to Key
West by the fortnightly transport, and from there
they went North to our summer home in Rhode
Island.</p>
        <p>Mother then had to face a very serious situation.
Naturally, the people were much incensed over my
brother's desertion, and no one could tell what the
authorities might do. Left with four small children
and another (myself) in Georgia, with very little
money, and food scarce, there were many
perplexities to meet, both immediate and in the
<pb id="mitch15" n="15"/>
future. She knew that the only thing for her to do was
to follow father as soon as possible. But first, she
must get me down from Columbus, for she could not
think of my being left behind. It would seem a simple
thing for her to go up the river after me, but the war
had brought about many unexpected conditions.</p>
        <p>Fearing the blockaders would go up the river and
burn the towns and factories, the Confederates had
obstructed the passage with trees, rafts and other
materials, which, in time, had accumulated still
further débris of all sorts, so that the river was
practically useless above this obstruction, which
extended northward for miles. The problem was
how to get around this obstruction. Beyond that, she
could get a steamer. But the hardest trouble of all
was leaving her little children behind. Dear old
“Aunt Ann,” a faithful colored nurse, could be entirely
<pb id="mitch16" n="16"/>
trusted for service and devotion, and a relative
promised to protect them. Though mother was
brave, it was a hard trial to leave the young family
and start off alone on the unknown but certainly
dangerous journey.</p>
        <p>She was rowed as far as the obstruction, around
which she was carried in an ox cart, stopping for
the night's rest whenever she could find a decent log
house. She must have suffered many privations and
much fatigue. Rowing against the current was slow
and tedious work, and jolting over rough roads
through the deep forests must have been lonely and
fatiguing. Realizing that I could never endure such
an experience, and hearing that the river had made
a way for itself around the obstruction, though a
narrow, swift and dangerous one, she resolved to
brave it, and engaged a man to build a strong boat
for the return trip, and take us down himself. He
was an Italian
<pb id="mitch17" n="17"/>
who had lived in Apalachicola, and was a man to
be trusted.</p>
        <p>Beyond the obstruction she found the rest of the
journey easy, and she could rest a little before
meeting us. That meeting was joyful, but full of
conflicting emotions.</p>
        <p>She was so worn from the journey that she
hesitated about taking me back with her, and said
she would have to leave me behind after all, but I
had something to say about that, and exclaimed
vehemently, “Mother, if you do not take me with
you, you will never see me again!” So after resting
a couple of weeks, the eventful return journey was
begun.</p>
        <p>I was sad at leaving my sister behind, but her
husband and home were there, and as a family we
had traveled so much, both on this continent and
Europe, that we were used to partings, and I set
out on this unusual journey without forebodings.</p>
        <pb id="mitch18" n="18"/>
        <p>The distance from Columbus to Apalachicola
was about three hundred miles. We took a
steamboat to Fort Gaines, where there was a
military station, and where we would have to get a
passport which we must present at a small station
quite a distance below the obstruction. This was to
stop, if possible, the constant escape of deserters.</p>
        <p>Immediately on our arrival at Fort Gaines
mother went to the arsenal for the passport. She
was met by a very agreeable young adjutant, who
said he had not the power to give us one, but he
was expecting the major back at any moment and
he would give it.</p>
        <p>The next day she went out again, only to have
the same experience. The third day with the same
result. On the fourth day I said, “Let me go;
perhaps he will give it to me.” Taking an attendant,
I trudged along the two miles with great
confidence, and was rewarded by being able to
bring the promise
<pb id="mitch19" n="19"/>
of the precious document. My youth probably
appealed to the young man, and he could not help
feeling that I ought not to be detained. We did not
know it then, but found out afterwards that he had
orders to detain us till the major came, as we were
not to be allowed to go on. He said for us to make
our arrangements for departure the next day, and
he would bring the passport himself to the
steamboat which would take us down to the
obstruction. I was triumphant, but mother had her
doubts as to his keeping his word.</p>
        <p>The next morning we went on board, hoping for
the best. The bell rang for starting, but still no
adjutant appeared. At last, just when our hearts
were sinking with disappointment and the gang
plank was being drawn in, he came galloping down
the road with the passport in his hand. He probably
had hoped the major would come at the last
<pb id="mitch20" n="20"/>
moment and relieve him of the responsibility. I
never heard if he suffered from his disobedience of
orders, but have always been grateful to him for his
kindness. I still have the paper and treasure it very
highly.</p>
        <p>The distance to the obstruction was not great,
and there we found “Bernardo” waiting for us with
the new strong boat. My trunk and a few packages
of food comprised the cargo, for we had to travel
as light as possible. The other boatman, whom
Bernardo had engaged, turned out to be a refugee
like ourselves, and he was glad to give his services
under the circumstances.</p>
        <p>The river had utilized one of those bayous with
which the Southern rivers are so well provided, as
a means of escape around the obstruction. It had
been widened and deepened by the force of the
strong current, but as the stream carried off the
banks the trees would fall in, making it much more
dangerous,
<pb id="mitch21" n="21"/>
and the utmost care and skill were necessary
to bring us through in safety. Mother and I lay in
the bottom of the boat with strict orders not to
move, while the little boat was tossed about by the
swift current. If we had hit one of the projecting
trees, we would have sunk immediately. Mother
thought of her four helpless little children left in
Apalachicola, and must have made many and
earnest appeals for help and protection.
I do not remember how long this lasted,
but our progress was very swift, and finally the
tension was relaxed and we glided
out into the smooth waters of the river. How lovely
it looked after the mad turmoil and anxiety of the
bayou.</p>
        <p>The men rested a while, letting the boat float
down the peaceful river, and we all gave
thanks for our deliverance from the dangers we
had encountered.</p>
        <p>About eleven o'clock that night we found
<pb id="mitch22" n="22"/>
a good landing, where we went ashore, and
lighting a fire to keep the wild beasts away, we lay
down on the ground for a little rest from our
cramped positions.</p>
        <p>Mother, worn out by the anxieties of the day,
dozed off, but I was too excited by the novelty and
beauty of the scene. The moon was full, and though
just before Christmas, the weather was mild. The
air was heavy with the scents of the forest behind
us, from which could be heard, from time to time,
the calls of owls, panthers and wildcats. We saw
none, but there was always the expectation that
one would appear.</p>
        <p>We roasted peanuts in the coals and toasted
bacon and corn pones. These were our only food
during the entire journey. The river water, muddy
though it was, satisfied our thirst. Supplies of all
kinds had long been very scarce, and we had
learned to be very thankful for little, and that of
the simplest.</p>
        <pb id="mitch23" n="23"/>
        <p>About four in the morning we resumed our way
down the now placidly flowing stream. The banks
were sometimes high bluffs, then low stretches of
sand or clay, but more often tangled masses of
trees and thick undergrowth coming right down to
the water. No one could possibly penetrate it, and
we were as alone as though we were the only
inhabitants of the earth.</p>
        <p>The exciting event of the morning was passing
the little military post where the passport must be
examined. I can well remember the rather
overdone indifference of my mother and the stoical
look on the faces of the men. The passport was
only for mother and me. It said nothing about the
men, and at first it seemed as though there would
be some trouble, but it was so obvious that we
must have some one to do the rowing that we were
given permission to go on. But it was not till we had
left the post several miles behind
<pb id="mitch24" n="24"/>
that we were really at ease. The rest of the trip
was uneventful. The men rowed and rested. We
always made progress, as the flow of the river was
several miles an hour.</p>
        <p>We hoped to reach home before dark of the
second day in the little boat, but the men were
nearly exhausted and could not row steadily.
Finally we came out into the big bay in front of the
city, and, oh, how little and frail our boat seemed,
especially as it had begun to leak and mother and I
had to take turns bailing.</p>
        <p>But all things come to an end at last, and about
midnight we climbed up on the deserted wharf of
unfortunate Apalachicola. Little did it look like the
busy, thriving place of two years before. Instead of
high piles of cotton bales, grass was growing in the
streets. Where innumerable negroes used to work
busily there was silence and
<pb id="mitch25" n="25"/>
loneliness. The life of the city was gone. Poor
Apalachicola! Her glories had departed.</p>
        <p>The scene made a vivid impression on my
youthful imagination, and I realized in a degree how
sad and forlorn it was.</p>
        <p>We were glad to be on our feet after the
confinement of the boat. No one knew when we
would arrive; all were asleep; and the walk to our
home seemed like going through a dead city. It
reminded me of the old story of “The Sleeping
Beauty.”</p>
        <p>However, the faithful nurse slept with one eye
open, and we were soon surrounded by the little
family. The meeting was almost too pathetic for
joy, and tears and laughter were about evenly
distributed.</p>
        <p>It was certainly an unusual scene. Aunt Ann,
the old nurse, as well as the children, had rushed
out in their nightclothes, and we embraced each
other in the garden
<pb id="mitch26" n="26"/>
among the orange trees, regardless of the
neighbors. The excitement stimulated us for the
moment, but we were so exhausted that we were
soon put to bed.</p>
        <p>It was fortunate that we arrived as we did, for
the food question had grown to be a very serious
one for the old negro, as the simple supply was
nearly exhausted.</p>
        <p>Agriculturally, Apalachicola was unfortunately
situated, being built on a sand bank. Almost every
one who could get away had gone, and there were
few negroes to cultivate what little soil there was.
No steamers could come down the river, and if any
one went down the bay for fish and oysters, he was
suspected of sympathizing with the Northerners.
That left the city dependent on an occasional barge
coming down the lower part of the river with corn
meal. Of other food there was none except a few
sweet potatoes. There were no cattle, consequently
<pb id="mitch27" n="27"/>
no meat; no poultry, as there was no food
for them. Our cow had died from lack of food. She
had lived quite a while on cotton seed, but gave very
little milk, and at last was buried in the back yard.</p>
        <p>Before father left he had found several casks of
rice in one of his empty warehouses. It was taken to
the house, and he thought it would last a long time.
But one day mother discovered that weevils were in
it and put it out in the yard on sheets. The neighbors
saw it and soon a crowd collected and demanded
the rice. Mother knew they would take it by force if
she refused, so yielded, giving each a little till nearly
all was gone. After the supply of rice was
exhausted there was little good food to be had. Corn
meal, with an occasional treat of oysters, was the
steady bill of fare. Once the supply of meal was so
low that mother went to a friend saying, “I hear you
have some corn meal;
<pb id="mitch28" n="28"/>
you must divide with me; I have almost nothing for
my children.” Once there was a report that a barge
was in sight, and all flocked to the wharf, only to see
the barge upset and the whole cargo dumped into
the water. One can imagine the scene!</p>
        <p>I had fared rather better in the interior, and found
the food very unpalatable, but hunger is the best of
sauces, and I soon found an appetite for the simple
fare.</p>
        <p>As soon as mother had rested she began to plan
for our going North. She knew we would have to
wait till spring, as none of us was prepared to face
the rigors of a Northern winter. She sent a note to
the captain of the “Somerset,” which he
acknowledged by calling one day when he came up
to burn a few houses. He said that when she was
ready he would come up for us, and take care of us
till the transport came from Key West, so her
anxieties on that score were at rest.</p>
        <pb id="mitch29" n="29"/>
        <p>One day we heard that the town was excited
about two men who had been missing for some time,
and that a search party had started out in quest of
them. Mother was much worried, as they were the
men who had taken father and Colby down the bay.
Later one of the scouts who came regularly to town
said if the men were wanted they could be found at
a certain place. Both had been dead some time.
They had been tied to trees and shot at by the whole
company. They had been suspected of helping
others besides father, and of certain other acts that
brought them under suspicion of disaffection. All this
was a great shock to us. I remember the day that
the wife of one of them came to mother and asked
her if she had ever told who took father off.
Mother's feelings can well be imagined, but she
could answer with a clear conscience that she never
had.</p>
        <pb id="mitch30" n="30"/>
        <p>Towards March the captain sent a letter saying
he had received orders not to take any more
refugees, as there had been so many, and they
always came so poor, and many of them were ill
from exposure. The government was tired of
supporting them, consequently he would be unable to
give us the required assistance.</p>
        <p>This sounded very discouraging, but mother's
determination was not at all shaken. She knew we
could not stay in Apalachicola and starve. There
were some islands in the bay on which were a few
old houses, and she felt sure she could find shelter
there till the fortnightly transport came, so she began
her preparations. She packed the articles she felt she
must save if possible, and everything was arranged
for leaving at a moment's notice.</p>
        <p>Not long after, word was brought that the
launches were coming up the bay. Mother
<pb id="mitch31" n="31"/>
immediately started for the wharf and met the
captain, saying, “I am now ready to go back with
you.” He laughed and said, “Well, make your
packages small.” The result was that she, with her
five children, and fifteen pieces of luggage, were put
safely on board the launches, and we bid farewell to
our Southern home.</p>
        <p>The people turned out to see us off, and the
presence of the various officers, to say nothing of
several small cannon, sufficed to insure us a
respectful treatment.</p>
        <p>On the way mother explained her plan to the
captain, but he scorned it, saying, “I will take you
over the island after lunch, and you can see for
yourself, but I could not think of letting you stay
there. I shall be very happy to have you as my
guests.” It was a new and wonderful experience for
us youngsters and we thoroughly enjoyed it.</p>
        <p>I must say here that the “Somerset” was
<pb id="mitch32" n="32"/>
a reconstructed ferryboat that previously had plied
between New York and Brooklyn. This ferryboat,
returned to her original condition, is still carrying
passengers to and fro between the same cities, at
Fulton Ferry, and whenever I chance to cross on her
I am overwhelmed with recollections, most of them
very pleasant.</p>
        <p>Lunch was served as soon as we arrived, and
words cannot express our joy at seeing whitebread
and butter, apples and cake, beside other luxuries,
spread out before us. It seemed almost like sacrilege
to eat such precious delicacies. The captain enjoyed
our delight, and mother shed tears at seeing her
children eat all they wanted. It is almost impossible
to describe how happy we were the next two
weeks. The ship and every one on board were at
our disposal.</p>
        <p>The ship's tailor made beautiful suits for the
three boys, and lamented that he could
<pb id="mitch33" n="33"/>
not do the same for the rest of us. We were a
shabby looking lot, as to clothing, for nothing had
been bought for two years, and growing children are
not very careful. Some brown linen curtains had
been found in one of father's stores and made into
shirts for the boys and dresses for the girls. Shoes
had been made out of stiff pieces of cloth, etc. It is
useless to enter into these little details, for there
would be no end to my story, and they are not
essential.</p>
        <p>The captain sent the boys to the mess-room, and
the rest of us lived in his dining room. We were sent
ashore each day for exercise and play, were allowed
to bring shells and other treasures on board, and
were petted and feasted and very, very happy. In
fact, nothing was too good for us. The truth was that
these men had been shut off from family life so long,
many of them having children at home, that they
were as happy as
<pb id="mitch34" n="34"/>
we, and it was a pleasant break in their
monotonous routine.</p>
        <p>One day the captain said to mother, “I know that
whatever Confederate money you have is worthless,
and you cannot possibly have any 'greenbacks,' so
you must be without funds, and how will you get this
family to Rhode Island?” She replied with much
spirit, “It is my own affair how much or how little I
have. I expect my husband has sent some money to
Key West for my use.” “Very well,” said he, “I
have ten thousand dollars here  -  prize money  -  that
I want deposited in New York, and it would be a
favor to me if you would carry it with you, using as
much as you need, and your husband can replace it
at his convenience.”</p>
        <p>“Oh,” said mother, “I have all the responsibility I
can bear now. I could not possibly take your
money.” “Have you one hundred dollars?” asked
the captain. “No.” “Have
<pb id="mitch35" n="35"/>
you fifty?” Such persistence brought the climax.
“I'll tell you just how much I have. Twelve gold
dollars that belong to Cora.” “I thought as much,”
said he. “Now, I insist upon your taking five
hundred dollars, for you will need a good deal as
soon as you leave us.” Such kindness could not be
resisted and was accepted with much gratitude.</p>
        <p>The days flew by very swiftly. Once a vessel
was seen trying to run the blockade, and though we
went after her with all haste, she made her escape.
Another day we went ashore to see the men casting
a seine. Quite large fish were caught and made
good sport for the fishermen. Every time we went
ashore, we were carried on the backs of the sailors,
as the water was too shallow to permit even the
small boats to land.</p>
        <p>We enjoyed it all so much that if we had not had
home in view we should have been
<pb id="mitch36" n="36"/>
very sorry when we saw the “Honduras” arrive,
and knew that the time had come for us to leave
our kind friends. The “Somerset” family was
sincerely sorry to lose us, for our stay had been
mutually pleasant.</p>
        <p>However, the “Honduras” proved to be as
happy a home as the “Somerset,” and our life on
board for four days has always been a pleasant
recollection. We stopped at Tampa and Cedar
Keys, both very beautiful harbors, and distributed
rations, mail, ammunition and other necessities at
the blockading points. It was very interesting to
watch.</p>
        <p>When we arrived in Key West another problem
presented itself. The town was full of refugees. The
one hotel was crowded to its fullest capacity, and
no boat from New Orleans in sight. It was after
Butler had taken New Orleans, and a regular line
of steamers plied between that city and New
York. Yellow fever had broken out in Key
<pb id="mitch37" n="37"/>
West, and the expected steamer might not even
come to the wharf.</p>
        <p>Several of the officers of the “Honduras” said
they knew of a place which was respectable, but
they could not say more for it, but if mother would
go there they too would live there till they had to
leave for a return trip. Their presence added
greatly to our comfort and safety.</p>
        <p>While in Key West we were made happy by a
visit from our old slave and cook, Aunt Sally. She
was a Virginia darky and a first-class servant.
Before mother had gone to Columbus for me the
negroes had begun to leave for Key West in large
groups. Aunt Sally came to mother and said she
wanted to go, and mother made no opposition. In
fact, she was glad to have her go, as it made one
less to feed. She knew Aunt Sally would always be
able to take care of herself, as she was an
accomplished laundress. I remember
<pb id="mitch38" n="38"/>
well when she first came to us. She was to
be sold, and being such a fine woman, was allowed
time to find her own master. Failing that she would
be sold to the highest bidder in the open market. She
went down on her knees before my father, imploring
him to buy her as an act of charity. She was
overcome with joy when he consented, for she knew
she would be kindly treated. I used to stand beside
her in the evening when she was making bread. She
would entertain me by telling interesting stories and
singing the old plantation songs, only one of which I
remember, and only three verses of that. The music
is a quaint minor, and I always loved it:</p>

          <pb id="mitch40" n="40"/>
          <p>Aunt Sally heard we were in Key West, and
immediately came to see us, and took us children in
her motherly arms.</p>
          <p>After ten days there was a rumor that the
steamer from New Orleans was in sight, and mother
flew to the dock full of resolution and hope. When
the captain saw her he said very decidedly,
“Madam, I have no room. Everything is as full as
possible.” “But my daughter and I can sleep on the
cabin floor.” “Oh,” said he, “if you have a daughter,
then it is absolutely impossible.” “Captain,” she
replied, “I have five children, and we are all going
with you.” The thought that that was the last
steamer for the summer and yellow fever surely
carrying us off if we stayed, gave force to her
manner.</p>
          <p>The captain wilted, and said meekly, “I have
one stateroom, dark as night all the time, and
flooded each morning when the
<pb id="mitch41" n="41"/>
decks are washed.” “I will take it, whatever it is.
When do you leave?” “Get your children
immediately, for we leave as soon as possible, any
moment.”</p>
          <p>How her heart must have jumped for joy
when we sailed away from the fever-stricken
city into the pure air of the Gulf and knew
we were headed toward home.</p>
          <p>The fever raged in full force that summer and
many, especially negroes, died. As we never heard
from Aunt Sally, we felt sure she was one of the
victims.</p>
          <p>This part of our journey was very different from
our previous experiences. We were no longer
honored and feasted. We were only one group
among many forlorn refugees. We were shabby and
neglected. Part of the time we were seasick, and
always uncomfortable in our cramped quarters. The
boys looked neat in their sailor suits, but the rest of
us were, to say the least, not
<pb id="mitch42" n="42"/>
dressed in the latest fashion. The first day my
brother Tom was wandering alone about the saloon,
when an officer ordered him to go forward, saying,
“No sailors were allowed aft.” It took a good deal of
explanation before he was satisfied that the boy was
a passenger, for the suit was so exactly right that he
could hardly be convinced that it belonged to a
landsman. That was before it was the fashion for
boys to wear sailor suits. The rest of my story is not
very thrilling. We arrived at our home in Rhode
Island after an uneventful trip to New York, and
were welcomed by my father and brother, who had
passed a long and lonely winter. The old farm
seemed a haven of rest and plenty after our hard
experience in Apalachicola.</p>
          <p>Several of our kind naval friends have visited us
since then, and we were very happy
<pb id="mitch43" n="43"/>
at being able to offer hospitality to those who had
befriended us in time of peril and need.</p>
