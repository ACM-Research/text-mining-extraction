        <head>PREFACE</head>
        <p>THIS book needs this much of an apology. It is to a
great extent the autobiography of an insignificant person.
If it were that alone, it would have no excuse for
publication, and would possess little interest for those
outside the immediate home circle. But it is not an autobiography 
alone. It introduces views of Southern life and 
feelings and civilization, prior to and during the war,
which possess an unflagging interest for the American
people; and it tells the true story of several striking events
which preceded our civil strife, and many episodes of the
great war. Besides these, it gives accurate descriptions
not heretofore published of the appearance and actions
and sayings of many distinguished participants on the
Confederate side.</p>
        <p>When I first concluded to print the book, I made an
honest effort to construct it in the third person. It was a
lamentable failure, and made it appear even more
egotistical than in its present form. Having returned to the
narrative in the first person singular, I found myself a
participant in several scenes in which I was not actually
present. How to eliminate these, and at the same time
preserve the continuity of the narrative, was a serious
problem. I solved it at last by the consent of my only
living brother that he would stand for me in several episodes
<pb id="wiseiv" n="iv"/>
having told me all I know.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1">1</ref> I will not mar the
narrative by pointing out the places in which my brother is
myself. This confession redeems the book from being
classed either as an autobiography or a romance; and
whenever anybody shall say to me, “Why, you were not
there?” I will answer, like the Israelite gentleman, “Yes, I
know. Dot vas mine brudder.” The reader gets the facts
as they were, and that is all he ought to expect.</p>
        <p>I dedicate it to my old Confederate comrades, the
bravest, simplest, most unselfish, and affectionate friends
I ever had.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER I</head>
        <head>A LONG WAY FROM HOME</head>
        <p>IT was the day after Christmas in the year 1846.</p>
        <p>Near sundown, two young officers of the army of the United
States sat upon one of the benches on the promenade of the
great reservoir which supplies the city of Rio de Janeiro with
water.</p>
        <p>Both were lieutenants,  -  one of engineers, the other of
artillery. Any one half acquainted with the United States would
have recognized them as West Pointers; and their presence in
this far-away spot was easily accounted for by a glance
downward from the coign of vantage where they sat, at a fleet
of United States men-of-war and troop ships riding at anchor
in the bay.</p>
        <p>Nowhere in all the world is there a scene more beautiful than
that spread out before them. Below, falling away down the
mountain side to the silver sands of the bay, were the palms
and gardens, and orange and olive groves, surrounding the
residence of the Cateti suburb. To seaward, the southern
boundary of the mile-wide entrance to the bay, loomed the
bald, brown peak of the Sugar Loaf Mountain, with the
beautiful suburb of Botafogo nestling near its base. Huge
mountains, their dense foliage lit by the sinking sun, ran down
to the water's edge upon the opposite or northern shore. Far
beneath
<pb id="wise2" n="2"/>
them was the Gloria landing for naval vessels. To westward,
sweeping out into the bay with bold and graceful curves, and
spread beneath them like a map, was the peninsula upon
which the city of Rio is built, and beyond this, gleaming in the
evening sunlight, and studded with islands of intense verdure,
extended the upper bay until it was lost in the distance, where,
on the horizon, the blue peaks of the Organ range closed in
the lovely picture.</p>
        <p>The ships bearing the commands to which the young 
gentlemen were attached were bound to California around
Cape Horn. The troops were to take part in the war then
flagrant between the United States and Mexico. A short stop 
had been made at Rio for water and provisions and
these two youngsters were among the first to apply for and
obtain shore leave.</p>
        <p>The dusty appearance of their dress, and other evidence of
fatigue, showed that they had not failed to sustain the
reputation of their countrymen as investigators of everything
new and strange. In fact, they had, in the morning exhausted
the sights to be seen in the city. After amusing themselves in
the shops of the Rua Direita, and replenishing their stock of
Spanish books in the Rua do Ovidor and wandering through
several churches and residence streets, they had become very
much interested in the remarkable aqueduct which supplies
the city of Rio with water.</p>
        <p>Our young soldiers, in their engineering zeal, had followed
the aqueduct back to its source of supply; and now, bound for
the Gloria landing, were resting, deeply impressed by the great
work, and by the genius and skill of its builders. But both the
youths, recalling the fact that it was the Christmas season, felt,
in spite of all the tropical novelty and strange beauty
surrounding them as evening closed in, a yearning for an 
American home
<pb id="wise3" n="3"/>
and voice and face; and their conversation naturally enough
fell into conjecturing how the Christmas was being spent by
their own loved ones in the United States, or in bemoaning the
good things they were missing.</p>
        <p>While thus engaged, they saw two men approaching. One
was in civilian dress; the other wore the uniform of assistant
surgeon in the United States navy. The newcomers were
engaged in animated conversation; and, although the civilian
was a man of forty, while his companion was a youngster of
twenty-five, there was little if any difference in the alertness of
their steps.</p>
        <p>The faces of the young officers lit up with pleasure as, upon
the near approach of the two pedestrians, they caught the
sound of genuine United States English. They had observed
the American flag floating from a residence in the Cateti, and
had no doubt that the persons who were now passing were in
some way connected with the legation. Accordingly, with that
freedom which fellow countrymen feel in addressing each other
in foreign lands, the West Pointers arose at the approach of the
two gentlemen, and, catching the eye of the elder of the two,
advanced, announced their rank and service, and made some
inquiry as a groundwork of further conversation. They were not
mistaken in their surmises. The gentleman addressed was the
Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the Empire
of Brazil from the Republic of the United States. A title like that
was well calculated to paralyze the familiarity of two young
military men; and when they realized that, unannounced and
covered with dust, they had of their own motion ventured into
conversation with the bearer of such an august title, their first
impulse was to apologize for their temerity and to withdraw.
Even from an officer of no higher grade than captain in their
own service, they were accustomed to a
<pb id="wise4" n="4"/>
greeting strictly formal, usually accompanied by the inquiry, 
“Well, sir? state your business;” and, having done so, they were
generally glad enough to salute and withdraw. Here they were,
without any business, standing in the presence of a high
official, with nothing more to say, and with no excuse to give for
what they had said. But before their embarrassment could grow
more annoying, the minister put them completely at their ease. 
“Well met!” he exclaimed; “we are just returning homeward
from the city. Come! The more the merrier: you shall dine with
me. I still have some Christmas turkey and plum pudding, and
we will drink the health of the good angel who sent my
countrymen to me at this blessed season.”</p>
        <p>During the course of their walk to the American legation, the
young fellows had opportunity to observe their newly found
host more carefully. To them he was a revelation. His name and
position in politics were not unknown to them; for although still
young, he had for many years been a conspicuous figure in
national politics in the United States. The echoes of his
eloquence, as well as accounts of his game-cook courage, had
penetrated even into the isolated world of the Academy at West
Point. In fact, he had been absent from the United States but
two or three years upon this mission, which had been accepted
partly on account of failing health, and partly from a desire to
strike a blow at the infamous African slave-trade. He had
accomplished much towards breaking up the slave-trade, and
derived great benefit to his health.</p>
        <p>Brilliant at all times in conversation, he was, on this
occasion, unusually interesting. The sight of his country's
ships in the harbor, and the news of the struggle with Mexico,
so excited and elated him that he was seen
<pb id="wise5" n="5"/>
at his best by his visitors. The two boys studied him as if he
had been some great actor. Tall and thin, he was nevertheless
exceedingly active and muscular. His dress consisted of simple
black, with spotless linen. He wore the open standing collar and
white scarf affected by the gentlemen of that period. The only
ornament upon his person was a large opal pin confining the
neckerchief. His head gear, suited to the climate, was one of
those exquisitely wrought white Panama hats which is the envy
of men living beyond the tropics. Beneath this was a head
exquisitely moulded, with a noble brow, and large hazel eyes,
the ever-changing expression of which, coupled with a full, rich
voice, charmed and fascinated his guests. His silken blond hair
was thrown back and worn long, as was the custom of the day.
A nose too handsome to be called Roman, yet too strong to be
designated as Grecian; a mouth wide and mobile, filled with
even, white teeth; and a strong chin with a decided
dimple,  -  completed the remarkable face which turned in ever-changing expression, from time to time, towards its
companions, as they strode homeward in the twilight.</p>
        <p>Such was the American minister; and, according to the mood
in which one found him, he impressed the stranger as the
gentlest, the tenderest, the most loving, the most eloquent, the
most earnest, the most fearless, the most impassioned, or the
fiercest man he had ever met. Nobody who saw him ever forgot
him.</p>
        <p>They reached the legation just as it was growing dark, and
as the full-orbed moon was rising from the distant sea. Seeking
the veranda, and seating his guests in the wicker easy-chairs
with which it was well supplied, the minister excused himself,
and left them for a few minutes to their own observations and
reflections.</p>
        <p>As the soft sea-breeze came up to them, laden with
<pb id="wise6" n="6"/>
garden perfumes; as they watched the golden highway the
moon's reflection on the sea; as they saw the twinkling lights
of the ships in the deep shadows of the bay below
them,  -  they felt as if they had indeed discovered an earthly
paradise; and when a fair blond girl in filmy apparel glided
through the drawing-room and joined them speaking pure
English, it seemed as if their paradise was being peopled by
angels. Everybody here spoke in English. Everything spoke of
home. The pictures on the walls, the books on the tables, yes,
the dishes at table were all American.</p>
        <p>The visitors were conducted to their apartments to make
necessary preparations for dinner. Soon after their return to
the drawing-room, the minister reappeared with a look
somewhat troubled, as he apologized for his long absence and
the non-appearance of the lady of the house.</p>
        <p>A moment later the folding-doors rolled back, and the
English butler announced that dinner was served. Oh what a
contrast with the ward-room of the man-of-war in which our two
lieutenants had been dining for a month or more!</p>
        <p>Dinner over, the company once more sought the cool veranda,
where coffee and cigars were served. There they were joined by
Baron Lomonizoff, the Russian minister who had called to be
informed of all the recent developments in the controversy
with Mexico, and who spoke English perfectly. Later, just as
the baron was bidding adieu, in fact, at what seemed to our
young friends to be a very late hour for visiting, the oddest
imaginable specimen of Brazilian humanity was introduced as
Dr. Ildefonso.</p>
        <p>His efforts at English were startling. They nearly convulsed
our two young friends, and reconciled them to their own
failures at Portuguese.</p>
        <p>As the little doctor showed no signs of leaving, and
<pb id="wise7" n="7"/>
as, by one or two indications, the young visitors began to
suspect it was time for them to go, they reluctantly took their
departure, thanking their host a thousand times for the
pleasure he had given them, and chatting joyously, on the
route to the ship, about the good fortune which had given
them such a Merry Christmas.</p>
        <p>The little Brazilian doctor and the surgeon in the navy had
remained because there was work on hand for them. I entered
my name on the docket of humanity that night; and as the
lawyers say, my cause was continued until the further order of
the court.</p>
        <p>How do I know it? I will tell you.</p>
        <p>Forty-five years later, at a great banquet in New York, I was
sitting beside an aged, grizzled general of the armies of the
Union.</p>
        <p>Said the old general cheerily, “Did I ever tell you of my visit
to your father in Rio?” Receiving a negative response, he
proceeded in his inimitable way to recount every incident
above set forth, omitting the hour of his own departure from
the legation. The memory of the struggles of the little Brazilian
doctor with the English language still amused him immensely.
He was recalling some absurd mistake of Dr. Ildefonso, when I
looked up, and, with a merry twinkle in my eye, said, “General,
at what hour did you leave the Cateti that night?” “Oh, I
should say about eleven or twelve o'clock,” said the general. 
“Well, now, do you know, my dear general, I deeply regret you
left so early. I arrived myself that night about two hours after
your departure, and would have been so delighted to meet you
under my father's roof.” This sally was met by a hearty laugh
from the listening company, and was followed by a glass of
wine to the memory of those olden days, since when so many
things have happened.</p>
        <pb id="wise8" n="8"/>
        <p>The young lieutenant of artillery, and the old general
above described, was no other than William Tecumseh
Sherman, commander of the armies of the Union. His
companion was the officer who afterwards became
famous as General Halleck. Neither of them ever met
again their host of that evening.</p>
        <p>In later years, he also became a distinguished general
but on the Confederate side. He never knew that Sherman
and Halleck, the great Union generals, were the
young officers he entertained at Rio the night I was born;
for he died many years before the general revealed his 
identity as above related. </p>
        <p>Forty years after this meeting, when I was in
Congress, I received a letter from a dear old retired
chaplain of the navy living in Boston, Rev. Mr.
Lambert, asking assistance in some public matter, and concluding with the
remark that this demand of a stranger sprung from the
fact that the writer had held me in his arms and baptized
me at the American legation in Rio, April 14,1847.</p>
        <p>In the spring of 1847, my father asked the President
for a recall; and, his petition being granted, the United
States frigate Columbia was placed at his disposal for the
return to America.</p>
        <p>I was a tried seaman when, for the first time, I set foot
upon the soil of my country, and took up my residence
where my people had lived for over two hundred years. I
was not born on the soil of the United States, but
nevertheless in the United States; for the place where I
was born was the home of a United States minister, and
under the protection of the United States flag, and was in
law as much the soil of the United States as any within its
boundaries. Descended from a number of people who
helped to form the Union, born under the
<pb id="wise9" n="9"/>
glorious stars and stripes, rocked in the cradle of an
American man-of-war, and taught to love the Union next
to my Maker, little did I dream of the things, utterly
inconsistent with such ideas, which were to happen to me
and mine within the first eighteen years of my existence.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER II</head>
        <head>THE KINGDOM OF ACCAWMACKE</head>
        <p>OUR voyage terminated in the kingdom of Accawmacke,
the abiding-place of my ancestors for two and half centuries.
Although within eight hours of New York and six hours from
Philadelphia by rail, the region and its people are as unlike
those of these crowded centres of humanity as if they were a
thousand miles away.</p>
        <p>John Smith tells us, in his memorable narrative of earliest
American explorations, that when Captain Nelson sailed in
June, 1607, for England, in the good ship Phoenix, he, John, in
his own barge, accompanied him to the Virginia capes; and there,
after delivering his writings for the company, he parted with him
near the southernmost cape, which he named Cape Henry. Sailing
northward, Captain Smith first visited the seaward island,
which he named Smith's Island, after himself. It is still called
Smith's Island, and is owned by the Lee family. Then he
returned to the northernmost cape, at the entrance to the
Chesapeake Bay, and named it Cape Charles, in honor of the
unfortunate prince afterwards known as Charles I. Upon the
point of this cape Smith encountered an Indian chief, whom he
describes as “the most comely, proper, civil salvage” he had
yet met. The name of this chief was Kictopeke. He was called 
“The Laughing King of Accomack,” and Accomack means, in
the Indian tongue, “The Land Beyond the Water.” He bore in
his hand a long spear or harpoon, with a sharpened
<pb id="wise11" n="11"/>
fish-bone or shell upon its point; and he it was who taught
John Smith and his companions to spear the sheepshead and
other fish in the shallow waters hard by. John Smith and The
Laughing King have been buried for well-nigh three centuries,
but the people about Cape Charles still spear sheepshead on
the shoals in the same old way.</p>
        <p>Smith and his companions cruised along the western shore
of this Peninsula of Accawmacke, which is the eastern shore
of the Chesapeake Bay, until they reached what is now called
Pocomoke River, the present boundary between Virginia and
Maryland. The distance is probably eighty miles. The reason
assigned for the long cruise was that they were searching for
fresh water. To those who know the abundant springs of the
Peninsula, this statement is surprising. Overtaken in the
neighborhood of Pocomoke by one of those summer thunderstorms
which are so prevalent in that region, they were driven
across the bay to the western shore, and thence they cruised
down the Chesapeake until they turned into what is now called
Hampton Roads. Passing the low sandspit where the ramparts
of Fortress Monroe now frown and the gay summer resorts are
built, they stopped at the Indian village Kickotan, located upon
the present site of Hampton. Obtaining there a good supply of
food from the Indians, they returned to the Jamestown
settlement, about forty miles up the river, then called Powhatan,
now known as the James. In this as in all things, the
Englishman appropriated what belonged to the Indian, and
King James supplanted King Powhatan.</p>
        <p>It was on this return voyage that Smith, while practicing the
art acquired from the King of Accawmacke, impaled a fish
upon his sword, in the shallow waters about the mouth of the
Rappahannock River. Unaware of the
<pb id="wise12" n="12"/>
dangerous character of his captive, he received in his wrist a
very painful wound from the spike-like fin upon the tail of the
fish. This wound caused such soreness and such swelling that
he thought he was like to die, and his whole party went ashore
and laid Smith under a tree, where he made his will. “But,” says
he, “by night time the swelling and soreness had so abated
that I had the pleasure of eating that fish for supper.” The next
morning the journey was resumed, and the place, in remembrance
of the incident, was named Stingaree Point. To this day,
that point at the mouth of the Rappahannock is called
Stingaree Point; and that fish is still called Stingaree by the
people along the Chesapeake Bay.</p>
        <p>After this famous cruise, John Smith, who was as active and
restless as a box of monkeys, made his map of Virginia, which
is still extant,  -  and a pretty good map it is, showing his capes
and his islands, and his points and his rivers, and what
not,  -  in which map the Kingdom of Accawmacke bears a most
conspicuous part.</p>
        <p>On that historic document, old John at certain point printed
little pictures of deer, to show where they most abounded; and
at other points he designated where the wild turkeys were most
plentiful. The author of this humble narrative has, in his day,
hunted every variety of game which abounds at the present
time in Old Virginia; and just where the deer and turkeys were
most abundant in 1608, according to John Smith's map, there are the most
abundant now. In the counties of Surry and Sussex, upon the
south side of the James, run, doubtless, the descendants of
those very deer whose pictures adorn the map of John Smith,
published three centuries ago; and within the past twelve
months the writer has followed the great-great-great-
grandchildren of the identical turkeys, no doubt, from whose
flocks were captured, in 1616,
<pb id="wise13" n="13"/>
the twenty birds sent by King Powhatan to his brother the
King of England.</p>
        <p>But to return to our Kingdom of Accawmacke.</p>
        <p>After the Jamestown colonists had tired of poor old John
Smith, after he had blown himself up with his own powder
while smoking in his boat, upon one of his return trips to
Jamestown from the present site of Richmond; after he had
returned to England, broken in health and spirits,  -  the
colonists who remained found, among their other miseries and
tribulations, that they were sadly in need of salt.</p>
        <p>Bearing in mind stories brought back from the coast by
Smith, Sir Thomas Dale, governor, in the year 1612 detailed a
party from the Jamestown settlement to go to the Kingdom of
Accawmacke and boil salt for the settlers at Jamestown.</p>
        <p>We may well imagine that such a task was far from grateful
to those to whom it was allotted. It was looked forward to by
them, no doubt, as the equivalent of solitary confinement in a
dangerous locality. At Jamestown the settlers were located
upon an island. This fact and their numbers gave them
comparative security from the savages. In Accawmacke the
party assigned to saltboiling was placed upon the same land
as the Indians; and its numbers were so small, and the
position so isolated from the chief settlement by the
Chesapeake Bay between them, that their situation would
have been most perilous in case of attack. It was therefore,
doubtless, in the spirit of satire that the party named the place
at which they first located upon the eastern shore, Dale's Gift.</p>
        <p>Thus came about the first settlement of the white man upon
the eastern shore peninsula of Virginia; and, recognizing its
separation from the other settlements, the kings of England for
many years addressed all their decrees to
<pb id="wise14" n="14"/>
the Virginia colonists to their “faithful subjects in ye Colonie
of Virginia and ye Kingdom of Accawmacke”</p>
        <p>Like many another venture undertaken reluctantly in
ignorance, this settlement upon the eastern shore proved to
be anything but an irksome and dangers transfer. The party
at Dale's Gift found the Accawmacke Indians totally unlike
the warlike and treacherous tribes across the bay; and from
that time forth there never was, not even at the time of the
general outbreak of the savages in 1629, any serious trouble
between the whites and the Indians of the eastern shore.
The climate also was much more salubrious than that of the
swamp region where the brackish waters at Jamestown bred
malaria. As for sustenance, they found the place an earthly
paradise. In the light and sandy soil corn, vegetables, and
many varieties of fruit grew with little care of cultivation and in
great abundance. Fish and shell-fish of every kind abounded in
the ocean, bay, and inlets. Wild fowls of many sorts, from
the lordly wild goose to the tiny teal, swarmed in the marshes
and along the coast. Game in great abundance, furred and
feathered, could be had for the shooting of it upon the land;
the fig and the pomegranate grew in the open air. And the
influence the Gulf Stream, which in passing these capes
approaches to within thirty miles of the coast and then turns
abruptly eastward, made, as it still makes, residence upon the
eastern shore of Virginia most charming and delightful. The
eastern shore men were the epicures of the colony. A hundred
years before New York knew the terrapin, it was the daily
food in Accawmacke.</p>
        <p>We may be sure that the less fortunate settlers at
Jamestown, Smithfield, Henricopolis, Flower de Hundred and
the Falls of the James were not long in finding out the
delights of this, at first, despised settlement in Accawmacke.
<pb id="wise15" n="15"/>
History tells us that when, twenty years later, the
colony of Virginia was divided into eight colonies,
“to be governed as are the shires in England,” the
Accawmacke settlement was of sufficient importance to
constitute of itself one of these eight counties; and in 1643,
when the whole colony had a population of but fifteen
thousand, one thousand of these were upon the eastern
shore. When Captain Edmund Scarburgh, presiding justice,
opened the first County Court of Accawmacke at Eastville, the
county seat, in the autumn of 1634, The Laughing King of
Accawmacke had no doubt ceased to laugh; for he, like many
another savage chief before and after him, had by this time
felt the fangs of the British bull-dog sink deep into the vitals
of his kingdom, and became sensible of the fact that it was a
grip which, once fastened upon its prey, never relaxed its
hold.</p>
        <p>Rare old records are those of Captain Edmund Scarburgh and
his successors, and very curious reading do they furnish. 
You may see them, reader, if, instead of flashing
and dashing over every other country in search of novelty,
you will seek the things which are interesting in your native
land, within a stone's throw of your door. There they are,
preserved to this day, in the little brick court house, and are 
continuous from then until now, without a
break, preserving the history of their section intact through a
period of nearly three centuries.</p>
        <p>The Peninsula is no longer a single county. About 1643,
ambitious Colonel Obedience Robins, from Northamptonshire,
England, succeeded in changing the name of the Peninsula to
Northampton. It was not until 1662, when the eastern shore of Virginia 
was divided into two counties, that the upper portion resumed the old title of
Accawmacke, which it retains to this day. The lower part of
the original Accawmacke is still called Northampton.</p>
        <pb id="wise16" n="16"/>
        <p>Nowhere is the type of the original settler in Virgina so well
preserved, or are to be found the antique customs
manners, and ways of the Englishman of the seventeen
century in America so little altered, as in the Kingdom of
Accawmacke. No considerable influx of population from
anywhere else has ever gone to the eastern shore of Virginia
since the year 1700. The names of the very earliest settlers are
still there. Everybody on the Peninsula knows everybody
else. Everybody there is kin to everybody else. Nobody is so
poor that he is wretched; nobody is so rich that he is proud. The
majority of the upper class are stanch Episcopalians, just as
their fathers were Church of England men; and the remainder of
the population are for the most part Methodists, Baptists and
Presbyterians.</p>
        <p>The vices of the community, as well as the virtues, are equally
well-recognized inheritances from their progenitors. Fighting
and drunkenness are by no means absent but theft is rare
among the whites. The kinship and sociability of the
population are such that the fondness of the Englishman for
sports of all kinds is freely indulged. No neighborhood is
without its race-boat; no court day without its sporting event
of some kind; and no tavern without its backgammon board,
quoits, and, in old times its fives-court. The poorhouse has
fallen into decay. When a man dies, his kin are sufficiently
numerous to care for his family; and while he lives, there is no
excuse for pauperism in a land where earning a living is so
easy a matter.</p>
        <p>The citizen of Accawmacke may begin life with no other
capital than a cotton string, a rusty nail, and broken clam, and
end it leaving a considerable landed estate. With his string for
a line, his nail for a sinker and his clam for bait, he can catch
enough crabs to eat
<pb id="wise17" n="17"/>
and sell enough besides to enable him to buy himself hooks
and lines. With his hooks and lines he can catch and sell
enough fish to buy himself a boat and oyster tongs. With his
boat, fishing-lines, and oyster tongs he can, in a short while,
catch and sell enough fish and oysters to enable him to build a
sloop. With his sloop he can trade to Norfolk, Baltimore,
Philadelphia, and New York, sell fish, oysters, and terrapin, and
carry fruit and vegetables, until he has accumulated enough to
buy his own little patch of ground, and build his house upon
it. Then, from the proceeds of his fruit, berries, and every
variety of early vegetable, for which he will find excellent
markets, he is sure of a comfortable living with easy labor; and
he will be happier in his simple home than many who are far
more pretentious, and whose incomes are far greater.</p>
        <p>Such has been for three centuries, and still is, the place and
people among whom my lot was cast when I arrived from
Brazil,  -  descendants of the families of Scarburgh, Littleton,
Yeardley, Bowman, Wise, West, Custis, Smith, Ward,
Blackstone, Joynes, Kennard, Evans, Robins, Upshur,
Fitchett, Simpkins, Nottingham, Goffigan, Pitts, Poulson,
Bowdoin, Bagwell, Gillett, Parker, Parramore, Leatherbury,
Cropper, Browne,: and the rest of them, who were there when
Charles I. was king, and who gave the name of Old Dominion
to Virginia because they refused to swear allegiance to the
Pretender Cromwell, and made the colony the asylum of the
fugitive officers of their lamented sovereign.</p>
        <p>Poor enough pay they got for their loyalty; for, when Prince
Charlie came to his own, although Sir Charles Scarburgh, son
of old Captain Edmund of blessed memory, was Court
Surgeon, and although Colonel Edmund Scarburgh, his
brother, was made Surveyor-General in
<pb id="wise18" n="18"/>
Virginia, in recognition of his fidelity, the reckless sovereign
gave away the devoted Kingdom of Accawmacke to his
favorites, Arlington and Culpeper. To this day, one of the
loveliest places upon the Peninsula, on Old Plantation Creek,
bears the name of Arlington, bestowed upon it by John Custis,
in honor of one of the proprietary lords of the eastern shore.</p>
        <p>A famous local celebrity in his day was this old John
Custis,  -  feasting and junketing at lordly Arlington. When, in
1649, Colonel Norwood, seeking asylum in
Virginia after King Charles's defeat, was shipwrecked upon the
coast of the eastern shore, he first secured abundant clothing
from Stephen Charlton, a minister of the Church of England,
and his sufferings were atoned for he says, by finding John
Custis at Arlington. He tells us how he had known him as a
tavern-keeper in Rotterdam, and of the high living he had
with Custis in his new home until he put him across the bay to Colonel 
Wormley's, more dead than alive from hospitality.</p>
        <p>From the point of Cape Charles to the Maryland boundary,
the coast of the Peninsula on sea side and bay side is indented
with inlets, which are called “creeks” in this section. On the
bay side, going northward from the cape where the oldest
settlements were made, the names of these creeks are English,
such as Old Plantation, Cherrystone, and Hungers. Higher up
the bay side, the names given by the Indians before the white
settlements seem to have been retained; for we have
successively Occahannock, Nandua, Pungoteague, Onancock,
Chesconessex, Annamessex, and Pocomoke as the names of
the beautiful and bold inlets on the bay side. On the sea side,
they rejoice in such titles as Assawamman, Chincoteague, and
the like. These numerous inlets, many of which are navigable
for vessels of considerable size, are but a few miles
<pb id="wise19" n="19"/>
apart, and divide the Peninsula into many transverse “necks.”
Thus it often happens that neighbors living on opposite sides
of these creeks, within hailing distance of each other, find it
necessary, in order to visit each other by land, to travel miles
around the head of the creek dividing them. Small boats are,
therefore, as much in use as means of intercourse between
neighbors, and for visiting the post-offices and little towns at
the wharves, as are horses and vehicles; and an eastern shore
man is as much at home in a boat as upon the land. The public
roads of the counties are called Bay Side and Sea Side roads,
and their general course is up and down the Peninsula, just
inside of the heads of the creeks. The only transverse public
roads are those to the wharves, and an occasional crossroad
from the Bay Side to the Sea Side road.</p>
        <p>It by no means follows, from the general use of boats, that
the travel by land is diminished; for in no place is the
proportion of wheeled vehicles to population greater than upon
the eastern shore. Poor, indeed, is the citizen who cannot own, or
cannot occasionally borrow, an animal and a vehicle of some
kind. Strangers, visiting that section for the first time, get the
impression that at least half the population is continually
driving back and forth upon the highways; and the number and
variety of animals and vehicles collected at the county seat on
court day is something truly astonishing. The speed at which
the driving is done is likewise a matter of comment and
observation by many visitors to the eastern shore.</p>
        <p>People from the Blue Grass regions, where size and bone
and symmetry count for so much in horseflesh, are at first
disposed to look contemptuously upon the Accomack twelve
of horse; and, indeed, it must be confessed that he is not the
highest expression of physical beauty. But never was the
Scripture saying, that“the back is fitted
<pb id="wise20" n="20"/>
to its burden,” better exemplified than in the tough and
wiry little animal which you will sit behind, if you ever make a visit to
this far-away kingdom. Small in stature, inclined even to those
homely features known as ewe nick and cat ham, often higher
behind than in front, and with great length of stifle, he is not, I
admit, imposing to look upon. We must carefully scan the
cunning little fellow before we condemn him. Note, if you
please, in the first place, that the close, shiny coat bespeaks a
strong infusion of the thoroughbred; observe the large, gazelle-like
eyes beaming beneath the foretop, which is fluffy and
shaggy from the constant influence of salt sea air; watch the
nervous playing of the pointed ear, and see how the broad
forehead tapers away to the muzzle, with its wide and flexible
nostrils; observe the clean, straight legs and flat knees before,
and bent stifles, well muscled, behind; run your hand over
those pasterns, long, limber, and without a windgall; and do not
overlook the cup-like, often unshod, hoofs. What say you to
those sloping shoulders, that deep chest, and those well-rounded
ribs, close coupled to the heavy hips? When you
have finished, you will not ridicule a moving machine like that,
if you know good horseflesh when you see it. You may call him
pony if you like. Many of them do, indeed, possess a cross
derived from the wild pony of Chincoteague Island. Now, I see
you turn to look at the light conveyance, with its almost fragile
harness, and know you are wondering whether such an outfit,
drawn by such a horse, will take you to your destination. One
drive will dissipate every doubt. You are starting for a journey
in a country where there is not a hill twelve feet high within fifty
miles, over light, well-packed sand roads, on which in many
places, you could hear an egg-shell crush beneath the wheel.</p>
        <pb id="wise21" n="21"/>
        <p>Come, mount with me. Never fear that our vehicle and
harness are frail. They are light, but not fragile. In the matter of
our driving we are exquisites, and we buy the toughest and the
best. Never fear that we shall be overturned, or that we shall
hurt the horse. Hurt him? I love him as the apple of my eye;
and he knows me as the Arab steed knows his rider. See how
the little rascal snuffs for a caress, as I loosen him from the
fence where he and a long line of his companions are made
fast. Now we have backed him out into the roadway. Gentle as
a lamb, quick as a kitten, see the little bundle of nerves start
the instant the reins are gathered, and how, with that squat
between the shafts, and spraddle, and overreach in the hind
legs, known to every horseman as the surest sign of going, he
is settled to his work, and spinning us along at a slashing gait.
Before long, twenty miles lie behind us, and when we pull up at
Belle Haven or Horn Town, not a sign of weariness or
punishment does the little beggar show. All that he asks  -  and
he asks that in a way that no one can mistake his wish  -  is that
we loosen his check-rein and let him stretch that bony neck,
and give a long, deep heave, before he takes thirty swallows
from the roadside water-trough. Then he rubs his neck against
my sleeve, and his unclouded eye says, “Come, I am ready. Let
us go again.”</p>
        <p>Let me tell you, also, that the horse is not the only thing
which you will find better than it looks in the Kingdom of
Accawmacke. The pretty little white-painted red roofed
houses are better than they look, as you will learn when you
enter their hospitable portals, and find them the abodes of
refinement and virtue and hospitality. The quaint, flat farms
are better than they look, as you will learn when you see the
bountiful crops of fruit and high-priced early vegetables and
berries which they produce. 
<pb id="wise22" n="22"/>
The sea side and the bay side are even better than they
look, as you will know when you learn the wealth of fish and
shell-fish and sea food and game of which they are the
storehouses. The people themselves are better than they look;
for, beneath their unassuming and oftentimes provincial
appearance, they possess great shrewdness, great powers of
observation, strong character, decided opinions, refinement,
and considerable education; and, without one tinge of false
pride, they are of a lineage as old and as honorable as any of
which America can boast.</p>
        <p>Two things, also, you will find in this locality which can be
no better than they look. One is the daybreak and sunrise from
the sea, and the other is the exquisite sunset which lights land
and ocean as the orb of day sinks out of sight to the west
beneath the waves of the Chesapeake. Not sunny Italy, with all
her boasted wealth of color, can surpass the many-tinted
loveliness of evening in the ancient Kingdom of Accawmacke,
to which, for some years to come, my residence was now
transferred.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER III</head>
        <head>OUR FOLKS IN GENERAL AND IN PARTICULAR </head>
        <p>OUR folks have been in Old England since the days of
Alfred, and in America since Thomas West, Lord de la War,
was governor of the Virginia colony in 1608, when numerous
brothers, cousins, and relatives followed him hither in search
of the treasures of the still undiscovered South Sea.</p>
        <p>There and here, for centuries, in peace and in war, they have
never failed to be mixed up in the thick of whatever game the
English stock has played.</p>
        <p>They have lived and died in Devonshire and Somersetshire
for nearly ten centuries. Until its recent destruction to make
way for the government buildings, the old; family nest at
Plymouth was almost as well known to Englishmen as the banks
of the Tamar itself. Burke tells us the name is among the oldest in England.</p>
        <p>The first American ancestor of our name was a younger son
of these old Devonshire people, and came to the Virginia
colony in the reign of Charles the First. The ancient shippinglists
show that he sailed from Gravesend, July 4, 1636, after first
taking the oath of allegiance to king and church. He was a lad
of eighteen, who, yielding to the spirit of adventure which
then prevailed in England, joined his friends, the Scarburghs of
Norfolk, in the Kingdom of Accawmacke.</p>
        <p>Two hundred and sixty years of separation ordinarily works
considerable estrangement, and difference in characteristics, 
<pb id="wise24" n="24"/>
between the separated branches of a family. Not so
with our people. If they possess one predominant trait, it is their
faith in and attachment to anybody and everybody bearing the
name, or springing from the old stock. But for the evidence it
gives of stanchness in love and loyalty, the way in which the
old ties are kept up, to this day, between the English and
American branches would seem absurd. Descendants in the
eighth degree since the separation recognize the kinship; and
the English cousins welcome the Americans to hearth and home,
taking no note of the two and a half centuries which have
elapsed since the American immigrant wandered off from his
English home, and placed the Atlantic Ocean between himself
and his family.</p>
        <p>And let me tell you, you boys of America, that there is no
higher inspiration to any man to be a good man, a good citizen,
and a good son, brother, or father, than the knowledge that
you come from honest blood. Few who have it scorn it, and
many of those who are loudest in belittling it would give all
they have to possess it. And, boys, let me tell you another
thing. When you are hunting for that honest blood, when you
are looking back into the wellsprings of your existence for the
source of the virtue the courage, the manhood, the truth, the
honesty, the reverence, the family love, the simplicity of life,
which will make you what true men ought to be, believe me,
you are more apt to find it in the progenitors who came from
“the right little, tight little island” than anywhere else on this
rolling planet.</p>
        <p>Don't deceive yourselves with the notion that England did
not furnish the best of us. We have had our troubles with
her in the past, it is true. But it is hard for the mother to realize
that her boy is grown, and accord him his rights as a man.
She sometimes makes it very
<pb id="wise25" n="25"/>
uncomfortable for him by failing to recognize that he is no
longer in his swaddling-clothes. But there is not a true-hearted
boy in the world who, in spite of his mother's shortcomings,
does not feel in his heart that there is no other like her.</p>
        <p>Don't take my word for it, if you think I am an old fogy. Wait
until you grow up and see the world for yourselves. Travel
through Russia, or Turkey, or Austria and you will never see a
thing to stir your heart with a desire to be one of them. Stand in
the shadow of the Pyramids, and you will be untouched by one
wish that your blood were Egyptian. Go through Germany, and,
while you will find there much to admire, there will still be
something lacking. In the home of the fickle Gaul, even at
Napoleon's tomb, the American boy is not in touch with his
surroundings. Spain and Italy, while possessed of a wealth of
antique beauty, are to us only echoes of a decayed and
different civilization.</p>
        <p>But, some sunny day in London, wander through Westminster
Abbey and read the names. Some misty morning in Trafalgar
Square, cast your eye upward to the form of Nelson, as he stands
there in the fog, with the lions sleeping at the base of his column.
In some leisure hour, visit the crypt of St. Paul's, where the car
that bore Wellington to his rest still stands. Then, perhaps, you
will appreciate the meaning of an old fogy when he tells you
“There's nothing outside America which tugs at an American's
heart-strings like the names and deeds and monuments of Old
England.”</p>
        <p>Don't let us deceive ourselves about it, either. Don't
think or say that it is a better country than our own Don't let us be
Anglomaniacs. That is not at all necessary. America is good
enough for us. In many things: these blessed United States
already equal any nation on
<pb id="wise26" n="26"/>
the globe. In almost everything, time considered, they are a
marvel. Within the past seventy years, American inventive
genius has contributed more to make life easy, and to advance
civilization, than all the world beside in many hundred years, if
we except the inventions of printing and gunpowder. In future
we may, and probably shall, become in all things the greatest
nation that ever existed. But it is not disloyalty to your own
country, and no disparagement of its greatness, to thank God
that the people from whom we sprang were Englishmen, and
that we have part and lot in England's glory.</p>
        <p>In all America, there is no spot more emphatically English
than the Kingdom of Accawmacke. Nay, more: there is many a
spot in England to-day where the manners and customs of the
population have changed more from what they were in the
seventeenth century, than those of that little peninsula in
America. Of the twenty-five thousand white people in the two
counties of the eastern shore of Virginia, it is safe to say that
four fifths of them are descendants of the earliest English
settlers, and that there has been less infusion of foreign
element there within the last three centuries than in many parts
of England itself. But a few years ago, this writer sat in the old
church at Bishops Lydeard Somersetshire, and looked over the
congregation. The resemblance in appearance between the
people assembled there and the congregations he had often
seen in the Episcopal Church at Eastville, the first county seat
of Accawmacke and in the Bruton Parish Church at
Williamsburg, was striking.</p>
        <p>The first John Wise married Hannah, eldest daughter of
Captain Edmund Scarburgh. In 1655, we find him locating his
grant from Governor Diggs on Nandua Creek, and in 1662, he
was one of the first presiding justices of the newly formed
county of Accawmacke In this year,
<pb id="wise27" n="27"/>
also, the Indian chief Ekeekes, for “seven Dutch blankets”
sold him the two thousand acre tract in Chesconesseck,
named “Clifton” by its new purchaser  -  a tract of which the
greater part descended without deed from father to son for six
generations, until sold to pay the debts of the seventh heir,
who was killed in 1864 in the American war between the
States.</p>
        <p>John, eldest son of the emigrant, married a Matilda,
daughter of Lieutenant-Colonel John West and died in 1717.
Their son John married a Scarbugh, daughter of Colonel Tully
Robinson, and died in 1761. Their son John married Margaret,
daughter of Colonel George Douglas, and died in 1770. Their
son John married first a Mary, daughter of Judge James Henry
and then a Sarah, daughter of General John Cropper, and died
in 1813; and their son Henry, a younger son, was my father.
Related to a great number of the people of his county; known
to all; honored and respected for his high character and
beloved for his widely known talents and eloquence, which
had reflected honor upon the community,  -   father's return
from Brazil to his home in Accomack was the occasion of great
rejoicing and festivities upon the eastern shore.</p>
        <p>No more beautiful spot for a dwelling-place can be found
anywhere than his home named “Only.” It is located upon a
bold estuary of the Chesapeake, called Onancock Creek,
which comes down westwardly from its source, and, upon
reaching Only, makes a graceful turn, first southward, then
westward, then northward, and, curving like a horseshoe,
incloses within its bend five acres of ground, with banks high
above the stream and level as a table, on which stands a grove
of noble oaks of the original growth.</p>
        <p>In the neck of the horseshoe, with the grove behind it
<pb id="wise28" n="28"/>
and a fan-shaped lawn of greensward before it, stood the
mansion house. It was not a stately structure There are few such
among the simple folk of this Peninsula. But it was a model of
scrupulous neatness, every way fit for the residence of an
unpretentious country gentleman, and, outside and inside, gave
evidence of taste and refinement. On the eastern side of the
lawn, a terraced garden ran down to the water's edge; and about
the porches, roses, cape jessamines, and honeysuckles climbed
in great luxuriance. Adjoining the house were the kitchen and
quarters of the household slaves, and outside the lawn, beyond
the terraced garden, were the barns, carriage-houses, stables,
and cattle-pens. Still further away were the quarters occupied by
the plantation slaves. Looking upstream, other pretty points
were visible, on which, in groves, the picturesque dwellings of
the neighbors were seen, and in the further distance was the
village of Onancock, with its steeples, and sandy streets, and
red-topped houses, and wharves swarming with boats of all
sizes from the schooner to the skiff. Westward from Only, the
stream courses broad and shining between sloping banks, on
which, here and there, their greensward often coming down to
the water's edge, stood other homes, which looked smaller and
smaller in the distance. Far away, beyond a dim point of pines
marking the mouth of Onancock Creek, the sparkling whitecaps
of the bay are visible, with the sails of commerce passing up and
down or turning in and out of the entrance to the creek.</p>
        <p>On the beautiful November morning determined upon for
welcoming my father on his return to the United States,
relatives, neighbors, friends, clients, and political adherents
began to assemble at Only.</p>
        <p>Bright and early, activity was visible on the plantation.
Under the wide-spreading oaks, long tables were improvised,
<pb id="wise29" n="29"/>
covered with snowy linen, and groaning with everything
good to eat. At several points under the bluffs, pits were dug
where beeves and sheep and pigs were barbecued, and oysters
and clams and crabs and fish were cooked by the bushel. Great
hampers of food, sent from the village, or from the homes of
neighbors, stood about the tables, ready for distribution when
the feast should begin. The house itself, decorated with flowers
and evergreens, was thrown wide open to the guests, and in the
rooms of the first floor was spread a collation for the more
distinguished visitors.</p>
        <p>By eight o'clock in the morning, the earliest of the guests
hove in sight. By ten o'clock, the grandees of the county
began to arrive.</p>
        <p>There were Colonel Joynes, the county clerk, Lorenzo Bell,
the county attorney; the Arbuckles, the Custises the Finneys,
the Waples; the Corbins from near the Maryland line; the
Savages from Upshur's Neck; the Croppers from Bowman's Folly
on the seaside; the Kneads from Mount Prospect; the Upshurs
from Brownsville the Baylys from Mount Custis; and the
Yerbys, the Nottinghams the Goffigons the Kennards, and
Smiths from Northampton. But why enumerate? Their name was
legion. </p>
        <p>By midday the stables and stable-yards were filled; and
the horses, fastened to the front-yard fence, formed a continuous
line; while the creek about the grove was literally filled with
small craft ranging from canoe to “pungy,” and a steamboat
had arrived from Norfolk with a great company and a band of
music. This band, playing in the grove, was an endless source
of wonder and delight to many of the primitive people, who heard a brass band that
day for the first, and no doubt, in some instances
last time in their lives.</p>
        <pb id="wise30" n="30"/>
        <p>Within the house, father and mother held a long levee,
welcoming old friends, and stirred to their hearts depths by the
simple ovation of which they were the recipients.</p>
        <p>Without, under the shade of the trees, hundreds of visitors,
after paying their respects to the host and hostess, walked or
sat about and chatted with each other.</p>
        <p>We may be sure that not the least theme of their conversation
was politics; for not only was it in Virginia where
everybody talked politics everywhere, but it was just at the
period when Americans were carrying all before them in
Mexico, and the Whigs were about to elect old “Rough-and-
Ready,” and snatch political control from the Democracy. Nor
was there lack of party differences among the assembled
guests, to give spice to the discussions. Hot and heavy was
the argument between “Chatter Bill” Nottingham and 
“Monkey” Johnson, as to which national party was entitled to
the honors for the American triumph in the Mexican war. Everybody
had his nickname in these days.</p>
        <p>Colonel Robert Poulson, the county representative in the
legislature, had his group around him, as, red in face and
solemn of mien, he ventilated his views on the best method of
protecting the Virginia oyster-beds from Maryland poachers.
Captain Stephen Hopkins, the largest vessel-owner of the
county, had his admiring coterie, who insisted upon hearing
his opinion, which he gave modestly, as to the prospect of a
rise in the price of corn in the Baltimore market. Not far away, a
noisy group of youngsters were bantering each other as to the
respective merits of two saucy centreboard skiffs that rode
proudly near the shore, and it was not long before a race
between the Southerner and the Sea-Gull was a fixed event of
the future.</p>
        <p>As the day wore on, and when the multitude had been
<pb id="wise31" n="31"/>
fed, a movement from the house to the grove indicated that
something important was about to occur. The host and
hostess and the distinguished guests moved out to an
improvised platform under the oaks, and there began the
formal ceremonies of welcome.</p>
        <p>Colonel Joynes, the venerable county clerk, as of course,
called the gathering to order, when the stragglers had all
drawn near. Then came the introduction of a young fellow
from Hampton, afterwards somewhat known as a poet, who
read an original poem lauding Virginia and her honored son.
Then followed a brief address of welcome from young Bell.
And then father stood up, facing, for the first time after years
of absence, the people among whom he was born; the kin who
had loved him from his infancy; the constituency who had
made his brilliant career possible; the people who still had faith
in him, and had come so far to do him honor.</p>
        <p>It was an impressive scene. Restraining himself, and laboring
under the deep emotion such interest in himself was well
calculated to arouse, he drew his audience to him with the
simple speech which the skilled orator so well knows to be the
most effective at the outset. Then, gradually warming up to his
theme, he pictured the yearning of his heart for these old
scenes during his long exile in foreign lands; reviewed his work
abroad in the interest of humanity; his desire to see the
infamous slave trade abolished; his hope for some scheme by
which the curse of slavery might ultimately be removed
without wrong to the owner; his realization of the glorious
work accomplished by the Union arms in Mexico during his
absence; his deep sense that, with restored health and the youth
remaining to him, there was still much of his life's work before
him; his gratitude to God for this restoration to his
own people; his deep emotion at this evidence of their
<pb id="wise32" n="32"/>
continued trust; and his abiding faith in their further
confidence in him. He concluded with a brilliant and
genuine tribute of affection for a constituency so true and so
confiding. His audience were wrought into a burst of
thunderous applause, which was renewed and renewed as the
band played, “Carry Me Back to Old Virginia.”</p>
        <p>The formal ceremonies over, the visitors gradually dispersed,
and quiet reigned once more at Only.</p>
        <p>It is the death of that era  -  a death which begun with my
birth, and was complete before I attained manhood   -  that is to
be chronicled in the following pages.</p>

      <div1 type="chapter">
        <pb id="wise33" n="33"/>
        <head>CHAPTER IV</head>
        <head>MY MOTHER: FIRST LESSONS IN POLITICS</head>
        <p>THE autumn of 1850 brought an event freighted with deep
significance to me. My mother died. Although I was but four
years old, it made a profound impression, and it exercised an
incalculable influence upon my after life. My mother was a
Northern woman, daughter of Hon. John Sergeant,
a distinguished lawyer, and for many years representative in
Congress from Philadelphia. Her people were of New England
blood, identified with the earliest and most important events of
the Plymouth Colony.</p>
        <p>She had been taught to practice economy, simplicity, and
scrupulous neatness and order. She was deeply religious,
charitable, sympathetic, highly sentimental, and withal
ambitions. She was one of those beautiful, refined creatures
for which the City of Brotherly Love is famous. Hers was one
of those extraordinary natures whose physical comeliness
seems to make no injurious impression upon loveliness of
character. Indeed, both in herself and with those about her,
consideration of her appearance was subordinated to
appreciation of her moral and intellectual beauty.</p>
        <p>It was seven years after her marriage before she fully
realized the vast difference between the life in which she had
been reared and that into which her marriage had brought her.
For, prior to their departure for Brazil, father, being in
Congress, had resided for the most part in
<pb id="wise34" n="34"/>
Washington, and had no fixed establishment in Virginia. In
Brazil, social conditions had been strange to herself and
husband alike. It was only on my father's return from
Brazil  -  when the Virginia establishment was resumed  -
that she realized the vastly altered terms of her
existence. It is fortunate it was so. It gave time for her wifely
love to become fixed and deepened beyond disturbance; and
residence in Brazil undoubtedly took away the shock of
slavery as it existed at home. Coming now to a knowledge of
Virginia slavery, it was much less repulsive than it would
have been if she had been transplanted direct from
Philadelphia. Notwithstanding this gradual change, the
contrast was strong enough to make her fully realize the
difference between the duties and the pleasures of her new
home and those to which she had been accustomed in girlhood.
Of the society about her she had nothing to complain. The
good old people were of excellent social position, and
Philadelphia was their social rendezvous. Many of them were
acquaintances of her family. They were neighborly and
congenial enough, and the means of intercommunication were
excellent. One of lighter tastes, and less serious purpose and
sense of duty, could easily have found, in her new
surroundings, all the social enjoyment she desired, and
might have been, quite happy and free from care.</p>
        <p>But it was not so with the mistress of Only. She had too
much of the old Puritan blood in her to ignore the word 
“duty.” She adored her husband, and was as ambitious as
himself, which is saying a great deal. She knew that, if he
was to maintain his professional and political prominence,
she must assume her share of the duties of their domestic
life; and when she fully realized what the meant for her, she
doubted her ability to bear the burden it imposed; but,
asking God to sustain her, resolved to try.</p>
        <pb id="wise35" n="35"/>
        <p>With the abundance of servants at her command, the care of
her children was a task comparatively easy. But it was these
very servants who were the chief cause of her anxieties. They
were slaves. When she had consented to marry her husband,
she had not fully considered, perhaps, the difference between
conducting a Philadelphia household and being mistress of a
Virginia plantation. At the former place, an impudent or sick
or worthless servant might be discharged or sent to a hospital,
and the place supplied by another. Here, a discharge was
impossible. Beside the necessity for discipline, every
requirement, whether of food or clothing, or care in sickness,
had to be supplied to these forty servants, who were as
dependent as so many babies. In those days, slavery was not
looked upon, even in Quaker Philadelphia, with the shudder
and abhorrence one feels towards it now. It had not been a
great while since it existed in Pennsylvania. A few slaves were still
owned in Delaware, and Maryland and Virginia
were slave States. The time had come, it is true,
when it was abolished in Pennsylvania; but
its existence was a fact so familiar that it produced no
particular protest or expression of abhorrence, and, by all
save a small coterie of abolitionists, was regarded as
probably permanent. Slave-owners mingled with non-slave
owners upon terms of mutual regard and respect, unaffected,
apparently at least, by any consideration of the subject of
slavery.</p>
        <p>Even if my mother had no qualms of conscience concerning
ownership of negroes, her sense of duty carried her far
beyond the mere supplying of their physical needs, or
requiring that they render faithful service. Forty immortal
souls, as she viewed it, had been committed to her guidance.
Every time one of these gentle and affectionate creatures
called her “mistress,” the sense of obligation
<pb id="wise36" n="36"/>
resting upon her, to keep their souls as well as their
bodies fit for God, echoed back to her tender heart with
alarming distinctness. And in time, sweetly and humbly as
she performed her task, it became very irksome. She sleeps
to-day in Laurel Hill, on the banks of the Schuylkill, having
died at the early age of thirty-three, and no one knows how
much that sense of duty to her slaves contributed to her
death.</p>
        <p>Ah, you who blame the slaveholder of the olden day, how
little you know whereof you speak, or how he or she became
such; how little allowance you make for surrounding
circumstances; how little you reck, in your general
anathemas against the slave-owner, of the true and beautiful
and good lives that sacrificed themselves, toiling to do
their duty to the slaves in that state of life to which it
pleased God to call them! There is not a graveyard in Old
Virginia but has some tombstone marking the resting place
of somebody who accepted slavery as he or she found it, who
bore it as a duty and a burden, and who wore himself or
herself out in the conscientious effort to perform that duty
well. Mark you, I am not bemoaning the abolition of slavery.
It was a curse, and nobody knows better than I the terrible
abuses which were possible and actual under the system.
Thank God, it is gone.</p>
        <p>All that I am saying to you now is, you who fought slavery,
as well as you who have heard it described in the passionate
denunciations following its death, realize that the name of
slave-owner did not always, or even in the majority of cases,
imply that the slave-owner was one whit less conscientious,
one whit less humane, one whit less religious, or one whit less
entitled to man's respect or God's love, than you, who,
because, perhaps, you were never slave-owners, delight to
picture them as something
<pb id="wise37" n="37"/>
inferior to your precious selves. After all, it was not you, but
God that abolished slavery. You were his mere instruments
to do his work.</p>
        <p>In the case of my mother, her task was somewhat
lightened by the character of her possessions, for the slaves
were of more than usual intelligence, and were, for the most
part, family inheritances.</p>
        <p>This was no abode of hardship and stony hearts. No
slaves were sold from that plantation. The young ones might
have eaten their master's head off before he would have
taken money for their fathers' and their mothers' children.
No overseer brandished the whip that is so prominent a
feature upon the stage, or in the abolition books of fiction.</p>
        <p>Back to me, through the mists of nearly half a century,
comes once more the vision of the young Puritan mother, who
followed the man she loved into this exile from every
association of her youth, and yet was happy in that love
because she <sic corr="worshipped">worshiped</sic> him next to her God.</p>
        <p>Now I see her upon a Sabbath afternoon, with all her
slaves assembled in the hallway, dressed in their Sunday
clothes. Young and old, her own children and her servants,
are gathered about her to listen to the word of God.</p>
        <p>I have heard many great orators and preachers in my day,
but never a voice like that of my mother, as she read and
expounded the Holy Word to her children and her slaves.</p>
        <p>In later years, I have heard great voices and great melodies,
but never sweeter sounds to mortal ear than those of my
mother and her children and her slaves, singing the simple
hymns she read out to them on those Sabbath afternoons
at Only, in the days of slavery.</p>
        <p>Then came the lessons in the catechism taught to children
<pb id="wise38" n="38"/>
and slaves in the same class, where, before God, the two
stood upon equal terms, the blacks sometimes proving
themselves to be the quicker scholars of the two. </p>
        <p>Such was my childhood's home; and such was many
another home in that land which, year by year, is being; more
and more depicted by ignorance and prejudice as the abode
of only the brutal slave-driver and his victim.</p>
        <p>The beautiful month of October, 1850, with its wealth of
color and its exquisite skies, rolled round. All seemed well at
home. My father, once more immersed in political life, was
absent in Richmond, a delegate to a great constitutional
convention, where all his energies were directed towards
adjusting the true basis of representation in the legislature
between the sections of Virginia where slavery existed and
those where no slaves were owned. It was a difficult
question, on which he had taken ground in favor of a
manhood suffrage as opposed to suffrage based upon
representation of the property owners. Nearly every mail
brought letters to mother announcing the progress of the
fight, in which she seemed deeply absorbed. The reputation
which her husband was making resulted five years later in
his election as governor, and she clearly foresaw that result.
This prospect reconciled her to the separation, and made her
look bravely forward to an expected event.</p>
        <p>One day I missed my mother, and was told that she was
ill. Servants were hurrying back and forth, and soon the
doctor arrived. Bedtime came, and Eliza, the white nurse,
took me away from the nursery adjoining my mother's
chamber, and put me to bed in a strange room. There, after
undressing me, she made me kneel and, in saying my
prayers, ask God to bless mamma. When I was tucked away
in bed, she sat beside me, and
<pb id="wise39" n="39"/>
stroked my long tresses, and sighed. It was all very strange. 
“Mammy Liza, is mamma very sick?” I asked. “No, my child,
I hope not,” said she, and then bade me go to sleep, and soon
I closed my eyes.</p>
        <p>It was not for long, for in an hour or two I heard voices in
the hall, and hurrying footsteps, and, awakening and sitting
bolt upright in bed awhile, I finally slipped down to the floor,
and made my way, in my thin nightclothes, into the hall,
where I found the servants assembled, and weeping as if
their hearts would break, uttering loud lamentations. 
“What is it, Aunt Mary Anne?” said I, cold, and shivering with
fright. “Oh, my po' baby, yo' mamma is dead,  -  yo' mamma is
dead! Oh my po', po' mistis is dead  -  dead  -  dead!” she
screamed, at the same time seizing me, and wrapping me in
her shawl, and bearing me back to the warmth.</p>
        <p>Night wore away mournfully enough, until at last, with a
faithful slave beside me, I sobbed myself asleep, crying more
because others about me wept, than because I knew the real
cause for my grief. Morning came, and when I awoke, I could
not yet fully understand the solemn silence of all about me,
or the meaning of the strange black things I saw. Breakfast
over, the old nurse came to me to go with her and see
mamma. In silence, and amid the sobs of every servant on
the place, I and my little brother and sister were led into a
darkened room. There on the bamboo bedstead which she
had brought as her favorite from Rio, lay mamma,
apparently asleep, a tiny baby resting on her breast. By her
side, his head buried in the pillow, and sobbing as if his
heart would break, was my oldest brother,  -  not her own
child, but one who had loved her as his own mother, and who
now mourned a second mother dead. Gazing out of the half-opened
window, dressed in solemn black, stood the physician
who had
<pb id="wise40" n="40"/>
sought in vain to save her. I was frightened and awed beyond
utterance.</p>
        <p>The next day the Fashion, Captain Hopkins's best vessel,
lay to at the Only landing. A fearful-looking black box
covered with velvet was borne aboard the Planter with
solemn steps. Her sails were hoisted. With the freshening
breeze she bore away, and, as the evening sunlight made a
shining pathway on Onancock Creek, the vessel pursued her
course westward until she became a tiny speck and
disappeared. They told me that my mother was in heaven.
Since that day, whenever the route to heaven arises to my
mind, I see the white sails of a vessel gliding westward in
the golden pathway made upon dancing waters by the
brilliant sinking sun of a clear autumn evening.</p>
        <p>The home-coming of father, some weeks after this sad
event, was pitiful indeed.</p>
        <p>He had been advised of my mother's death by a
messenger, who rode forty miles down the Peninsula, crossed
the bay to Norfolk, and thence telegraphed to Richmond.
Such were the difficulties of communication, even at that
recent date. When the news first reached him, the body was
on its way to Baltimore, and thither he repaired to meet it,
and accompany it to its last resting-place. After this, he had
been compelled to return to his duties in the convention at
Richmond, a widowed relative having meanwhile assumed
charge of his family, and holding them together until he
could return.</p>
        <p>In the darkness of a drizzling winter evening, after a long,
cheerless ride, he drew near his desolate home. A chill
nor'easter storm, which had lasted for two days, made the
passage across the Chesapeake, in the stuffy little
steamboat Monmouth, exceedingly disagreeable. The few
friends he met at the wharf expressed their sympathy 
<pb id="wise41" n="41"/>
more by subdued speech and close grasp of the hand
than in actual utterance. A storm-stained gunner, clad in
oilcloth, who had just made his landing from his goose-blind
to ship his game to market, came up to the carriage and
handed in, as tribute of his interest, a beautiful brace of
brant. As he shook the rain from his tarpaulin, remarking
that it was a great day for shooting, he uttered no word of
consolation; but his manner and his act were as delicately
suggestive of his reasons as if he had been bred to the
manners of a court.</p>
        <p>Although the vehicle sent for father was amply supplied
with curtains, aprons, and robes, the rain beat in upon him
as he drove facing the storm, its cool moisture not ungrateful
to his fevered cheek. Ordinarily, the homeward ride on such
occasions was relieved by cheerful conversation between
master and man concerning domestic matters and the
progress of farm work. To-night, the weeds of mourning and
the sunken cheek and eye had awed the faithful slave into
respectful silence, which the master seldom saw fit to break.
Homeward they sped in silence, with little to vary the
monotonous pitapat of Lady Ringtail's hoofs in the shallow
pools with which the storm had filled the level roads.</p>
        <p>He lay back with folded arms and half-closed eyes,
resentfully brooding upon the hard fate which had twice
made him a widower. At a turn of the road they passed a
silver maple, whose faultless form and beautiful coloring in
springtime and in autumn had so excited the admiration of
his wife that the children had named it “mamma's tree.” It
was leafless and bare to-night. A scurrying blast, shaking it
as they passed, blew down from it a shower of raindrops, as
if in mockery.</p>
        <p>At the outer farm-gate the driver alighted, and, as father
walked the mare slowly through the open gate, he
<pb id="wise42" n="42"/>
caught sight of the twinkling light which shone from the
chamber where mother had died. It had ever been a beacon to
him in days gone by. There, many a day, had she sat and
watched for his return; and many a night had she drawn back
the curtain that he might see her signal first of all. The sight
of it had always warmed his heart. Now, he almost shuddered at the thought of;
returning home. As they entered the yard, and drove around the circle leading to the doorstep, he turned his face
away from her terraced garden, only to look upon the arbor,
where, in days gone by, she had delighted to sit and watch the
sunsets.</p>
        <p>Before the vehicle drew up at the door, news of the father's
and the master's arrival had spread through all of the
household. Wide open flew the doors, and down the steps,
bareheaded and heedless of rain or wind, we children rushed,
shouting “Papa  -  papa  -  papa!” and springing into his
arms with rapturous kisses. One by one we were snatched
and hugged and kissed, and pushed backwards up the steps,
with orders to run in out of the rain, while he busied himself
for a moment giving directions concerning his luggage and
the care of Lady Ringtail.</p>
        <p>Poor little ones! How insensible they were to the great
calamity that had befallen them! How little they realized
his loss or their own! In the short weeks since our mother's
death,  -  weeks filled with deep affliction to him,   -  our
mourning-clothes had become familiar to us; our kind old
aunt had taken mother's place in all our thoughts and for all
our wants; our mamma was only a beautiful vision of the
past. We laughed and romped, and greeted papa with joyous
faces; unconscious alike that we had cause for sorrow, or that
his heart was bleeding afresh at sight of us.</p>
        <pb id="wise43" n="43"/>
        <p>The welcome awaiting him within was different from the
joyous babble of the little ones outside. There, almost
dreading to meet him, was the half-grown daughter of his
first marriage. She was old enough to know and feel what a
deep, irreparable loss had come upon her just when she most
needed the love and care and guidance of the one now dead.
It was not, and yet it was, her own mother that had died.
And there was the tender-hearted woman who had come to
keep together his little flock until his return. She had truly
loved his wife, and now, herself a widow, she had seen him
twice bereft.</p>
        <p>As these two twined their arms about him, and buried
their faces upon his shoulder sobbing, the prattling
motherless children paused in their merriment to wonder
why their grief should give itself new vent upon an occasion
so joyous as papa's return.</p>
        <p>But let us not dwell longer upon a scene so mournful.</p>
        <p>Before leaving Richmond, father had written home
directing that a chamber should be prepared for himself as
far as possible from his former apartment. He could not
brook the thought of living surrounded by the familiar
objects of her chamber. Although he had been much absent
of late, and much engrossed in other ambitions, he was a
man devoted to his family, and deeply interested in his
home. He knew, whenever he reflected upon the facts, that
his apparent neglect of these duties of late was because of
political objects he could not abandon, and that his course
had been taken with his wife's approval; but ever and anon
the thought came back to him that she had been alone when
she died, and, in spite of all philosophy, the memory of that
lonely death distressed if it did not actually chide him. He
determined that, even at the sacrifice of ambition, he would
henceforth devote himself to the duties he owed to his
children and his home, and
<pb id="wise44" n="44"/>
make to her memory the atonement for what he could not
help regarding as neglect of her when she lived.</p>
        <p>To this resolution I was indebted for four or five of the very
happiest years of my life. To this day, my fancy takes me
back to that great chamber where father made me his
bedfellow and constant companion; to that high tester
bedstead where, many a night, tucked away amid
comfortable linen, I watched the great hickory logs flicker
and sputter upon the andirons, and closed my eyes, at last,
lulled by the never-ceasing scratching of father's goose-quill
pen at a great writing-table in the centre of the room; to the
delightful half-consciousness of being folded in his arms
when, late in the night, he joined me, and hugged me to his
heart.</p>
        <p>We were early risers, we two chums and companions. By
daybreak, the servant came in and built a roaring fire. By
sunrise, father and I were dressed, and out upon the farm, or
at the stables or the cowpens, followed by Boxer and Frolic,
our Irish terriers. The fashionable folk of to-day affect the
Irish terrier, and imagine that they have a new breed. Father
had a brace of them over forty years ago, and they were sure
death to the rabbits of Only. Many and many a day we came
back to breakfast with one, two, or three molly-cottontails
caught by Boxer and Frolic in our morning excursions upon
the farm.</p>
        <p>Then there was hog-killing time, when, long before day,
the whole plantation force was up with knives for killing,
and seething cauldrons for scalding, and great doors for
scraping, and long racks for cooling the slaughtered swine.
Out to the farmyard rallied all the farm hands. Into the pens
dashed the boldest and most active. Harrowing was the
squealing of the victims; quick was the stroke that slew
them, and quicker the sousing of the dead hog into the
scalding water; busy the scraping of
<pb id="wise45" n="45"/>
his hair away; strong the arms that bore him to the beams,
and hung him there head downward to cool; clumsy the old
woman who brought tubs to place under him; deft the strong
hands that disemboweled him. And so it went. By the time
the sun was risen, how bare and silent were the pens where
hogdom had fed and grunted for so long a time!</p>
        <p>How marvelous to youthful eyes the long rows of
cleanscraped hogs upon the racks; how cheerful the blazing
fires and boiling pots, and how sweet the smell of the hickory
smoking in the cold air of daybreak; how merry and how
happy seemed every one upon the place, old and young, men
and women, girls and boys, in the midst of this carnival of
death and grease! Up with the earliest, I was one of the
busiest men in all the company,  -  now frying a pig-tail upon
the blazing coals beneath the scalding-pots; now claiming a
bladder to be blown up for Christmas; now watching the
wonderful process of cleansing, or lard-making, or sausage-grinding.
My! what tenderloins and spare-ribs were on the
breakfast-table! my! how, for a fortnight after hog-killing,
what sausages and cracklin, and all sorts of meat, we had!
The skin of every darkey on the place shone with hog's
grease, like polished ebony; and even Boxer and Frolic grew
so fat they lost their interest in rabbit-hunting.</p>
        <p>Then came the lovely springtime, when the ploughing
began, and I followed him about the farm until my poor
little legs were ready to give way beneath me. And the great
red-breasted robins and purple grackle lit in the new-
ploughed ground, from which such sweet aroma rose. And
the golden plover, sweeping past, fell to father's unerring
gun, I scrambling after them through the crumbling loam.</p>
        <p>Then followed the harvest time, when birds'-nests and
<pb id="wise46" n="46"/>
young hares were in the stubble, and when the children rode
upon the straw-loads. And the summer days, when father
took me sailing in the Lucy Long, and sea-trout fishing at
the lighthouse, or built and rigged and sailed for me such
boats as no other boy ever had!</p>
        <p>After that came the autumn time, when my uncle, a
famous Nimrod, appeared with dog and gun, and taught me
the mysteries of quail-shooting, so that I could tell how
Blanco the setter stood, and how Bembo the pointer backed,
and how Shot retrieved, and talked about these things like a
veteran sportsman.</p>
        <p>And there, also, was our annual visit, in charge of Eliza,
the white nurse, to our grandmother in far-off Philadelphia.
This was the period of good behavior and restraint, neither of
which I always practiced; and, as I viewed it, it bore hard
upon my other engagements. A short city residence was not
altogether distasteful to me; but there were so many horses
to ride, and so many boats to sail, and so many dogs to work,
and so many fish to catch, and so many things to do at Only,
that I looked on the Philadelphia trip as time wasted from
more entrancing employments. I felt that I was growing
rapidly, and that there were a great many things which I
might grow past, if I did not keep going all the while; and
thus it was that at seven years old I was regarded as what
we call an enterprising youth.</p>
        <p>Nor was I too young to detect that there were marked
differences between methods of life and thought at home,
and those which prevailed in Philadelphia.</p>
        <p>My mother's family, especially the dear old grandmother,
to whom my mother's death had been a great blow, were
exceedingly kind, and did everything to make the visits
enjoyable; but there was a something in their treatment of
us little orphans which approached to patronizing
<pb id="wise47" n="47"/>
and, young as I was, my pride rebelled against the
idea that any one could condescend towards us.</p>
        <p>One day, when I heard an aunt refer to me as her “little
savage,” I grew furiously angry; and another day, when the
white servant referred to me as a slave-owner, I let her
understand that I did not own a slave who was not her
superior in every quality, good manners and good looks
included. These were only episodes in what were otherwise,
on the whole, very happy visits; but, young as I was, I early
learned that between the people of my father's and my
mother's home there was brewing a feeling of deep and
irreconcilable antagonism, the precise nature of which I
could not altogether comprehend.</p>
        <p>As early as the autumn of 1862, I was made very happy by
being sent to school. As was the case in almost every section
of the South, the village school-teacher at Onancock was a
Northern man. My brother Richard, three years older than
myself, was my companion. We were furnished with red-topped
boots, red neckerchiefs, warm overcoats, warm caps
with coverings for the ears, and tin luncheon-pails, and never
were we more elated than on our first triumphal march to
Onancock, a mile away. As we passed the farmyards and the
fields where our old friends the slaves were at work, many
were the cheery words spoken to us.</p>
        <p>“Dat's right,” said saucy Solomon; “I spec' you'll be as
big a man as Mars' Henry hisself when you is done school.”</p>
        <p>“You'd better not pass through Mr. Tyler's yard. He's got a
pow'ful fierce dog,” shouted Joshua.</p>
        <p>And the last thing said by old George Douglas, who was
something of a tease, was, “Don't you let none of them
Onancock boys lick you, for you comes of fightin' stock.”</p>
        <pb id="wise48" n="48"/>
        <p>Thus began our education, and a good beginning it was; for
we were blessed with a conscientious teacher, school at a
healthy distance, and at once entered the class with a red-headed
girl, clever as she could be, with whom I fell in love,
and who put me to my trumps every day to
keep her from “cutting me down” in the spelling-class.</p>
        <p>Thus passed away the happy days of childhood,  -  days
unlike those which come to any boy anywhere nowadays;
days belonging to a phase of civilization and a manner of life
which are as extinct as if they had never existed.</p>
        <p>Yet in those times, but nine years before war and
emancipation came, there was no thought that either was
near at hand. My brother and I, on our return from school,
were put across the creek at Onancock wharf. One sunny
evening, we found father at old Captain Hopkins's store at
the wharf, the spot where the village post office was kept. He
had been rowed up to the village in his yawl, the
Constitution, and was waiting to take us home with him.
The mail had just arrived, and an eager throng was listening
to the news of the presidential election. The old captain
read the returns, which told that Franklin Pierce was to be
the next President, and the crowd cheered vociferously.
Father was called upon for a speech, and briefly expressed
his gratification at the result. The thing which most struck
my ear was father's congratulation of his friends that the
election of Pierce set at rest all fears as to slavery and
secession, or concerning
the abolitionists. He told how Pierce, being a Northern
man, must prove acceptable to the North; and how, being
sound upon the slavery question, his administration would
allay the fears of the slave-owner, and quiet the threats of
secessionists. Everybody agreed that this was so, and
everybody hurrahed for Pierce and King; and, as the
Constitution rushed homeward on the placid waters,
<pb id="wise49" n="49"/>
under the strokes of two sable oarsmen, I puzzled myself to
guess what were the fears of the slaveholder, and what were
the threats of the secessionist, and who were the
abolitionists.</p>
        <p>Now, I was a young gentleman who, when athirst for
knowledge, held not back. Accordingly, I opened my inquiries
in a series of questions, and received answers much after
the following order:  -  </p>
        <p>“What are the fears of the slaveholder?”</p>
        <p>“Why, my son, there is a small number of fanatics in the
North who demand that slavery be abolished immediately,
and the slaveholders are apprehensive of them.”</p>
        <p>“What is a fanatic, and what is an abolitionist?”</p>
        <p>“A fanatic is a wild enthusiast, who will listen to nothing
which interferes with his demands; and an abolitionist is
one who demands that the slaves shall be freed.”</p>
        <p>“Are there many people of that kind in the North?”</p>
        <p>“Yes; more than we know about.”</p>
        <p>“Is Pierce that sort of man? ”</p>
        <p>“Oh, no. He is not in favor of freeing the slaves.”</p>
        <p>“Well, now I know what the slaveholder fears, tell me
next what is the threat of the secessionist.”</p>
        <p>“Young man, you listen too closely. Secession means that
a State, like our Virginia, being dissatisfied with the way
the Union is managed, would withdraw from the Union, and
establish an independent government of her own, or form a
new one with other States which withdrew with her.
Secessionists are men who threaten to do that.”</p>
        <p>I paused a minute, and thought over all this; then, looking
up, said:  -  </p>
        <p>“Well, if we secede, we shall not be the United States any
more, shall we?”</p>
        <pb id="wise50" n="50"/>
        <p>“No.”</p>
        <p>“And if we shall not be the United States anymore, we
shall not have the stars and stripes for our flag, and the Old
Constitution and the Columbia frigates won't
belong to us any more, will they?”</p>
        <p>“No, not if we secede.”</p>
        <p>“Well, now, papa, don't let's secede. No, sir; don't let's
secede. You are not for secession, are you, papa? Think of
what a horrible thing it would be to give up the
government grandpa and General Washington made, and
the flag, and the ships, and all that, and start another thing
all new, without any history or anything. You are not a
secessionist, I know, because you said you were not. Are
you, papa?”</p>
        <p>“No, no, my boy. Far from it. Nobody loves the Union
better than I do. Nobody has better cause to love and
honor and cherish it. I was reared in the home of a
grandfather who fought for it by the side of Washington; I
was taught from my earliest infancy to venerate the flag of
the Union. My manhood, at home and abroad, has been
dedicated to its service; and God grant that the Union may
never be rent asunder in my day by the fanaticism of the
North or the passion of the South. Heaven be praised, the
election of Mr. Pierce seems to put at rest all fears on that
score from any direction.”</p>
        <p>We were nearing the landing. The autumn sun had sunk
into the distant bay. The long shadows of the grove at Only
were thrown towards us across the pooly waters. Earth,
air, and sky were bathed in the glories of an Italian sunset,
as these fervid words fell from father's lips; and never in all
his life had he spoken more eloquently or more truly. What
he had said soothed and comforted me, to whom the
thought of the possibility that Virginia could be aught but
part of the
<pb id="wise51" n="51"/>
American Union, or that we might lose the American
flag, had never come before.</p>
        <p>Thus it was that I learned my first lesson in politics and
was well and firmly assured that that could not possibly
happen which did actually happen within the next nine
years.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER V</head>
        <head>THE KNOW-NOTHING CAMPAIGN AND LIFE IN RICHMOND</head>
        <p>DURING the next three years, we had things pretty much
our own way at home, as far as female control was concerned.
The dear old aunt who presided over father's household,
although we loved her very much, was too indulgent to be a
successful manager of children; and while Eliza, the Irish
nurse, was firm and strong enough, we were rapidly growing
beyond her control.</p>
        <p>Then there was my aunt's son, a most attractive fellow, just
entering upon manhood,  -  a thorough-paced childspoiler. It
was no uncommon thing for him to take me to the county seat,
or the neighboring villages, where, while he pursued his
amusements, I found companions and playmates that were
improving neither to manners nor ideals of life. The association
was delightful, nevertheless. On these excursions, there was
no whim of fancy which that partial young relative was not
more than ready to gratify. Our attachment was lifelong, and in
after years the deep and abiding interest of my old-bachelor
cousin in all that concerned me never abated until he died. At
home, I had a thousand things to make boyhood happy. With
the grown-up slaves I was a great favorite; and, as was often
the case in plantation life, the little darkeys near my own age
were my playmates and companions, and accepted me as their
natural leader and chief. By the time I was eight years old, I
could shoot, and ride, and fish, and swim, and sail a boat; I had
a yoke of yearling
<pb id="wise53" n="53"/>
oxen broken by myself; my own punt in which to go fishing;
fishing-lines and crab-nets; a dog and a colt; and had become a
breeder of most prolific chickens. Nothing pleased me more
than dropping corn in planting-time, or hauling wood and straw
with my own team. For months at a time I would go barefoot,
during the summer season, dressed in brown linen and a straw
hat. All this laid in a store of health and strength that was of
great value in after years. In truth, I was a most bustling,
energetic lad with no end of vitality, but lacked the parental
government and care of a mother; and it was a blessed day for
me when my father married again.</p>
        <p>My father's third wife was a refined and cultivated woman, of
suitable age, and possessed a most lovable disposition. It was
not long before she established her dominion in our
household,  -  a dominion of love.</p>
        <p>I was taught to observe meal-times; to appear with hair
brushed and face and hands washed; to attend family prayers;
to spend less time at the negro quarters; to account more
precisely for my nomadic wanderings; to devote regular hours
to studies; and in many ways to adopt much more orderly
methods than I had been accustomed to pursue of late. All
which came in good time, for I was soon to become a city boy.</p>
        <p>In 1855, a great political contest occurred in Virginia. A
faction known as the Know-Nothing party, or the American
party, had sprung up suddenly, and had triumphed in a
number of the Northern States. It was a secret organization,
with oaths and grips and passwords. Its rallying cry was that
Americans should rule America. Incidental to this watchword
was a real or fancied hostility to foreigners, particularly the
Irish, and to the Catholic Church. Until it reached Virginia, it
had been successful everywhere. Father believed in the
teachings of
<pb id="wise54" n="54"/>
George Washington that secret political organizations were
dangerous to republican liberty, and in the teachings of
Thomas Jefferson that no man should be proscribed on
account of his religion. He maintained that neither Irish
men nor other foreigners should be oppressed or ostracized
by reason of their religious faith or their nationality.</p>
        <p>The result of the approaching conflict seemed exceedingly
doubtful when he was chosen as the Democratic candidate
for governor of Virginia. The circumstances of his selection
were not altogether flattering or hopeful. Many of his
political associates preferred him as the man in their
opinion best fit to make the desperate fight, but there were
others who preferred him because they believed the struggle
was hopeless and secretly desired his defeat. He accepted
the nomination; and although, at the outset, the Know-
Nothing party had an enrolled majority of ten thousand of
the entire voters of the State, he entered upon one of the
most remarkable campaigns in Virginia politics, and after a
brilliant canvass was elected by ten thousand majority.</p>
        <p>It is seldom a boy nine years old is deeply interested in
politics, but this campaign was one that enlisted the
intense enthusiasm of young and old.</p>
        <p>In American politics, we have recurring periods of political
“crazes.” Of late years we have witnessed several
such. The Greenback craze, the Granger craze, the Silver
craze, have each in its turn arisen, and, for the time being,
made whole communities drunk with excitement. Friends
of many years are estranged by these ephemeral issues.
They are carried into business, into church, into the
household, everywhere, until entire commonwealths are so
wrought up that even women and children take part until
election day, and after that we hear no more about them.
Such commotions are like brushfires,
<pb id="wise55" n="55"/>
which, igniting instantly, burn and crackle and fill the
whole heavens with smoke, as if the world was on fire, and
then die out as suddenly as they sprung up.</p>
        <p>The Know-Nothing craze of 1855 was just such an
excitement. Our community was divided into factions.
Everybody took sides. Men who had never been known to
show an active interest in politics became intense partisans,
and political discussion went on everywhere. One of the first
results experienced by me was a black eye and a bloody nose,
received in a hard fight with the son of the village
blacksmith. Exactly how the row began, neither of us could
clearly explain; but we were on opposite sides, and that was
sufficient. It was a drawn battle, for the blacksmith
interfered, having no intention of losing a valuable trade by
reason of political differences. In the little village of
Onancock, the rival organizations found vent for their
enthusiasm by building and flying two immense kites, with
the names of their respective party candidates emblazoned
on them conspicuously. Many an evening, after school was
dismissed, I saw half of the villagers of the place out on the
green flying their Know-Nothing and Democratic kites, as if
the result depended upon which flew the highest.</p>
        <p>In due course came election day. Father being absent, the
young cousin above referred to represented him at the
polling-place, and took me with him. In those days, voting
was done openly, or <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">viva voce</foreign></hi>, as it was called, and
not by ballot. The election judges, who were magistrates, sat
upon a bench with their clerks before them. Where
practicable, it was customary for the candidate to be present
in person, and to occupy a seat at the side of the judges. As
the voter appeared, his name was called out in a loud voice.
The judges inquired, “John Jones (or Bill Smith), for whom
do you vote?”  -  for governor, or
<pb id="wise56" n="56"/>
for whatever was the office to be filled. He replied by
proclaiming the name of his favorite. Then the clerks
enrolled the vote, and the judges announced it as enrolled.
The representative of the candidate for whom he voted arose,
bowed, and thanked him aloud; and his partisans often
applauded.</p>
        <p>All day long I sat upon my cousin's knee, or played about
the platform. Nobody smiled more broadly, or applauded
more vigorously, at votes cast for father; and nobody was
more silent or haughty when votes were cast against him. At
sundown, the polls were closed, and, to my infinite
mortification, the majority at the precinct was announced as
in favor of the Know-Nothings. The craze had simply taken
possession of the place and run away with it. The ignorant
and the vain had all been captured by the signs and grips
and secret passwords of Know-Nothingism. For the first time
in his life, father was defeated at his home. I thought we
were done for. When we were safely bundled in the vehicle,
and headed for home, I felt like crying, and the Know-Nothing
cheers still rung in my ears most depressingly. What
mortified me most of all was the fact that I knew of a
bantering compact between the owners of the rival kites that
the victorious party should own the kite of the vanquished,
with the privilege of flying it tailless and upside down. The
thought of seeing our beloved kite in such ignominious plight
nearly prostrated me. As a matter of fact, the result at this
precinct had been fully anticipated by the grown folks, and
gave them no serious concern as to the general result. The
Know-Nothing majority was really less than they had
claimed. Seeing how I was cast down, my cousin, holding me
between his legs in the one-seated buggy, endeavored to
explain that there was no cause for alarm. Long before he
finished, he discovered
<pb id="wise57" n="57"/>
that, worn out by the fatigue and disappointment of the day,
I was fast asleep, and in that condition he bore me into the
house in his arms, laid me on the broad settee in the hall,
and covered me with the lap-robe.</p>
        <p>More cheering news from other places came thick and fast
in the next few days, and it was not long before I was
delightedly watching the Know-Nothing kite sailed tailless
and upside down by father's friends.</p>
        <p>Then came the preparations for removal of our residence
to Richmond for four years.</p>
        <p>No life could have been more in contrast with that at Only
than the one to which I was now introduced. January 1, 1856,
father took the oath of office as governor, and we proceeded
to establish ourselves in the Government House, as it was
called.</p>
        <p>It is a fine old structure, simple in exterior, very capacious,
surrounded by pleasant grounds, fronting the Capitol Square at
Richmond. The house at Only seemed like a wren-box contrasted
with this great residence. With play-grounds, and stables, and
conservatory, and outhouses, it was indeed a most attractive
place. Young gentlemen nine years of age are not apt to
underestimate their own importance in such a situation, and I
was no exception to this rule. The legislature was in session in
the Capitol, and as a large majority of the members were in
political sympathy with father, I received a great deal more
attention and petting from them than was good for me. My
bump of reverence never was over-developed, and under the
influence of this sort of thing, I rapidly became very pert. But
there were other directions in which I did not find life “all beer
and skittles.”</p>
        <p>A school was selected where, beside a decided lack of
enthusiasm for any school, I found this particular one not
altogether a bed of roses. Being the best school obtainable,
<pb id="wise58" n="58"/>
it was attended by the sons of the most prominent
people of the place. And therein lay the trouble. If their
fathers' views had controlled the election of governor, our
residence at Only would have been undisturbed. The city
was the stronghold of Know-Nothingism in Virginia. In a
vote of nearly four thousand, father had not received
exceeding nine hundred votes, and they were for the most
part from the humbler classes. The Richmond Democrats
were so few in numbers that they were called the “Spartan
Band.” The rural votes gave father his majority, especially
in the splendid yeomanry of the Shenandoah Valley, among
whom very few slaves were owned. They were the men who
afterwards, drawn into the war to fight the slave-owners'
battles, won with their valor the immortal fame of
Stonewall Jackson.</p>
        <p>Father had notions about manhood suffrage, public
schools, the education and the elevation of the masses, and
the gradual emancipation of the slaves, that did not suit
the uncompromising views of people in places like
Richmond. It was the abode of that class who proclaimed
that they were Whigs, and that “Whigs knew each other by
the instincts of gentlemen.” The slave market was a
flourishing institution in Richmond, fully countenanced if
not approved and defended. The majority of Richmond
people hated the name of Democracy, and, almost always
defeated by it, were willing to unite with the Know-Nothings
or any other party to defeat their enemy the
Democracy.</p>
        <p>At school, I very soon discovered that the Richmond city
boys were disposed to turn up their noses at me, not only as
a country boy, but because I was my father's son. I had
several fistic encounters with them, and after that things
went on more smoothly, but not very pleasantly.</p>
        <p>There never was such a place as Richmond for fighting
<pb id="wise59" n="59"/>
among small boys. The city is built over a number of hills
and valleys, and in those days the boys of particular
localities associated in fighting bands, and called
themselves Cats. Thus there were the Shockoe Hill Cats,
the Church Hill Cats, the Basin Cats, the Oregon Hill Cats,
the Navy Hill Cats, etc.</p>
        <p>About this time we were seized with the military fever. In
those days, the State of Virginia had a large armory at
Richmond, and a standing army of a hundred men! The
command was known as the “Public Guard,” but the
Richmond boys called them the “Blind Pigs.” The syllogism
by which this name was reached was unanswerable. They
wore on their hats the letters P. G., which certainly is P I G
without the I. And a pig without an eye is a blind pig. Q E D.</p>
        <p>The public guard was as well drilled and oared for as any
body of regulars in the United States army. It guarded the
penitentiary and public grounds, and was a most valuable
organization in many ways.</p>
        <p>Captain Dimmock, commanding officer, was a West
Pointer, I think, and the beau ideal of a soldier. His son
Marion and my brother, three years my senior, conceived the
idea of forming a boy's soldier company. Father encouraged
the idea, and caused a hundred old muskets in the armory
to be cut down to the proper size for boys. Captain Dimmock
entered heartily into the scheme. The boys were drilled
assiduously. Their uniform was neat cadet gray; and for
several years the “Guard of the Metropolis” was one of the
most striking institutions of Richmond. It always paraded
with the Public Guard, and the precision of its drill
astonished and delighted all beholders. Seven years later,
William Johnson Pegram, the first lieutenant of that
company, attained the rank of brigadier-general in Lee's
army before he was twenty-one
<pb id="wise60" n="60"/>
years old, and although killed in battle, is still remembered as
one of the bravest and most brilliant artillery commanders of
the civil war. Many other members were utilized as drill-masters
at the outbreak of the war, and subsequently became excellent
officers.</p>
        <p>Too young to carry a musket, I was made marker of this
famous company, and was as proud of my uniform and little
marker's flag as a Frenchman of the Cross of the Legion of
Honor.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER VI</head>
        <head>BEHIND THE SCENES</head>
        <p>THE present generation finds it difficult to realize the
position in the Union occupied by Virginia, even as late as
1856-60, to which period our narrative now brings us. People
recall, in a general way, that Virginia was once the theatre of
many historic events; that she gave birth to many great men in
the early days of the Republic; and that she was the chief
battle-ground in the civil war.</p>
        <p>A romantic interest attaches to her in consequence, and
there is a certain tenderness for Virginia felt towards no other
State, even in sections which were once arrayed against her.</p>
        <p>But from many causes, a decline in her social and political
importance has occurred within the last forty years, which, in
its rapidity and in its extent, presents one of the most
remarkable instances in history. Let us not stamp it as
degeneracy. The day when she produced men of the type of
Lee and Jackson is too recent to justify despair.</p>
        <p>It is made doubly difficult to judge her by the character of
the writings concerning her. On the one hand, we have
extravagant eulogiums and fond laments of those who laud
her old-time history and people, and admit no defects in them;
on the other, the always unfair and often ignorant
denunciations of the anti-slavery folk, who are unwilling to
admit, even at this late day, that any good could come out of
the Nazareth of slavery. Both are wide of the mark. The social
and economic conditions
<pb id="wise62" n="62"/>
of Virginia were neither utopian, as the one loves to
depict, nor bad and vicious, as the other would
represent them.</p>
        <p>It is undeniably true that, between the two extremes
of society, as it existed there prior to 1865, was an
awful gulf, upon one side of which were green pastures
and still waters, and on the other noisome bogs filled
with creeping reptiles. It was a condition incompatible
with every theory of republican equality among men,
and beyond question repugnant to the ideas and
sensibilities of free communities.</p>
        <p>Whether what has followed will ultimately result in a
better civilization is as yet far from settled; but
whether for better or for worse, it is certain that a
social, economic, and political earthquake, never
surpassed in suddenness and destructive force, burst
upon that people, working changes that have left little
trace of what was there before.</p>
        <p>If the Virginian who died forty years ago could revisit
his native commonwealth, he would find it difficult to
recognize the place where he lived. If he located it by
the streams which still flow to the sea, and the
mountains still standing as sentinels through the
centuries, he would soon learn, even concerning these,
that many are no longer landmarks of Virginia, but,
snatched from her in the hour of her weakness against
her will, are now possessions of an alien State. For the
less enduring things,  -  for men such as he knew, for
their very habitations, their mode of life, the fashion of
thought of his day, for its wealth, its refinement, its
culture, for its lofty incorruptibility and high-mindedness,  
-  he would search sadly and in vain.</p>
        <p>In the day of which I write, Virginia, among the
States of the Union, was, in territorial area, second
only to
<pb id="wise63" n="63"/>
Texas. Her western boundary was the Ohio River;
northward, her Panhandle projected high up between Ohio
and Pennsylvania. Her wealth made her credit at home
and abroad above question. Her bonds sold higher in
New York and London than those of the federal
government. Her political importance placed her sons
in commanding positions in the cabinet, on the bench,
and as representatives to many important foreign
governments. In every national assemblage her voice
was hearkened to as that of a potent and conservative
and reliable guide.</p>
        <p>Richmond was admittedly the centre of a society
unsurpassed in all America for wealth, refinement, and
culture. Nearly every distinguished foreigner felt that
his view of America was incomplete unless he spent
some time in the capitol of the Mother of States and
Statesmen. Soldiers, authors, sculptors, artists,
actors, and statesmen sought Richmond then as
surely as to-day they visit New York and Boston.</p>
        <p>The actual population of the city was small. It is difficult
to realize that in 1860 Richmond had but thirty-eight
thousand inhabitants. But the truth is, that its real constituency
was much greater; for it was the assembling-point
of a large class of wealthy persons who resided on
their plantations upon the upper and lower James, and 
in Piedmont, Tidewater, and the South Side.</p>
        <p>It is not uncommon nowadays to see references to
Southern society of that period as uncultured, and
rather sensual than intellectual in its tastes. This
historic falsehood, like many others assiduously told
for a long time, may find permanent lodgment in the
belief of the future. No statement was ever more
unjust. With inherited wealth, with abundant leisure,
with desire to excel in directing thought, and to attain
that command of men which knowledge affords, with
an innate passion for oratory,
<pb id="wise64" n="64"/>
a thorough education was the natural ambition of a
Virginia gentleman. True, his efforts were not directed
towards acquiring practical or scientific knowledge; for these
were in those days possessed, for the most part, by men who
expected to apply them to earning a livelihood. But in
education in the classics, in the study of ancient and modern
languages, in history, in philosophy moral and political, in
the study of the science of government, in the learned
professions, no men in America were better equipped than
the wealthy Southerners of that period.</p>
        <p>It is true, there was no public-school system, and the
reason for it was very plain. The wealth of the upper classes
enabled them to have private tutors. The paucity in numbers
of the lower classes of the whites, and the distances at which
they lived apart, rendered public schools impracticable for
them. Education of the blacks was, of course, contrary to all
ideas of slavery. Suppose we depended upon the wealthy to
inaugurate public schools,   -  how many should we have? Yet
nobody suspects that they are indifferent to education. The
best proof of the care of the slaveholding Southerner for
education may be found in the lives of distinguished
Northern men who grew up fifty years ago. In many
instances, they record the fact that their first employments
were as tutors in wealthy Southern families. The private
libraries of Virginia destroyed in the war, or burned in the
old Virginia homesteads, would have filled every public
library in the North to overflowing. Every current periodical
and publication of that day, American and foreign, was upon
the library table of the Virginian not later than it was in the
Northern reading-room.</p>
        <p>Conversation at social gatherings did not run to games
and sports, and dress and dissipations, and gossip and
amusements, but to the great events of the day, to the
<pb id="wise65" n="65"/>
latest productions in literature and art, and to things worthy
of man's noblest thought and discussion. It is an insult to
the memory of those most intellectual people to describe the
men as a breed of swearing, drinking, and gambling fox-hunters,
and the women as pampered, candy-eating dolls.
The per cent<sic corr="no punctuation needed">.</sic> of youth educated at foreign universities was
greater in proportion to white population, at the outbreak of
the war, in Virginia than in Massachusetts. This was
natural, in view of the greater individual wealth.</p>
        <p>It is true that every enterprise dependent upon what is
known as public spirit, or originating in the demand or
desire of common use, was sadly lacking. Wealthy people
seldom coöperate. Each buys, for private use, things which
all might well use in common if the price was an important
consideration; and none, perhaps, have as much, or as good,
as all might more cheaply obtain if they acted conjointly.</p>
        <p>In times of slavery, there never was a decent hotel or public
livery in the South. The private establishments were so large
that their hospitality was deadly to the success of public
houses, or other provision for the public comfort. Of a thousand
or two thousand visitors to the city of Richmond, not one
hundred would seek public accommodation. They either had
town residences of their own, or were taken in charge by friends
and relatives as soon as they reached the city. Everybody was
kin to everybody. Visitors were ushered into vacant chambers
that were already yearning for them, attended by the servants
that were idle in their absence, furnished with equipages and
horses that needed use and work, and fed of an abundance that
had been wasted before they came. All this was repaid by their
mere presence, which banished ennui, in those days when public
amusements were rare and inferior.</p>
        <pb id="wise66" n="66"/>
        <p>The domestic luxury and comfort of these people was all that
heart could wish for. Their houses were furnished
sumptuously in every detail. From drawing-room to chamber,
everything was provided which wealth could wish. Mahogany,
rare china and glass ware, massive silver, and the choicest of
damask and linen were found in the dining-room, which was an
important feature of every home. But there was a singular lack
of the elaborate ornamentation and gilding so prevalent at
present. The servants were in numbers, in thorough knowledge
of their duties, in considerate care of their guests, and in
respectful deference to their superiors, such as never were
surpassed anywhere, and such as are now found on no portion
of the earth's surface, unless, perhaps, it be in England. The
Virginia cook and the Virginia cooking of that time were the full
realization of the dreams of epicures for centuries. They also
have passed away, like many of those precious gifts which are
too delightful to be of long continuance. The dress of the
period was, considering the opulence of the people, remarkable
for its simplicity. Of diamonds and precious stones and jewelry
there was abundance, and they of the most costly kind, and in
quality the costumes of the women were of the best; but
neither in number nor in extravagance of make-up was there
any such display, especially in public, as later times have
developed.</p>
        <p>Male attire was exceedingly simple. As late as 1858, several
of the old gentlemen wore the queues we see in pictures of
Washington and his contemporaries, but those instances were
exceedingly rare. Among elderly men, no such thing as a beard
was admissible. The clean-shaven face was almost without
exception. Young dandies began to wear hirsute adornments
about the time Ned Sothern appeared in “Our American
Cousin,” and made “Lord
<pb id="wise67" n="67"/>
Dundreary” side-whiskers the fashionable fad. Elderly
gentlemen wore broadcloth, with tall silk hats, high standing
collars, and white or black stocks. This was varied among
country gentlemen by broad slouch hats of felt or straw, and
expansive white or nankeen waistcoats. During the heated term,
a fashionable attire was an entire outfit of white or brown linen
duck.</p>
        <p>Until the year 1858, there was little difference between the
costumes of old and young men, except in neckwear. Among
youngsters, colored cravats were worn. About that year came,
among the ultra fashionables, a remarkable outfit, consisting of
short, double-breasted reefing jackets, trousers immense at the
hips and tapering to the ankles, Scotch caps, and “Dundreary”
whiskers. But a country youth would have scorned such wild
imaginings of tailors. A city man thus equipped, walking beside
a woman in hoops and a broad-faced bonnet, would give Fifth
Avenue a genuine sensation if he reappeared today.</p>
        <p>The private equipages were handsome. Rogers, of
Philadelphia, and Brewster, of New York, built nearly all of the
carriages in use among the Virginians, and the horses were
Virginia or Kentucky thoroughbreds. There was rivalry to
possess the handsomest teams, and the equipages on Franklin
Street compared favorably, in number and style, with those in
any city in this country. One remarkable old lady, a Mrs. Cabell,
had a vehicle swinging upon immense C-springs, drawn by large
Andalusian mules of her own importation, with liveried
coachman and footmen. But that was never adopted as a
model. Even at that late day, a few people drove to the White
Sulphur in their private vehicles, and a drive of forty miles to
visit friends in the country was a mere episode. The sociability
of the period was great.</p>
        <pb id="wise68" n="68"/>
        <p>Concerning the mode of life, there were but two important
meals daily. Breakfast, except for business people or
schoolchildren, was rather late. Morning visiting among the
ladies was from one o'clock until three P. M. The dining hour
was generally at three P. M. From dinner time until about 7.30 
P.M. came a leisure period for driving; and then an informal
repast, consisting of tea, coffee, chocolate, biscuits,
sandwiches, and light cakes, served in the drawing-rooms. At
this hour the family, its guests and visitors, were generally
assembled in their best dress. The meal, if such a light repast
could be so designated, was served by butlers bearing great
trays. Every drawing-room had its “nest” of tiny tables on
which to place the plates and cups. The repast did not even
interrupt the flow of conversation. In pleasant weather, many of
the guests sat upon the porticoes and were served there. This
was the time when young folks, male and female, interchanged
visits.</p>
        <p>Music, vocal and instrumental, and dancing varied the
enjoyment of those charming evenings. The wit of the time was
brilliant and refined. There was Littleton Tazewell, remembered
as having declined a proffered cup of tea by dryly saying: 
“No, thank you, I would be azwell without the T.” There was
Tom August, whose wit was like Sheridan's. He it was who
refused to bet on the great four-mile race between “Red Eye ”
and “Revenue” because, as he said, the result was already
certain. When asked why it was certain, he replied, “The first legal maxim I
ever learned was, ‘<foreign lang="la">Id certum est, quod certum
Reddi potest.</foreign>’” On another occasion, responding to the
frightened inquiry, “Who is that?” when a neighbor heard
him falling downstairs, he promptly replied, “'Tis I, sir, rolling
rapidly.” Sweet Tom August,  -  courtly to dames, loving to
friends, brave in war, brilliant at the
<pb id="wise69" n="69"/>
bar, gentle and loving to the last,  -  green be the grave
that covers thee! Dying July 31st, he laughed, an hour
before he died, and remarked, “For once, the first and
last of August have come together.”</p>
        <p>And then there was mincing and primping John R.
Thompson, the poet, and young Price, now a grave professor of
Columbia, and handsome, dashing Willie Munford, to-day a
white-haired minister; and Jennings Wise, and Brandfute
Warwick, and John Pegram,  -  the last three dead in the battle
front before five years had rolled by. And there were young
Randolph Barksdale and Randolph Harrison, twin Apollo
Belvideres in youthful beauty. And red-faced George Pickett, in
his army clothes, before Gettysburg immortalized him, leading
his charming petite sister to the piano to flood the house with
melody like that of the mocking-bird. There, too, was the brilliant
Lucy Haxall, whose exuberant wit made all the welkin ring; and
sweet Mary Power Lyons, who made men better for beholding
such exquisite refinement and maidenly beauty; and the rich
Penn heiress from New Orleans; and the gentle Morsons; and
Pages and Carters and Lees by the score.</p>
        <p>In the quiet corners sat matrons smiling on this scene of
pleasure,  -  Dame Scott, of Fauquier, with her great white
turban, her intellectual face looking like a queen's;
Mrs. Judge Stanard, handsome and charming; Mrs. James
Lyons, young and beautiful as the most blushing debutante;
stately Mrs. Fowle, of Alexandria, and, by her side, hospitable
Mrs. McFarland, and beautiful and accomplished Mrs. Seddon,
of Goochland. Last, but by no means least, were the middle-aged
and elderly representative men of the city and State,
engaged in courteous attention to the ladies, or grouped in
drawing room, library, or veranda, discussing the living issues
of
<pb id="wise70" n="70"/>
the times. There was James Lyons, one of the leaders of the
Virginia bar, the handsomest man of his day; and noble-looking
John B. Young, who, in the forefront of his profession, still
found time to read Dickens until he was a walking
encyclopædia of Dickens's wit; and William H. McFarland,
Richmond's king of hospitality, portly and imposing, in ruffled
shirt and spotless black; and Judge Robert Stanard, whose
very presence was suggestive not only of the bench, but of a
certain weakness he had for whist and “Lou” and “Bragg;”
and George W. Randolph and Roscoe B. Heath, the rising men
of the bar; and the Reverends Joshua Peterkin and Charles
Minnegerode, spiritual doctors; and Doctors Deane and Haxall,
doctors of the flesh,  -  all mingling in most delightful and
refined exchange of courtesy and thought.</p>
        <p>Once or twice a week the public band played in the Capitol
grounds. The park was illuminated. The citizens generally
promenaded up and down the great parade and enjoyed the
music. Our home was opened on such occasions to father's
friends, and with clean-washed face and most approved attire,
I flitted in and out: now petted in the drawing-room; now
stealing away with a biscuit or a cake for some little pet darkey;
now out in the public square with my boy acquaintances.</p>
        <p>School occupied our mornings, and three afternoons of the
week were allotted to our French. When older, I should never
have begrudged that time to so charming a companion as Mlle.
Vassas, the<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">institutrice</foreign></hi>, but we looked upon her then as our
natural enemy. Afternoons and Saturdays were left to us to
indulge in boyish diversions. At first, these were harmless and
domestic enough. In the spacious grounds about the
Government House, we had pet pigeons, tame squirrels, a
rabbit-warren, an improvised
<pb id="wise71" n="71"/>
gymnasium, and other things to make home happy. Old Harry,
our slave coachman, often accompanied us on horseback rides;
and the boys of our acquaintance were glad to avail themselves
of the attractions at our home. We were warned against playing
in the streets, or wandering into other portions of the city, and
for a long time obeyed such commands very well. But in time, I
found many excuses for absence. Between the visits to the
state barracks, where our soldier company drilled, and to the
Penitentiary, where ingenious convicts, without regular
employments, built us boats, and engines, and cannon, and
wagons, and all sorts of toys, there were always plausible
excuses for frequent and long absences, the real nature of
which were never very closely investigated.</p>
        <p>Then came the excitement of another presidential election. I
hear you exclaim, “Now what possible interest could a
presidential election possess for a boy ten years old?” You
ask that question because you do not know the society I am
describing. Not a day passed that I did not hear something
about the dangerous condition of the political situation. Long
before James Buchanan was nominated by the Democrats, I
knew that Stephen A. Douglas, “the little giant,” with his
views of squatter sovereignty, could not command the vote of
the Southern Democracy. Father was a warm supporter of Mr.
Buchanan as the representative of the conservative element of
Democracy. Accordingly, when Buchanan was nominated,
largely through the influence of the Virginians, I felt a personal
interest in the success of “Buck and Breck,” and was their
avowed advocate in all places. Richmond was still unreconciled
to Democracy; and the American ticket, headed by ex-President
Fillmore and Andrew Jackson Donelson, was a hot favorite in
Virginia's capital. As for the new and third party, known
<pb id="wise72" n="72"/>
as Republican and led by Fremont and Dayton, it literally had
no following there. Out of the 160,000 votes cast in Virginia
in the presidential election of 1856, only 1800 votes were
cast for the Republicans, and they were nearly
all cast in the Panhandle.</p>
        <p>But the supporters of Buchanan and of Fillmore made a
great noise in Richmond. They were united in ridiculing
Fremont, but divided in all else. Nearly every night, open-air
political speaking took place, with parades, banners,
red lights, and bands of music, and great orators visited
the city. From these, and from the political cartoons, which
were very plentiful, I learned a great deal about Buchanan
and Breckinridge, and about Fillmore and Donelson; but I
was led to regard the candidacy of Fremont as a political
farce, and chiefly heard of him as finding woolly horses in
the Rocky Mountains, and running away with Jessie
Benton, daughter of Missouri's great senator. I did not
realize that, although the storm of abolition had not yet
assumed full force, it was rapidly gathering, with its centre
in this Republican ticket; nor appreciate that, in many
Northern States, Fremont was drawing to his support a
great following, which, with its “wide-awake” processions
and other demonstrations, excited an enthusiasm not seen
in politics since the time of “Tippecanoe and Tyler too.”
Even when the election occurred and Buchanan was chosen,
I did not know that the real battle had been between
Buchanan and Fremont, and that, for the first time, a solid
North had been arrayed politically against a solid South.</p>
        <p>No; however seriously a scrutiny of the returns may have
affected older and more thoughtful people, young folks, and
many older folks than I, looked only at the results, and
regarded the election of Buchanan as once more putting at
rest the plans of the abolitionist and
<pb id="wise73" n="73"/>
the fears of the slaveholder. Little did I foresee that
within eight years from the time I was hurrahing for
“Buck and Breck,” I should be led in battle by Breck in an
assault on Buck, and upon everything that Buck and Breck
stood for in the great election of 1856.</p>
        <p>The result of the election of 1856 gave great satisfaction
at our home. In the year 1857, passing through 
Washington on our return from the annual visit to
Philadelphia, I had the distinguished honor of visiting a
President for the first time. In company with a friend of 
father's, we children were taken to the White House. The
President was a charming old gentleman, of very 
distinguished appearance. His greeting was cordial and
simple. I looked him over carefully, and wondered why he
had one hazel and one blue eye, and why he had never 
married. Then I reflected that perhaps that was the real
reason, for the dear old fellow seemed exceedingly fond of
children, and perhaps, after all, would have had a wife and
children, if he could have found a lady who would be 
content with a pair of misfit eyes. Very sweet and tender eyes
they were, however. After looking through the President's
conservatory and receiving some pretty flowers, and eating
a fine piece of President's cake, and being intrusted with some
kind messages for father, we felt that we had not made any
mistake in supporting Buchanan for President.</p>
        <p>Soon after this, we had an opportunity of seeing an
eminent representative of the other side in politics.
Personal animosities did not enter so largely into politics
in those days as they do now, although the stakes of the
political game were greater, and the issues really more
vital.</p>
        <p>An abolitionist in the abstract, as conceived by us under
the teachings surrounding us, was a very frightful
creature. We had heard much of past negro insurrections
<pb id="wise74" n="74"/>
inspired by secret Northern emissaries. It was part of
my early education to learn of a fearful massacre, led by a
desperate negro named Nat Turner, in the county of
Southampton a few years before I was born. I had been
taught to believe that Nat Turner and his deluded followers
had really had no cause of grievance, but that secret
abolition emissaries had gone among them, and with devilish
malignity had stimulated them to rise in the night, and
put to death a number of innocent people who had been good
to them all their lives, to whom they owed every debt of
gratitude for becoming their masters here and making
Christians of them, instead of leaving them savages in
Africa. All this seemed reasonable, with no arguments on the
other side; and the fact that Nat Turner and all who joined
him were wiped off the face of the earth seemed a natural
result of Nat's lack of appreciation of the good state in which
he lived. In a general way I had heard, and heard it with
regret, that the real culprits, the abolitionists, who had
made Nat Turner do these horrid things, had escaped, and
from time to time contemplated the possibility that such
fiends still existed, and still prowled at night about negro
quarters, and induced them to run away. Of course, I had no
idea that such a thing as a negro insurrection could occur in
our community with a body of troops present like the Public
Guard. But why talk of such possibilities? Were not the
negroes perfectly content and happy? Had I not often talked
to them on the subject? Had not every one of them told me
repeatedly that they loved “old Marster” better than
anybody in the world, and would not have freedom if he
offered it to them? Of course they had,  -  many and many a
time. And that settled it.</p>
        <p>All this being true, I looked upon an abolitionist as, in
the first place, a rank fool, engaged in trying to make
<pb id="wise75" n="75"/>
people have what they did not want; and in the next place,
as a disturber of the peace, trying to make people wretched
who were happy, and a man bad at heart, who was bent on
stealing what belonged to his neighbor, or even inciting the
murder of people for slaveholding, as if slaveholding were a
crime, when it was no crime, but a natural and necessary
condition of society.</p>
        <p>With views like this concerning abolitionists in general,
my curiosity was greatly excited when I heard that one
William H. Seward, the acknowledged leader of the
Republican party in the North, was not only in the city of
Richmond, but was visiting and being entertained by the
Hon. Jargon Lyons, a connection and supporter of my father.</p>
        <p>When I was presented to Mr. Seward, I was greatly
surprised to find him a natural-looking person, with most
attractive manners, genial, bright in companionship,
laughing in his talk, and actually going so far as to call his
host Lyons, and the other gentlemen by their given names.
Mr. Seward surprised me also by eating and drinking and
smoking, and having a good time generally; and I watched
him long and in vain to see some distinguishing mark by
which I might thereafter recognize an abolitionist. I
discovered none, except it be a wonderfully large nose, which
was also a characteristic of John Brown and Abraham
Lincoln, his brother abolitionists.</p>
        <p>I listened in vain for some utterance of abolition views
from Mr. Seward, but the party seemed more interested in a
decanter of old Madeira, and a discussion of some passing
social event, than in the all-absorbing question of slavery,
and so Mr. Seward's convictions were reserved for future
expression. I thought he might possibly give money to Austin
the butler, with which to escape from slavery, but, so far as
was ever discovered, nothing like
<pb id="wise76" n="76"/>
that occurred. Mr. Seward came and went. He enjoyed his
visit, and his host enjoyed his company. But neither made
much impression on the political views of the other.</p>
        <p>Many other things were happening which drew my
attention to the subject of slavery. During our next visit to
Philadelphia, everybody was talking about a book and a play
called “Uncle Tom's Cabin.” I had heard mention of the book
at home, as a very powerful but very “pernicious” book. More
than once the subject had come up in conversation in my
presence; and I had heard the work spoken of as a cruel
travesty upon Southern life, disgusting in its sentimental
sympathy with the negro. I was surprised to find that
everybody in the North was reading “Uncle Tom's Cabin,”
and pronouncing it a remarkable production; and when it
was proposed, on our next visit to Philadelphia, to take me to
a theatre to see this wonderful play of “Uncle Tom's Cabin,” I
was delighted. Never did theatrical performance open to
any one more gratifyingly than that wonderful drama. In
my heart I had a feeling that our Northern kinsfolk thought
their homes were finer than those in our beloved South. I did
not think so. When, in the opening act, I saw the beautiful
Southern home, with its flowers and bowers and sunshine, I
said to myself, “Now they will see how we live, and will envy
us.” Yes, old Uncle Tom and all his family were just such
darkeys as were in Virginia. And as for Eva, there she was,
looking like a hundred little girls I knew, and infinitely
sweeter in voice and eye than the prim Northern girls
surrounding me. And Eva's father! I knew a hundred
charming young fellows just like him. Her mother? Well,
there was no denying it that now and then we saw one like
her, but she was not a common or attractive type. And
Topsy? Yes, there were darkeys just like
<pb id="wise77" n="77"/>
her, even within my limited knowledge. I laughed and
enjoyed myself along with the others over Topsy's queer
antics.</p>
        <p>The play moved on. In time the slave auction came, and the
negro-buyers, and the terrible domestic tragedy to Uncle
Tom, and the fearful Mississippi River trip, and the
whipping of Eliza's husband,  -  her flight, the bloodhounds'
and all the ghastly story which thrilled a nation. I was too
young to grasp the moral of that story, yet old enough to feel
my heart rebel against things which I had never before seen
laid at the door of the people I loved and among whom I lived.
I believed that many of them were the mere creations of a
malignant enemy, who had conjured them up out of her own
imagination to prejudice the outside world against my kith
and kin, and I indignantly denied, when questioned
concerning the play, that such scenes were possible. I had
never witnessed them, or heard of them, in the home of my
father. I resolved to denounce and forget this new phase of
slavery which that night had revealed to me, and the anger
and the pity which I heard expressed by the people about me
confirmed me in the belief that they were sentimentalists on
subjects of which they were ignorant, and that the
denunciation of slavery by Northerners sprang from
prejudices engendered by just such outrageous exaggerations
as those of “Uncle Tom's Cabin.”</p>
        <p>But the play made a deep and lasting impression upon
me. The sweet vision of little Eva, the inexpressible
pathos of Uncle Tom, the freaks of Topsy, came back to
me time and time again. Alas! they returned yoked in
my memory with the wretched figure of Legree, the bloodhounds,
and the misery of the other scenes, and the 
possibility that it all might be true revealed itself to me in a
way that I little expected. I knew there was such a thing
<pb id="wise78" n="78"/>
as a negro-buyer. On one or two occasions I had had such
men pointed out to me. I had been taught to regard them as
an inferior class of humanity; but this knowledge came
principally from the negroes themselves, for the grown
people of my own class seldom referred to them, and they
received no sort of social recognition. I had, in fact, seen in
the newspapers advertisements of the sale of negroes, side
by side with little figures of a man with a pack on his back,
and the offer of a reward for a runaway. But never until my
return from the North was my curiosity sufficiently aroused
to make me locate the place of selling negroes, or determine
me to see a sale.</p>
        <p>Among my Northern kinsfolk was a young uncle, a
handsome, witty fellow, much younger than my mother.
Notwithstanding her death, he had kept up his affection and
intimacy with father. Influenced partly by his regard for
father and partly by pride as a Pennsylvanian, he had
become an ardent supporter of Mr. Buchanan. He occupied a
rather prominent position as a Democratic member of the
Pennsylvania legislature. Controlled doubtless by his warm
attachments in the South, he had no squeamish feelings
about slavery. He loved the Union, and sincerely believed
that the only way to preserve it was by recognizing the
existence of slavery, and by protecting the slaveholders in all
lawful ways. He believed also that men like his brother-in-
law were convinced that slavery ought to be abolished; and
that the best way to bring that result about, without
disunion and conflict, was to trust to its gradual
accomplishment by the slave States themselves acting
under the influence of men such as he knew, instead of
attempting to coerce them by outside influence, which, as he
believed, would arouse their antagonism and defiance, so as
to defeat or delay the end desired. This was the honest
feeling which made many a Northern man
<pb id="wise79" n="79"/>
Democrat in those days. It may have been an error in
judgment, but it was an error, if error at all, on the side of
Union and fraternity, springing from a knowledge of their
Southern brethren, a respect and regard for them, and a
desire for the peaceful solution of a most perplexing
problem. Let no man at this day denounce that feeling as
cowardice or lack of principle. The man of whom I write felt
that way and acted that way to the last. But when the 
“irrepressible conflict” came, he laid down his life with a
smile for the Union, while many a man who had precipitated
the struggle never went to the front. And he was but one of
thousands.</p>
        <p>It was he who had taken me to see “Uncle Tom's Cabin;”
and it was he who had petted me, and taken me about the
streets of Philadelphia, and spoiled me in many ways; and
it was he who had taken me to visit the President; and now
he had come to visit us, and spend a week of leisure with his
favorite brother-in-law.</p>
        <p>My oldest brother had recently returned from Paris. He
had been absent as Secretary of Legation in Berlin and
Paris for nearly six years. He and my uncle were nearly of
the same age, and devoted friends. Father loved this oldest
son as the apple of his eye, and the feeling of that son for his
father was little short of adoration. The relations between
these three  -  father, son, and brother-in-law  -  were of the
most intimate and beautiful kind. Together they conferred,
as if they were men of the same age, and, being in full accord
on public questions, their views were always harmonious,
whether looking to some social pleasure, or some
coöperation for the advancement of their political plans.
Father had higher ambitions than he had yet realized. He
was becoming prominent as a possible candidate for the
presidency. Both from a natural inclination and a desire to
promote his candidacy, my
<pb id="wise80" n="80"/>
brother had become editor of the “Richmond Inquirer,” the
leading Democratic journal of Virginia; my uncle was heart and
soul enlisted in securing support for father among his own
constituency. It was believed that his well-known
conservatism on the subject of slavery, and his intense
devotion to the Union, would make his prospects very good
for the nomination.</p>
        <p>I had unrestrained access to the library, where this trio
frequently assembled; and, without being admitted into their
graver conversation, heard it, and understood its general
tenor. The occupations of my father and brother left their
visitor to find his own amusements until the evening hour, and
he diverted himself at such times by reading or sight-seeing, or
in diversions with the children, of whom he was very fond.</p>
        <p>One Saturday, thus left alone with me, the subject of “Uncle
Tom's Cabin” came up. He asked if I had ever seen a slave
sale. “No,” said I, all alert, for since I saw the play I had
resolved that I would some time see a slave auction; “but I
know where they sell them. I saw the sign a few days ago. Let
us go and see what it is like.” So off we started. Out of the
beautiful grounds and past the handsome residences we went,
turning down Franklin Street towards the great Exchange Hotel,
which was at that time the principal public place of Richmond.
Beyond it we passed a church, still used as such, although the
locality had been deserted by residences, and stables and little
shops surrounded it. As we proceeded, the street became more
and more squalid and repulsive, until at last we reached a low
brick warehouse, with its end abutting on the street and
running far back. Over the place was the sign, with the name of
an owner and the words “Auction House” conspicuously
painted. At the door hung a red flag, with an advertisement
pasted on
<pb id="wise81" n="81"/>
its side, and up and down the street a mulatto man walked with
another flag, ringing a large bell, and shouting, “Oh yea! Oh,
yea! Oh, yea! Walk up, gentlemen. The sale of a fine, likely lot
of young niggers is now about to begin.” To these he added, in
tones which were really merry, and with an expansive smile,
that they were “all sorts of niggers, belonging to the estate of
the late  -   sold for no fault, but to settle the estate;” and that the lot
embraced all kinds, “old ones and young ones, men and
women, gals and boys.”</p>
        <p>About the door, and on the inside, a few men were grouped,
some in their shirt-sleeves. For the most part, they had the
appearance of hostlers. The place itself looked like a livery
stable within the building. For a long distance back from the
street, there were no sidelights or skylights. In the rear only
was it light, where the structure projected beyond those on
either side of it, and there the light was ample, and the
business in hand was to be transacted.</p>
        <p>We moved cautiously through the dark front of the building,
and came at last to the rear, where a small platform occupied the
centre of the room, and chairs and benches were distributed
about the walls. Another large mulatto man appeared to act as
usher, standing near a door, through which from time to time he
furnished a fresh supply of slaves for sale. A large man, with
full beard, not a bad-looking fellow but for the “ratty”
appearance of his quick, cold, small black eyes, acted as
auctioneer. A few negroes sat on the bench by the door, they
being the first “lot” to be disposed of. The purchasers stood
or sat about, smoking or chewing tobacco, while the auctioneer
proceeded to read the decree of a chancery court in the
settlement of a decedent's estate under which this sale was made. 
The lawyers representing 
<pb id="wise82" n="82"/>
different interests were there, as were also the creditors
and distributees having interests in the sale. Besides these
were ordinary buyers in need of servants, and slave traders
who made a living by buying cheap and selling for a profit.
We took seats, and watched and listened intently.</p>
        <p>After reading the formal announcement authorizing the
sale, the auctioneer became eloquent. He proceeded to
explain to his auditors that this was “no ordinary sale of a
damaged, no-'count lot of niggers, whar a man buyin' a nigger
mout or mout not git what he was lookin' fur, but one of those
rar' opperchunities, which cum only once or twice in a
lifetime, when the buyer is sho that fur every dollar he pays
he's gittin' a full dollar's wuth of real genuine nigger, healthy,
well-raised, well-mannered, respectful, obejunt, and willin'.”
“Why,” said he, “gentlemen, you kin look over this whole
gang of niggers, from the oldest to the youngest, an' you won't
find the mark of a whip on one of 'em. Colonel, for whose
estate they is sold, was known to be one of the kindest
marsters, and at the same time one of the best bringers-up of
niggers, in all Virginia. These here po' devils is sold for no
fault whatever, but simply and only because, owin' to the
Curnel's sudden death, his estate is left embarrassed, and it
is necessary to sell his niggers to pay his debts, and for
distributin' some ready money amongst numrus 'aars. Of
these facts I assure you upon the honor of a gentleman.”</p>
        <p>Having thus paved the way for good prices, he announced
that among the slaves to be offered were good carriage-drivers,
gardeners, dining-room servants, farm hands,
cooks, milkers, seamstresses, washerwomen, and
“the most promisin', growin', sleek, and sassy lot young
niggers he had ever had the pleasure of offerin'.”</p>
        <pb id="wise83" n="83"/>
        <p>The sale was begun with some “bucks,” as he facetiously
called them. They were young, unmarried fellows from
eighteen to twenty-five. Ordered to mount the auction-block,
they stripped to the waist and bounced up, rather amused
than otherwise, grinning at the lively bidding they excited.
Cautious bidders drew near to them, examined their eyes,
spoke with them to test their hearing and manners, made
them open their mouths and show their teeth, ran their
hands over the muscles of their backs and arms, caused
them to draw up their trousers to display their legs, and,
after fully satisfying themselves on these and other points,
bid for them what they saw fit. Whenever a sale was
concluded, the successful bidder was announced, and the
announcement was greeted by the darkeys themselves with
broad grins, and such expressions as “Thank Gord,” or 
“Bless de Lord,” if it went as they wished, or in uncomplaining
silence if otherwise. It was surprising to see how thoroughly
they all seemed to be informed concerning the men who were
bidding for them.</p>
        <p>The scenes accompanying the sales of young women were
very similar to those with the young men, except that what
was said to them and about them was astonishingly plain
and shocking. One was recommended as a “rattlin' good
breeder,” because she had already given birth to two
children at seventeen years of age. Another, a mulatto of
very comely form, showed deep embarrassment when
questioned about her condition.</p>
        <p>They brought good prices. “Niggers is high” was the
general comment. Who bought them, where they went,
whether they were separated from father, mother, brother,
or sister, God knows. Let us hope the result was as humane
as possible.</p>
        <p>“I am now goin' to offer you a very likely young
<pb id="wise84" n="84"/>
chile-barin' woman,” said the auctioneer. “She is puffectly
helthy, and without a blemish. Among the family, she
is a universal favorite. I offer her with the privilidge of
takin' her husban' and two chillen with her at a very
reduced price, because it is the wish of all concerned to
keep 'em together, if possible. Get up here, Martha
Ann.” A large-framed, warm, comfortable-looking,
motherly soul, with a fine, honest face, mounted the block
“Now, gentlemen,” said he, continuing, “ef you'll cast
yo' eyes into that corner, you will see Israel, Martha
Ann's husband, and Cephas and Melindy, her two 
children. Israel is not what you may call a real able-bodied
man. He broke his leg some years ago handlin' one of
the Curnel's colts, and he ain't able to do heavy work;
but I am asshoed by everybody on the place that Israel
is a most valuable servant about a house for all kind of
light work, and he can be had mighty cheap.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, sir,” spoke up Israel eagerly, “I kin do as
much en ennybody; and, marsters, ef you'll only buy
me and de chillun with Martha Ann, Gord knows I'll
wuk myself to deth fur you.”</p>
        <p>The poor little darkeys, Cephas and Melinda, sat
there frightened and silent, their white eyes dancing
like monkey-eyes, and gleaming in the shadows. As her
husband's voice broke on her ear, Martha Ann, who
had been looking sadly out of the window in a pose of
quiet dignity, turned her face with an expression of
exquisite love and gratitude towards Israel. She gazed
for a moment at her husband and at her children, and
then looked away once more, her eyes brimming with
tears.</p>
        <p>“How much am I offered for Martha Ann with the
privilidge?” shouted the auctioneer. The bidding
began. It was very sluggish. The hammer fell at last.
The price was low. Perhaps, even in that crowd,
nobody wanted
<pb id="wise85" n="85"/>
them all, and few were willing to do the heartless act of
taking her alone. So she sold low. When the name of
her purchaser was announced, I knew him. He was an
odd, wizen, cheerless old fellow, who was a member of
the Virginia legislature from one of the far-away
southside counties adjoining North Carolina. Heaven be
praised, he was not a supporter of father, but called
himself an Old-line Whig, and ranked with the
opposition. He seemed to have no associates among the
members, and nobody knew where he lived in the city.
He was notoriously penurious, and drew his pay as
regularly as the week rolled around.</p>
        <p>“Mr.  -  buys Martha Ann,” said the auctioneer. “I
congratulate you, Mr.  -  . You've bought the cheapes'
nigger sold here to-day. Will you take Israel and the
young uns with her?” </p>
        <p>Deep silence fell upon the gathering. Even
imperturbable Martha Ann showed her anxiety by the
heaving of her bosom. Israel strained forward, where he
sat, to hear the first word of hope or of despair. The old
man who had bid for her shuffled forward, fumbling in
his pockets for his money, delaying his reply so long
that the question was repeated. “No  -  o,” drawled he at
last; “no  -  o, I'm sorry for 'em, but I railly can't. You
see, I live a long way from here, and I ride down to the
legislatur', and, when I get here, I sell my horse and
live cheap, and aims to save up enough from my salary
to buy another horse and a chile-barin' woman' when
the session's done; and then I takes her home, ridin'
behind me on the horse. Thar ain't no way I could
provide for gittin' the man and the young uns home,
even if they was given to me. I think I'm doin' pretty
well to save enough in a session to buy one nigger,
much less a whole fambly.” And the old beast looked up
over his spectacles as 
<pb id="wise86" n="86"/>
he counted his money, and actually chuckled, as if
he expected a round of applause for his clever
business ability.</p>
        <p>A deep groan, unaccompanied by any word of 
complaint, came from the dark corner where Israel
sat. Martha Ann stepped down from the platform,
walked to where he was, the tears streaming down
her cheeks, and there, hugging her children and
rocking herself back and forth, she sobbed as if her
heart was breaking.</p>
        <p>My companion and I looked at each other in
disgust, but neither spoke a word. I was ready to
burst into tears. The old creature who had bought
the woman lugged out his hoarded money in
sundry packages of coin and paper, and, as he
counted it, said, “Martha Ann, cheer up; you'll find
me a good marster, and I'll get you a new
husband.” He might well have added, “and the
more children you have, the better I'll like you.”</p>
        <p>Thank God, the scene did not end there. The
silence was oppressive. The veriest savage on
earth could not have witnessed it without being
moved. “Let us go away,” I whispered. At last the
suspense was broken. A handsome, manly fellow,
one of the lawyers in the case, exclaimed, “By! I
can't stand this. I knew Colonel well. I know how
he felt towards Israel and Martha Ann and their
children. This is enough to make him turn in his
grave. I am unable to make this purchase; but
sooner than see them separated, I'll bankrupt
myself. Mr.  -  , I will take Martha Ann off your
hands, so as to buy her husband and children, and
keep them together.”</p>
        <p>“Well, now, you see,” drawled the old fellow,
pausing in his work, with trembling hand, “if you
feel that way, the time to speak was when the gal
was up for sale.” His eye glittered with the thought
of turning the situation to advantage. “You see
she's mine now, and I consider
<pb id="wise87" n="87"/>
her a very desirable and very cheap purchase:
Moreover if you want her, I think you ought to be
willin' to pay me something for the time and
trouble I've wasted here a-tryin' to git her.”</p>
        <p>The proposition was sickening. But the old
creature was so small himself that his demand of
profit was likewise small, and the matter was soon
arranged. Whether he remained and bought
another “chile-barin'” woman is unknown; for,
sick at heart at the sights we had witnessed, we
withdrew, and walked slowly back in the glorious
sunlight, past the neighboring church, and up to
the happy abodes of Virginia's best civilization,
little inclined to talk of the nightmare we had been
through. From that hour, the views of both of us
concerning slavery were materially modified.
Throughout the day, the horrors we had witnessed
came back and back again to me; and,
recuperative as I was, I was very, very unhappy.</p>
        <p>That night, the experiences of the morning were
the subject of a long and anxious and earnest
conversation between father, my brother, and my
uncle. At its close, I felt much relieved and proud of
them, and better satisfied, because they were all
agreed that a system in which things like that
were possible was monstrous; and that the
question was, not whether it should be abolished,
and abolished quickly, but as to the manner of its
abolition.</p>
        <p>Within seven years from that time, my brother
and my uncle were both dead,  -  killed in battle on
opposite sides in a struggle resulting from slavery.
Father's fortune and happiness were engulfed in
the horrible fraternal strife which grew out of this
cancer on the body politic,  -  a cancer which all
three of those men were honestly anxious to
destroy.</p>
        <p>Virginians! you who in our day were led by Lee
and Jackson! have you read this chapter? Is it
true or untrue?
<pb id="wise88" n="88"/>
Ask yourselves calmly. The time has now come when
you ought, in justice to yourselves, to try to satisfy yourselves
wherein your old system was wrong and unjustifiable, as well
as wherein it was right. One who loves you wrote this story;
one who was your comrade in the fight we lost; one who has
no word of blame for you, but, on the contrary, believes that we
had every provocation to fight; one who, as long as he lives,
will glory in the way we fought, and is proud of his own scars,
and teaches his children to believe that the record of
Confederate valor is a priceless heritage.</p>
        <p>It is not written when the truth can do you harm. It is not
written by an alien in feeling, or an enthusiast for an abstract
idea. It is written to make you think,  -  to make you ask
yourselves whether you can, before God, claim that all was as it
should be when we had slavery. It is written to reconcile you to
your loss by showing you from what your children were
delivered.</p>
        <p>It is penned in the firm belief that some day, while brooding
upon the happiness, the wealth, the culture, the refinement
then possessed by the South, and to so large an extent lost to
her now, you may realize that all these, delightful as they were,
did not justify the curse and misery of human slavery. I seek to
make you realize, if not admit, that its abolition was a greater
blessing to us even than to the slaves, and that emancipation
was worth all we surrendered, and all the precious lives that
were destroyed; to bring you to confess, the brave and
generous men I know you to be, that the time has come at last
when, through our tears, and without disloyalty to the dead, in
the possession of freedom and union and liberty, true
Confederates, viewing it all in the clearer light and calmer
atmosphere of to-day, ought to thank God that slavery died at
Appomattox.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER VII</head>
        <head>MY BROTHER</head>
        <p>IN the last chapter I spoke of the return of my brother
Jennings from France. After graduating at Bloomington, Ind.,
and studying law at William and Mary College, and before he
attained his majority, he had received from President Pierce an
appointment in the diplomatic service, and was sent to Berlin
as attaché of the American Legation He spent three years in
Berlin and Heidelberg, and was thence transferred to Paris as
Secretary of Legation, where he further improved himself by
study, and by contact with the most polished society in
Europe. When he returned to Virginia in 1857, at the age of
twenty-five, he was well equipped for a brilliant career. His
homecoming after a long absence was the occasion of great
rejoicing in our family. It was as if a new light had sprung up in
the household. My brother was so modest and unaffected that
his acute intellect and varied information were not always
revealed to strangers. His disposition was so amiable that in all
his life he never had a boyish quarrel with any one. Of
singularly mature and sedate nature, he had been his father's
loved and trusted companion before his departure for foreign
parts; and now that he had returned and was about to assume
life's serious responsibilities, they became inseparable
companions. He at first entered upon the practice of law; but
although he scoured reasonable employment, and was
thoroughly trained in common, civil, and international law, he
found the practice irksome, and lacking in excitement. His
<pb id="wise90" n="90"/>
ambition was for political distinction, and very soon he quit
the law, and became editor of the “Richmond Enquirer,” the
Democratic organ of Virginia. The touch
of a master hand was quickly revealed in that journal. His
familiarity with foreign politics, and the new lights shed
upon them by his knowledge and criticisms, attracted
widespread interest on the part of his fellow journalists, as
well as the public. In domestic politics, his ardent nature
was soon made manifest upon every page. Since the death of
Father Ritchie, its once famous editor, the “Enquirer” had
lost ground, and descended to the level of a staid and
humdrum commonplace newspaper.</p>
        <p>Within a short time the paper again stood foremost
among Southern journals, and my brother's name became as
well known as that of his father. His social successes were
not less marked than his professional triumphs. Women and
children idolized him. And well they might, for he preferred
their society to that of men. Passionately fond of music and
of dancing, it was his delight to steal away from the sombre
circle of his own sex, or leave the after-dinner cigar and wine,
to join the ladies in the drawing-room. There he would linger
with unsatisfied delight, listening to the music, or dancing
until all others were exhausted. An accomplished linguist,
with all sorts of interesting knowledge of the world,
delightful in conversation, he possessed an indescribable
charm for women. Yet, although he was brought into daily
contact with exquisite creatures, whom it was almost 
impossible not to love, his fondness for the other sex seemed
altogether platonic.</p>
        <p>If a child saw him once, it never forgot him. Children
flocked about him as if he had been the Pied Piper of
Hamelin. He rejoiced in this sovereignty, and ever went
prepared with trifles to surprise and delight them.</p>
        <pb id="wise91" n="91"/>
        <p>One of the most remarkable things about him was his
unaffected piety. He never made a profession of religion, yet
he was as punctilious in church attendance as an elder; and
in the silence of his chamber, where no one saw him, he
prayed every night before retiring. Unlike the many blasé
youths who are spoiled by residence in France, a long life in
Paris had produced no visible effect upon his purity of life or
childlike faith. Whoever was thrown with him, young or old,
superior or inferior, first wondered at his sweet simplicity,
and then loved him for his unaffected naturalness, sincerity,
and gentleness. This charming young brother, returning after
so long an absence as if from the dead, was a revelation
and a source of wonderment from the time I awoke in the
morning until I closed my eyes at night. This was literally
true, for until his coming, I had never seen anybody open the
day, winter and summer, with a plunge into an ice-cold bath;
likewise, until his arrival with his Parisian love of the
theatre, I had never closed the day at the playhouse with a
companion always glad to go, be it ever so bad a show.</p>
        <p>My brother Richard, near my own age, had been sent off to
boarding-school; leaving me sole occupant of our sleeping
apartment. The chambers of the Government House were
large and lonesome, and it was with unspeakable pleasure
that I obtained consent of the newcomer that my little bed
should be placed in his chamber. From this association
sprung pleasures innumerable. The marvelous things from
Paris and Berlin were sources of unending interest and
information. There were the great German Schlagers, or
dueling-swords, used by the Heidelberg students in the
contests among their fighting corps, and in time I was fully
informed about the habits of the German universities. How
it tickled me to hear the
<pb id="wise92" n="92"/>
story of young Sidney Legare, of South Carolina, who
joined the Saxon Corps, and, armed with one of these
selfsame Schlagers, fought and won his battle with a
German baron! The inscriptions on the hilt bore the names
of the young Americans who maintained the pluck of the
United States among the Continental youth.</p>
        <p>There also were fencing-foils and masks, with which he
had become so expert in beautiful Paris that he was known
in every <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">salle d'armes</foreign></hi>. With these we had many a
friendly bout, until I considered myself quite a rattling
blade with the foils. Then at times our conversation was in
French; especially when I required cash, or proposed
some amusement, I plunged away at him with all the
French I could command, until I really improved in
speaking. From him also I learned much of Parisian court
life in the time of Louis Napoleon, and many a day laughed
at the stories of the intimacy between Napoleon III. and
the Hon. John Y. Mason, of Virginia, the American Minister
to France, in whose house my brother had been regarded
almost as one of the family.</p>
        <p>My bright and joyous room-mate, bustling about of
mornings, making his toilet after his exhilarating bath,
often sang snatches of Parisian operas, or repeated long
passages from Shakespeare, Byron, and Walter Scott, for
he was full of romance. Thus I became familiar with
operatic airs, and could repeat many of the striking poetical
quotations. And there were the Parisian clothes and
toilet articles and preparations,  -  wonderful French
waistcoats and cravats and neckerchiefs, and boots and
shoes, and <foreign lang="fr">eau de quinine</foreign> for those curly locks, and
pomade for that downy mustache; every one of them
strange and new and very captivating to me. I would
rub my own frowsy mop of hair, hitherto only half
brushed, with that <foreign lang="fr">eau de quinine</foreign>, until my scalp was as
<pb id="wise93" n="93"/>
red as a lobster, and sighed that I had no mustache on
which to test the perfumed stick pomatum. What is there
on this earth more delightful to the small boy than
rummaging among the toilet outfit and dress of a grown-up
brother? And he told me wonderful stories of knights and
ladies and tournaments, and put me to reading Sir Walter
Scott; and gave me a famous copy of “Charles O'Malley,
the Irish Dragoon,” and laughed with me over “Handy
Andy;” and in the evenings, when lessons were difficult,
lifted me along with Cæsar and Virgil or mathematics, that
we might go together later to the show. Then there were
the German wines he had brought home, four hundred
varieties; for, while he was abstemious, and cared little for
spirituous or malt liquors, he loved to sip the Rhine wines
with his cigar; and I, who was by no means averse to them,
was soon an expert in Niersteiners, and Laubenheimers,
and Moselle Auslice, and Lietfraumilch and
Johannisbergers, and all the rest; but above all, I loved the
sparkling Moselles, which have all my life reminded me of
that beloved companion of those happy days. Oh, never
had boy a friend and mentor like him   -  so lovable, so
affectionate, so considerate, so pure so stimulating to
honest work, so willing, so resourceful in innocent
amusement.</p>
        <p>One night we attended the play of “East Lynne” at the
old Richmond Theatre. The performance was poor
enough, to be sure, to a young man fresh from Paris, but I
thought it was great. On our way home, he remarked that
the only performer of merit in the <sic corr="cast">caste</sic> was the young
fellow, John Wilkes Booth. In him, he said, there was the
making of a good actor. The criticism made an impression
upon me, who remembered the man and the name. Little
did I imagine then that in seven years my beloved
companion would be one of the victims of our
<pb id="wise94" n="94"/>
great national tragedy, or that, at its close, the callow
stripling who played before us that night would shock
the civilized world with the awful assassination of the
President. </p>
        <p>And now we come to the antithesis of all these happy
incidents. I have dwelt upon him at length with a
purpose,  -  he illustrated a peculiar phase of that civilization. 
Gentle as was that brother,  -  tender and loving
as he was to every one, devoted as a slave to his father,
deferential to his mother as if she had been a queen,
courteous and considerate towards the humblest servant
who ministered to his wants, honored and beloved by
everybody with whom he was thrown,  -  he was
nevertheless as fearless and uncompromising in certain
things as the fiercest knight who ever entered the lists.
He was, more emphatically than any man I ever knew,
the type of the class to which he belonged. He had been
educated in a school, at home and abroad, which not
only recognized the code duello, but accepted it as the
most rational mode of settling private differences.</p>
        <p>Of private differences personal to himself, my brother
had none. But father's reputation was the object of his
care above all others. On one occasion, when asked if his
heart had not yet been touched by woman, he replied, 
“No. My love for father  -  my desire for his
advancement  -  is the absorbing passion of my life. It
leaves no place for other deep affection. Female society is
indeed most attractive, but beside the other feeling, it is
a mere passing thought. I have no time for other 
serious love.” What an odd speech for the latter half of
the nineteenth century! Does it not sound mediæval?</p>
        <p>In the course of public discussion of public men,
there were criticisms of his father,  -  some facetious,
some severe. Concerning such, he had determined upon
a line
<pb id="wise95" n="95"/>
of action. Quick and hot and insulting came the reply to
every comment of this kind. Then followed, in due
course, the inquiry as to authorship, the avowal, the
demand of a retraction, the refusal, the challenge, the
duel. To the young editor, there was nothing alarming
in all this, there was nothing improper, there was
nothing unexpected. He had resolved that whoever
criticised his father should do so at his peril, should be insulted,
should be fought if it was so desired, and that to this
line of conduct he would adhere until such criticism
stopped, or he himself stopped a bullet.</p>
        <p>How absurd, how utterly Quixotic, such a course seems
to us to-day! Yet, in that time, not only was it deemed
no absurdity, but a great number of the community, in
fact a majority, regarded it as natural and manly,
evincing chivalry of the very highest order.</p>
        <p>Now, whatever other commodities may have been
scarce in Virginia markets of that time, fighting was as
easily obtainable as blackberries in June. Not many
young Virginians were his peers in intellect and
accomplishments, but there were many who were as brave and no
more intimidated by the danger of a duel. Many such
were opposed to him in politics, and were unwilling to
forego, from any fear of fighting, the decided expression
of their opinions on politics in general, or of his father
in particular.</p>
        <p>The result was that he had all the dueling the most
enthusiastic advocate of the sport could desire, for the
next two years. A cabal of father's political antagonists
held a conclave, if reports were true, and determined
that the son was an obstacle in their way, to be
disposed of, in furtherance of their arrangements to
defeat the father. Under these refined, humane, and
highly civilized conditions, my brother Jennings
actually fought eight duels in
<pb id="wise96" n="96"/>
less than two years. It all seems ludicrous to us, in our
prosaic, commonplace, and common-sense way of looking 
at things nowadays; but it was no joke to me, when every two or
three months I missed my beloved companion from his room
and bed for several days, only to learn that he was engaged in
fighting another duel. Pitiful and anxious indeed were the
days and nights passed on such occasions, waiting to know the
result. To me it was an enigma past my comprehension. What
it was all about, I could not understand. I would read, and
read again, the publications leading to these fearful duels, and
for the life of me I could not comprehend what there was in
them to drive men to seek each other's lives. I could not
conceive the mental or moral processes by which my sweet
brother, who never quarreled with anybody, could bring
himself, without anger, to shoot at another man with deadly
intent. And when he returned, laughing at the eagerness of my
embraces and welcome, and apparently bearing no ill-will
towards anybody or anything on earth, and when I saw him
say his prayers at night, and go to church, and mingle in gay
society, just as he had done before, the mystery only deepened.</p>
        <p>My brother most certainly seemed to bear a charmed
life, for no one ever hit him in these many encounters. On
the other hand, it was no mystery to me that he hit nobody
himself, for I knew that a more execrable shot never went
afield. Sometimes, after this abominable dueling began, we
practiced with dueling-pistols. His foreign education had
trained him only in the use of the broad sword and the foils,
and these were not American weapons. On several occasions,
I saw enough of his bad marksmanship to know that if he
hit anybody it would be by accident; for he was both
inexpert and inapt with firearms and I easily outstripped
him in marksmanship.</p>
        <pb id="wise97" n="97"/>
        <p>The thing went on; duel after duel occurred. In one of
them, the gallant fellow, after his opponent fired, discharged
his pistol in the air, because his adversary was near-sighted
and at his mercy. In another, after ineffectual exchange of
shots and the customary palaver, matters had been
adjusted. At last, on another occasion, the antagonists had
actually started to leave the field, when his adversary
demanded another shot. His demand was acceded to, and at
the next fire my brother succeeded in hitting him, and
seriously wounded him. Little credit he deserved for
marksmanship; it was another instance like that of the
shooter portrayed in “Punch,” in which a sportsman, hitting
a bird after many failures, appealed to the Scotch game-keeper: 
“Ah, Sandy, I hit that one.” “Yes, sir,” was the reply,
“they will fly into it sometimes.” But whether designed or
accidental, this last performance, after making a great
hubbub for a few days, resulted in giving him a breathing-spell,
and he had no more duels prior to the outbreak of the
war.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER VIII</head>
        <head>UNVEILING OF WASHINGTON'S STATUE, AND REMOVAL OF
MONROE'S REMAINS, 1859</head>
        <p>IN all her history, from the formation of the federal
government until the hour of secession, no year stands out
more prominently than the year 1858 as evidencing the
national patriotism of Virginia. To one participating in the
scenes enacted in Richmond, and listening to the speeches of
her leaders, the statement that within three years the old
commonwealth would renounce allegiance to the federal
Union would have seemed preposterous.</p>
        <p>The State, at great expense, had reared a noble
monument to the memory of George Washington. It consists of a
central shaft surmounted by an equestrian statue of
Washington, with six smaller plinths, on which are placed
heroic figures of Virginians, representing different periods of
her greatness.</p>
        <p>Not one of these men, was famous for deeds done on
behalf of Virginia alone. The fame of each and every one of
them rests upon public services, or sacrifices for the nation.</p>
        <p>Among such, Virginia finds her greatest names. There was
Washington, her son, father of his country; there, too, Andrew
Lewis; who penetrated the unexplored wilderness of the
Northwest and made it hers. Yet she joyously ceded all
claims upon it to the nation, as her contribution to perpetual
union and fraternity, imposing only the conditions that
slavery should never exist there,
<pb id="wise99" n="99"/>
and that alternate sections of land should be dedicated to
public education. There was also Patrick Henry, who roused
thirteen colonies to revolution with his immortal eloquence;
and George Mason, who drafted a bill of rights epitomizing
the aspirations and safeguards of republican institutions in
language which, from then until now, has furnished the
substance of the written charts of government of all the
newly admitted States; and Thomas Jefferson, sage,
philosopher, and seer, author of the Declaration of
Independence, the Statutes of Religious Liberty, and founder
of Virginia's university; and General Thomas Nelson, who
devoted his fortune to the Continental struggle, and trained
an American cannon upon his own house when it was the
headquarters of Cornwallis at Yorktown; and John
Marshall, who began his public career as captain in a
Virginia regiment, served at Valley Forge and Monmouth,
and afterwards, as Chief Justice of the United States, was
the peerless expounder of that Constitution which he had
fought to establish.</p>
        <p>Oh, what a galaxy of men, encompassing the very heavens
of our national life! What other commonwealth could
produce its like then? What other can produce it now? </p>
        <p>Is it surprising that the Virginians, whose State was
mother of the nation's father, whose great Chief Justice, the
youngest of the immortal group, was the lodestar of
constitutional construction, loved that Union and rejoiced
in it, and honored it from their hearts' inmost depths? </p>
        <p>In other States, jealousies and animosities against the
Union may have existed, but, up to that time at least, such
sentiments found little lodgment in the breasts of the
Virginians.</p>
        <p>With beating hearts and honest pride, they assembled
from every section, February 22, 1858, to unveil the
<pb id="wise100" n="100"/>
equestrian statue of Washington. The figures of
Henry and Jefferson had preceded that of
Washington, and were on their appropriate plinths.
Poor Crawford, the sculptor in charge of the work,
had died from over-exertion in Rome after the
Washington figure was cast and shipped to
America. The presence of his widow lent an
additional and pathetic interest to the scene about
to be enacted.</p>
        <p>The vessel bearing the statue arrived at
Richmond from Italy some weeks before the
unveiling. The male population of the city, men
and boys, dragged the statue through the streets
from the wharves to the Capitol grounds, a
distance of over a mile. Enthusiasm was
unbounded on every hand.</p>
        <p>Of all these new sights I there beheld, that
which captivated me most was the corps of cadets
of the Virginia Military Institute. The State owned
an arsenal at Lexington, in the valley between the
Blue Ridge and the Alleghanies. Prior to 1839, she
kept a guard at this arsenal. In that year, she
established there a military school, in charge of
Captain Francis H. Smith, a distinguished
graduate of West Point. It was organized strictly on
the lines of the United States Military Academy,
as to drill, discipline, tuition, and all else. At first
the number of cadets was limited to a few, who
received board and tuition free, and in return
guarded the property of the State, and agreed to
teach school for a certain period after graduation.
By degrees, a large number of cadets were
admitted upon condition that they pay for board and
tuition. The school grew; extensive buildings were
erected; and in 1858 the Virginia Military Institute
had over three hundred cadets, and was the best
establishment of the kind in the United States,
except the United States Military Academy. It
resembled the latter in everything but in the
liberality of appropriations,
<pb id="wise101" n="101"/>
and the assurance of an appointment to the army.
Its original superintendent remained in charge,
and he continued to hold the office for fifty years.
To this uniformity of administration much of the
high reputation of the school was no doubt
attributable.</p>
        <p>The appearance of the corps on the above
occasion, the first on which I ever saw it, was
sufficient to excite the wildest enthusiasm of a
small boy. Never before had I seen such trim, alert
figures; such clean, saucy-looking uniforms; such
machine-like precision and quickness of drill;
such silence and obedience. From the first day my
eye rested on the cadet corps, the height of boyish
ambition was to be a cadet. Four companies of
infantry and a section of artillery drawn by “rats” 
constituted the cadet outfit.</p>
        <p>The “rats” referred to were not genuine rats
like those attached to Cinderella's coach, but 
“plebes” or new cadets, who, until they remain a
year and hear “Auld Lang Syne” played at the
graduation exercises, are called “rats.” The only
thing about this fine body that struck me as in any
way lacking in soldierly appearance was the
commandant of the infantry battalion. He was not
my ideal of a soldier, either in military bearing, or
in the manner in which he gave his commands.
His uniform was not new; his old blue forage-cap
sat on the back of his head; and he stood like a
horse “sprung” in the knees. His commands were
given in a piping, whining tone, and he appeared to
be deeply intent upon his business, without paying
much regard to the onlookers. On the other hand,
the officer commanding the section of artillery was
the model of a martinet. He was petite, quick as a
lizard, straight as a ramrod, and his commands
were delivered like the crack of a whiplash. I
thought him a perfect commanding officer.</p>
        <pb id="wise102" n="102"/>
        <p>The cadets were quartered in the Richmond Lyceum.
When the ceremonies were over, the small boys collected
about the corps like flies about molasses, and, when the
cadets marched off to their quarters, followed them, I
among the foremost. I knew several of the cadets. When
the command was halted near its quarters, we boys
crowded around it in such a way that we inconvenienced
the officer in charge. He passed along the line, tapping us
back with the flat side of his sword, exclaiming in a
deprecatory voice, “Get away, little boys! Get away
get A-W-A-Y!” It was ludicrous, and I could detect
smiles, even on the faces of the thoroughly disciplined
cadets; but something in the manner of the officer made
the boys get away, and get away in a hurry.</p>
        <p>When the parade was dismissed, on inquiring about the
officers, I learned that the odd-looking commandant was
familiarly called “Old Jack;” that his real name was Major
Jackson; and that the cadets, while disposed to make light
of him for his eccentricities, dared not trifle with him. As to
the other officer, Major Gilham, all agreed that he was the
best drill-officer and tactician they had; that he was far
superior to Major Jackson; and they spoke with profound
respect of the infantry tactics of which he was the author.</p>
        <p>At the grand reception given that night by my father, I
again saw both these officers, and their bearing confirmed
me in the judgment that there was no question which was
the superior soldier. Major Jackson was plainly dressed,
wore coarse shoes, had a weary look in his blue eyes, took
very little part in conversation, seemed bored by the
entertainment, neither ate nor drank, and, after paying his
respects to the governor, and to General Winfield Scott,
commander-in-chief of the armies of the United States,
quietly disappeared. Colonel Gilham, on
<pb id="wise103" n="103"/>
the other hand, was urbane, ubiquitous, and remained
until the close of the entertainment.</p>
        <p>In after years, I had occasion to revise my opinion of the
relative ability of these two men, for Major Jackson was
none other than the immortal Stonewall; and Major
Gilham, while brave enough, never rose beyond the rank
of colonel, and retired from active service in 1862 to
resume his professorship at the Institute.</p>
        <p>And “Old Fuss and Feathers!”  -  bless his colossal old
soul! was ever a name more appropriately bestowed?   -  I
saw him also that day, for the first time. What a monster in
size he was! Never was uniform more magnificent; never
were feathers in cocked hat more profuse; never was sash
so broad and gorgeous. He was old and gouty, keen for
food, quick for drink, and thunderous of voice, large as a
straw-stack, and red as a boiled lobster. His talk was like
the roaring of a lion, his walk like the tread of the elephant.
No turkey-gobbler ever strutted or gobbled with more self-importance
than did the hero of Lundy's Lane. The women
flattered him, and he liked it. The men toasted him, and he
never refused to join or to respond. As long as he
remained, he was the cynosure of all present. When he
withdrew, a characteristic incident occurred. In the great
hallway, he called for his wraps and his galoshes. The
servants were quick to hurry forward with them. Several
cadets had been invited to the entertainment, and were
standing about awestruck in the presence of the
commander-in-chief.</p>
        <p>As the servants offered him his cloaks and overshoes,
he waved them away imperiously, and in his commanding
voice thundered out, “No, no! Let the cadets attend upon
me. Here, you cadets! Help me with my overshoes and
wraps. It is not every day that I can get such orderlies,
and it is not every day that you can wait
<pb id="wise104" n="104"/>
upon the general of the armies.” The boys leaped forward to
his assistance, delighted at such distinguished condescension,
and soon had him fully caparisoned. With his
arms about their shoulders, he laboriously descended the
sleety marble steps, shouted back some cheery words to
those watching on the portico, entered the fine carriage which
awaited him, slammed the door, and drove away, snorting
and puffing, in all his majesty.</p>
        <p>What a wonderful mixture of gasconade, ostentation, fuss,
feathers, bluster, and genuine soldierly talent and courage
was this same Winfield Scott of blessed memory! A great
smoking mass of flesh and blood! So devoted to epicurean
enjoyment that, even when he was candidate for President,
he lugged into his public papers allusion to his “hasty plate
of soup.” But for all that, a splendid soldier in the service of
his country for over fifty years. What a contrast he presented
to his favorite companion,   -  gentle, quiet Colonel Lee! </p>
        <p>It was days after this glorious celebration before its
excitements subsided sufficiently to enable me to
concentrate my reluctant mind upon Latin, French, and
mathematics.</p>
        <lb/>
        <p>Delightful, inspiring to patriotism, exhilarating, as were
the ceremonies at the unveiling of the Washington statue,
the scenes enacted in Richmond in July of that same year
outstripped them far in gorgeousness, and in the display of
fraternal feelings between the North and South.</p>
        <p>In the month of April, the Virginia legislature made
provision for the removal of the remains of Ex-president
James Monroe from the city of New York to the capital of
Virginia.</p>
        <p>Mr. Monroe had been buried in New York with
appropriate honors, interred in a private cemetery vault,
purchased
<pb id="wise105" n="105"/>
by his daughters, and there his ashes “awaited the
call of his native State” for twenty-seven years. At the time
the Virginia legislature made that call, his only surviving
descendants were three children of Mrs. Gouverneur. The
eldest, bearing his name, deeply afflicted by Providence, and
the second, a daughter, spoke through their father, Samuel
L. Gouverneur of Frederick County, Maryland; the third,
Samuel L. Gouverneur, Jr., spoke for himself. All assented
to the removal.</p>
        <p>The public announcement of the intention of his native
State to reclaim his ashes was the signal for a great
outburst of patriotic fervor in Virginia and in New York.</p>
        <p>Virginians residing in New York held meetings looking to
the disinterment there with appropriate ceremonies; the
city authorities at once passed the necessary resolutions.
Committees of conference were sent from Virginia. A
steamship was chartered to convey the remains, and the
New York military vied with one another for the honor of
acting as military escort. So great was the enthusiasm that it
culminated in a tender, by the Seventh Regiment of New
York, of their escort of the remains at their own expense, as
a guard of honor from New York to Richmond. This being
accepted, that splendid body of citizen soldiery chartered
the Ericcson steamer, and made ready for their patriotic
pilgrimage.</p>
        <p>The Richmond military were all busy with preparations
to receive their guests. The public grounds, the Capitol,
all public places, were filled with workmen erecting arches,
painting patriotic emblems, hanging thousands of colored
lanterns, and draping the city in mourning. The Fourth
of July fell that year upon Sunday. Consequently, the
arrival of the remains and the military escort was timed
for Monday, July 5. At daybreak and at sunrise the
Fayette Artillery, a local volunteer organization, fired the
<pb id="wise106" n="106"/>
national salute in the Capitol Square. At six o'clock, the
flags upon the public buildings, hotels, and shipping were
placed at half mast. The citizens were still engaged draping
their residences and places of business in the habiliments
of mourning. The Henrico Light Dragoons, the Public Guard,
the First Virginia Regiment, the Young Guard Battalion,
and the Rocky Ridge Rifles from the neighboring town of
Manchester formed line at seven o'clock and marched to
Rocketts, the landing place of the steamer Jamestown,
bearing the remains of President Monroe. Upon the
neighboring hillsides were gathered thousands of people,
men and women, white and black, of every condition in life.
Carriages, omnibuses, and baggage-wagons were drawn up
in long lines near the wharf; marshals and field-officers rode
hither and thither giving orders, and scattering the crowds
to right and left before them. Flaunting flags, and signals at
half mast, were visible everywhere; civic organizations with
bands and banners followed the military. The whole
community was in a ferment of expectation.</p>
        <p>“The day opened clear and beautiful, the intense heat
relieved by a pleasant southerly breeze. The local troops
stacked arms, and waited the arrival of the steamers.</p>
        <p>“The Jamestown came in sight at ten minutes past
eight o'clock, and slowly approached the wharf, with flags
and signals at half halliards. As the ship came alongside
her wharf, the committee and guests from New York stood
on the upper deck, and regarded with much interest the
exciting scene on shore.</p>
        <p>“The remains of President Monroe having been removed
from the forward saloon to the upper deck and placed under
an awning, the governor and mayor proceeded on board the
Jamestown and received the guests and an interchange of
friendly greetings took place. The
<pb id="wise107" n="107"/>
remains were attended by a detachment of the New York
National Guard, but after their arrival, they were relieved
by a platoon of the Richmond Grays, detailed for the
purpose.</p>
        <p>“The steamer Glen Cove, with the New York Seventh
Regiment on board, came in sight at ten minutes past ten,
and, despite the solemnity of the occasion, the younger
portion of the assembled throng gave vent to their feelings
in a cheer. As the steamer approached the wharf, her
appearance was really imposing. The soldiers, with their
glittering arms, were paraded ready for debarkation, while
the splendid band of the Seventh, stationed on the forward
deck, played a solemn dirge.</p>
        <p>“The Virginia troops were drawn up in line, facing the
river, ready to receive the visitors, and without unnecessary
delay the Seventh left the boat, and passed on to the right
of the line, the Virginia military presenting arms as they
marched by.</p>
        <p>“The hearse, drawn by six white horses, attended by six
negro grooms dressed in white, now proceeded to the
steamer, and, under the direction of the pall-bearers,
received the remains. The troops presented arms, flags were
lowered, drums rolled, and trumpets sounded, after which
the Armory Band played a dirge, while the hearse proceeded
to its place in the line. Minute-guns were fired and bells
tolled, continuing during the progress of the procession to
the cemetery.</p>
        <p>“The procession moved at half past eleven o'clock.</p>
        <p>“The route lay directly up Main Street to Second, down
Second to Cary, and thence out to Hollywood. All along the
route of the procession, a distance of more than two miles,
the sidewalks were lined with spectators; every balcony,
porch, and window overlooking the street, every available
spot on the line, was crowded with ladies, children,
<pb id="wise108" n="108"/>
and men. The minute-guns continued firing, the bells
in the vicinity of the route tolled, answered by peals from
others in the distance; business was universally suspended;
and the attention of the entire community was
concentrated on the imposing pageant in honor of the
memory of the illustrious man whose bones were now on
the way to their earthly resting-place.</p>
        <p>“The troops marched with reversed arms, and the bands
played music appropriate to the occasion.</p>
        <p>“The grave of Monroe is located in the southwest corner
of Hollywood, on an eminence commanding a magnificent
view of the city, the river, and the environs.</p>
        <p>“After the line was formed around the grave, the coffin
was removed from the hearse. When the remains were
lowered into the grave, the troops presented arms, the
Seventh Regiment rested on arms, and the band played a
dirge. This portion of the ceremony being over, the governor
appeared on the front of the platform and spoke:  -  </p>

in their last resting-place with becoming ceremonies.</p>

                <p>“‘Venerable Patriot!  -  he found his rest soon after he
retired. On the 4th of July, 1831, twenty-seven years ago, he
departed, like Jefferson and Adams, on the anniversary of
the Independence. His spirit was caught up to heaven, and
his ashes were enshrined in the soil of his adopted State,
whose daughter he had married,  -  of that
<pb id="wise109" n="109"/>
grand and prosperous Commonwealth whose motto is 
“Excelsior,” our sister New York, the Empire State of the
United States of America. Virginia was the natural mother
of Monroe, and New York was his mother-in-law,  -  Virginia
by birth and baptism, New York by marriage and burial.
This was well, for he gave to her invaders the gloved hand of
“bloody welcome” at Trenton, and New York gave to him a 
“hospitable grave.” Virginia respectfully allowed his ashes to lie long enough to
consecrate her sister's soil, and now has dutifully taken
them to be “earth to her earth and ashes to her ashes,” at home
in the land of his cradle. New York has graciously bowed
to their family request, has disinterred the remains, has
laid them out in state, and has sent the elite of her chivalry
to escort them with banners and trumpets, in military
and civic procession, to our cemetery. Who knows
this day, here around this grave, that New York is of the
North, and that Virginia is of the South? “The North has
given up,” and “the South shall not hold back,” and they are
one, even as all the now proud and preëminent thirty-two
are one.</p>
                <p>“‘We affectionately, then, welcome New York, and cordially
embrace her around the grave of him, Virginia's
son, to whom she gave a resting-place in life and in death. And
now I call the minister of God to pray for his blessing on this
passing scene. I ask the righteous man to pray fervently and
effectually for the example of this patriot's life to 
be blessed to the youth of our country,  -  
blessed to the people of this generation; blessed to the
public men of New York and Virginia and the United
States; blessed to the cause of truth and justice and human
freedom; and blessed to the perpetual strength, peace,
liberty, and union of this confederacy, “one and indivisible,
now and forever!” May the good which this
<pb id="wise110" n="110"/>
patriot did be revived by the disinterment of his bones,
and may monuments of wisdom and virtue like his be so
multiplied and raised around yonder Capitol of the Mother
of States, that the very statues of her heroes and
sages and patriots dead and departed shall be the moral
guide-marks of her living and active servants, to preserve
this Commonwealth, untorn in destiny and untarnished in
glory, to “the last syllable of recorded time,” when the
tenants of Hollywood, this beautiful city of the dead, shall
rise to immortal life!’”</p>

        <p>Of these inspiring scenes I was a silent but interested
witness. Every manifestation of patriotic and fraternal
feeling thrilled me to my inmost soul. From time to time I
had heard the mutterings of discontent and the prophesies
of approaching conflict, but the scenes which I
beheld, and the burning words and thundering shouts I
heard that day, put at rest the last feeling of fear for the
future of my country.</p>
        <p>At the close of the ceremonies at the grave, the
artillery, stationed outside the inclosure, fired three
salvos.</p>
        <p>Upon the day following, the delirious city was given a
specimen of the drill and efficiency of the glorious Seventh
Regiment. Its appearance and perfection in drill and
discipline were beyond all expectations. After a review by
the governor, Colonel Duryee drilled the regiment, without
music, in various battalion movements.</p>
        <p>I stood agape at every evolution. The Virginia troops,
which I had theretofore regarded as perfection itself,
seemed to me now a mere incongruous lot of painted toys,
contrasted with this homogeneous mass of military, neat,
brilliant in cleanliness, and absolutely without gaudiness. In
the Richmond regiment no two companies were of the
same size, and no two uniformed alike. The Grays were
gray, the Blues were blue, the Montgomery Guard was
<pb id="wise111" n="111"/>
green as the waters of Niagara, the Riflemen blue and
green, the Young Guard blue and red. One company had
plumes of white, another short pompons, a third red
and white plumes. When they were drawn up in line, they
looked deplorably irregular, contrasted with the absolute
uniformity of the handsome Seventh.</p>
        <p>It seemed incredible that I, a protégé, in fact a veteran,
of the Richmond military,  -  I, who until now had looked
upon the First Virginia Regiment as the finest body of
troops on earth,  -  could come to regard it as almost
contemptible in the short space of twenty-four hours.</p>
        <p>Yet there were others like me.</p>
        <p>Said one paper:  -  </p>
        <p>“The recent visit of the Seventh Regiment of New York to
our city, it is to be hoped, will have a good effect on our
volunteer organization. We could but regard the simple
uniform of the entire regiment, and the neat and
unostentatious dress of its officers, as presenting a wide
contrast with the parti-colored line of our volunteers, and
the fine decorations and pompous display which meet the
eye in surveying our regimental parades.</p>
        <p>“We have not a doubt that the volunteer force of the city
would be strengthened, would be increased in numbers
and improved in discipline, if they would consolidate
themselves into one regiment, abandon their uniforms,
and adopt a new and plain dress for the whole body of
soldiers.”</p>
        <p>Little did the writer know, and less did the Seventh
Regiment suspect, that upon this visit they fixed, in the
Southern mind, a type of uniform which, within three
years, was substantially adopted by the Confederate
States.</p>
        <p>Three years after this date, the First Virginia Regiment
had fought in the battle of Manassas; and the Seventh
<pb id="wise112" n="112"/>
was encamped at Arlington Heights, but fifteen miles' 
distant, being part of a hostile force moving against Mount
Vernon and Richmond. Such was the rapid march of events.</p>
        <p>After the scenes above described had closed, and the
military had departed, the remainder of the year glided
away uneventfully; but the glorious memories of July 5
lingered, and all Richmond was busy in the effort to have a
real military force such as it had seen, and to abandon the
past methods of its volunteer system. As for patriotic
national feeling, it is safe to say that, when the year 1859
opened, in spite of Southern fire-eaters and Northern
fanatics, there were not, in the whole State of Virginia, five
thousand men who had any sort of sympathy with the idea of secession. </p>

        <head>CHAPTER IX</head>
        <head>THE JOHN BROWN RAID</head>
        <p>THE declamation against disunion and the mutual
pledges of fraternal love between North and South, which
attended the banquet to the Seventh New York Regiment in
Richmond, arose in great part from a knowledge of sectional
feeling, threats of disunion, and of partisan recriminations
between politicians, but too familiar to all 
who spoke. At the same time, an intense
antagonism to slavery existed in sections of the North and
West, accompanied by the determination to abolish it by
any means in their power, lawful or unlawful.</p>
        <p>Little effort has been made to record the fact, yet it is
nevertheless true, that many Southern men were working
earnestly and loyally towards the adoption of some plan of
gradual emancipation which, while it would free the slave,
would not destroy the labor system of the South or leave the
slave-owner impoverished. The abolitionist did not believe
this. He was uncharitable in his judgment of the humanity
of the slave-owner; and his demand that a difficult problem,
requiring time for its solution, should be disposed of at once
and in his way  -  <hi><foreign lang="fr">per fas aut nefas</foreign></hi>  -  was strongly
provoking. The attitude of the people of the North generally
concerning escaped slaves seemed to the Southerners
inconsistent, and tended to increase the friction between the
sections. The people of the North professed great reverence
for their constitutional obligations, and constantly
disclaimed a purpose to
<pb id="wise114" n="114"/>
interfere with slavery where it existed. They insisted that they
were only opposed to the spread of slavery into the free States
or Territories, and would respect the rights of the slave-owner
where slavery already existed. Yet, whenever a slave escaped,
the Northern community in which he sought asylum was
practically unanimous in thinking it a great outrage and
hardship if he was pursued into their territory and taken back to
his owner. It is often said that, before the war, only a small
portion of the Northern people belonged to the abolition party.
Whether that was true or not, it is certain that a vast majority of
every Northern community was in sympathy with obstacles
thrown in the way of recapturing escaped slaves. Everybody,
North and South, was well aware that in many instances the
slave was enticed from his home by abolition emissaries. Yet
when he reached the North, thousands who would not have
gone South to incite him to escape did all they could to make
the work of the emissaries effectual.</p>
        <p>In such a condition of affairs, the practical difference
between the abolitionist and the sympathizer, to the man who
lost his slave and could not recover it, was very nebulous.
From certain descriptions of these times, one would think that
all the threats and taunts were made, and all the provocations
were given, by the Southerners. At this late day, such a
contention is nonsense. No more defiant, vindictive, or
aggressive speech was ever made than that of Charles Sumner,
senator from Massachusetts, in the United States Senate in
1859, on the “Barbarism of Slavery.” He had a personal
grievance, it is true; he had been brutally assaulted in that
chamber years before, and his speech bore every mark of being
the result of</p>
        <q direct="unspecified">
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“The patient watch and vigil long</l>
            <l>Of him who treasures up a wrong.”</l>
          </lg>
        </q>
        <pb id="wise115" n="115"/>
        <p>It is not justifying the assault made upon Mr. Sumner by
Preston S. Brooks to say that no man ever did more to provoke
an attack upon himself than did Mr. Sumner. His speech in 1856
was able, studied in its malignity, and all the more provoking
from its strength. Nor was Sumner the only man of that class.
We may search through the congressional debates in vain for
more coarse and insulting language than that used by Senator
Ben Wade, of Ohio, upon the floor of the Senate. Every
opportunity was taken by him to lead the debates in the Senate
into sectional channels.</p>
        <p>Acquisition of Cuba is more advocated in the North to-day
than in the South. In 1860, the project was branded by the
Republicans in the Senate as a slaveholder's scheme for
securing additional representation. The proposition then made
by Senator Slidell, to purchase Cuba for thirty million dollars,
was flouted by Wade and his party as a mere ruse for providing
“niggers for the niggerless.” Jealousy, antagonism, and hatred
between the sections animated the representatives of both, and
neither lost any opportunity to vituperate and recriminate.</p>
        <p>While this was the condition of feeling among the
politicians, it had not yet extended to the masses. For several
years, the conflict had been in progress between the free-soilers
and pro-slavery men in Kansas. The Virginians were
conservative in their views about that struggle. They realized
that the men engaged in it on both sides were a bloodthirsty
and disreputable lot. Leading Virginians, supporters of Mr.
Buchanan, warned him not to go too far in subserviency to the
extreme pro-slavery men, or to force a pro-slavery constitution
upon the State. Virginians, while they heard of the fanatical
and bloody butcheries committed in Kansas by one “Old
Brown,” and men of his class, also heard of equally
<pb id="wise116" n="116"/>
horrid crimes committed by the pro-slavery men. They
held both in abhorrence, and indorsed neither.</p>
        <p>It was not the Kansas trouble that occasioned them
concern, or excited their apprehensions concerning the
Union. It was the announcement by Abraham Lincoln, of
Illinois, in his debate with Douglas in 1858, that the Union
was a house divided against itself, and that slavery and
union could not coexist. It was declarations like those of
Senator Seward, of New York, that “an irrepressible
conflict” existed between the North and South. It was
speeches of men like Charles Sumner, breathing deep
malice against the South, and denouncing it in polished
oratory. These and a hundred others like them from men
of the North, less prominent but not less representative,
made Virginians realize that the times were perilous, and
say to themselves: “If this temple of union is divided
against itself and must fall, if slavery and union cannot
coexist, if an irrepressible conflict is upon us, if Mr.
Sumner expresses the state of Northern sentiment, it is
manifest that the hour of disunion is here. The only thing
remaining for us to do is to begin to consider which side
of us the line of cleavage shall come, north or south.”</p>
        <p>Virginians were no more angels or philanthropists than
people to the north or to the south of them. They were
moved by their affections, their interest, and their resentments, 
just as humanity is moved to-day. Their strongest
social ties were with the Southern people. They had a
great part of their wealth invested in slaves; and, while
far in advance of the States to the south of them in the
desire for some plan of gradual emancipation, they were
not willing to have their property unceremoniously jostled
out of their hands without compensation, to gratify Mr.
Lincoln, Mr. Seward, Mr. Sumner, Mr. Wade, or the
<pb id="wise117" n="117"/>
constituencies which they represented. They thought the
conditions of future association announced by these men
a rather high and hasty price for the privilege. And, lastly,
their very love of the Union inflamed them against men
who, as they viewed it, were making union impossible,
except on terms involving humiliating surrender to the
abolitionist.</p>
        <p>It is often said by writers that Mr. Lincoln and Mr.
Seward, when they spoke of a divided house, the impossibility 
of the coexistence of union and slavery, and the
“irrepressible conflict,” were simply stating abstract
propositions, and did not mean that they would counsel a
physical assault upon slavery or the enactment of
unconstitutional laws, and that their figures of speech
referred only to the logic of the political situation. Their
language may have been intended as statements of
abstract principles; but, assuredly, what they said was
susceptible of, and received, quite another construction.
By their followers and opponents they were understood as
declaring war on slavery, immediate and uncompromising.</p>
        <p>As for Mr. Sumner and Mr. Wade, nobody pretended
that they meant anything else. The Southerners may
have been more demonstrative and noisy in their
quarrels; but they were not a whit more stubborn,
aggressive, defiant, or irritating than the men of the
North. The Southern man scoffed the pretense that the
Northern man really desired union, when he refused to
subordinate his demands concerning slavery to any other
consideration. The Northern man denounced the
Southern man as hating the Union, because he would not
consent to remain in it, even if he believed that the North,
while professing the purpose of respecting his right, at
heart intended to deprive him of his slave property on the
first opportunity.</p>
        <p>This political warfare was very intense in 1858-59.
The
<pb id="wise118" n="118"/>
debates between Lincoln and Douglas on the slavery question,
in the autumn of 1858, kindled the fires of slavery and anti-slavery
discussion on every hilltop. In 1859, the awful tragedy
in which Senator Broderick was killed by Judge Terry in
California, in a duel growing out of the slavery question, lent
fuel to the flame.</p>
        <p>Just at this crisis an event occurred, which was made a test, in
the mind of the average Virginian, of the real feeling of the
North towards the South. After it happened, he set himself to
determining what was the real meaning, the real tendency, and
what was to be the outcome, of the doctrines announced by Mr.
Lincoln, Mr. Seward, Mr. Sumner, and others during the years
1858 and 1859. He believed that in the expressions of the North,
concerning this event, he would find the best evidence of what
their real sentiments were towards the South.</p>
        <p>The attack of John Brown upon Harper's Ferry came upon
Virginia like a clap of thunder out of a clear sky.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon of October 17, 1859, I was passing along
Main Street in Richmond, when I observed a crowd of people
gathering about the bulletin board of a newspaper. In those
days, news did not travel so rapidly as now; besides which, the
telegraph lines at the place from which the news came were cut.</p>
        <p>The first report read:  -  </p>
        <p>“There is trouble of some sort at Harper's Ferry. A party of
workmen have seized the Government Armory.”</p>
        <p>Soon another message flashed: “The men at Harper's Ferry
are not workmen. They are Kansas border ruffians, who have
attacked and captured the place, fired upon and killed several
unarmed citizens, and captured Colonel Washington and other
prominent citizens of the neighborhood. We cannot
understand their plans or ascertain their numbers.”</p>
        <pb id="wise119" n="119"/>
        <p>By this time an immense throng had assembled, agape with
wonder.</p>
        <p>Naturally reflecting that the particulars of an outbreak like
this would first reach the governor, I darted homeward. I found
my father in the library, roused from his afternoon siesta, in the
act of reading the telegrams which he had just received. They
were simply to the effect that the arsenal and government
property at Harper's Ferry were in possession of a band of
rioters, without describing their character. I promptly and
breathlessly told what I had seen on the bulletin boards, and,
while I was hurriedly delivering my news, other messengers
arrived with telegrams to the same effect as those posted in the
streets. The governor was by this time fully aroused. He was
prompt in action. His first move was to seize the Virginia code,
take a reference, and indite a telegram addressed to Colonel
John Thomas Gibson, of Charlestown, commandant of the
militia regiment within whose territory the invasion had
occurred, directing him to order out, for the defense of the
State, the militia under his command, and immediately report
what he had done.</p>
        <p>Within ten minutes after the receipt of the telegram, these
instructions were on the way. Similar instructions were flashed
to Colonel Robert W. Baylor, of the Third Regiment of Militia
Cavalry.</p>
        <p>The military system of the State was utterly inefficient,
having nothing but skeleton organization. The telegrams
continued to come rapidly, describing a condition of
excitement amounting to a panic in the neighborhood of
Harpers Ferry. The numbers of the attacking force were
exaggerated, until some reports placed them as high as a
thousand. The ramifications of the conspiracy were of course
unknown.</p>
        <p>I was promptly dispatched to summon the Secretary of
<pb id="wise120" n="120"/>
the Commonwealth, the Adjutant-General, and the colonel and
adjutant of the First Regiment. I found almost immediately all
but the adjutant, for whom I searched long. At last this young
gentleman was discovered, all unconscious of impending
trouble, playing dominoes in a German restaurant, and regaling
himself with the then comparatively new drink of “lager.”
Hurrying back with my last capture, we found the others
assembled, and instantly the adjutant received instructions to
order out the First Virginia Regiment at eight o'clock P. M.,
armed and equipped, and provided with three days' rations, at
the Washington depot.</p>
        <p>In those days, the track ran down the centre of the street,
and the depot was in the most popular portion of the city.
News of the disturbance having gone abroad it was an easy
task to assemble the regiment, and, by the time appointed, all
Richmond was on hand to learn the true meaning of the
outbreak, and witness the departure of the troops. Company
after company marched through the streets to the rendezvous.
The governor transferred his headquarters to the depot, where
he and his staff awaited the last telegrams which might arrive
before his departure. Telegrams were sent to the President and
to the governor of Maryland for authority to pass through the
District of Columbia and Maryland with armed troops, that
route being the quickest to Harper's Ferry. The dingy old
depot, generally so dark and gloomy at this hour of the night,
was brilliantly illuminated. The train of cars, which was to
transfer the troops, stood in the middle of the street. The
regiment was formed as the companies arrived, and was resting
in the badly lighted street, awaiting final orders.</p>
        <p>The masses of the populace swarming about the soldiers
presented every variety of excitement, interest, and curiosity.</p>
        <pb id="wise121" n="121"/>
        <p>As for me, my “mannishness” (there is no other word
expressive of it) was such that, forgetting what an insignificant
chit I was, I actually attempted to accompany the
troops.</p>
        <p>Transported by enthusiasm, I rushed home, donned a little
blue jacket with brass buttons and a navy cap, selected a
Virginia rifle nearly half as tall again as myself, rigged myself
with a powder-horn and bullets, and, availing myself of the
darkness, crept into the line of K Company. The file-closers
and officers knew me, and indulged me to the extent of not
interfering with me, never doubting the matter would adjust
itself. Other small boys, who got a sight of me standing there,
were variously affected. Some were green with envy, while
others ridiculed me with pleasant suggestions concerning what
would happen when father caught me.</p>
        <p>In time, the order to embark was received. I came to 
“attention” with the others, went through the orders, marched
into the car, and took my seat. It really looked as if the plan
was to succeed. Alas and alas for these hopes! One
incautious utterance had thwarted all my plans. When I went
home to caparison myself for war, the household had been too
much occupied to observe my preparations. I succeeded in
donning my improvised uniform, secured my arms, and had
almost reached the outer door of the basement, when I
encountered Lucy, one of the slave chambermaids.</p>
        <p>“Hi! Mars' John. Whar is you gwine?” exclaimed Lucy
surprised.</p>
        <p>“To Harper's Ferry,” was the proud reply, and off I sped.</p>
        <p>“I declar', I b'leeve that boy thinks hisself a man, sho' nuff,
said Lucy, as she glided into the house. It was not long before
she told Eliza, the housekeeper, who in
<pb id="wise122" n="122"/>
turn hurried to my invalid mother with the news. She
summoned Jim, the butler, and sent him to father with the
information.</p>
        <p>Now Jim, the butler, was one of my natural enemies.
However the Southern man may have been master of the negro,
there were compensatory processes whereby certain negroes
were masters of their masters' children. Never was autocracy
more absolute than that of a Virginia butler. Jim may have
been father's slave, but I was Jim's minion, and felt it. There
was no potentate I held in greater reverence, no tyrant whose
mandates I heard in greater fear, no ogre whose grasp I should
have felt with greater terror. This statement may not be fully
appreciated by others, but will touch a responsive chord in the
heart of every Southern-bred man who passed his youth in a
household where “Uncle Charles,” or “Uncle Henry,” or 
“Uncle Washington,” or uncle somebody wielded the sceptre of
authority as family butler. Bless their old souls, dead and gone,
what did they want with freedom? They owned and
commanded everything and everybody that came into their
little world. Even their own masters and mistresses were
dependent upon them to an extent that only increased their
sense of their own importance. What Southern boy will ever
forget the terrors of that frown which met him at the front door
and scanned his muddy foot-marks on the marble steps? What
roar was ever more terrible  -  what grasp more icy or relentless  -  
than those of his father's butler surprising him in the cake box
or the preserve-jar? What criminal, dragged to justice, ever
appeared before the court more thoroughly cowed into
subjection than the Southern boy led before the head of the
house in the strong grip of that domestic despot?</p>
        <p>“What!” exclaimed the governor, on hearing Jim's
<pb id="wise123" n="123"/>
report of my escapade, “is that young rascal really trying to
go? Hunt him up, Jim! Capture him! Take away his arms, and
march him home in front of you!” Laughing heartily, he
resumed his work, well knowing that Jim understood his orders
and would execute them.</p>
        <p>Think of such authority given to a negro, just when John
Brown was turning the heads of the slaves with ideas of their
own importance! Is it not monstrous? I was sitting in a car,
enjoying the sense of being my country's defender starting for
the wars, when I recognized a well known voice in the
adjoining car, inquiring, “Gentlemen, is any ov you seed
anythin' ov de Gov'ner's little boy about here? I'm a-lookin' fur
him under orders to take him home.”</p>
        <p>I shoved my long squirrel-rifle under the seats and followed
it, amid the laughter of those about me. I heard the dread
footsteps approach, and the inquiry repeated. No voice
responded; but, by the silence and the tittering, I knew I was
betrayed. A great, shiny black face, with immense whites to
the eyes, peeped almost into my own, and, with a broad grin,
said, “Well, I declar'! Here you is at las'! Cum out, Mars'
John.” But John did not come. Jim, after coaxing a little, seized
a leg, and, as he drew me forth, clinging to my long rifle, he
exclaimed, “Well, 'fore de Lord! how much gun has dat boy
got, anyhow?” and the soldiers went wild with laughter.</p>
        <p>In full possession of the gun, and pushing me before him,
Jim marched his prisoner home. Once or twice I made a show
of resistance, but it was in vain. “Here, you boy! You better
mind how you cut yo' shines. You must er lost yo' senses. Yo'
father told me to take you home. I gwine do it, too, you
understand? Ef
<pb id="wise124" n="124"/>
you don't mind, I'll take you straight to him, and you know
and I know dat if I do, he'll tare you up alive fur botherin' him
with yo' foolishiss, busy ez he is.” I realized that it was even
so, and, sadly crestfallen, was delivered into my mother's
chamber, where, after a lecture upon the folly of my course, I
was kept until the Harpers Ferry expedition was fairly on its
way.</p>
        <p>What I learned of events at Harper's Ferry was derived
from the testimony of others. The First Virginia Regiment
reached Washington; but, on arrival there, the Richmond
troops returned, in consequence of the news of the capture of
all the insurgents at Harper's Ferry by the United States
Marines.</p>
        <p>This mad effort, so quickly and so terribly ended, was in
itself utterly insignificant. John Brown, its leader, was the
character of murderous monomaniac found at the head of
every such desperate venture. He has often been described as
a Puritan in faith and in type. It is not the province of this
writer to inquire into the correctness of this classification. He
was an uncompromising, blood thirsty fanatic. Born in the year
1800, he lived for fifty-six years without any sort of prominence.
He was never successful in business ventures, had farmed,
raised sheep, experimented in grape culture, made wine, and
engaged in growing and buying wool. At one time in his life,
and up to a period not long before his death, he was regarded
as an infidel by his associates, although at the time of his
death he declared himself a true believer. In October, 1855, he
appeared in Kansas, and at once became prominent as a leader
of armed bands of free-soilers. On his way to the defense of
Lawrence, in 1856, he heard of the destruction which had taken
place there, and turned back He resolved to avenge the acts of
the pro-slavery horde. He reckoned up that five free-soil men
had been killed,
<pb id="wise125" n="125"/>
and resolved that their blood should be expiated by an equal
number of victims.</p>
        <p>“Without the shedding of blood, there is no remission of
sins,” was a favorite text with Brown. He called for volunteers
to go on a secret expedition, and held a sort of Druidical
conclave before starting out. Four sons, a son-in-law, and two
others accompanied him. He had a strange power of imbuing
his dupes with his own fanaticism. When he avowed his
purpose to massacre the pro-slavery men living on
Pottawatomie Creek, one of his followers demurred. Brown
said, “I have no choice. It has been decreed by Almighty God
that I should make an example of these men.”</p>
        <p>On Saturday night, May 24, 1856, John Brown and his band
visited house after house upon Pottawatomie Creek, and,
calling man after man from his bed, murdered five in cold
blood. They first visited the house of Doyle, and compelled a
father and two sons to go with them. The next morning, the
father and one son were found dead in the road about two
hundred yards from the house. The father was “shot in the
forehead and stabbed in the breast. The son's head was cut
open, and there was a hole in his jaw as though made by a
knife.” The other son was found dead about a hundred and
fifty yards away in the grass, “his fingers cut off and his arms
cut off, his head cut open, and a hole in his breast.”</p>
        <p>Then they went to Wilkinson's, reaching there after
midnight. They forced open the door and ordered him to go
with them. His wife was sick and helpless, and begged them
not to take him away. Her prayer was of no avail. The next day
Wilkinson was found dead, “a gash in his head and side ”</p>
        <p>Their next victim was William Sherman. When found in
 the morning, his “skull was split open in two places,
<pb id="wise126" n="126"/>
and some brains were washed out. A large hole was cut in his
breast, and his left hand was cut off, a little piece of skin on
one side.” The execution was done with
short cutlasses brought from Ohio by Brown.</p>
        <p>“It was said that on the next morning, when the old man
raised his hands to Heaven to ask a blessing, they were still
stained with the dry blood of his victims.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2">1</ref> In his life by
Sanborn is a picture of him made about this time. It represents
him clean-shaven, and is, no doubt, the best picture extant by
which to study the physiognomy of a man capable of these
things.</p>
        <p>The tidings of these executions caused a cry of horror to go
up, even in bloody Kansas. The squatters on Pottawatomie
Creek, without distinction of party, met together and
denounced the outrage and its perpetrators. The free-state men
everywhere disavowed such methods. The governor sent a
military force to the Pottawatomie to discover the assassins.
The border ruffians took the field to avenge the massacre. One
Pate, feeling sure “Old Brown,” as he was called, was the
author of the outrage, went in search of him. Brown met him,
gave battle, and captured Pate and his command.</p>
        <p>Kansas was in a state of civil war; the governor ordered all
armed companies to disperse; and Colonel Sumner, with fifty
United States dragoons, forced Brown to release his prisoners,
but, although a United States marshal was with him, made no
arrests.</p>
        <p>This gives an insight into the character of John Brown, 
“the martyr.” Drunk with blood, inflamed by the death of one of
his sons in these border feuds, impelled to further deeds of
violence, no doubt, by the immunity secured from those
committed in Kansas, John Brown began, as early as the fall of
1857, in far-away
<note id="note2" n="2" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref2">1.  See Rhodes's <hi rend="italics">History of the United States</hi> vol. ii.
p. 162, etc.</note>
<pb id="wise127" n="127"/>
Kansas, to formulate his plans for an outbreak in Virginia. His
confederate Cook, in his confession, has left the whole story.</p>
        <p>Inducing Cook and eight or ten others, over whom he seems
to have <sic corr="possessed">possesed</sic> complete mastery, to join him, they started
east to attend a military school, as it was said, in Ashtabula
County, Ohio. The party united at Tabor, Iowa; there, in the
autumn of 1857, he revealed to this choice band that his
ultimate destination was the State of Virginia. His companions
demurred at first, but his strong will prevailed. They shipped
eastward two hundred Sharp's rides that had been sent to
Tabor for his Kansas enterprises the year previous. In May,
1858, Brown held a convention in Chatham, Canada, in a negro
church, with a negro preacher for president, and adopted a
constitution, which, without naming any territory to which it
was to apply, said: “We, the citizens of the United States, and
the oppressed people, who, etc., do ordain and establish for
ourselves the following provisional constitution and
ordinances.” This constitution, drawn up by John Brown, and
adopted by himself and half a dozen whites, and as many more
negroes in Canada, provided for legislative, executive, and
judicial branches of his government. It also provided for
treaties of peace, for a commander-in-chief, for communism of
property, for capturing and confiscating property, for the
treatment of prisoners, and for many absurd things besides.
After providing for the slaughter or the robbery of nearly
everybody in the United States who did not join the
organization, or voluntarily free their slaves and agree to keep
the peace, it culminated in a declaration:  -  </p>
        <p>“Art. 46. The foregoing articles shall not be construed so as
in any way to encourage the overthrow of
<pb id="wise128" n="128"/>
any state government, or of the general government of the
United States, and look to no dissolution of the Union, but
simply to amendment and repeal, and our flag shall be the
same as our fathers fought under in the Revolution.”</p>
        <p>No one can read the absurd jargon and believe the it was
the product of the same brain. Yet the last declaration of the
document is no more inconsistent with the facts than were the
repeated declarations of Brown after he had killed a number of
people at Harper's Ferry, that he proposed no violence. Nor
was it a whit more absurd than the pretended loyalty to State
and country of those who applauded his career of murder and
robbery, and treason both state and national.</p>
        <p>From May, 1858, to October, 1859, Brown pursued his
plans. He rented a farm near Harper's Ferry, and there
collected his arms and ammunition, without exciting suspicion. 
Delays occurred from lack of funds, etc. An
anonymous letter was sent to the Secretary of War, in the
spring of 1859, revealing his plans and purposes, but it seems
to have made no impression, although the Secretary of War
was a Southern man.</p>
        <p>Shortly before Brown made his demonstration, his cohorts,
to the number of twenty, black and white, assembled at his
farmhouse, and Sunday night, October 16, 1859, they
descended upon Harper's Ferry. About 10.30 P. M., they seized
and captured the watchman upon the railroad bridge across the
Potomac, and proceeded with him to the United States
armory, of which they took possession. Brown then sent forth
a party, headed by his lieutenant, Cook, to capture Colonel
Lewis Washington and Mr. Allstadt, leading citizens, who
were to be held as hostages. These gentlemen were compelled
to leave their beds, and accompany the invaders. Their
slaves, to the
<pb id="wise129" n="129"/>
number of thirty, were also compelled, against their will, to join
the party. Colonel Washington was a grandnephew of George
Washington, and a member of the staff of the governor of
Virginia.</p>
        <p>A sword of Frederick the Great, which had been presented to
George Washington, was “appropriated” for use by John
Brown. At this point we are introduced to the word selected
by Brown as descriptive of his taking other people's property.
He did not call it stealing, or robbery, or violent seizure. He
invariably referred to it as “appropriating,” and he pronounced
the word in a peculiar way,  -  putting the whole emphasis upon
the second syllable, as if it were a-<hi rend="italics">prop</hi>-riating. It was a
favorite and oft-repeated word with him. Here also we see, in
his appropriating the sword of Frederick the Great to be worn
by himself, that overshadowing egotism which was one of his
most prominent characteristics,  -  the inordinate vanity of
lunacy.</p>
        <p>It was an ill omen for his venture that the first person killed
by his band in the early morning was an inoffensive colored
man, a porter at the railroad station, who, being ordered to stop
and seeking to escape, was shot as he ran away. The next
victim was a citizen killed standing in his own door. The next,
a graduate of West Point, who, having heard of the trouble at
the Ferry, was shot from the armory as he rode into town on
horseback armed with a gun.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to describe the consternation which these
scenes produced among the citizens of Harper's Ferry.</p>
        <p>When the marines had completed their lawful and proper
work the following morning, John Brown lay on
the grass desperately wounded. His entire party was
killed, wounded, or captured, and the dead bodies of two
<pb id="wise130" n="130"/>
of his sons were beside him. It was a ghastly ending of a horrid
venture. As has been truly said of it by an eminent Northern
historian: “In the light of common sense, the plan was folly;
from a military point of view, it was absurd.” The first question
which arises in the mind of every one is, Did John Brown know
the nature of his own acts? As far as man may answer such a
question, he answered it himself on many occasions.</p>
        <p>While in the engine-house, receiving and returning the fire
of the marines, one of his prisoners, Mr. Daingerfield, told him
he was committing treason. One of his followers spoke up and
said: “Captain Brown, are we guilty of treason in what we are
doing? I did not so understand it.”</p>
        <p>“Certainly,” said Brown, and coolly kept up his fire.</p>
        <p>When examined after his surrender, and upon his trial, he
said he fully understood the nature of his acts and the
consequences, and peremptorily refused to permit any plea of
lunacy to be interposed in his defense.</p>
        <p>John Brown was tried for treason, murder, and inciting slaves
to insurrection. His trial occupied six days. He was defended by
able counsel, of his own selection, from Massachusetts and
Ohio. Every witness he desired summoned appeared. The
evidence of his guilt was overwhelming, and he was sentenced
to death. Any other penalty would have been a travesty of
justice, and a confession that the organized governments which
he assailed were mockeries, affording no protection to their
citizens against midnight murder and assassination. Did the
Virginians exult over the wretched victim of his own
lawlessness? NO!</p>
        <p>The “New York Herald” published the account of how
that verdict was received: “Not the slightest sound was
heard in the vast crowd, as this verdict was returned
<pb id="wise131" n="131"/>
and read; not the slightest expression of elation or triumph
was uttered from the hundreds present. . . .Nor was this strange
silence interrupted during the whole of the time occupied by
the forms of the court.”</p>
        <p>When Brown was asked if he had anything to say why
sentence should not be pronounced, he said among other
things: “I admire the truthfulness and candor of the greater
portion of the witnesses who have testified. . . . I feel entirely
satisfied with the treatment I have received on my trial.
Considering all the circumstances, it has been more generous
than I expected.” He admitted a design to free the slaves, but
denied all intention to commit treason, or murder, or violence in
so doing, and declared that in what he had done he felt fully
justified before God and man.</p>
        <p>There was nothing remarkable or unusual in talk like this by
a man like that. It has been the usual jabber of desperate,
unbalanced egotists and law-breakers since vanity, ignorance,
and fanaticism produced the first assailant of organized
government. It was heard again when Wilkes Booth,
assassinating Lincoln, exclaimed: “‘<foreign lang="la">Sic semper tyrannis!</foreign>’” and
again, when Guiteau slew Garfield, claiming that he served his
country in committing the base deed.</p>
        <p>The Virginians took the life of John Brown to preserve their
own lives, and the lives of their wives and children, from
destruction. He had, indeed, “whetted knives of butchery” for
them, and had come a thousand miles to kill people who had
never heard his name.</p>
        <p>Yet, when the majesty of the law was vindicated, they did
not gloat over his dead body or mutilate his corpse, as he had
done his Kansas victims. They did not boil his bones and
articulate them to be hung in a public museum. When Justice
was satisfied, his body, unmutilated, was delivered
<pb id="wise132" n="132"/>
to his wife to bear back to his home, and she is a witness to the
fact that she was shown all the sympathy, all the tenderness,
all the consideration, of which the awful situation admitted.</p>
        <p>When the Virginia people first came into possession of the
facts of the John Brown fiasco, they did not believe the
outrage had been promoted or would be justified by any
considerable number of sane, law-abiding people anywhere.
With an inborn love of courage, the bearing of John Brown
was so fearless throughout that, even in their anger at his
impotent violence, they admired his fortitude. Even the
governor of the State testified to this. Describing his
appearance as he lay wounded before him, he said he could
liken his attitude to nothing but “a broken-winged hawk lying
upon his back, with fearless eye, and talons set for further fight
if need be,” and such was undoubtedly the man; such have
been many others like him. The quality of perfect courage,
coupled with an unbalanced judgment, narrow-mindedness,
and fanaticism, has produced a hundred characters in history
like Brown. Pity, pity, pity it is to see that splendid quality
perverted and destroyed by such fatal accompaniments. It was
with a genuine sigh of admiration for this fortitude that,
without one doubt about their duty, the Virginians imposed the
penalty for his crime upon John Brown.</p>
        <p>To one who knows the truth, the most tantalizing reflections
upon the John Brown raid are these: The man who, as colonel
in the army of the United States, captured Brown; the governor
of Virginia, under whose administration he was justly hung;
ay, a majority of the people of Virginia  -  were at heart opposed
to slavery. Uninterrupted by madmen like Brown, they would
have accomplished, in good time, the emancipation of the
<pb id="wise133" n="133"/>
slave without the awful fratricidal scenes which he precipitated.
Of course there are those who will still deny this, and
conclusive proof is impossible. History took its course. Yet it is
hard that one madman was able to warp that course, and it is
wrong to glorify him as saint and martyr, while men infinitely
his superiors in intellect, in broad philanthropy, in civilization,
and his equals in moral and physical courage, were driven by
his folly into apparent advocacy of slavery. Neither Colonel
Lee nor the governor of Virginia were champions of slavery.
Both rejoiced at its final overthrow, even at the great price in
blood and treasure at which it was accomplished. The
fanaticism which applauded Brown's acts made them feel that
there was no possible peace or union with such people, and
made them resolve that, sooner than submit to such savage
fraternity, they would fight for freedom from its dictation, its
taunts, and its interference.</p>
        <p>When Virginia had performed her duty in executing Brown,
her next step was to inquire what sympathy she received in the
hour of her trial. She expected, as she had a right to expect, that
the North, boasting of its superior civilization and its greater
regard for the maintenance of the laws protecting person and
property, would be practically unanimous in condemnation.
Even the half-civilized free-soilers of Kansas had denounced
Brown's barbarism.</p>
        <p>When it was learned that, in many parts of the North,
churches held services of humiliation and prayer; that bells
were tolled; that minute-guns were fired; that Brown was
glorified as a saint; that even in the legislature of
Massachusetts, eight out of nineteen senators had voted to
adjourn at the time of his execution; that Christian ministers
had been parties to his schemes of assassination and robbery;
that women had canonized the
<pb id="wise134" n="134"/>
bloodthirsty old lunatic as “St. John the Just;” that
philanthropists had pronounced him “most truly Christian;” 
that Northern poets like Whittier and Emerson and Longfellow
were writing panegyrics upon him; that Wendell Phillips and
William Lloyd Garrison approved his life, and counted him a
martyr,  -  then Virginians began to feel that an “irrepressible
conflict” was indeed upon them. Still, they waited to ascertain
how wide-spread this feeling was.</p>
        <p>Horace Greeley, editor of the “New York Tribune,” the
leading Republican journal of the North, contented himself with
referring to Brown and his followers as “mistaken men,” but
added that he would “not by one reproachful word disturb the
bloody shrouds wherein John Brown and his compatriots are
sleeping.” John A. Andrew, of Massachusetts, presided at a
John Brown meeting, proclaiming that whether the enterprise
was wise or foolish, John Brown himself was right. The next
year, Mr. Andrew was elected governor of Massachusetts. The
Northern elections in the month succeeding John Brown's raid
showed gains to the Republicans in the North. Lincoln spoke
in February, 1860, at Cooper Institute, New York. His comments
on Brown were looked for with anxiety. He said John Brown's
effort was “peculiar;” and while he characterized it as absurd,
he had no word of censure. Seward spoke soon afterwards in
the Senate. He was a man of more refinement than Lincoln. He
represented a constituency more highly civilized, and one in
which a greater regard for law existed than in the West. He
dared to say that Brown “attempted to subvert slavery in
Virginia by conspiracy, ambush, invasion, and force,” and to
add that “this attempt to execute an unlawful purpose in
Virginia by invasion, involving servile war, was an act of
<pb id="wise135" n="135"/>
sedition and treason, and criminal in just the extent that it
affected the public peace and was destructive of human
happiness and life.”</p>
        <p>Seward's detestation of slavery was more widely known than
Lincoln's. Up to that time, he had no formidable competitor for
the Republican nomination for the presidency. It is not
improbable that, in the then excited state of Northern feeling,
the two candid admissions above quoted cost him the
nomination for the presidency.</p>
        <p>While these scenes were being enacted, a great change of
feeling took place in Virginia towards the people of the North
and towards the Union itself. Virginians began to look upon
the people of the North as hating them, and willing to see them
assassinated at midnight by their own slaves, led by Northern
emissaries; as flinging aside all pretense or regard for laws
protecting the slaveowner; as demanding of them the
immediate freeing of their slaves; or that they prepare against
further attacks like Brown's, backed by the moral and pecuniary
support of the North.</p>
        <p>During the year 1860, the Virginians began to organize and
arm themselves against such emergencies. They knew that,
while James Buchanan was President, the power of the federal
administration could be relied upon to suppress such
violence; but they also knew that his term of office was nearly
at an end, and they had little hope of such protection if the
federal administration fell into the hands of the Republicans.
While the State was still unprepared to secede, her citizens
were - a unit in the resolve that Northern fanatics, who
thenceforth appeared on Virginia soil upon any such mission
as that of John Brown, should “be welcomed with bloody hands to
hospitable graves.”</p>
        <p>When the troops came back from Harper's Ferry, they
<pb id="wise136" n="136"/>
were amply supplied with songs. The first and most popular
was one upon John Brown, sung to the time of “The Happy
Land of Canaan.” It had a number of verses, only one of
which I remember, running something thing after this
fashion:  -  </p>
        <lg type="song">
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“In Harper's Ferry section, there was an insurrection,</l>
            <l>John Brown thought the niggers would sustain him,</l>
            <l>But old master Governor Wise</l>
            <l>Put his specs upon his eyes,</l>
            <l>And he landed in the happy land of Canaan.”</l>
          </lg>
          <lg type="verse">
            <head>REFRAIN.</head>
            <l>“Oh me! Oh my! The Southern boys are a-trainin',</l>
            <l>We'll take a piece of rope</l>
            <l>And march 'em up a slope,</l>
            <l>And land 'em in the happy land of Canaan.”</l>
          </lg>
        </lg>
        <p>It is surprising how popular this rigmarole became through
the South, and many a time during the war I heard the
regiments, as they marched, sing verses from it. It is in
contrast with the solemn swell of “John Brown's Body,” as
rendered by the Union troops. The latter is only an adaptation
of a favorite camp-meeting hymn which I often heard the
negroes sing, as they worked in the fields, long before the
days of John Brown. The old words were:  -  </p>
        <lg type="song">

        <head>CHAPTER X</head>
        <head>HOW THE “SLAVE-DRIVERS” LIVED</head>
        <p>OUR life during the year 1860 was in strange contrast with
the busy and exciting scenes of 1858 and 1859. Father's term of
office expired January 1, 1860. He sold his plantation in
Accomac, and bought another in the county of Princess
Anne, near Norfolk. This change was due partly to domestic
and partly to political considerations.</p>
        <p>During a period of rebuilding at “Rolleston,” our new home,
I was sent, January 1, 1860, to live with a favorite sister, and
attend a private school presided over by the parish minister, a
Master of Arts of the University of Virginia. The location was
in the county of Goochland, about twenty miles west of
Richmond, in the beautiful valley of the upper James.</p>
        <p>From Lynchburg, which is near the foot-hills of the Blue 
Ridge, the James River courses eastward to Richmond, a
distance of about two hundred miles, through a valley of great
fertility and beauty. The width of this valley seldom exceeds a
mile, and at many points it is much narrower than that. The flat
lands along the course of the stream are known as the “James
River low grounds,” an expression which conveys to the mind of
the Virginian an idea of fatness and fecundity such as others
conceive in reading of the valley of the Nile. About
Lynchburg, high bluffs hang over the stream, and the flat
lands are narrow and small in extent; but from Howardsville,
<pb id="wise138" n="138"/>
in Albemarle, to Richmond, a hundred miles below the
valley broadens, and the bluffs grow less beetling as the
gently rolling lands of lower Piedmont are reached. In general
characteristics, the section resembles the valleys of the
Genesee and the Mohawk in New York, with a greater
luxuriance of woodland and more extended vistas.</p>
        <p>Upon the swelling hills overlooking the James were built, at
the time of which I write, for a distance of a hundred miles or
more, the homes of many of the wealthiest and most
representative people of our State.</p>
        <p>No railroad penetrated the valley. The only means
provided for transporting products to market was the James
River and Kanawha Canal, an enterprise projected by General
Washington. It had been completed as far as Lexington,
passing through the Blue Ridge Mountains at the point known
as Balcony Falls, a spot suggestive of the Trosachs pass in
Scotland.</p>
        <p>For their own transportation up and down the valley, these
prosperous folk had private equipages and servants. When
the distance was greater than a day's journey, the home of
some friend, generally a kinsman, stood wide open for their
entertainment. The canal was available upon emergency as a
means of travel, but as its speed was only about four miles an
hour, few of the grandees resorted to it. A fine road ran along
the foot-hills, parallel with the canal and river, from Richmond
to Charlottesville, often keeping companionship for a mile or
two with the route of the canal. The hills were of that stiff red
clay celebrated afar for its adaptability to corn and tobacco;
and the soil of the low grounds, often refreshed and
rejuvenated by the overflow of the James, was a deep alluvial
deposit of chocolate loam, inexhaustible in richness and
fertility, and producing all the cereals in marvelous abundance.</p>
        <pb id="wise139" n="139"/>
        <p>Recalling a few of the princely dwellers in this favored
section, one remembers the Cabells of Nelson; the Gaits of
Albemarle; the Cockes of Fluvanna; the Hubards of
Buckingham; the Bollings of Bolling Island and Bolling Hall;
the Harrisons of Ampthill, and Clifton, and Elk Hill; the
Hobsons of “Howard's Neck,” and “Snowden,” and
“Eastwood;” the Flemings of “West View;” the Rutherfords of
“Rock Castle;” General Philip St. George Cocke of “Belle
Mead;” the Skipwiths; the Logans of “Dungeness;” the
Seldens of “Orapax” and of “Norwood;” the Warwicks; the
Michaux of Michaux's Ferry; the Morsons of “Dover;” the
Seddons of “Sabot Hill;” the Stanards of “Bendover;” the
Allens of “Tuckahoe;” and many others:  - </p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Their swords are rust,</l>
          <l>Their bodies dust;</l>
          <l>Their souls are with the saints, we trust.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Scattered along the valley, owning respectively from seven
hundred to two or three thousand acres, with slaves enough
to cultivate twice the lands they owned, they were the
happiest and most prosperous community in all America; not
rolling in wealth, like the sugar cane and cotton planters of the
South, yet with a thousand advantages over them, in the
variety of their productions, in the beauty of their lands, in the
salubrity of their climate, in the society about them, and in
their access to the outer world.</p>
        <p>The home of my sister was on one of these fine James River
estates, and her neighbors were of the most highly cultivated
people of whom that region boasted. The plantation had been
purchased from Colonel Trevillian, descendant of an old
Huguenot family, and its name, “Eastwood,” had been
bestowed by its former owner, Peyton Harrison. My brother-in-
law, after an education
<pb id="wise140" n="140"/>
in Europe, had essayed business, but ill-health compelled him
to adopt a country life. The house stood in a grove of oaks of
original growth, in the midst of an extensive lawn carpeted with
greensward. Behind it were the stables, the inclosures, and the
household servants' quarters. In front, half a mile away, were
the low grounds and river; and to the left again, half a mile
distant, stood the overseer's house, the quarters of the farm
hands, and the farm stables. Up and down the river were
visible the handsome residences of the neighbors. On remote
hillsides or in the wooded points, one saw, here and there,
great barns of brick or wood for storing wheat or corn, and
houses where tobacco was stripped and hung, and smoked
and dried, and pressed into hogsheads interminable lines of
stone or post and oak fences, without one missing panel,
showed, as few other things in farming do show, the
prosperity of the owners of these lands. Great fields  -  this one
pale green with winter wheat, this sere and brown in pasture
land, this red with newly ploughed clods, and this with a
thousand hillocks whence the tobacco had been
gleaned  -  were spread out to the vision, glean of weeds and
undergrowth, and cultivated until they looked like veritable
maps of agriculture.</p>
        <p>Near at hand, or far away upon the hillsides, one beheld
the working-bands of slaves, well clothed, well fed, and
differing from other workmen, as we see them now, chiefly in
their numbers and their cheerfulness and their comfortable
clothing. Remarkable as the statement may seem, those
slaves, over whose sad fate so many tears have been shed,
went about their work more joyously than any laboring people
I ever saw.</p>
        <p>Our school was located a mile away, in rear of the river
plantations, upon a road leading to what was known as “the
back country.” A little church built from the private 
<pb id="wise141" n="141"/>
contributions of the river planters, was used as the
schoolhouse. It was near the parsonage. That point was
selected, not only for its convenience to the teacher, but also
because of its accessibility to the children of the smaller
farmers in this “back country.” It is often said that
antagonism existed between this humbler class of whites and
the wealthy nabobs living upon the river. Perhaps there may
have been something of the inevitable envy which the less
fortunate feel everywhere towards the prosperous and great,
but certain it is, there was little manifestation of it there. The
wealthy sought in every way to be upon good terms with the
poor; and one of the best proofs that they succeeded is found
in the fact that, when war came, the two stood up together
side by side, and fought and slept and ate and died
together,  -  never thinking of which was rich or which was
poor, until a time when such as survived were all poor
together, and those who had always been poor were in their
turn the more fortunate of the two.</p>
        <p>Our nearest neighbors were the Seddons,  -  one of the
loveliest families of people that ever lived. The head of the
house was a gentleman who, after a thorough education, had
achieved distinction at the bar and in Congress, but, owing to
delicate health, had retired to his plantation. He entertained
extreme views on the subjects of slavery and the nullification
doctrines of Calhoun; but for years he had, owing to
precarious health, taken no active part in politics. Polished in
manners, gentle in bearing, hospitable and considerate in
all things, he captivated visitors to his home as soon as they
entered it. And in whatever he failed, his wife more than
atoned for it by her graciousness. She was the accomplished
heiress Sally Bruce. She and her sister Ellen, both beautiful in
person and in character, and thoroughly educated,
<pb id="wise142" n="142"/>
took Richmond society by storm upon their first
appearance there in the 40's, and succumbed at last to the
blandishments of two young cousins, married them, bought
adjoining plantations in Goochland, and were now rearing
their children side by side. Such were the families of Hon.
James A. Seddon and James M. Morson, Esq.</p>
        <p>Some of the happiest days of my childhood, some of the
most elevating, purifying, and refining hours of all my life, were
passed in these two households. Both Mr. and Mrs. Seddon
were accomplished linguists, and demanded that their children
should be as well educated as themselves. Their library was
supplied with the best thought of the world, and the course of
literary culture prescribed by them for their children was not
only comprehensive, but was made attractive by the way in
which it was pursued. Often the evening gatherings of the
family were converted into reading classes, and, with the
charming voice of their mother added to the attraction of the
subject, the children became interested. That charming voice?
Yes, one of the sweetest that ever sang. Not only was she an
admirable performer upon the piano, but when she sang,
accompanying herself upon the harp, she was a very
nightingale. Her tender Scotch ballads never were surpassed
upon the stage.</p>
        <p>Love, intellectuality, refinement, hospitality, made that
home an abode fit for the most favored of mortals; and her
care for their welfare made “Mis' Sallie” the ideal, in the
minds of the servants, of what an angel would be in the world to
come. The children? They were numerous as the teeth in a
comb. Three of the Seddon boys ranging from a year older to
two years younger than myself, were my sworn allies.
Morning, noon, and night, we were together. Of course we all
had horses,  -  everybody
<pb id="wise143" n="143"/>
had a horse. Often the three Seddon boys rode to school upon
the back of one filly, with a young darkey to fetch her home.
Their route brought them directly past the Eastwood gate, and
many a day in 1860 that blessed filly took upon her back a fifth
rider, as I slipped down from the gatepost where I had awaited
their coming. And many a head-punching I received from the
combined forces of the Seddons because I tickled that filly in
the flank, and made her kick until she tumbled the entire load,
four white boys and a darkey, into the muddy road, and then,
kicking at us, scampered away, leaving us to fish our Horaces
and Livys and Virgils out of the mud, and walk the remainder of
the way to school.</p>
        <p>The Morson children, first cousins of the Seddons, were also
numerous; and while their residence was at a little distance from
ours, the families were frequently together. At school, during the
week, plans were made for the afternoons and Saturdays, and we
ranged the whole country-side, shooting, or riding, or visiting.</p>
        <p>A favorite amusement was excursions up the canal in our
own boat, drawn by our own team, to a famous fishing place at
“Maiden's Adventure” dam. Thither boys and girls repaired
together, making quite a boatload, taking baskets of luncheon
and spending the day.</p>
        <p>The school-teacher, the Rev. Mr. Dudley, was an efficient
man, who demanded that his pupils should study hard, and
was not at all squeamish about the proper use of hickory.
Notwithstanding this, he was popular, and joined in the sports
at recess with genuine zest. One of our favorite games was
called “Germany,” or “Chermony,” in which a paddle, a certain
number of holes in a row, and a hard rubber ball were used.
Under certain regulations, each player claimed a hole in the
ground, and, when the ball went into it, was privileged to hit
some
<pb id="wise144" n="144"/>
one else with the ball. Mr. Dudley was a large, fleshy man, and
it was noticeable that, while the boys were always delighted to
have him in the game, he was hit about twice as often as all the
boys put together. However much he may have compelled
them to rub themselves in school, the boot was very much on
the other leg in these little outside pastimes; so much so, that
Parson Dudley, after being “roasted” for a long time,
appeared to lose his enthusiasm for the game.</p>
        <p>It was during the recess hour, on a bright May day in 1860,
that a boy rode by, returning perhaps from Richmond, and
gave Mr. Dudley a copy of a newspaper. No sooner had he
disposed himself comfortably to read the news, leaving us
boys to our diversions, than with a loud exclamation he broke
forth, “Ah! that settles it. I feared as much. Abe Lincoln is
nominated for President. He will be elected, and that means
war.”</p>
        <p>I, who was now in my fourteenth year, and deeply
interested in political matters, was anxious to know why Mr.
Lincoln's election portended war any more than that of any
one else.</p>
        <p>“Well,” said Mr. Dudley, perfectly sincere in every word he
spoke, “Mr. Seward was the logical candidate of the
Republican party, entitled to the nomination by superior
ability and by long service. He is a man of very pronounced
anti-slavery views, but is a gentleman by birth and
association, and if elected President, would respect his
constitutional obligations and the rights of the Southern
States. Everybody expected him to be the nominee; but his
course and utterances of late, especially his utterances
concerning old John Brown, are not radical enough to suit the
Black Republicans. On the other hand, this man Lincoln has
come to the front, venomous and vindictive enough to satisfy
the most rabid abolitionist.” He
<pb id="wise145" n="145"/>
then proceeded to draw a picture of Lincoln horrible enough.
He told how he was, in his origin, of that class of low whites
who hate gentlemen because they are gentlemen; how, in
personal appearance, he was more like a gorilla than a human
being; how he possessed the arts and cunning of the
demagogue to a degree sufficient to build himself up by
appealing to the prejudices of his own class against gentlemen;
and how, in his joint debates with Douglas, who had
completely overmastered him, he had nevertheless brought
himself into notice, and secured the nomination of his party, by
going far beyond other leaders in advocacy of radical measures
against slavery, and in abuse of the South.</p>
        <p>That settled Abraham Lincoln with me. I was thoroughly
satisfied that no such man ought to be President; but I could
not yet conceive it possible that such a monster would be the
choice of a majority of the people for President. Lincoln's
nomination did not, however, interfere with my happiness or
appetite. In faint, I had faith in the triumph of Mr. Lincoln's
opponents.</p>
        <p>A few days after this, I accompanied my sister and brother-
in-law to a breakfast at the Stanards'.</p>
        <p>In course of conversation at table, the nomination of Lincoln
was discussed. That gave rise to the inquiry, on the part of our
hostess, whether her guests had read the remarkable sermon
recently delivered in the city of New Orleans by the Rev. Dr.
Palmer, an eminent Presbyterian divine, upon “The Divine
Origin of Slavery.” As none of her guests had seen it, and all
expressed the desire to do so, a servant was sent to the library
for the newspaper, and one of the company proceeded to read
aloud the salient points of Dr. Palmer's address. Undoubtedly,
from his standpoint, the great minister put the case very
strongly. His arguments were, however, chiefly based upon
the
<pb id="wise146" n="146"/>
divine sanction of the patriarchal institutions of the Old
Testament. I was not a profound Biblical scholar, but a number
of very good women had spent a great deal of time, during the
brief space of my life, hammering into my head portions of the
Old Testament. It so happened also that during breakfast that
morning the Mormon doctrines of Brigham Young had come
up for discussion, for Brigham was much in evidence then, and
everybody, especially the ladies, had joined in denouncing him
as monstrous.</p>
        <p>The reading of Dr. Palmer's sermon occupied some time. It
bored me, but I found no opportunity to escape. At its
conclusion, the company agreed that it was an able and
conclusive argument. Mrs. Stanard, who was a witty woman
given to facetious remarks, declared a purpose to mail a copy
of the sermon to Abe Lincoln. I, who was inclined to be pert as
well as facetious, proposed to send another copy to Brigham
Young, “For,” said I, “every argument of Dr. Palmer, based on
the slavery of the Old Testament, is equally available for
Brigham Young in support of polygamy; and I sympathize with
Brigham.”</p>
        <p>It is unnecessary to add that the assembled guests, in their
disgust at my “pertness,” dropped the argument on slavery.</p>
        <p>Soon after this breakfast, I witnessed the first parade of the
Goochland Troop. The John Brown invasion had given a
pronounced impetus to the military spirit of Virginia. In almost
every county, new military organizations had sprung up. As
the Goochland folk were rich, owners of fine horseflesh, and
every man of them a horseman from his childhood, it was
natural that they organized a command of cavalry.</p>
        <p>During the winter, the plan was conceived. The first
<pb id="wise147" n="147"/>
meeting looking to its consummation was held at February
court. The preliminary drilling began in the early spring. And
now in May, for the first time, the troop assembled in full
uniform for drill and inspection. Julien Harrison, of Elk Hill was
its commandant. Mr. Hobson, my brother-in-law, at whose
house I lived, was the first lieutenant. The company was
composed of the very flower of the aristocracy of the James
River valley, and the capital invested in the arms, uniforms, and
the horseflesh of the Goochland Troop would have equipped a
regiment of regulars.</p>
        <p>At their first parade and review, they were the guests of the
master of Eastwood. Every man vied with every other in his
mount. There were not ten horses in the company less than
three quarters thoroughbred. It was indeed a gallant
sight,  -  those spirited youngsters, men, and beasts. The
uniforms of the privates were fine enough for major-generals.
Their arms they bought themselves,  -  the carbines and pistols
from Colt, the sabres from Horstmann. The shabrack of a
Goochland trooper cost more money than the whole
equipment of a Confederate cavalryman three years later. Little
did they realize then that within a year they would be part of
the best regiment in the brigade of the immortal Stuart, and
that they would pass into history as the “Black Horse
Cavalry,”  -  a bugaboo scarcely less terrible to the imagination
of their foe than “masked batteries.” There was, in fact, but
one company in the Confederacy called “Black Horse Troop,”
and that came from Fanquier County; but they were counted
by thousands in the imagination of the Union soldiers.</p>
        <p>Many years afterwards, in conversation with a Union
veteran, something was said of handsome cavalry. He
remarked that the most vivid picture of a perfect soldier
<pb id="wise148" n="148"/>
retained by his mind was that of a Confederate cavalry officer
named Captain Julien Harrison, of the Fourth Virginia Cavalry,
who bore a flag of truce in 1861 into the Union lines at
Manassas.</p>
        <p>The thing which most impressed itself upon me, during my
residence in Goochland in 1860, was the marked difference
between slavery upon these extensive plantations and slavery
as it existed in the smaller establishments which I had
theretofore known. It could not be truly said of these people
that they were cruel to their slaves, but it was certainly true
that the relations between master and slave were nothing like
so close or so tender as those with which I had been
theretofore familiar. The size of the plantations and the number
of slaves were such that it was necessary to employ farm
managers or overseers, and to have separate establishments,
removed from the mansion house, where the overseers resided,
surrounded by the laborers on the plantation.</p>
        <p>As a consequence, the master and his family saw little of
this class of servants, and the servants saw and knew little of
the master. There was lacking that intimate acquaintance and
sympathy with each other which ameliorated the condition of
the slaves where the farm was small, the servants few, and no
overseer came between master and servant.</p>
        <p>Wealthy men, too, like several of those in our
neighborhood, had so many slaves that they were compelled
to buy other plantations on which to employ them. For
example, Mr. Morson owned nearly eight hundred Negroes.
In order to sustain them, he purchased large plantations in
Mississippi. A portion of his time was passed there looking
after his interests, and thither, from time to time, it was, in the
nature of the case, necessary to transfer some of his Virginia
slaves, for they increased rapidly, and the
<pb id="wise149" n="149"/>
Virginia plantation could furnish employment and sustenance
for only a limited number. Such transfers were made as
humanely as possible. Families were removed together, in order
to avoid harassing separations, and the change bore as lightly
as possible upon the blacks. But, after all, it was an
unsympathetic proceeding; for the negro race has the
strongest of local attachments, and old Virginia was, and still
is, the dearest spot of earth to the native darkey.</p>
        <p>The weeping and wailing among those who were ordered
South was pitiful. Although they were going to their master's
plantation, it was in a strange land and under the government
of unknown people, who felt none of the softening influences
of early associations. Above all, it was without regard to any
consideration of their wishes or their prejudices, and the
expression of either would have been vain. </p>
        <p>The slaves upon our place presented another repulsive
feature of the institution. The master and mistress were both
young persons of pure, elevated Christian lives, incapable of
brutality, and most ambitious to deserve and to possess the
loyal love of their slaves. They could have had no country
establishment without the possession of slaves; and, both
being members of large families, they could not hope to acquire
by gift a sufficient number of slaves to carry on their
plantation. As a consequence, they were compelled to buy the
essential quota. These purchases were made by families, as far
as possible, but the aggregate was made up of negroes who
came from different places, and were strangers to each other.
Great circumspection was exercised in the effort to secure the
proper kind of servants, and large prices were paid in order to
secure such. But everybody knows how little reliance is to be
placed in the advance characters given to servants, and
<pb id="wise150" n="150"/>
how often, when strange servants are brought together, unforeseen
incompatibilities of temperament, or new conditions,
affect them. Thus it was that the new establishment at 
“Eastwood,” wealthy and luxurious as it seemed, had its
troubles and its trials like all the rest of the world. The darkeys
were jealous of each other. The ones represented as marvels
of diligence and obedience turned out to be lazy and
impertinent. And so it went. The most flagrant instance of this
kind was a butler named Tom, a handsome fellow, quick,
intelligent, and represented as a phenomenal servant. When
Tom arrived, he was a joy and a comfort to master and mistress,
and they felt that he was worth the $2500 they had paid for him.
In a little while, Tom appeared, from time to time, in a condition
of excitement or irritability or stupor, and his conduct was
exceedingly perplexing. Suspecting liquor as the cause of his
strange behavior, strict watch was kept upon the wine cellar
and the sideboard, but no liquor was missed. At last, Tom
developed a distinct case of <foreign lang="la">mania a potu</foreign>, and then it was
discovered that he had been steadily imbibing from a large
demijohn of alcohol to which he had access. As his distemper
developed an inclination to knock the heads off his fellow
servants, male and female, on the slightest provocation, his
presence made matters very uncomfortable; and while his first
offense was overlooked and forgiven, under solemn promises
of reform, he soon relapsed into bad habits, and became so
violent that it was necessary to have him seized and bound by
Alick the gardener and Ephraim the hostler, in order to prevent
murder.</p>
        <p>Now, what would our humane and philanthropic friend,
Mrs. Harriet Beecher Stowe, think of a case like this? And how
would the dear old lady have disposed of it? This was one of
many of the perplexing situations of slavery. 
<pb id="wise151" n="151"/>
There was nothing to do with Tom but to sell him with all
his infirmities on his head. Of course the abolitionist will say it
was awful; but to have given him away would have been
imposing upon the friend to whom he was presented, and to
set him free was offering a premium to drunkenness and
faithlessness. Tom shed tears of repentance, and the family
shed tears of regret and humiliation. But as there were young
children and women all about him,  -  women and children of his
own race as well as the white race,  -  and as he was liable to get
drunk and violent, and to knock the heads off of any or all of
them at any moment, the question recurs on the original
proposition. What was to be done with Tom?</p>
        <p>But enough of these instances. This and many others only
confirmed me in the opinion, planted when I saw the sale of
Martha Ann, and growing steadily thereafter, that slavery was
an accursed business, and that the sooner my people were
relieved of it, the better.</p>
        <p>June came, and with it the end of the school term and my
return to my father's home. I had made decided advances in
knowledge. I had read the first six books of Virgil; been drilled
in Racine and Molière and Voltaire; finished Davies's
Legendre; and was fairly embarked in algebra, besides a good
grounding in ancient and modern history and a smattering of
natural philosophy.</p>
        <p>So I boxed my books, packed my trunk, gathered together
my effects,  -  including my gun, with which I had become quite
proficient, and a coop containing a gamecock and pullets of
the choicest James River stock,  -  and tried myself homeward.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XI</head>
        <head>THE CALM BEFORE THE STORM  -  THE CLOUDBURST</head>
        <p>THE proverb that a calm precedes a storm was never better
illustrated than in the peaceful days of the summer and
autumn of 1860, and the winter of 1860-61.</p>
        <p>Our new home opened up a phase of existence entirely
different from any I had theretofore known. Although it was
within five miles of the city of Norfolk, which was easily
reached either by land or by water, Rolleston, my father's new
plantation, was as secluded a spot as if no city had been within
a hundred miles. It was the ancient seat of the Moseley family,
one of the oldest in the State. Located upon the eastern branch
of the Elizabeth River, it embraced, besides a broad area of
cultivation, a handsome body of timber of original growth,
running from the water's edge back for a mile or more. The
dwelling and cartilage were near the river, and the cultivated
land, which was on its easternmost side, was bounded by a
large millpond. Across the mouth of the pond a dam was
erected, with floodgates admitting the tide and confining it at
high water for the use of a gristmill.</p>
        <p>Beside the gristmill, the new purchaser erected a saw mill on
the woodland tract for his own use in erecting new buildings,
and for the sale of lumber in the adjacent city. When I reached
the place, a number of mechanics were remodeling the
dwelling, and building new farm houses and barns. Every boy
who has lived on a farm knows the joys of the youthful heart
at having access to
<pb id="wise153" n="153"/>
a carpenter's bench, and to all the lumber and tools and nails
he wants.</p>
        <p>Besides myself, I had as companions and playmates my
brother, a nephew near my own age, a white boy,  -   the son of
the miller,  -  and my own slave, black John. From rosy morn till
dewy eve, during all the vacation of 1860, this precious
company was busy with new enterprises. The adjacent waters
swarmed with fish and terrapin and crabs and oysters and
clams, and every variety of sea food. The fields and forests
and marshes abounded with game. The Elizabeth River was a
beautiful sheet of water for sailing, and father had provided
himself with the stanchest and fastest boats to be obtained.</p>
        <p>The milldam and pond were our favorite rallying-point. There
we anchored our craft, and fished and swam and sailed our
miniature boats, and engaged in the many pastimes which
make boyhood so happy a period. To-day, we were occupied,
busy as bees, building hen-houses. To morrow, the all-engrossing
subject was a new boat, devised and constructed
by ourselves. Another time, we might be seen, all hands, riding
the high side of our fastest boat in a clipping sail to Norfolk,
and, again, bending to the oars like tried seamen, rowing
homeward in a calm. To-day would be devoted to fishing in
deep water, to-morrow to crabbing on the shoals; another time,
to setting weir mats across the mouths of the little estuaries to
catch “fatbacks” or jumping mullets when the tide went out;
and another time, the whole company would be busy baiting
and sinking terrapin traps. Sometimes we would drive away in
the farm-carts to Lambert's or Garrison's Fishing Shores, ten
miles away upon the Chesapeake Bay, to seine-hauling, from
which we would return at evening, our carts loaded down with
fish for salting and use during the winter season. On other
days, we made up fishing
<pb id="wise154" n="154"/>
excursions in our sloop, the Know-Nothing, down to the deep
waters of Hampton Roads, for sea trout and sheepshead.
Every day had its new and busy occupation and delight, and
for several months we never put shoes upon our feet, save
when we were called upon to visit the city. With great straw
hats and brown-linen shirts, and trousers rolled up above our
knees, we were almost amphibians, and were sunburnt as
brown as Indians.</p>
        <p>It may not have been a period of great intellectual growth,
but it certainly was a time in which our physical health was
highly developed, and the qualities of enterprise and self-reliance
were highly stimulated.</p>
        <p>In the month of August, the Great Eastern, the largest ship
then afloat, came to Hampton Roads, which was the signal for a
general holiday, and everybody who was anybody, far and near,
went to visit her. We went down the harbor with Captain Oliver
upon our sloop, the Know-Nothing, to inspect the English
monster. From the city to the Roads where the Great Eastern lay,
ten miles below, the waters of Norfolk harbor were alive with
river-craft, crowding all sails and decked in their best bunting,
firing small cannon and waving salutes. We had bent the racing-sails
of the Know-Nothing for the occasion, and she showed her
heels not only to the vessels of her own class, but to many far
larger than herself. I was very proud of being one of the
company of the smartest craft in Norfolk waters.</p>
        <p>The Great Eastern, it will be remembered, was an immense
ship, of a length and size never since equaled, unless it be by
the new steamer Oceanic, now under construction. She was
680 feet in length, with a width of beam of over 80 feet, and a
draft of 27 feet of water. Her contrast with other ships of that
time was, however, much greater than it would be with the
ships of to-day.
<pb id="wise155" n="155"/>
In general outline, she was, of course, very much like other
vessels of her kind. When she first came in view, I felt
disappointed; for there were no other objects near her with
which to contrast her. But after a large steamer of the Old
Dominion line passed the Know-Nothing on the way down the
harbor, looming high above us, and rocking us in her wake until
our washboards were almost submerged, and then passed on
towards the Great Eastern, where, by the side of the latter, she
appeared to be no larger than a tug, I began to realize the size
of the magnificent newcomer. When the Know-Nothing sailed
up and around the visitor, her topmast not five feet above the
rail of the Great Eastern, the matter grew plainer; and when our
party boarded the Great Eastern and traversed the great spaces
within, I found it difficult to realize that she was the work of
men, or that the colossal whole moved and was directed in
every motion by the control of one human mind.</p>
        <p>While the ship proved a failure, the ideas first advanced in
her were developed and applied to other ventures, in such a
manner that she produced a revolution in the construction of
ships for merchant marine service, little less marked than that
in naval warfare resulting from the convict in Hampton Roads
two years later.</p>
        <p>The visit of the Prince of Wales to America occurred about
the same time as the arrival of the Great Eastern.</p>
        <p>I was to remain at home during the next school year. One of
our neighbors, with a large family, had secured the services of
a young university graduate as private tutor, and I was to
attend his school, about two miles distant. Consequently,
early in September, I went to Goochand to bring back some
schoolbooks and other belongings. It was on this visit that I
happened to be in Richmond at the time of the visit of the
Prince of Wales,
<pb id="wise156" n="156"/>
and was in St. Paul's Church upon the Sunday when the
prince attended divine worship there.</p>
        <p>During our residence in Richmond, many eminent Englishmen 
had visited the city from time to time, and a mere
English lord was no very great sight; but my interest was
most decided in a British heir-apparent not much older than
myself.</p>
        <p>The young fellow was a typical Anglo-Saxon. His tawny
hair, fair complexion, and blue eyes were exactly what one
familiar with the type would have expected to see. At that time,
he was rather slight in build, and did not display the best of
physical development. His shoulders were drooping, and his
hips rather broad; his movements were awkward, and his
manner altogether boyish. I had no opportunity to converse
with him, for, being a small boy, I secured no introduction; but
I saw him several times, and wondered at the deference shown
to him by the distinguished-looking old gentlemen who were
his traveling companions, as well as by several of the leading
citizens, friends of my father, by whom the prince was
entertained.</p>
        <p>One who saw him in 1860 would find it difficult to discover
in the stout, bald, elderly, well-fed man of the world, still
known as the Prince of Wales, whom I saw in London several
years ago, any trace of the awkward boy who visited
Richmond in 1860.</p>
        <p>Never had boy more glorious liberty or greater variety of
sport, and never did reckless youth pursue its bent more
indifferent to the graver affairs going on about it. One day in
October, I drove into Norfolk, and, seeing a great crowd
assembled, paused and heard part of a speech by Stephen A.
Douglas. I was greatly impressed by his tremendous voice,
every tone of which reached me more than a block away, and I
loudly applauded his Union sentiments.
<pb id="wise157" n="157"/>
But having obtained the supply of powder and shot I
needed, I soon forgot Douglas. Not long afterwards, I heard,
without its making a great impression upon me, that on one of
those gorgeous November days Douglas had been defeated
for President, and Abraham Lincoln had been elected President
of the United States. More than once I heard, without believing
it, that there was serious and imminent danger of civil war as a
result. “Let it come,” was my only reflection; “who's afraid?”</p>
        <p>Before the close of the year 1860, many men from Southern
States rode out to Rolleston from Norfolk to visit and confer
with father about the course Virginia would pursue in view of
that of South Carolina and other States. Some of them
remained to meals, and some stayed overnight, and so I heard
their conversations. Some of them had new and strange flags
pinned upon their lapels, or little palmetto rosettes, which they
gave me. When I visited the city, I heard new tunes like “Dixie”
and “The Bonnie Blue Flag;” and men said that Virginia
would secede with other Southern States. But father still
declared that he was opposed to secession, and believed that,
if any fight was necessary, the South should “fight in the
Union.” I did not know what it all meant, and did not believe it
could result in actual war, and in fact had become so
engrossed in the pleasures of life at Rolleston that I gave little
attention to aught else but the pursuit of my boyish
diversions.</p>
        <p>I was a little over fourteen years of age when the civil war
began. No pair of eyes and ears in all America were more alert
than mine. Every event, as it wound off the reel of time,
excited my most intense interest, and made its indelible
impression.</p>
        <p>As State after State passed ordinances of secession, the
<pb id="wise158" n="158"/>
disunion sentiment gained ground in Virginia. Father was hotly
opposed to secession, but he always coupled that declaration
with the further one that he was equally opposed to Northern
coercion.</p>
        <p>The Virginia legislature called a convention to consider what
course the State should take in the impending crisis. The
election for delegate from our county, Princess Anne, was
exciting, and the result was in great doubt. Father was a
candidate, opposed by Edgar Burroughs, Esq., a popular and
outspoken Union man. Mr. Burroughs was a native of the
county, had a large family connection, and was supported by a
strong following, who wanted neither secession nor fighting. It
required all the prestige of my father's name, and a careful
declaration of his modified views upon secession, to elect him,
and he was returned by a small majority.</p>
        <p>Poor Burroughs, like many another who resisted secession
to the last, went into the Confederate service, and sacrificed
his life for his State.</p>
        <p>The convention remained in session a long time before it
took decisive action. When it assembled, it was composed of a
safe majority of Union men, and a minority of secessionists.
My father held unique views, and had a very small following.
Opposing secession, he at the same time advocated
preparations by the State for defense against what he
considered the threatened aggression of the federal
government. In his own book, “Seven Decades of the Union,”
he has fully set forth what he meant when he advocated
“fighting in the Union.” It is sufficient to say that, at the time,
his views were regarded as impracticable, and that he failed to
impress them upon the body, or to gain any considerable
following.</p>
        <p>The issue seemed likely to be decided in favor of the Union
men, until the occurrence of two events which precipitated
<pb id="wise159" n="159"/>
secession. The first of these was the firing upon Fort
Sumter. The second was the call issued by President Lincoln
upon the States, Virginia included, for troops to suppress the
rebellion.</p>
        <p>It has been said that the Southern leaders fired upon Fort
Sumter in order to force these issues, well knowing that
Virginia could not be relied upon to withdraw from the Union
in any other way. Whether this be so or not, this result was
accomplished.</p>
        <p>The Virginians realized that they had come to the parting of
the roads. The question presented was no longer, Shall we
fight? War was flagrant. The only question to be decided was,
On which side shall we fight? </p>
        <p>Virginia was reduced to the alternative of furnishing her
quota of troops to the Union, or of refusing to do so, which
was the equivalent of secession. It was a hard situations
made doubly hard by the fact that, even at the moment when
these things happened, a peace conference, presided over by
her venerable ex-President John Tyler, was in session at
Washington, vainly endeavoring to bring about a bloodless
solution of the trouble.</p>
        <p>Now, however, no time was to be lost in further
negotiations. Indecision in such a crisis would have been little
less than cowardice.</p>
        <p>One by one, men who had steadily voted with the Union
men transferred their support to the secessionists. Knowing
that war was inevitable, they decided to fight for and with
their friends. The ordinance of secession was passed three
days after Mr. Lincoln's call for troops; and while the
schedule provided for its indorsement by the people, the
march of events was so rapid that popular indorsement 
was not obtained until long after the State had taken
an unmistakable attitude in the conflict.</p>
        <p>While these things were progressing, I visited Norfolk
<pb id="wise160" n="160"/>
daily to ascertain, and keep the family informed concerning
the progress of public affairs.</p>
        <p>From the time Sumter was fired upon, and Mr. Lincoln's
proclamation was made public, business was almost
entirely suspended. The people assembled upon the streets,
discussing the situation, breathlessly awaiting the decision
of the convention at Richmond, and listening to popular
harangues. The local military, anticipating the result,
assembled, and paraded the streets with bands and
Southern flags. When the telegraph flashed the announcement
that the secession ordinance had been passed,
it was greeted with great cheering, the firing of guns, and
every demonstration of excited enthusiasm.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to describe the feelings with which I saw
the stars and stripes hauled down from the custom house,
and the Virginia state flag run up in their place I had
become rampant for war, but never until then had I fully
realized that this step involved making the old flag under
which I was born in Brazil, and which, until now, had
typified to me everything of national patriotism and
national glory on land and sea, henceforth the flag of an
enemy.</p>
        <p>It was a beautiful spring morning. Across the harbor at
the Gosport Navy Yard, the United States flag still floated
from the garrison flagstaff, and from the ships,  -  the
Pennsylvania, the Cumberland, the Merrimac, the
Germantown, the Raritan, and others whose names were
famous in our naval annals. Father had been chairman of
the Naval Committee of the House of Representatives for
many years, and had become, while minister to Brazil
personally acquainted with nearly all the prominent naval
officers. Upon those ships, lying there, were many men who,
but a short time before, were welcome visitors at our home.
It was almost incredible that they were now, and
<pb id="wise161" n="161"/>
were to be henceforth, enemies, or that they might at any
time open fire upon the town which they had originally come
to protect. A certain Confederate general was ridiculed for
saying, after the war ended, that he had never seen the old
flag, even in the battle-front, without tears in his eyes. That
was doubtless a figure of speech. It was rather hyperbolical
and beyond any feeling I had; but I can understand the
emotion of every man who, having loved and honored the
stars and stripes, could not bring himself, even while the
war was going on, to hate them, or shut out from his
remembrance what they had been to him.</p>
        <p>The day after the State seceded. General Taliaferro, a
militia general, arrived at Norfolk and assumed command.
Troops from the South began to arrive. Among them I recall
particularly the Third Alabama Regiment, one of the finest
bodies of military I ever saw. It numbered full one thousand
men, the best representatives of Montgomery, Selma,
Mobile, and other places in Alabama. It was uniformed like
the New York Seventh Regiment, and commanded by
Colonel Lomax, a superb soldier. Those wealthy young
fellows of the Third Alabama brought with them not less
than one hundred servants, and their impediments were
more than was carried by a division in Lee's army three
years later.</p>
        <p>All attention was concentrated now upon the navy yards and
ships in possession of the United States. The advantage of
securing the latter was fully understood. No less than six or
seven vessels were sunk in the channel below the city, to
prevent the ships from passing out. A demand for the
evacuation of the navy yard and the surrender of the ships was,
it was understood, made by General Taliaferro upon
Commodore Paulding. Friday the 19th and Saturday the 20th
were consumed in negotiations. Saturday,
<pb id="wise162" n="162"/>
a party of Union officers landed at the Roanoke dock
with a flag of truce, and proceeded under escort to General
Taliaferro's headquarters at the Atlantic Hotel. A long
conference ensued, and then they returned to their ships. The
fevered populace could gain no information concerning the
interview or its probable results.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, several companies of local military proceeded
to old Fort Norfolk, which was on our side of the river
just below the town, and removed a large quantity of
ammunition stored there, unprotected by the Union troops.
That ammunition was largely used in the first battle of
Manassas, which occurred three months later.</p>
        <p>It was nearly dark, Saturday, April 20, when, despairing
of getting further information, I secured my horse and
vehicle, bought all the thrilling newspaper bulletins I could
lay hands upon, and, tearing myself away from the
excitement of the town, started for home. The erstwhile
silent woods skirting the homeward road were now
transformed into camps. Places whose deep silence at night,
in time of peace, had been broken only by the uncanny call of
the whippoorwill, or the hooting of owls, were lighted up
with camp-fires, and resounded with the joyous laughter of
the soldiers, the calls of sentinels, the stroke of the axe, or
the singing of the cooks and servants. Verily, this thing
called war was a fascinating sport. My heart sickened at the
thought that it would probably all be over before I was old
enough to be a participant in its glorious exhilaration.</p>
        <p>At home, the family, impatient at my tardy return,
devoured every item of news in the papers, and hung
breathless upon every report of what was going forward in
the city. Thoroughly fagged out by excitement, I went early
to bed, wondering “What next?” Things happened so fast in
those days that, as soon as one thing occurred, we
<pb id="wise163" n="163"/>
began to expect something else, and in this case we were not
disappointed. Some time after midnight, the household was
aroused by a series of explosions in the direction of Norfolk,
and on going out, we beheld a dense canopy of smoke
hanging over the city, illuminated by fires, and flashing
almost momentarily with the light of new explosions. It was
easy to conjecture the meaning of this. The United States
forces had abandoned and blown up the Gosport Navy Yard.
I was keen to return at once to the city, but concluded to
remain until daylight.</p>
        <p>The next morning was Sunday, and bright and early I
accompanied a party of our workmen in our sloop to the
city. What a sight of devastation greeted us. The
Pennsylvania and the Merrimac and other ships had been
burned to the water's edge. Some of their guns had been
loaded, and exploded as the heat of the fire reached them,
but fortunately the ships had listed heavily before the
discharge, and the shots had gone into the water high over
the town. The ship sheds were all destroyed. A futile effort 
had been made to blow up the dry dock. The barracks and
officers' quarters and the machine shops had all been fired.
Some of these fires had been extinguished, while others
were still burning. The long rows of guns in the navy yard,
fifteen hundred in all, had in many instances been spiked,
or disabled by breaking their bunions with sledge-hammers.
Old sails and clothing and masses of papers
strewed the parade, and, altogether, it was marvelous to
behold what destruction and disorder had been wrought
within the space of a few hours where all had been
construction and perfect order for many years.</p>
        <p>As for the late occupants, the following were the facts:
About nine o'clock Saturday night, the Pawnee had come
<pb id="wise164" n="164"/>
up from Fortress Monroe, easily passing the obstructions. She
doubtless brought the orders what to do. After knocking the
navy yard into smithereens, and transferring all the valuable
papers and the sailors to the Pawnee and Cumberland, and
burning the Pennsylvania. Merrimac, and other ships, the
Pawnee and Cumberland steamed down the harbor to Fortress
Monroe. On their downward passage, the sailors manned the
yardarms, and cheered the Union flag, as it was lit up by the
blaze of the burning ships. The ease with which these vessels
had passed the obstructions and escaped was a sore disappointment 
to the Confederates.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref3" n="3" rend="sc" target="note3">1</ref></p>
        <p>We spent the greater portion of the day wandering about
through the abandoned navy yard, and inspecting the first
real devastation of war which we had yet beheld. Little did we
realize that it was possible to rebuild the dry dock, or that in it,
out of the charred remains of the Merrimac, would be
constructed a ship which was destined to revolutionize naval
warfare. Still less did we realize that this scene of destruction
was, as contrasted with what we were yet to witness, as
insignificant as the burning of a country smoke house beside
the conflagration of Moscow.</p>
        <p>Immediately after the evacuation of Norfolk by the Union
forces, the fortification of the harbor began. Batteries were
erected at Craney Island, Lambert's point, Sewell's Point, and
elsewhere. Obstructions were placed in the harbor to prevent
the return of Union vessels. Long lines of intrenchments were
erected in rear of the city, extending from the eastern branch
of the Elizabeth River to Tanner's Creek. The military forces
were distributed along what was known as the intrenched
camp
<note id="note3" n="3" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref3">1.  For full and graphic description of this, see <hi rend="italics">Rebellion Records</hi>, vol. i. Doc. p. 119.</note>
<pb id="wise165" n="165"/>
and the fashionable amusement of the time was to visit the
various encampments, and witness the drills and parades.</p>
        <p>Our house, but a mile or two beyond the lines, was
constantly filled with visitors, and was gay beyond all
precedent.</p>
        <p>Almost immediately after the passage of the secession
ordinance, father received a commission as brigadier-general in
the Confederate service, with directions to repair to West
Virginia, recruit and organize a brigade, and protect that section
of the State against any hostile advance. His preparations for
departure were immediately begun; and I was desolate at
learning that my brother Richard, now seventeen, was recalled
from William and Mary College to accompany him as aid-de-camp.</p>
        <p>Just before their departure, the family was roused late one
night by a loud knocking upon the door, and the appearance of
my brother Henry and two cousins who lived upon the eastern
shore peninsula. My brother was an Episcopal minister, and
had been up to this time in charge of a church in West
Philadelphia. He was exceedingly popular with his
congregation, and no man owed parishioners more for love and
kindness than he did. Hoping against hope, he had clung to his charge, thinking that
possibly something might happen to avert hostilities.
Meanwhile, the feeling there had become intense.</p>
        <p>One day, having occasion to visit the barber-shop of the
Girard House, the barber by some means discovered who he
was, and, seeking from him some assurances of loyalty to the
Union which he could not conscientiously give, the barber
threw down his razor, and refused to finish shaving a rebel.
Leaving the place, as a crowd was assembling, he hurried
homeward, to find that his residence had been protected from a
mob through the prudent exhibition
<pb id="wise166" n="166"/>
of a Union flag by a small 
boy whom he employed; and under advice of friends, he left 
the city forthwith, and journeyed homeward via Wilmington, 
Del., down the eastern shore peninsula, to the home of two 
young cousins in Accomac. They joined him, and the three
crossed the Chesapeake Bay in a small boat from Cape
Charles, and reached our home as described.</p>
        <p>My brother brought us the first tidings we had for a
long time from our relatives in Philadelphia, and from
his description they had become as intense partisans of
the Union side as were we of the South. Poor fellow! He
took the situation very much to heart. While loyal to
kith and kin, he, even at that early day, declared that 
we did not know the power, the resources, or the
numbers of our adversaries, and that the struggle of the
South for independence was hopeless folly. We were all
elated, and felt no doubts whatever. We were disposed to
regard him as controlled in his feelings by his deep
aversion to parting with a noble and devoted
congregation.</p>
        <p>A few days later, my eldest sister, wife of Dr. A.Y.P.
Garnett, of Washington, D. C., arrived at our home
with her family of children. They had abandoned their
home and reached Richmond on one of the last trains
which came through. When they joined us at Rolleston, our
family was a very large one. The teacher of my school
volunteered, and the school closed. My father and young
brother Richard departed for the war in West Virginia.</p>
        <p>My oldest brother Jennings was about this time 
elected captain of the Richmond Light Infantry Blues, a
volunteer organization founded in 1793. His company joined
my father's forces, and became A Company, Forty-six
Virginia Regiment, of Wise's brigade.</p>
        <p>Bravely and gayly they all sallied forth to rendez-vous
<pb id="wise167" n="167"/>
at the famous White Sulphur Springs. Thence,
after organizing, they proceeded to Charleston Kanawha.
Every report from our own was watched for with intense
eagerness, of course, but the things occurring near at
hand were of the most exciting character.</p>
        <p>After the evacuation of Norfolk by the Union forces,
the sound of cannon was almost hourly in our ears. In a
few days, Craney Island, Sewell's Point, Lambert's
Point Pig Point, and other places commanding the
entrance of the Elizabeth and Nausemond rivers, were
fully fortified by the Confederates.</p>
        <p>At these points, our own troops were constantly
exercised in target practice; and the Union forces at
Fortress Monroe and the Rip-Raps (then called Fort
Calhoun now Fort Wool), and the Union ships in
Hampton Roads and the Chesapeake Bay, were engaged
in similar drills. At times, the reports, all of which we
could hear, were so loud and so frequent that we
believed an engagement was in progress.</p>
        <p>Confederate cavalry patrolled the beach of the
Chesapeake to guard against the landing of the enemy
for an attack upon Norfolk in rear. Major Edgar
Burroughs, my father's competitor for delegate to the
Secession Convention, was in command of a squadron of
this cavalry, encamped near Lynnhaven Bay, to protect
the seine-haulers there who supplied Norfolk and the
troops with fish.</p>
        <p>The camp was in a grove of live-oaks, behind the
sand dunes on the beach, but must have been visible
with glasses to those on the ships, and was easily in
reach of guns of the Union cruisers constantly
moving back and forth along the coast between
Fortress Monroe and Cape Henry. Later in the war, that
camp would have been instantly bombarded; but at this early stage, 
the
<pb id="wise168" n="168"/>
combatants were not altogether prepared to kill each other on
sight.</p>
        <p>The possibility of such an attack was, nevertheless, sufficient
to make the place very attractive; and many day, 
going down to the shore under pretext of securing fish
from the seines, I remained in the cavalry camp all day,
often watching the passing Union vessels through field-glasses,
which made everything and everybody upon them
plainly visible.</p>
        <p>Then came the insignificant affair at Big Bethel. Exaggerated
accounts of it frenzied us with joy. “The Happy
Land of Canaan” was once more utilized for versification,
and every little chap of my acquaintance went about
singing:  -  </p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“It was on the 10th of June that the Yankees came to Bethel,</l>
          <l>They thought they would give us a trainin', </l>
          <l>But we gave 'em such a beatin' </l>
          <l>That they never stopped retreatin'</l>
          <l>Till they landed in the Happy Land of Canaan.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>My poor little mare Pocahontas paid heavily for all this
war fervor. Not content with banging away half the day with
the rifles at targets erected on land and water, I was
ambitious also to become a cavalryman and a lancer. We
had tournament every day; that is, riding at a run, trying to
carry off suspended rings with a long pole. Then we would
caparison ourselves with sabres and dash at dummy heads.
In these exercises the riders changed; but the horse was the
same, and no doubt Pocahontas felt deep regret at the
condition of affairs which gave her such constant and violent
exercise.</p>
        <p>Then came the battle of Manassas. Until then, I had
never conceived the intensity of feeling, the exaltation of
exultation, to which men are aroused by the first deep
draught of blood and victory. Fierceness, as we know it
<pb id="wise169" n="169"/>
in peace times, is, contrasted with human war-passion, as
the sweet south wind beside the desert simoom. Around the
telegraph offices in Norfolk, great throngs of citizens and
soldiers stood, roused to the highest pitch of excitement, as
bulletin after bulletin was read aloud announcing a great
Confederate triumph.</p>
        <p>Men whose names had never been heard before leaped at
one bound into the front rank of the world's heroes, in the
minds of that delirious audience. Beauregard, Joe Johnston,
Stonewall Jackson, Bee, and Bartow were the names on
every tongue. The magnitude of the engagement was
represented as equal to the greatest of ancient or modern
battles. The throngs gloated in the stories of unprecedented
carnage. One telegram announced a field so covered with the
dead bodies of gayly dressed Union Zouaves that it
resembled a French poppy farm. The conduct of the Southern
troops was represented as surpassingly brave and chivalric,
while that of “the Yankees” was referred to as
correspondingly base and cowardly. The boast that one
Southerner could whip ten Yankees seemed fully verified.
The prediction followed that within a month the Southern
army would be encamped about New York, and that it would
dictate terms of peace within sixty days.</p>
        <p>It was many a year before I learned the historical fact
that the little battle of Manassas was one of the oddest
episodes in military history, in that it was fought at right
angles to the line of battle selected by both commanders,
and was virtually won by the Union forces when they
became panic-stricken and fled. It is almost incredible now,
remembering how it was represented at the time, that only
750 men were killed in both armies, and less than 2500
were wounded.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref4" n="4" rend="sc" target="note4">1</ref></p>
        <note id="note4" n="4" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref4">1.  Official war records: Union, killed, 481;

Confederate, killed, 269; wounded, 1483; captured, none.</note>
        <pb id="wise170" n="170"/>
        <p>The war had begun successfully enough to the Confederates 
to fan and inflame into the most exaggerated proportions 
the vanity of a boy concerning Southern valor.</p>
        <p>As the summer advanced, no other startling battle occurred.</p>
        <p>Even at that early day, General Lee was the man to
whom the Virginians looked with more confidence and more
hope than towards any other Southern leader. His
preëminence had been somewhat eclipsed by the brilliant
success of Beauregard and Johnston at Manassas; but great
things were expected of him in his campaign in West
Virginia against McClellan. Lee's western campaign
proved, as we all know, a failure. The mountainous
character of the country was such as to preclude successful
military operations.</p>
        <p>My father, commanding to the south of General Lee, was
forced, by the situation of the armies to the north of him, to
retire from the Kanawha valley. Before doing so, he had
made a successful foray upon the enemy at Ripley. The
Blues, and some other troops under command of my
brother, had surprised the enemy and captured a few men It
was a very insignificant affair, but we exaggerated it into a
deed of great valor and importance. The Confederate
forces retreated to the lines of the Gauley, Floye won a
handsome victory over the enemy at Carinfax Ferry, and my
father's command took a strong position on Sewell's
Mountain, awaiting attack and confident a victory.</p>
        <p>Shortly after this, Floyd retreated with his command to a
place called Meadow Bluff. He ranked my father, and
ordered him to withdraw his forces to that place. This
my father flatly refused to do, and his insubordinate led
to an angry controversy, necessitating the presence of
General Lee. Upon General Lee's arrival, he fully sustained
<pb id="wise171" n="171"/>
the military views of General Wise; but it was
evident that two civilians like Wise and Floyd could not
coöperate in harmony, and both were ordered elsewhere.</p>
        <p>The exposures and excitements of the Virginia campaign
resulted in a protracted illness of my father, and for weeks
he lay at the point of death in Richmond. While he was thus
prostrated, campaigning in West Virginia petered out, and
both sides, Union and Confederate, realized that the
fighting must be done elsewhere, and the troops were
withdrawn. McClellan became commander of the Army of
the Potomac.</p>
        <p>General Lee was ordered to Charleston to superintend the
fortifications there, followed by the sneer of the cynical but
brilliant editor of the “Examiner,” John M. Daniel, that it was
hoped that he would do better with the spade than he had done
with the sword. Floyd dropped out of public view and died soon
afterwards, and my father's brigade was ordered to Richmond to
reorganize and await a new assignment.</p>
        <p>I shall never forget the impressions made by that brigade
when it returned from the West Virginia campaign in
December of 1861. They were the first troops I had seen
return from active campaigning. During the very rainy season
in the mountains, all the gilt and newness of their uniforms
had disappeared. The hair and beards of the men had grown
long, and added to their dirty appearance. A famous charger, 
named “Legion,” had been presented to
to my father at Staunton as he went out in the spring, 
and my brother had taken with him an exquisite
chestnut thoroughbred filly. Exposure in bad weather and
bad feed had baked their coats and filled them with mange, and
had made these two, and all their companions, look like
so many bags of bones. When, spiritless,
<pb id="wise172" n="172"/>
dejected, and half starved, they were led from the box-cars in
which they arrived, I could not believe they were the same
horses I had known.</p>
        <p>Altogether, a decided reaction had taken place since the
wonderful battle of Manassas. It had not been followed up
by the extermination of “the Yankees,” as I expected it would
be.</p>
        <p>Although but two hundred and sixty-nine Confederate
soldiers had been killed at Manassas, many of them were our
friends. But the deaths in battle were as nothing compared
with other deaths. We were beginning to dread measles and
mumps and typhoid fever and dysentery in the camps. We
were learning the ghastly truth that, for every man who dies in
actual battle, a dozen pass away ingloriously by disease.</p>
        <p>The skeleton had not yet clutched any of our family but,
my! how many of our friends were already in mourning!
And the war seemed no nearer to its end than when it
began.</p>
        <p>Six months before that, the town would have turned out
to see the brigade pass through. To-day, under the command
of the senior colonel, it marched through the city
quietly enough, and went into camp on the outskirts, without
attracting great attention.</p>
        <p>When father's health was partially restored, he return to
our home near Norfolk to complete his recuperation. One day
we visited the Gosport Navy Yard, and saw them building a
great iron monster upon the origins framework of the
Merrimac. My father felt great pride and interest in this, for he
it was who, before he had departed for West Virginia, sent
General Lee a description and model of a marine catapult,
designed years before by Captain Williamson; and he always insisted that
<pb id="wise173" n="173"/>
this was the first suggestion for the construction of the
boat. </p>
        <p>It was a very happy period, that time in the autumn of 1861,
when my father and brother were at home with us. I was no
longer anxious to see them in the field. I had heard too much of
the exposures and dangers and deprivations of camp life. But in
time the orders came. My father was assigned to the command of
Roanoke Island. The brigade came down from Richmond. It
was mightily spruced up and benefited by its sojourn in
Richmond, and its soldierly appearance made a good impression
as it passed through Norfolk.</p>
        <p>At the head of his command in the 46th, my darling brother
Jennings marched. When he saw me, he came out and patted and
kissed me, and asked about everything at home. Before we
parted, be sure he pressed into my hand a crisp new
Confederate bill, for he and I were “partners.”</p>
        <p>The brigade was embarked on barges to pass down through
the Albemarle Canal to Roanoke Island, and the last I saw of them
was as they floated away, towed by the tugs, singing “The
Bonnie Blue Flag.”</p>
        <p>The thing which made me feel very proud was the news told me
by quite a number of the officers that in the reorganization
near at hand, my brother was to be the colonel of
the 46th. I asked him about it. He laughed and said it was all
nonsense, and refused to discuss the subject. But I knew it was
true, for everybody in the regiment turned towards him lovingly
as the “best and bravest and simplest and purest man among
them.</p>
        <p>I was lonesome enough January 3, 1862, when father and
his staff rode off from Rolleston to join the brigade
<pb id="wise174" n="174"/>
at its new station. They journeyed by land along the coast to Nag's Head, on the outer
coast of North Carolina, whence they were to cross by ferry to Roanoke 
Island.</p>
        <p>I felt a deep foreboding that trouble was in store for us from this new venture.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XII</head>
        <head>THE ROANOKE ISLAND TRAGEDY</head>
        <p>THERE are certain names whose mere mention
produces feelings of horror, or pain, or sadness from
association. To me, that of Roanoke Island is one of these.</p>
        <p>The island commanded the passage by water through
Hatteras Inlet and Pimlico Sound to Albemarle and
Currituck sounds. It was a most important strategic point, for
a force of Union troops passing it had at their mercy several
towns upon the North Carolina coast, could cut off the
supplies and railroad and canal communications of Norfolk,
and were in position to attack that city in rear. 
About January 1,1862, my father was assigned to 
the command and defense of Roanoke Island. Major-General
Huger was the commander of the department
embracing that position. </p>
        <p>General Huger was one of those old West Point
incompetents with whom the Confederacy was burdened.
He was both by birth and personally a gentleman, and no
doubt a brave man; but the only reason on earth for his
being a major-general in command of an important
department was that he was a graduate of West Point.
The Confederacy felt this influence much more than the
United States. Mr. Davis, our President, was a West Point
graduate as was everybody else connected with our military
organization General Bragg, his favorite military
counselor, was the martinet of the old army; and Generals
Hardee and Cooper, the leading advisers at headquarters;
<pb id="wise176" n="176"/>
and Generals Lee and Johnston, the commanders in the
field, were all West Point graduates.</p>
        <p>I am not belittling the great advantages secured to the
Confederacy by service of a number of very superior West
Point officers, who joined their fortunes with hers; but with
them came also a very inefficient and inferior lot, unfit for
the high commands to which they were assigned,  -  men
who stood in the way of better officers, and who were
appointed and retained merely through favoritism. To this
latter class belonged Major-General Benjamin Huger, the
officer in command of Norfolk.</p>
        <p>The Secretary of War at the time was Judah P. Benjamin, 
in many respects the most remarkable person in
the Confederate States. The Confederate leaders were as a
rule, men of deep feelings and convictions, or men of
intense or passionate natures. Not so with Benjamin: he
had more brains and less heart than any other civil leader
in the South. He was an English Jew, and a 
lawyer of the first rank. He entered upon employment as
attorney for a client. For that client he worked with
surprising acumen, with great learning, with boundless
capacity for endurance, with unquestioned loyalty, and
absolute fidelity. If his client was in any case hanged, it was
only after Benjamin had done all in his power for him; but
after Benjamin had exhausted the resources of defense
and come to the end of the business for which he was retained,
he possessed the power of completely dismissing
his client's affairs from his mind. Likely as not, he would be
having a bottle of Madeira and a cigar at his club at the
moment the hanging was taking place. His nature was
such that he had no sentimental attachments, and seldom
troubled himself about the troubles of others. His
convictions were clear, vigorous, and strongly urged;
they were never passionate, or clouded by affection or
<pb id="wise177" n="177"/>
hate; he was never harassed by reminiscences. When a case
was lost, he did not bemoan it; he found another. He played
his part in the Confederacy as if he held a hand
in a game of whist; a skilled professional, he lost no
trick that could be saved, and did everything possible to win
for himself and his partner. When he lost, he indulged in no
repinings; he tore up the old pack, lighted a fresh cigar,
moved to another table, called for a fresh pack, took a new
partner, and played another game. His last game proved to
be much more successful than his Confederate venture, for
he moved to England, and became justly eminent at the
English bar. The Confederacy and its collapse were no more
to Judah P. Benjamin than a last year's bird's-nest.</p>
        <p>When my father was assigned to the command of Roanoke
Island, it was well known at the war department that
General McClellan was fitting out an expedition to attack
and capture the position. </p>
        <p>The disastrous termination of the operations of 1861 in
the mountains of West Virginia had not enhanced my
father's military reputation, or that of any other general
who was in the mountains. On the Union side, McClellan
had suffered, and even the prestige of Lee had been
damaged, in those impossible campaigns, so that he had
been assigned to the fortifications of Charleston followed by
the jeering taunts of John M. Daniel, the satirical editor of
the “Richmond Examiner.”</p>
        <p>But while my father lacked the advantages of a military
education he had a remarkably correct apprehension of
topography and was quick to see the strategic value of
positions. As soon as he visited Roanoke Island, he grasped
its importance, and saw that it was not only practically
defenseless, but unsupplied with any adequate is of
erecting fortifications. He hurried back to the
<pb id="wise178" n="178"/>
headquarters of General Huger at Norfolk, and doubtless
harassed that easy-going and high-living soldier with his
importunities. Failing to obtain any assistance from General
Huger, he repaired to Richmond, and endeavored to impress
upon the Secretary of War the necessity for prompt action.
Mr. Benjamin was an attorney, and not a soldier. He looked
for instruction to his client, who in this case was General
Huger. He doubtless thought that the West Pointer knew
much more of such matters than the civilian, and regarded it
as little less than insubordination for a brigadier-general to
seek the department direct. Then, too, Mr. Benjamin was
an easy-spoken, cool, suave Jew, quiet and diplomatic in
speech, never excited. It disturbed his nerves to have General
Wise in his department,  -  ardent, urgent, pressing, declaring
that past neglect had been criminal and present delay
was suicidal, and even guilty occasionally of some indignant
swearing at the galling indifference shown to the urgent peril
of the situation. The upshot of all this was a peremptory
order from the war department to General Wise to return
forthwith to Roanoke Island, and to do the best he could with
what he had in hand.</p>
        <p>After the inevitable disaster, the Confederate Congress
declared that General Wise had done everything in his
power, and that the blame for defeat lay entirely at the door
of General Huger and the Secretary of War; but that never
repaired the wreck, or gave us back our dead. <ref targOrder="U" id="ref5" n="5" rend="sc" target="note5">1</ref></p>
        <note id="note5" n="5" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref5">
          <p>1.  The report of the investigating committee, Confederate House of
Representatives (Series I. vol. i. p. 190):  - </p>
          <p>“The correspondence on file of General Wise with the Secretary of War,
General Huger, his superior officer, the governor of North Carolina, and
others, proves that he was fully alive to the importance of Roanoke Island,
and has devoted his whole time and energies and uproar to the defense of
that position, and that he is in no way responsible for the unfortunate
disaster which befell our forces upon the island on February 7 and 8.</p>
          <p>“But the committee cannot say the same in reference to the efforts of
the Secretary of War and the commanding officer at Norfolk, General
Huger. It is apparent that the island of Roanoke is important for the
defense of Norfolk, and that General Huger had under his command at
that point upward of 15,000 men, a large supply of armament and
ammunition, and could have thrown in a few hours a large reinforcement
upon Roanoke Island, and that himself and the Secretary of War had
timely notice of the entire inadequacy of the defenses, the want of men
and munitions of war, and the threatening attitude of the enemy, but
General Huger and the Secretary of War paid no practical attention to
these urgent appeals of General Wise, sent forward none of his important
requisitions and permitted General Wise and his inconsiderable force to
remain to meet at least 15,000 men, well armed and equipped. If the
Secretary of War and the commanding general at Norfolk had not the means
to reinforce General Wise, why was he not ordered to abandon his
position and save his command?</p>
          <p>“But, on the contrary, he was required to remain and sacrifice his
command, with no means, in his insulated position, to make his escape in
case of defeat . . . .Whatever of blame and responsibility is justly
attributable to any one for the defeat should attach to Major-General
B. Huger and the late Secretary of War, J. P. Benjamin.”</p>
        </note>
        <pb id="wise179" n="179"/>
        <p>Our home was on the route between Norfolk and Roanoke
Island. My father's haggard, perplexed appearance, as he
passed back and forth on these fruitless trips, revealed only
too plainly his knowledge that he had been placed in a
death-trap. Indeed, we all knew, as well before as
afterwards, what would be the result.</p>
        <p>It was on the 8th of February, 1862; a cold, blustering
northeast storm had prevailed for several days; the leaden
skies hung low; the rain, blown in sheets by the gusts, swept
against the windows; all farm work had been suspended;
the tides were driven in high upon the marshes; and the only
time I left the house during the day was in an oiled
sou'wester and gum boots, to look after the feeding of the
cattle and the sheep, huddled in their sheds of myrtleboughs,
and to see that the stock was cared for in the
evening. I was now the head of the plantation. A gloomy
dusk was closing in; the cold
<pb id="wise180" n="180"/>
winds swept so keenly that they fretted the shallow puddles
collected in the yard.</p>
        <p>With emptied feed-basket on my arm, I was returning; to the
house, when I saw a horseman slowly approaching by the farm
road. He was so muffled as to be unrecognizable, and even
when he reached the yard gate, I did not recognize the jaded
beast that bore him as our pretty little sorrel filly. It was my
brother Richard, my father's aid-de-camp, who for forty-eight
hours had been riding alone along the cheerless beach of the
Atlantic to bring the announcement to General Huger that the
armada of Burnside, consisting of about sixty vessels, had
entered Hatteras Inlet, passed up Pimlico Sound, and was in
sight of Roanoke Island when he left with his dispatches.
These he had delivered to the general at Norfolk, who, as he
reported, seemed almost indifferent to the announcement.
Having performed his task, he had ridden back to our home,
seven miles upon the return journey, and now reached it,
himself and his steed half dead from exhaustion. There was little
to lighten the gloom in the poor fellow's appearance or
conversation, for he reported our father prostrated at Nag's
Head from exposure in the effort to prepare the island for the
approaching assault.</p>
        <p>A roaring wood-fire and a hearty supper somewhat revived
his spirits, and for a time we almost forgot war troubles while
he gave marvelous accounts of the great flocks of sea-fowl
through which he had ridden in the storm. The strong winds
and high tides had forced him to ride, sometimes for miles, in
water up to the knees of his horse; and the storm was so fierce
that the geese and brant and ducks, driven in-shore, were
reluctant to fly, and oftentimes barely moved out of the way of
his horse.</p>
        <p>As we sat there, seeking such comfort as our home
<pb id="wise181" n="181"/>
and security from the storm outside gave us, and wondering
what had happened below, we little realized that upon the day
before, and on that very day, the battle of Roanoke Island had
been fought and lost, and that our gallant brother, wounded to
death, lay dying in the camp of his captors.</p>
        <p>The battle of Roanoke Island, fought February 7 and 8, was
the first of a series of disasters which befell the Confederates
in the early part of 1862.</p>
        <p>Roanoke Island is shaped something like an hourglass. Its
northernmost half is higher ground than its southernmost, and
the waters and wet marshes almost intersect it at its middle
part. The engineers who planned its defenses placed all its
fortifications upon the upper half, bearing upon the channel of
Croatan Sound to westward. Not a work was erected to prevent
a debarkation upon its lower portion. An attacking force
landing there was absolutely safe from the water batteries,
both while landing and afterwards. At the narrow neck of land
which connected the upper and lower half of the island was a
fortification, not one hundred feet in length and only four and
a half feet high, mounting three field-pieces. This captured,
every other artillery defense of the island was at the mercy of
the enemy, who by that manœuvre were in their rear,  -  so
emphatically in their rear that the vessels attacking the water
batteries could not fire after the Union troops assaulted the
redoubt, for their shot would have fallen into the ranks of their
own troops.</p>
        <p>The sea beach eastward of Roanoke Island, separated from it
by shallow water, is known as Nag's Head. My fathers
headquarters were established at a seaside hotel on the outer
beach. The announcement of the presence of Burnside's
expedition found him prostrated with pneumonia, and the
command of the troops devolved upon
<pb id="wise182" n="182"/>
Colonel Shaw, of North Carolina, although my father continued 
to give general directions from his sick-bed.</p>
        <p>The entire available force of Colonel Shaw consisted of two
regiments of North Carolina troops, numbering 1024 men, and a
detachment of my father's brigade, numbering 410 men, under
Lieutenant-Colonel Anderson,  -  total, 1434 men.</p>
        <p>Upon the morning of February 7, the ships of General
Burnside attacked what was known as the Fork Point battery,
and a ridiculous little so-called fleet of Commander Lynch,
consisting of seven tugs and river steamers. It was dubbed a 
“mosquito fleet,” and such in truth it was. Although gallantly
manoeuvred, it was no more regarded by Commodore
Goldsbrough than if the vessels had been so many tin pans
armed with potato guns. Pork Point battery was bravely
defended all day, but its guns could only be brought to bear
upon objects within a limited segment.</p>
        <p>The bombardment was kept up until night to cover the
landing of the troops at a point known as Ashby's, just below
the narrow part of the island. No serious damage was done to
the battery, and but few men were killed.</p>
        <p>Late in the afternoon, three Federal brigades were debarked.
The first consisted of five full regiments under General Foster;
the second, of four regiments under General Reno; the third, of
four regiments under General Parke,  -  thirteen full regiments in
all, not to mention a detachment of New York Marine Artillery,
with six Dahlgren guns, and Company B. New York 99th
Regiment. The debarkation took place at Ashby's Landing.</p>
        <p>Colonel Jordan, commanding the 31st North Carolina
Regiment, was sent to this point with his command under
<pb id="wise183" n="183"/>
orders to resist the landing, but he retired without firing a gun.
He had but 450 men, and the overwhelming number of the
enemy, and the vast fleet covering their landing and ready to
open on him as soon as his firing disclosed his position,
perhaps justified Colonel Jordan in returning. So the enemy, by
night-time, in astonishing force, was landed, and ready for next
day's operations.</p>
        <p>In his report, General Burnside gives a graphic description of
the beautiful sight when one of his light-draught steamers ran
up, towing a hundred surf-boats loaded down with men, and, 
“cutting loose” all at once, the boats were beached side by side
with such precision that four thousand men were landed in
twenty minutes; and this was but one of his three brigades.</p>
        <p>Fancy the feelings of that little band of raw North Carolina
troops under Colonel Jordan when, from the adjacent woods,
they witnessed these landings, and not only knew they had
but one thousand comrades to assist them, but that, when the
fight was lost, as lost it must be, there was no hope of escape!
Verily, the first colonists were not more desperately situated.
No one can blame the poor fellows for quietly withdrawing up
the dark and narrow road to the earthworks at the causeway
connecting the two sections of the island, a mile and a half
distant. There they found the Virginians and the 8th North
Carolina Regiment, numbering less than one thousand men in
all. The earthwork facing south, and commanding the
causeway by which the Union forces must approach, was so
insignificant in size that even the small number of
Confederates available more than filled it, and a part of
Jordan's regiment was placed in reserve in the fight next day.
The engineers who had erected this little work had reported
that the marshes to the right and left were impassable. The
same rainy, gusty night already
<pb id="wise184" n="184"/>
described settled down on our wretched soldiers, while, less
than two miles away, between twelve and fifteen thousand of
the enemy were building camp-fires, cooking their ample
supplies of provisions, and preparing to advance upon the
earthwork in the morning.</p>
        <p>Anxious to obtain information, Colonel Anderson ordered
Captain O. Jennings Wise, of Company A, 46th Virginia, with
twenty of his Virginians, to reconnoitre the position of the
enemy. In that wretched swamp, reconnoitring meant simply
going down a narrow road until they struck the enemy. The
road ran directly south, through the main embrasure of the
earthwork, over the sunken causeway. In front of the work, for
several hundred yards, the timber was cleared away. Beyond
the clearing, the road entered the woods, and, turning to the
right, ran down to Ashby's Landing where the enemy was
bivouacked.</p>
        <p>The task assigned to the brave fellows was simple enough.
All they had to do was to walk right down through the silent
pines until they came to the enemy's picket guard; when that
happened, somebody was likely to be shot, and somebody
likely to run away.</p>
        <p>It all sounds very simple, does it not, dear reader? I am
conjecturing, as I pen these lines, whether you ever had any
such experience. If not, and if you really are anxious for a
novel sensation, you can obtain it whenever you go on one of
these little reconnoissances.</p>
        <p>Cheerfully, and as uncomplainingly as if the allotted task
was of their own choosing, the little party sallied forth. Across
the opening they trudged in the gray darkness, and plunged
into the silent woods beyond. In Indian file and in silence they
pursued their route. Tramp, tramp, tramp,  -  on, on, on, every
step bearing them, as all knew, nearer and nearer to the enemy
they
<pb id="wise185" n="185"/>
were seeking. Now and again they paused and listened for
some sound; then onward they pressed, the tension
constantly becoming greater. No picket fire warned them.</p>
        <p>Of a sudden, “Who goes there?” came forth huskily out of
the darkness from a picket not twenty yards away. Quick as a
flash, they made a dash for him; but he fired and fled, followed
by two or three companions, who, like him, fired backwards as
they ran, and our boys gave them a volley, knocking one of
them over. Pursuit was too dangerous, for the sounds of the
firing had aroused the camp, and loud calls and hurrying
voices, not far distant, made it too plain that discretion was the
better part of valor. So, picking up the cap and gun of the man
who had been shot, the scouts started on a double-quick back
to the redoubt. What was learned was only that the enemy had
gone into camp near the spot where he landed. Prepared for
sleep by this little march and its excitements, my brother and his
men lay down on the wet ground behind the breastworks, and
slept, some of them, their last earthly sleep.</p>
        <p>A heavy fog hung over Roanoke Island the morning of
February 8, so dense that the fleet opposite the Pork Point
battery was unable to open fire, except in a desultory way. It
was eight o'clock before the mists lifted sufficiently for the
attack, and then the gunboats fired cautiously lest their shells
should fall among their friends who were advancing towards
our works.</p>
        <p>General Foster's brigade, accompanied by the six Dahlgren
guns, moved, about eight o'clock, up the narrow roadway
leading from Hammond's or Ashby's landings to the redoubt.
Their advance was completely concealed from the
Confederates, until a sudden turn to the left in the road
brought them to the clearing in front of our
<pb id="wise186" n="186"/>
earthworks. Then the Dahlgren guns, under Midshipman 
Porter, went into position and opened fire,
supported by the 25th Massachusetts and 10th
Connecticut regiments.</p>
        <p>The disposition of the Confederate forces was as follows: 
three field-pieces, a 24-pounder, an 18-pounder
and a 6-pounder, were mounted on the intrenchments.
For all three, they had nothing but 6-pounder ammunition. 
The 6-pounder was at the centre of the embrasure;
commanded by young William B. Selden, lieutenant of
engineers. The infantry supporting this artillery behind
the breastworks consisted of two companies of the 8th
North Carolina, two companies of the 31st North Carolina,
and two companies of the 46th and 59th Virginia
regiments, in all about five hundred men. The Rangers of
the 59th Virginia under Captain Coles were deployed as
skirmishers to the right of the earthwork; and the Blues
of the 46th Virginia under Captain Wise were deployed
as skirmishers to the left, in order to guard against any
attempted flank movement. Every engineer and every
scouting party who had examined the ground had
pronounced the deep and heavily wooded marshes to the
right and left of the Confederate position to be
impassable.</p>
        <p>General Foster, as soon as he engaged the fort with
his artillery and leading regiments, ordered the 23d and
27th Massachusetts regiments of his brigade to pass into
the swamp on the right, with directions to spare no effort
to penetrate it, and, if possible, turn the Confederate left
flank. Moving rapidly along the edge of the clearing,
these two regiments with great pluck entered the bog
and undergrowth, and, toiling knee-deep in the muddy
ooze, soon hotly engaged the Blues in the effort to turn
our left flank. The fighting in front was stubborn, so stubborn,
<pb id="wise187" n="187"/>
indeed, that in three hours the 25th Massachusetts
exhausted its ammunition and was relieved by the 10th
Connecticut; and the artillery, having used all but a few
rounds of its ammunition, was ordered to suspend its fire.
Meanwhile, Reno's brigade, coming up, moved to the left
and penetrated the dense woods in the attempt to turn
our right flank. The assault of Reno's brigade was met
by the Ben McCulloch Rangers, alone. Poor Coles, their
commander, was killed. The onslaught of Reno was
irresistible, and, as soon as his men could extricate
themselves from the morass and gain the higher ground
where the Rangers were posted, they drove the latter
before them like chaff before the wind.</p>
        <p>Then came tremendous cheering from Reno's men,
announcing their success in turning the right flank of the
fort. This so inspired the brigade of General Parke,
which had now come up and was deploying to the right
to aid the attack of Foster's flanking column, that the last
regiment of Parke (9th New York), while in the act of
passing the causeway, hearing the sound of Reno's
cheering and seeing a slackening of the fire from the
Confederate earthworks, changed direction and charged
the works in brilliant style. Whoever else may have been
appalled, young Selden still worked his gun, which bore
directly upon the advancing regiment. A discharge
passed over their heads. Deliberately lowering his piece
and reloading, he seized the lanyard in his own hand and
attempted to fire. The primer failed. Coolly securing and
adjusting a new primer, he once more sighted and
screwed down his gun so that it would rake mercilessly
through the ranks now close upon him. He straightened 
himself from sighting, stepped back, and was
actually making the motion to jerk the lanyard, when a
bullet from the rifle of a Union soldier not thirty yards
<pb id="wise188" n="188"/>
away pierced his brain, and he fell forward across his gun.</p>
        <p>On the left, the Massachusetts men, inspired by the shouts
from Reno's and Parke's commands, moved up and drove back
the Blues. Captain Wise, scorning the protection of the trees
behind which, by his command, his men were concealed,
passed back and forth along his attenuated line, counseling
the men to keep cool and fire close. In such a position, under
the fire of two regiments concentrated upon a single company,
his conduct was almost suicidal. It was not long before his
sword arm fell helpless by his side, fractured near the wrist by
a minie-ball. Untying a handkerchief about his neck, he
bandaged the wounded limb, laughingly remarking that he was
fortunate it was no worse; but he had scarcely resumed
command of his men, when he fell mortally wounded.</p>
        <p>His soldiers were passionately attached to him, and,
although the fire was by this time becoming murderous, two of
the Blues spread a blanket, lifted him gently upon it, and,
bearing him between them, trotted off sullenly to the rear as
the Union troops were climbing over the Confederate redoubt
to their right.</p>
        <p>All was over as far as the defense of Roanoke Island was
concerned. Two small reinforcements landed on the north end
of the island that morning, one under Colonel Green, another
under Major Fry, but neither were in time to participate in the
fight.</p>
        <p>Our little band had done its best; two hundred and fifty-one
killed and wounded in the Union rattles (more than half as
many as our whole force engaged) testified to the honest
fighting of our men.</p>
        <p>The capture of the redoubt placed the Union forces directly
in rear of the Confederate shore batteries; and,
<pb id="wise189" n="189"/>
as no other positions on the island were defensible, Colonel
Shaw surrendered his entire force.</p>
        <p>My poor brother was borne by his men along an
unfrequented path to the eastern side of the island. There
they found a small boat, and, obedient to his earnest desire,
were conveying him to my father's headquarters at Nag's
Head, where he would have died. Unfortunately, a party of the
9th New York under Colonel Rush Hawkins pursued the same
path as themselves, and, seeing the boat, opened fire upon it
and ordered it to return. One of these shots gave my brother a
third wound. A letter written thirty-two years afterwards by
Colonel Hawkins, who in these days of restored amity I am
proud to number among my friends, tells the sad, sad story of
the death of that sweetest brother boy ever had.</p>
        <p>A few days later, a flag-of-truce boat brought up the bodies
of our dead. When, in the Capitol of Virginia at Richmond, I
gazed for the last time in the cold, calm face; when I saw the
black pageant which testified to the general mourning as they
bore him to his last resting-place in beautiful Hollywood,  -  I
began to realize as never before that war is not all brilliant
deeds and glory, but a gaunt, heartless wolf that comes boldly
into the most sacred precincts, and snatches even the sucking
babe from the mother's breast; that the most cherished
treasure is its favorite object of destruction; that it ever plants
its fangs in the bravest and tenderest hearts; and that that
which we prize the most is surest to be seized by its insatiate
rapacity.</p>
        <p>But, reader, the death of a dear one in war does not bring
with it the chastened sorrow of a peaceful death. It inflames
and infuriates the passion for blood; it intensifies the thirst
for another opportunity to see it flow.</p>
        <p>The feeling which possessed me then, I well remember.</p>
        <pb id="wise190" n="190"/>
        <p>It was, “How long, oh, how long, will it be, before I can bury
these hands in the heart of some of those who wrought this
deed!”</p>
        <p>In less than a month, the Confederate war-dogs tore, before
my very eyes, their bleeding victims in a way that seemed an
answer to my prayer for vengeance.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XIII</head>
        <head>THE MERRIMAC AND THE MONITOR</head>
        <p>THE building of the iron-clad afterwards famous all over the
world as the Virginia, or the Merrimac, was a subject of daily
conversation in our household from the time the Gosport
Navy Yard was burned and abandoned by the Union troops
in April, 1861.</p>
        <p>My father, during his service in Congress, was for some
years upon the Committee on Naval Affairs; his acquaintance
with naval officers resulting from that fact, and from his long
residence at Rio de Janeiro, was unusually widespread.
Commodore James Barron was one of his constituents and
warm friends. Commodore Barron was the gallant but
unfortunate officer who killed Decatur in a duel, and was
himself severely wounded. Besides other contributions of
value to the navy, he conceived the idea of an impregnable
steam propeller, armed with a pyramidal beak, and a terrapin-shaped
back at an acute angle to the line of projectiles fired
from its own level. He called it a marine catapulta, and had
complete models, plans, and descriptions, which he exhibited
to the naval committee, in the effort to have a ship
constructed on these lines. He made little impression,
however; for in those days steam navigation had attained no
very great success,  -   much less the utilization of iron upon
ships. He subsequently presented the model to my father,
who had also a large number of models of other vessels.</p>
        <p>In our rummaging about the place, we boys found these
<pb id="wise192" n="192"/>
models in some old boxes, and took them down to our
millpond, where we anchored them as part of our miniature
fleet. The Barron model, and one constructed by Lieutenant
Williamson of the navy, were the most conspicuous, making
quite a proud addition to our naval display. This was in 1860.</p>
        <p>We also possessed a brass cannon about eighteen inches
long, which had been cast for us by a convict in the Virginia
Penitentiary. That cannon was stamped with the words 
“Union and Constitution,” but its use by its possessors was
most lawless. Modeling slugs for it by pouring melted lead
into holes made by sticking our rammer in the sand, we were
constantly firing these slugs, to the great peril of everybody
in the vicinity.</p>
        <p>One of our neighbors, a Captain Johnson, an old sea man,
living about a mile down the creek, had a flock of geese; and
from one of his voyages in Indian seas he had brought back
six coolie boys, who were probably apprenticed to him. These
coolies were passionately fond of the water, and were almost
constantly in sight, bathing, or rowing, or sailing a felucca-rigged
boat. After trying the range of our gun upon Captain
Johnson's geese, we began to practice upon the coolies. On a
certain evening, Captain Johnson appeared in full marine rig at
our landing, rowed by his six coolies, and, announcing to our
father the sport in which we had been engaged, gave notice
that he had a gun of his own, with which, if we did not
promptly cease our diversion, he would open a return fire.</p>
        <p>My father, who was a friend of Captain Johnson, and
indignant at our reckless misconduct, gave us all a bad half
hour in consequence of this visit. We were summoned before
him, and, after considerable discussion concerning the
punishment we should receive, were marched in a body to the
landing and made to apologize to the
<pb id="wise193" n="193"/>
coolies, who grinned and showed their teeth. After that we
were good friends of the coolies, and our future operations with the
gun were confined to the millpond on the opposite side of the
farm. In our new field, it promptly occurred to us, as it would
to most boys, that the best targets for our cannon were the
models of the iron-clads anchored out in the pond.
Unfortunately, they had no iron upon them; and, such was the
precision we had acquired in our practice upon Johnson's
geese and coolies, that in a few days the models of
Commodore Barron and Lieutenant Williamson were riddled,
and ignominiously disappeared. They were resting in the mud
at the bottom of our millpond when the war broke out.</p>
        <p>The following spring, after visiting the navy yard and
seeing the partially burned Merrimac, my father became
enthusiastic upon the subject of raising her and building
upon her frame an iron-clad ship on the lines of Commodore
Barron's model. Imbued with this idea, he instituted rigorous
inquiries for the model; but, for reasons which may well be
understood, none of us boys aided him much in the search.
Failing to find his model, he wrote to General Lee, who was
then commander-in-chief of the Virginia forces, an elaborate
description of Commodore Barron's invention, and made
rough drawings, urging the use of the Merrimac for carrying
out the design. He always believed and declared that this was
the first suggestion which led to the building of the Virginia.</p>
        <p>We all knew that an iron-clad ship was being built, and from
time to time informed ourselves of the progress made; and
great things were expected from her. So deep was my father's
interest in her, that he several times visited the navy yard to
inspect her. He repeatedly expressed the opinion that she
was being built to draw too much water, and that her beak or
ramming prow was improperly
<pb id="wise194" n="194"/>
constructed in this, that it was horizontal at the top
and sloped upward from the bottom, whereas it should
have been horizontal on the bottom and made to slope
downward to a point. When the ship was launched he was
indignant because the lower edge or eaves of her armor-clad
covering stood several feet out of the water, and it was
necessary to ballast her heavily to bring her sheathing below
the water line. This increased her draught to eighteen feet,
which was, as he declared, entirely unnecessary. He insisted
that this condition was due to the failure of the naval
architects (in calculating the water which she would draw
when sheathed with iron) to deduct from the weight of her
sheathing the weight of masts, spars, rigging, and sails, which
were dispensed with.</p>
        <p>Admiral Buchanan, Commodore Forrest, Captain Brooke,
and all the prominent naval men connected with the Norfolk
Navy Yard were personal and warm friends of my father. He
did not hesitate to express his views concerning these things,
but they, as professional men generally do, made light of the
criticisms of a layman. Nevertheless, I think that many naval
authorities are now disposed to admit that the chief reason
why the Virginia did not triumph completely over the Monitor
was her great draught of water, the loss of her prow, and the
twisting of her stem in ramming the Cumberland.</p>
        <p>After the disaster of Roanoke Island, my father returned to
his home on sick leave, where for some time his life was in
danger from pneumonia, aggravated by exposure on the
retreat from Roanoke Island. Our house was visited almost
daily during this period by distinguished military and naval
officers from the city, who came to express their interest and
sympathy.</p>
        <p>It was before the day of steam launches, and the appearance
<pb id="wise195" n="195"/>
of the distinguished officers and of the naval boats
which came up, manned by a dozen oarsmen, whose stroke
fell as that of one man, was very striking. During these visits,
they diverted my father with full descriptions of the progress
made in arming and equipping the Virginia, and we were
advised that the time of her completion, and the attack upon
the vessels in Hampton Roads, was rapidly approaching.</p>
        <p>There was dear old Commodore Forrest, tall, dignified, and 
with a face as sweet as that of a woman, surmounted by a
great shock of white hair like the mane of some royal beast;
and Captain Buchanan, far less striking in appearance, quiet,
kindly, and as unpretentious as a country farmer, but with an
eye which age had not dimmed, and which even then was
filled with the light of battle. They were both old men.
Commodore Forrest was sixty-five and Captain Buchanan
sixty-two. There was also Captain Brooke, taciturn and
dreamy; and Lieutenant Catesby Jones, a quiet man of forty;
and Lieutenant Minor, young, quick, and fidgety as a wren;
and all the rest of them, mingling with us simply and
unostentatiously, as if unconscious that the issues of one of
the greatest struggles the world ever witnessed were
committed to their keeping, and that they were to emerge from
it with names which will be remembered as long as the records
of naval warfare are preserved.</p>
        <p>Almost daily we boys went to Norfolk for the mail, or on
some domestic mission. We preferred our boat, and seldom
failed, before we left Norfolk harbor, to stand over toward the
Gosport Navy Yard and sail around and take a look at the
Merrimac. Such we called her; for we had never become
accustomed to the new name, Virginia. My father was now 
convalescent, and secured the
promise that he would be advised when the ship was
<pb id="wise196" n="196"/>
ready to sail for the attack. On March 7, he received a note
from Commodore Forrest, or one of those who knew, advising
him that the attack would be made upon the following day. He
consented that my brother Richard and myself should
accompany him, and the next morning the horses, which now
had been well fed and rested for a month at home, were
saddled and ready for us at the door.</p>
        <p>When we reached the city, the Merrimac, accompanied by
two little gunboats, the Beaufort and the Raleigh, had already
passed out, and all three were below Fort Norfolk. The
waterway is more circuitous than that by land, and we were
sure we should reach Sewell's Point, the most favorable
position for observing the conflict, before the slow-moving
vessels; in this we were correct. After a sharp gallop of eight
miles, we rode out upon the sandy hills facing Hampton Roads
at Sewell's Point.</p>
        <p>The scene was truly inspiring. Hampton Roads is as
beautiful a sheet of water as any on the face of the globe. It is
formed by the confluence of the James, the Nansemond and
the Elizabeth rivers. The James enters it from the west, the
Nansemond from the south, and the Elizabeth from the east.
The tides in the Roads run north and south, and pass to and
from the Chesapeake Bay through a narrow entrance at the
north, between Old Point Comfort and Willoughby's Spit.
Midway between these is the fort then known as Rip-Raps,
the proper name of which was Fort Calhoun, now changed to
Fort Wool. On the eastern side of the Roads the Confederates
had fortified two points,  -  Sewell's Point, where we were, and
Lambert's Point, at the mouth of the Elizabeth. On the
southern side, between the mouths of the Elizabeth and
Nansemond rivers, were the Confederate fortifications on
Craney Island. On the western side, at
<pb id="wise197" n="197"/>
the entrance to the Roads, is Fortress Monroe. From there the
land runs westwardly to Hampton, thence southwardly to
Newport News, which marks the entrance of the James River.
The Roads are about four miles in width and seven in length.
From where we stood, looking north, Fortress Monroe and the
Rip-Raps were perhaps, four miles away; looking westward
across the Roads, Newport News was five miles away; and,
looking south, Lambert's Point and Craney Island were plainly
visible three miles off.</p>
        <p>Upon the battlements of Fortress Monroe and the Rip Rap's
great numbers of Union troops could be seen through field-glasses,
and we could also make out the camps and
fortifications of the enemy at Newport News, and between that
point and Hampton, while our own people lined the shores and
crowded the ramparts at Craney Island and Lambert's Point.</p>
        <p>Anchored in the Roads were a great number of vessels of
every description, steam and sail, from the smallest tugs and
sloops to the largest transports and warships. Rumors of the
attack had brought down to Sewell's Point a number of
civilians, and the whole appearance of the scene was
suggestive of the greatest performance ever given in the
largest theatre ever seen. The Merrimac and her attendants
had passed Craney Island, and were coming down the channel 
east of Craney Island light
when we arrived. As she passed our fortifications, she was
saluted and cheered, and returned the salutes. From the way
in which she was shaping her course when first seen, it looked
to the uninitiated as if she proposed to sail directly upon
the Rip-Raps. Such hurrying
and scurrying was seen among the non-combatant craft in
the Roads as was never witnessed before. From great three-masters
and double-deck steamers to
<pb id="wise198" n="198"/>
little tugs and sailboats, all weighed or slipped anchor and
made sail or steam for Fortress Monroe, except three dauntless
war vessels,  -  two steamers, the Minnesota and the Roanoke,
and one sailing vessel, the St. Lawrence,  -  whose 
duty called them in the opposite direction. A long tongue
of shoal, running out from Craney Island, compelled the Merrimac
to go below Sewell's Point before she struck the main channel;
then she swung into it and pointed westward, showing her
destination, for she headed straight for Newport News, where the
masts and spars of the Congress and the Cumberland were plainly
visible.</p>
        <p>It was now past midday. The Merrimac on her new course
was nearly stern to us, and grew smaller and smaller as she
followed the south channel to Newport News. The three
United States vessels  -  Minnesota, Roanoke, and St.
Lawrence  -  started after her by what is known as the north
channel. It was a bitter disappointment to us that the battle
was to be waged so far away, but the ships and their
movements were still in view. The sun was shining, and a fresh
March breeze would, we thought, blow away the smoke. It
seemed an eternity before the first gun was fired. The
Merrimac, Cumberland, and Congress were nearly ranged in
our line of vision. The Merrimac appeared to us as if she was
almost in contact with the nearest of the two vessels. Captain
Buchanan states in his report that he was within less than a
mile of the Cumberland when he commenced the engagement
by a shot at her from his bow gun. We saw a great puff of
smoke roll up and float off from the Merrimac; a moment later,
the flashes of broadsides and tremendous rolls of smoke from
the Congress, the Cumberland, the batteries on shore, and the
Union gunboats; and then came the thunderous sounds, following
<pb id="wise199" n="199"/>
each other in the same order in which we had seen the
smoke. The engagement had begun.</p>
        <p>It was a time of supreme excitement and supreme suspense;
for the details, we who had no glasses were dependent upon
those who had. “She has passed the congress!” exclaimed an
officer, who was straining forward, trying to descry the
positions of the ships through the smoke, which now
enveloped the point of Newport News and the water beyond.
Bang  -  crash  -  roar  -   went the guns, single shots and
broadsides, making all the noise that any boy could wish. 
“She is heading direct for the Cumberland!” shouted another
between the thunders of the broadsides. “She has rammed the
Cumberland!” was announced fifteen minutes after the first
gun was heard, and our people gave three cheers. Our teeth
chattering with excitement, we awaited the next
announcement; it soon came: “The Cumberland is sinking!”
and again we cheered. Then came an ominous lull, the
meaning of which we did not know. Those watching through
the glasses notified us that three steamers were in sight,
standing down James River, and we knew it was Commander
Tucker with the Patrick Henry, Jamestown, and Teazer. Think
of it! The Jamestown, which, but four years ago, had brought
the remains of President Monroe to Richmond, with the New
York Seventh Regiment, on that visit of fraternity and good-will.
Here she was, armed as a war-vessel, fighting, those very men!</p>
        <p>Once more the cannon belched and thundered. This time
what we saw and heard was alarming: “The Merrimac is
running up the river, away from the Congress and other
vessels; she is fighting the shore batteries as she goes.” It
looked indeed as if she was disabled in some way; again a lull
and anxious waiting. “The Merrimac
<pb id="wise200" n="200"/>
is turning around and coming back!” Again the roar of a hot
engagement with the forts; another lull and another heavy
roll. “She is back pounding the Congress and raking her fore
and aft. The Congress is aground.” Again our people went
wild with enthusiasm. Poor fellows on the Congress! When
the Merrimac withdrew and passed upstream, it was only to
gain deep water in order to wind her, for where she had
rammed the Cumberland, her keel was in the mud and she
could not be put about. The fearless sailors on the Congress,
deluded by the appearance of retreat, believed that she had
hauled off, and, leaving their guns, gave three cheers. Having
brought his ship around into position to attack the Congress,
Captain Buchanan now came back at her, and, as he
approached, blew up a transport alongside the wharf, sunk
one schooner, captured another, and proceeded to rake the
Congress where she had run ashore in shoal water.</p>
        <p>Describing this stage of the fight, Captain Buchanan says
in his report: “The carnage, havoc, and dismay caused by our
fire compelled them to haul down their colors and to hoist a
white flag at their gaff and half mast, and another at the main.
The crew instantly took to their boats and landed. Our fire
immediately ceased, and a signal was made for the Beaufort to
come within hail. He then ordered Lieutenant Commander
Parker to take possession of the Congress, secure the officers
as prisoners allow the crew to land, and burn the ship. This
Captain Parker did, receiving her flag and surrender from
Commander Smith and Lieutenant Pendergrast, with the
sidearms of those officers. They delivered themselves as
prisoners of war on board the Beaufort, and afterwards being
permitted, at their own request, to return to the ship to assist
in removing the wounded,
<pb id="wise201" n="201"/>
never returned. The Beaufort and Raleigh, while alongside the
Congress after her surrender, and while she had two white
flags flying, were subjected to a heavy fire from the shore and
from the Congress, and withdrew without setting her afire,
after losing several valuable officers and men.</p>
        <p>Then Lieutenant Minor was sent to burn the ship, when he
was fired upon and severely wounded. His boat was recalled,
and Captain Buchanan ordered the Congress to be destroyed
by hot shot and incendiary shell.</p>
        <p>By this time the ships from Old Point opened fire upon the
Merrimac. The Minnesota grounded in the North channel; the
shoalness of the water prevented the near approach of the
Merrimac. The Roanoke and St. Lawrence, warned by the fate
of the Cumberland and Congress, retired under the guns of
Fortress Monroe. The Merrimac pounded away at the
grounded Minnesota until the pilots warned her commander
that it was no longer safe to remain in that position; then,
returning by the south channel, she had an opportunity to
open again upon the Minnesota, although the shallow water
was between the two; and afterwards upon the St. Lawrence,
which responded with several broadsides. It was too
tantalizing to see these vessels, which in deep water would
have been completely at her mercy, protected from her
assaults by the shoals. By this time it was dark, and the
Merrimac anchored off Sewell's Point. The western sky was
illuminated with the burning Congress, her loaded guns were
successively discharged as the flames reached them,
until, a few minutes past midnight, her magazine exploded
with a tremendous report.</p>
        <p>Thus ended the first day's doings of the Merrimac. Soon
after she anchored, some of her officers came ashore, and we,
who had been waiting all day, and who had now
<pb id="wise202" n="202"/>
decided to remain all night in order to see the next day's
operations, were gratified with a full and graphic description
of the fighting. Captain Buchanan, Lieutenant Minor, and the
other wounded were sent to Norfolk. Having been tendered
the hospitality of Sewell's Point by some of the officers, our
party remained, and were lulled to sleep by the firing of the
guns of the burning Congress, and rudely aroused about
midnight by the tremendous explosion of her magazine.</p>
        <p>Up betimes in the morning, we saw the Minnesota still
ashore. She was nearly in line with us, and about a mile nearer
to us than Newport News. A tug was beside her, and a very
odd-looking iron battery. We expected great things from this
day's operations. About eight o'clock, the Merrimac ran down
to engage them, firing at the Minnesota, and occasionally at
the iron battery. She was now under command of Lieutenant
Jones. We confidently expected her to be able to get very
near to the Minnesota, but in this the pilots were mistaken.
When about a mile from the frigate, she ran ashore, and was
some time backing before she got afloat. Her great length and
draught rendered it difficult to work her. Notwithstanding
these delays, she succeeded in damaging the Minnesota
seriously, and in blowing up the tug-boat Dragon lying
alongside her.</p>
        <p>While this was going on, the iron battery, which looked
like a cheese-box floating on a shingle, moved out from
behind the frigate and advanced to meet the Merrimac. The
disparity in size between the two was remarkable we could
not doubt that the Merrimac would, either by shot or by
ramming, make short work of the cheese-box but as time wore
on, we began to realize that the newcomer was a tough
customer. Her turret resisted the shells of the Merrimac, and
not only was she speedier
<pb id="wise203" n="203"/>
but her draught was so much less than that of her antagonist that she
could run off into shallow water and
prevent the Merrimac from ramming her. There was no lack
of pluck shown by either vessel. The little Monitor came right
up and laid herself alongside as if she had been a giant. She
was quicker in every way than her antagonist, and presented
the appearance of a saucy kingbird pecking at a very large
and very black crow.</p>
        <p>The first shot fired by the Merrimac missed the Monitor,
which was a novel experience for the gunners who had been
riddling the hulls of frigates. Then, again, when the eleven-inch
solid shot struck the casemates, knocking the men of
the Merrimac down and leaving them dazed and bleeding at
the nose from the tremendous impact, they realized that the
cheese-box was loaded as none of the other vessels had
been. Neither vessel could penetrate the armor of the other,
both tried ramming unsuccessfully: the Monitor had not mass
sufficient to injure the Merrimac; the Merrimac only gave the
Monitor a glancing ram, weakened by the Monitor's superior
speed; and then the Monitor ran off into shallow water, safe
from pursuit.</p>
        <p>Twice we thought the Merrimac had won the fight. On the
first occasion, the Monitor went out of action, it seems, to
replenish the ammunition in the turret, it being impossible to
use the scuttle by which ammunition was passed unless the
turret was stationary and in a certain position. The second
occasion was about eleven o'clock,
when a shell from the Merrimac struck the Monitor's pilot-house, 
and seemed to have penetrated the ship. She drifted
off aimlessly towards shoal water; her guns were silent, and
the people on board the Minnesota gave up hope and
prepared to burn her. This was when Lieutenant Worden,
commander of the Monitor, was
<pb id="wise204" n="204"/>
blinded and the steersman stunned. Their position was so
isolated that no one knew their condition for 80 minutes;
then Lieutenant Greene discovered it, took command, and
brought the vessel back into action.</p>
        <p>Shortly afterwards, Lieutenant Jones withdrew to Merrimac.
In his report of the action, he said: “The pilots declaring that
we could get no nearer the Minnesota, and believing her to be
entirely disabled, and the Monitor having run into shoal
water, which prevents our doing her any further injury, we
ceased firing a twelve o'clock and proceeded to Norfolk. The
stem is twisted and the ship leaks; we have lost the prow, 
starboard anchor, and all the boats. The armor is somewhat
damaged, the steam-pipe and smoke-stack both riddled the
muzzles of two of the guns shot away.”</p>
        <p>When from the shore we saw the Merrimac haul off and
head for Norfolk, we could not credit the evidence of our
own senses. “Ah!” we thought, “dear old Buchanan would
never have done it.” Lieutenant Jones was afterwards fully
justified by his superiors, but it did seem to us that he ought
to have stayed there until he drove the Monitor away. Beside
the reasons assigned above, Lieutenant Jones declared that
it was <sic corr="necessary">necesary</sic> to leave when he did, in order to cross the
Elizabeth River bar. The inconclusive result of that fight has
left to endless discussion among naval men the question,
“Which was the better ship of the two?” It is not within the
scope of this volume to investigate that problem. It is certain
that, up to the time the Monitor appeared, the Merrimac
seemed irresistible, and that but for the presence 
of the Monitor, she would have made short work of
the Minnesota. It is equally certain that the Monitor 
performed her task of defense. It is said she was anxious to
renew the fight; but two weeks later, the 
<pb id="wise205" n="205"/>
Merrimac went down into deep water, where the Monitor
was lying under the guns of Fortress Monroe, and tried to
coax her out, but she would not come, and even permitted the
Jamestown and Beaufort to sail up to Hampton and capture
two schooners laden with hay. The truth is that, if the
Merrimac could have induced the Monitor to meet her in deep
water, she would easily have rammed and sunk her.</p>
        <p>On our ride back to the city, my father, while greatly elated
at what had been done, continued to deplore the errors of
construction in the Merrimac, which the two days' fighting
had made all the more manifest; but we boys thought she had
earned glory enough, and joined the others in the general
jubilation.</p>
        <p>Everybody in Norfolk knew the officers and men on board
our ships; many of them were natives of the town. When they
were granted shore leave, they were given a triumphal
reception. Some time since, I read an account of the Dutch
admiral, De Ruyter, who, the day after his four days' battle
with the English fleet, was seen in his yard in his shirt-sleeves,
with a basket on his arm, feeding his hens and sweeping out
his cabin. It reminded me of the simple lives and
unpretentious behavior of those splendid fellows who
handled the Merrimac. Yesterday, they revolutionized the
naval warfare of the world; to-day, they were walking about
the streets of Norfolk, or sitting at their firesides, as if
unaware that fame was trumpeting their names to the ends of
the earth.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XIV</head>
        <head>A REFUGEE</head>
        <p>NOTWITHSTANDING our elation over the performance
of the Merrimac, which every one in the Confederacy 
regarded as brilliant victories, the fact that Norfolk was in
imminent peril became more and more apparent.</p>
        <p>The lodgment gained by the Union forces at Roanoke and
their possession of the sounds and rivers on the North
Carolina coast, had given them control of the canals
tributary to the city, and their presence was a constant
menace to the railroads, which were now the chief remaining
means of supplies. Union troops could at any time be
transported up the North Carolina rivers to within a few
miles of the Seaboard and Petersburg lines.</p>
        <p>If our army should at any time retreat from the lower
peninsula between the York and the James, the Petersburg
line would be further imperiled; for in that event, it would be
easy to throw a force of Union troops across the James to
cut the railroad. The fifteen thousand Confederate troops in
and about Norfolk would then be in a
position of extreme danger.</p>
        <p>These things were, of course, much more apparent to
those in command than to us boys; but throughout March
and April we saw and heard enough to make us realize that
there was a grave prospect that Norfolk might at any time be
evacuated, and our home left within the Union lines.</p>
        <p>My father became so thoroughly satisfied of the 
<pb id="wise207" n="207"/>
approaching evacuation of Norfolk that he suspended farming
operations, directed the sale of surplus stock to the
Confederate commissary, ordered that all the hogs should be
killed and cured, and that all the corn upon the place should
be ground and sold. Out of abundant precaution, the family
was removed in the latter part of April to the vicinity of
Richmond, and thither also were sent a number of the young,
able-bodied slaves.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, his military duties called him to Richmond,
where he was placed in command of the inner line of
defenses at Chaffin's farm, on the James River.</p>
        <p>Our home was thus left in the temporary custody of the
miller, a white man, and a few of the old trusted slaves, my
father having arranged with a friend in Norfolk, a man past
the age of military service, that, in the event of the
evacuation of the city, he would move out and take
possession of Rolleston, occupy it, and as far as possible act
as protector.</p>
        <p>About May 1, satisfied that the crisis was near at hand, my
father gave my brother Richard a leave of absence, and he
and I, with an orderly, were sent to Rolleston to do what we
could towards disposing of the remaining stock, and
shipping our movables to a place of safety.</p>
        <p>The plans of the military authorities were of course
guarded with as much secrecy as possible, but upon our
journey to Norfolk, the crowded condition of the railroads
and the immense shipments of government stores and
munitions not only confirmed us in the opinion that this was
preparatory to evacuation, but satisfied us it was almost
idle to hope to secure transportation for our private
effects.</p>
        <p>Still, we hustled around in a very lively way. We sold
some horses and cattle to the government, and, with a
little more time, would have succeeded fairly well in stripping
<pb id="wise208" n="208"/>
the old place “down to bare poles,” as the sailors say. It
was a sad and lonely mission. The farm was just beginning to
assume an orderly and well-kept appearance. Two years of
hard work, and the expenditure of a large amount of money in
new buildings and fences and in painting, had brought it out
wonderfully. New roads had been built, trees had been
planted, and ragged spots had been cleaned up, until
Rolleston, while nothing grand or fine, was a sweet, home-like
old farm, endeared to us especially by the memory of the
delightful days of boyhood which we had spent there. Now
everything about it was gloomy and sad enough. Not a human
being was in the house with us, except Skaggs, the white
orderly, who was sent to assist us, and old Aunt Mary Anne,
the cook, and Jim, the butler. Jim my father regarded as his
man Friday. Jim was to accompany us on our return to
Richmond. Nobody doubted that one so faithful and so long
trusted would prove true in this emergency.</p>
        <p>We wandered back and forth through the old house,
looking over the deserted rooms to see what particular articles,
most prized, we might wrap in small packages for removal, in
case we could not arrange for the transportation of everything.
It was a difficult problem to solve. The house was filled with
souvenirs from all parts of Europe and North and South
America. That was before the days of bricabrac, but our house
abounded with the things now so called. Our drawing-room
contained several pictures of great value, and many valuable
historical relics. Among the pictures were the original of Herring's
Village Blacksmith; a beautiful Bacchante, painted in
1829 by Pauline Laurent, presented to my father by Baron
Lomonizoff; and a set of exquisite Teniers (paintings of Dutch
drinking-scenes), beside sundry works of less note but great
value. The cabinets were literally
<pb id="wise209" n="209"/>
loaded with pretty souvenirs of foreign travel, and articles of
historic interest.</p>
        <p>We determined that these things should be first packed and
shipped, and had succeeded, on our visit to the city the day
before, in securing a promise from a friend in the
transportation department that, if we had them in Norfolk the
next day, he would send them through for us, even if they
went along with government goods. Accordingly, we had
ordered up the lumber for boxing them, and with Skaggs and
Jim were just preparing to pack, when, looking out of the
window, we saw, rapidly approaching in a buggy, the friend
whom our father had engaged to occupy the farm in case
Norfolk was evacuated. As he drove up to the yard gate,
opened it hastily, and hurried to the front steps, he exclaimed
excitedly, even before alighting, “The Yankees are coming! The
Yankees are coming! You had better get out of here quickly, if
you don't want them to catch you!” Then, in calmer tones, he
told us that the city was being evacuated; that the garrison
from Sewell's Point and Lambert's Point had been withdrawn
during the night, and, together with the troops in the
intrenched camps between us and Norfolk, had all been
marched into the city, and transported quietly under cover of
darkness to the south side of the Elizabeth River; that the work
of destroying the Gosport Navy Yard at Portsmouth had
begun; that the Merrimac had sailed out of the harbor to go up
James River; that the enemy at Fortress Monroe were landing
troops at Sewell's Point and Willoughby's Spit; that they were
rapidly approaching, if they had not already reached, the city;
and that there was not a Confederate soldier between us and
them.</p>
        <p>It took us about two minutes to decide upon our course of
action. By taking the Princess Anne County road via Great
Bridge, we could pass around the head of the
<pb id="wise210" n="210"/>
eastern branch of the Elizabeth River, and, going thence
westwardly to Suffolk, get once more within the Confederate
lines. We bore in mind that the Union troops in North Carolina
were probably acting in concert with those at Fortress
Monroe, and, marching up from the South, might intercept us.
Skaggs hurried to the stable, harnessed four mules to a farm
wagon, and went straight to the smoke house. We harnessed
a pair of carriage horses to our best carriage, and proceeded to
the house. The faithful Jim was on hand to aid in loading the
carriage with such silverware and valuables as it-would hold,
and such of the farm hands as were left aided Skaggs in
loading the wagon with meat.</p>
        <p>Just before we were ready to start, Jim disappeared. In vain
we called and searched for him. We never saw him again. The
prospect of freedom overcame a lifetime of love and loyalty.
There never was an hour of his life at which he could not have
had his freedom for the asking. He had several times refused
it. But now the opportunity was irresistible.</p>
        <p>Skaggs with his wagon drove out ahead of us. My brother
for the last time disappeared in the house. When he returned,
he had in his hands a long roll of canvas. He had with his
knife cut “The Village Blacksmith” out of its frame, and
wrapped it upon a roller. We tied it firmly, and strapped it in
the top of the carriage. After the war, we sold that picture for
fifteen hundred dollars, and the money came at a very good
time. During the present year (1897), the press has announced
its sale in England at a very large sum. Some years afterwards,
I found the Bacchante of Pauline Laurent in the parlor of a
Union volunteer general in Washington, and have it now. He
delivered it upon a very persuasive note from General
Schofield, then Secretary of War. Our Teniers
<pb id="wise211" n="211"/>
paintings, and several others of considerable value, have never
been recovered. Soon after the war ended, General Brown of
the Freedmen's Bureau, returned to my father a valuable
meerschaum pipe, the gift of the King of Holland to a friend;
and when I was in Congress, General B. F. Butler presented me
with a cup made from the original timber of the United States
ship Constitution, received by my father from Captain
Percival, of the navy. Thus, from time to time, a few of the
things we left that day drifted back to us; but the great bulk of
them were swept out by the tide, and lost upon the all-
engulfing sea of war. My father's correspondence, which was
very extensive, was left in his library. It was placed by the
Union authorities in the hands of the late Ben Perley Poore, of
Boston, for examination. It was said that the chief purpose of
such searches was to find, if possible, disloyal
correspondence between Southern leaders and people in the
North known as Southern sympathizers. Many years after the
war, a box of unimportant letters was returned to me by one of
the departments. The valuable portions of the correspondence
were missing. When Mr. Poore died, a few years ago, his
effects were advertised for sale, and among them were a great 
number of letters from my father's files.</p>
        <p>We bade farewell to Rolleston with heavy hearts, and bent
our cheerless way to Great Bridge. Even before we left, the
explosions in Norfolk began, and we heard them as we drove
along. We were very anxious lest the enemy, 
coming up from the South, should reach Great Bridge
before we did, but we passed it safely, and late in the
night reached Suffolk. It was a profound relief when
we found ourselves once more safely within the
Confederate lines. We saved our bacon in more senses than
one: for a party of Union troops reached our place a few
hours
<pb id="wise212" n="212"/>
after we left it, and the next day the Union forces occupied
the route we had traveled to Suffolk. Not long after our arrival
there, we heard an unusually loud explosion, which, as we
afterwards learned, was the blowing up of the magazine of the
Merrimac, an event which depressed us greatly.</p>
        <p>Reaching Richmond after several days' quiet driving, we
were directed to proceed to my sister's home in Goochland
County, whither the women of our family had preceded us.
There I remained until shortly after the seven days' fighting
about Richmond, when I was sent in charge of some of our
slaves to a temporary home secured by my father in the
mountains of southwest Virginia, at Rocky Mount, in Franklin
County. He correctly foresaw that, whatever happened, no
enemy would penetrate into that remote region.</p>
        <p>Before our departure for Franklin County, I made several
visits to Richmond, which was now on all occasions crowded to
overflowing with troops. The most vivid impression of
handsome soldiery made upon me during the war was by the
Third Alabama Regiment. In the two months which had elapsed
since the evacuation of Norfolk, I had not seen the regiment. Of
its splendid conduct in the battle of Seven Pines, and in the
other engagements, I had of course heard, and, knowing many
of its members, was naturally interested in everything concerning 
it. Passing along the streets of Richmond one day, I
saw three or four soldiers, looking as ragged and dirty as the
average, and I should have passed them by without further
attention but for hearing my name called. Then it was I
recognized a party of the dear old boys whom I had known in
the intrenched camp at Norfolk. It is impossible to convey any
idea of the change which I had been wrought in their
appearance by two mostly of
<pb id="wise213" n="213"/>
hard campaigning on the Peninsula. Their uniforms, once so
neat, were worn and torn and patched, marked with mud and
clay, and scorched by camp-fires. Their bright buttons and
trimmings had lost all lustre. Their flair was long, the freshness
of their complexions gone, and their eyes seemed lustreless
and bleared by camp-fire smoke. Even their voices were
softened and subdued. Oh! nobody knows, until he has seen
it, how marching and fighting by day, and sleeping under the
stars or in the storm at night, can wear men out. The Third Alabama
had had many a hard knock since we parted. In one of
its earliest engagements, it had been subjected by the mistake
of some commander to a murderous attack, in which it lost its
noble colonel, Lomax, whose body was never found. I was
shocked and surprised, upon inquiry for this or that light-
hearted fellow whom I had known in the gay days of mandolin
and guitar and moonlight sails, when they camped at Norfolk,
to hear that he was killed at such a place, or wounded at such
a place, or lay ill in such and such hospital, or was granted
sick leave. Nothing I had ever seen or heard before so brought
home to me the vivid realization that this war was becoming all-
consuming and all-devouring.</p>
        <p>“And where is the regiment now?” I asked. It was on the
nine-mile road, facing the enemy, about seven miles from the
city, near the Chickahominy bottoms, waiting to yield up yet
other victims to the Confederate cause in the seven days'
fighting about Richmond. That evening I rode down to see
them, but there was little to cheer one in the visit. There were
no more tents, or cooks, or attendant servants, or bright
uniforms, or bands, or dress parades. The camp was located
in a copse of pines in rear of a line of breastworks from which
the Union troops had been driven in the battle of Seven
Pines, and
<pb id="wise214" n="214"/>
which were now made to face the enemy. The men slept on
the ground, without any covering. The few camp fires were
built along the line, and the soldiers were cooking their own
rough fare. Out at the front, picket firing resounded all along
the line, and the men seemed to be silently brooding upon the
deadly storm then gathering. The seven days' fighting, from
Mechanicsville to Malvern Hill, began a little later, and many
another friend among them yielded up his life in those sultry
summer days of 1862.</p>
        <p>As we were returning to Richmond that afternoon, attracted
by artillery firing upon the Mechanicsville pike, we rode out to
Strawberry Hill, a beautiful farm overlooking the
Chickahominy valley, and witnessed an artillery duel between
Captain Lindsay Walker's battery and a Union battery
stationed in a field just above Mechanicsville. The firing was
across the Chickahominy valley. Through field-glasses, large
masses of the enemy were plainly visible about
Mechanicsville, and the spires of Richmond were the
background of the battery at which the Union troops were
firing. One of General McClellan's anchored balloons rode
high in the heavens behind Mechanicsville, and altogether
the sight was exceedingly inspiring. The distance between the
combatants was not more than two miles; but the damage
done in these encounters, with the short-ranged artillery of
that day, was insignificant.</p>
        <p>It was on this occasion that I first saw President Davis,
who had ridden out with several members of his staff to
inspect the lines. Mr. Davis was an excellent horseman, and
looked well on horseback. He had a passion for military life,
and was a man of cool nerves under fire. His presence was
always greeted with considerable enthusiasm by the troops,
although he never had the hold upon their
<pb id="wise215" n="215"/>
hearts possessed by “Ole Joe,” 
or “Mars' Robert,” as
General Johnston and General Lee were called. I do not
recollect distinctly who accompanied him, but have an
impression that his young secretary, Burton Harrison, was one
of the party. It was a time of deep solicitude for Mr. Davis, no
doubt, as the army had just changed commanders General
Johnston had been wounded at Seven Pines, and General Lee
had been relieved from duty at Charleston and appointed to
succeed him.</p>
        <p>The war had by this time produced two comparatively new
industries. One was the issuing of “shinplaster” currency, and
the other was the manufacture of fruit brandy.</p>
        <p>The United States laws relating to currency and revenue no
longer obtained, and the Confederate laws had not been put
into enforcement. The lack of small currency soon gave rise to the
issue of one dollar and fifty-cent and twenty-five-cent bills, by
nearly all the towns and counties of the State. Private bankers
also issued these bills, and even private individuals. I
remember particularly one Sylvester P. Cocke, an old fellow
who had formerly kept a country store at Dover Mills, in
Goochland County. In 1862, he had a little office upon the
bank of the “Basin” or terminus of the James River and
Kanawha Canal, in Richmond. The office was not exceeding
ten feet square, and stood in the corner of a large vacant coal-
yard. Mr. Cocke's banking facilities consisted of a table, a
small safe, a stack of sheets of bills, and a stout pair of shears.
He had his I. O. U.'s printed on ordinary letter-paper. They
had in one corner a picture of a mastiff lying in front of an iron
safe, holding its key between his paws, and, besides the date,
declared, “On demand I promise to pay to bearer” one dollar,
fifty cents, or twenty-five cents, or ten cents, and were
<pb id="wise216" n="216"/>
signed by Sylvester P. Cocke in a clerical hand. There he sat
signing, or clipping his promises apart with his shears, and,
although Mr. Cocke's means of redemption were an unknown
factor, his notes passed current with people in Richmond, and
all through the valley of the James, as if they had been
obligations of the Bank of England.</p>
        <p>Everybody in the country was engaged in converting his
fruit into brandy. Wherever there was a clear stream and a
neighboring orchard, there was sure to be a still. Where all
these stills and worms and kettles came from, nobody could
conjecture. It was a great fruit year, and there were no markets,
and it was apparent that liquor would be scarce and high. In
July, 1862, I drove our horses and carriage from a point just
above Richmond to the abode of the family in Franklin County,
a distance of two hundred miles or more, and I feel confident
that there was not ten miles upon the route in which I did not
pass one or more fruit distilleries.</p>
        <p>The passion for speculating in things which were likely to
become high-priced as the war progressed took possession of
everybody about this time. Staple articles, like sugar and
coffee and flour, were growing scarce. Prudent housekeepers
who had the means to procure these things laid in large
supplies. Speculators were buying them up, and storing them
for the rise which was sure to come. About this time also, in
view of the scarcity of sugar and molasses, people began to
cultivate sorghum, which thrived in our climate, and yielded a
reasonably good substitute for cane molasses.</p>
        <p>But the spirit of speculation was not confined to the larger
products; it extended to every variety of small manufactured
articles. On my drive to Rocky Mount I stopped one night in
Buckingham County with an old fellow 
<pb id="wise217" n="217"/>
who had a wayside tavern and a country store. During the
evening, conversation turned upon the increased price of
everything, and the profits to be made by purchasing and
holding articles which it would soon be difficult to procure. I
became infected with the trading spirit and on the following
morning my host admitted me to his store to inspect his stock,
and determine whether there was anything which I particularly
desired.</p>
        <p>War had made sad changes in the appearance of country
stores. The shelves, once filled with bright prints and cloths
and rolls of gleaming white goods, were now almost empty.
Only here and there were a few bolts of common cloth, such as
the Confederate mills could produce. The posts were no longer
decorated with bright trace-chains and horse-collars and
currycombs, but simply displayed a few rough shuck collars
and improvised farming gear. The showcases had been utterly
cleaned out of their stock of ribbons and laces, cakes and
candies, and cotton and scissors and gilt things. Perfumed
soaps and toilet articles, the glory of country stores in peace
time, had disappeared. A few skeins of yarn for knitting socks,
and cakes of home-made soap and moulds of beeswax, a few
chunks of maple-sugar, all at very high prices, constituted
about all the stock in trade that was left. I cast about in vain for
rare articles in which to invest for a rise, until at last I spied,
upon a dusty shelf, a box of watch-crystals! Timidly I inquired
the price, and it was not very high.</p>
        <p>“Do you think they will increase in value?” I asked
hesitatingly.</p>
        <p>“Increase?” said the storekeeper; “young man, you have
a trader's instincts. Increase? Why, in a year
there will not be a watch-crystal in the Confederacy. You
can name your own profit, and anybody will be glad to give it.”
 So I bought the nest of watch-crystals, feeling
<pb id="wise218" n="218"/>
sure I had a fortune in them. Perhaps I should have made a
great profit. With this idea firmly in my mind, I nursed them
carefully for several days, fully intending to put them aside
until watch-crystals were at the top notch of Confederate
prices, and then pocket a princely gain; but unfortunately,
before I reached the end of that journey, I one day, in a fit of
absent-mindedness, sat down upon the seat in the carriage
beneath which my watch crystals were stored, and thus ended
my first and last Confederate speculation.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XV</head>
        <head>AMONG THE MOUNTAINS</head>
        <p>ROCKY MOUNT, our place of refuge, was a typical Virginia
mountain village. Even at this present time, when it has its
railroad and telegraph, one in search of seclusion from the
outside world might safely select it for his purpose. Month
after month, year after year, roll by without other things to
vary its monotony than the horsetradings, or public
speakings, or private brawls of court days, or an occasional
religious “revival.”</p>
        <p>But in the summer of 1862, the excitement of war, and the
feverish anxiety to know of its progress, and the unusual
activity in every sort of trading, pervaded even that secluded
locality.</p>
        <p>The nearest point to us reached by railroad or telegraph was
a station named Big Lick, upon the Virginia and Tennessee
Railroad, in the county of Roanoke. Round about Big Lick,
whose population did not exceed thirty persons, the valley of
the Roanoke River was, as it still is, a veritable land of Goshen.
The adjacent farms, now covered by the populous city of
Roanoke, were in a state of excellent cultivation, and counted
among the most fertile in that beautiful valley. Hereabouts
were the stately homes of the Tayloes, the Wattses, the
Prestons, and many other representatives of the oldest and
wealthiest families of southwestern Virginia.</p>
        <p>When a visitor known to them arrived at Big Lick, it was
useless, whithersoever he was bound or howsoever
<pb id="wise220" n="220"/>
urgent his mission, to decline their generous hospitality. He
was sure to encounter some of them at the station and no
protestation availed against first accompanying them to their
homes, and then accepting their equipages in lieu of the
public conveyance for the remainder of his
journey.</p>
        <p>My brother Henry, being a clergyman and non-combatant,
was in charge of our family in Franklin. After driving our
horses across country and conducting our slaves to their new
abode, I again went East for some household effects, and he
and I, returning together to Big Lick, were there seized upon
by some friends, detained for several days, and finally
dispatched to our journey's end in the private vehicle of a Mr.
Tinsley. His home stood near the river bank, in a handsome
inclosure, surrounded by fields of harvested wheat, where the
very heart of the city of Roanoke is now located.</p>
        <p>His adjoining neighbors, not far distant, were the Tayloes,
whose mansion stood in a stately grove with well-kept lawns,
at a spot where engine-shops and the houses of railroad men
are built at present.</p>
        <p>The thing which impressed me most, upon the visit to
these good folk, was the absence of all the males of fighting
age. The Tayloes of Roanoke were prominent people, and in
all public affairs had figured conspicuously as representatives
of their county and their section. The only members of the
family at home to welcome the stranger within their gates
were the aged, white-haired head of the house and four or five
daughters and daughter in-law, clad in 
mourning. We were received with faultless
courtesy, and entertained with exquisite hospitality.</p>
        <p>Tremulously and anxiously the fine old gentleman, with
his female brood about him, asked for the latest news from
the front. Eagerly they plied us with new questions
<pb id="wise221" n="221"/>
concerning the progress and prospects of the struggle.
Insatiable and unabated seemed their desire to talk on and on
concerning that bloody phalanx aligned about Richmond,
whence we came.</p>
        <p>And well might their deepest interest be centred there, for
every arms-bearing Tayloe  -  son, brother, husband  -  was in
the forefront of the fight, save one. He had already fallen; his
portrait hung in the spacious drawing room beside the others.
His name was spoken and spoken again with gentle tears, and
with that reverence which the devout render to the Christian
martyr.</p>
        <p>In this spacious, peace-embowered home, nestled close to
the river, under the looming Mill Mountain, whose afternoon
shadows were already creeping across the lawn of oaks and
elms, and maples and hickories, with the summer breezes
stealing around its white pillars and through its wide hallways
and swaying its muslin curtains, with naught but gently
murmured conversation to break the delicious quietude, how
far away seemed the war! How startling was the contrast with
the seething cauldron of strife in which their strong men
struggled about Richmond!</p>
        <p>Yet which were suffering the most? Who shall measure the
agony which racked those hearts, outwardly so placid, during
the long years they waited while the strife went on?</p>
        <p>Who can picture the desolating sorrow which engulfed
them as, one by one, the strong arms on which that house
depended fell helpless, and the news came home
that the brave hearts for whose safety they prayed had
ceased to beat! for it was so. The war filled grave after grave
in the graveyard of the Tayloe family, until, when
it ended the male line was almost extinct.</p>
        <p>Our visit to these good folk was charming, and from
<pb id="wise222" n="222"/>
time to time, when wearied of our mountain isolation, we would
return to their lovely valley to mingle anew with such congenial
friends.</p>
        <p>To the east and south of them was the Blue Ridge and
beyond it our home. From the railroad station the stage road ran
for a mile or two through the valley then crossed the Roanoke
River by a ford at the base of the mountains, then plunged into
the rugged range. Winding up hill and down vale it went on,
through pass and gorge and over tumbling mountain-stream,
until it emerged into the rough foot-hill country east of the Blue
Ridge, in which was our new home.</p>
        <p>Twenty-eight miles of travel over such a route seems much
more than the measured distance, and carried us indeed into a
new class of population, as distinct from that which we left
behind as if an ocean instead of a mountain range had
separated the two communities. Soon the broad pastures and
fields of grain had disappeared. In their place were rough,
hillside lots, with patches of buckwheat or tobacco. Instead of
the stately brick houses standing in groves on handsome
knolls, all that we saw of human habitations were log-houses
far apart upon the mountain sides, or in the hollows far below
us. No longer were pastures visible, with well-bred cattle
standing in pooly places, shaded by sugar maples bathing their
flanks at noontide. No more did we meet smart equipages
drawn by blooded horses. No more the happy darkey greeted
us with smiles.</p>
        <p>Up, up, up,  -  until the mountain side fell far below our track;
down, down, down, until our wheels ground into, and our
horses scattered about their feet, the broken slate of a roaring
stream. Now, following the sycamore along its banks, with
here a patch of arable land and its mountain cabin, whence a
woman smoking a pipe, and
<pb id="wise223" n="223"/>
innumerable tow-headed children hanging about her skirts, eyed
us silently; and there another roadside cabin, with hollyhocks
and sunflowers and bee-hives in the yard, the sound of a
spinning-wheel from within, a sleeping cat in the window, and a
cur dog on the doorstep; here a carry-log, with patient team
drawn aside upon the narrow road to let us pass, the strapping
teamster in his shirtsleeves, with trousers stuck into his cowhide
boots, leaning against his load so intent in scrutiny of us that he
barely noticed our salutation; here a bearded man, clad in homespun
and a broad slouched hat, riding leisurely along on is broad-
backed, quiet horse, carrying the inevitable saddle-bags of the
mountaineer; here a woman on horse back, with long
sunbonnet, and coarse, cotton riding-skirt, and bag slung at the
saddle-bow, and small boy, with dangling bare feet, riding behind
her; here a spout-spring by the roadside, where the living water
of the mountain side leaped joyously from a hollow gum-tree log
grown green in service; now mounting upward again until all that
is visible is the winding road, with the blue sky above it, and the
massed tree-tops below, and the curling smoke of some mountain
distillery, with nothing to break far the stillness but the heavy
hammering of the log-cock upon some dead limb, or the
drumming of the ruffed grouse far away. So, on and on we
toiled, until we reached the open country beyond the
mountains, and late the in the evening our steaming horses drew
up at our new home which was strange and different from any we
had below ever had before.</p>
        <p>Our house was large, among the newest and most 
modern in the village, prettily located on the outskirts on the
highest knoll in the place, and commanded a fine; view of the
little valley and Bald Knob, and the mountains 
through which we came. The stage road, after
<pb id="wise224" n="224"/>
passing our house, entered the main street of the village
which was a rocky lane upon a sharp decline, with store and
houses scattered on either side, terminating at an inclosure
where stood the court house, clerk's office, and county jail.
Halfway down this street was the tavern, an antiquated
structure, with a porch extending along its entire front, its
brick pillars supporting a second story overhanging the
porch. This porch, which was almost on a level with the street,
was provided with an ample supply of benches and cane-
bottom chairs. At one end of it, suspended in a frame, was the
tavern bell, whose almost continual clang was signal for
grooms to take or fetch horses, or summons to meals.</p>
        <p>The tavern porch was the rallying-point of the town: hither
all news came; here all news was discussed; hence all news
was disseminated. From this spot the daily stage departed in
the morning. Here villagers and country folk assembled in the
day and waited in the evening and to this spot came the stage
in the evening, bearing the mail, the war news, and such
citizens as had been absent, visitors who drifted in, or
soldiers returning sick wounded, or on furlough.</p>
        <p>Supreme interest centred ever about the arrival or
departure of the stage. In the foggy morning it appeared 
with its strong four-in-hand team, and took its place
majestically in front of the old tavern. The porter rocked it as
they dumped the baggage into the boot the red-faced driver
came forth from the breakfast-room with great self-
importance. With his broad palm he wiped away the greasy
remnants of his meal, lit his brier root pipe, drew on his
buckskin gloves, settled his slouched hat over his eyes,
clambered to his seat upon the box gathered his reins and
whip, and cast a glance towards the post-office across the
way; an aged man and a meek-eyed
<pb id="wise225" n="225"/>
woman in simple garb slipped quietly into the rear seats,
going perhaps on some sad mission under summons to a far-
off hospital at the front; a dainty miss, with bonnet-box and
bunch of flowers, kissed papa and mamma and took her place
within, full of joyous anticipation doubtless, for even in war
times girls love to visit each other; a fat commissary, returning
from his search in the back country for supplies, came forth,
reeking with rum and tobacco, and swung up awkwardly to the
seat beside the driver. Tom, Dick, and Harry, the new recruits
bound for the front, proud in their new and misfit uniforms,
seized mother, wife, sister, or sweetheart in their arms, kissed
them, bade them have no fear, and scrambled lightly to the
top. The lame and tardy postmaster hobbled forth at last, and
threw his mail-pouch up to the dashboard. The coachman
gave his warning cry of “All aboard,” the hostlers drew off the
blankets, the long whip cracked its merry signal; with discord
in each footfall at the start and concord as they caught the
step, the horses pulled away; and the lumbering stage went
grinding up the stony street, its horn singing its morning carol
to those who were awake. As they disappeared over the hill-
top, a last merry cry of parting came back from the bright boys
on the stage-top, and the last they saw of home was the
waving tokens of love from those they left behind.</p>
        <p>As the day advanced, the tavern porch again took on an air
of life.</p>
        <p>Everybody traveled upon horseback. By midday, the
country folk began to stream in. Up and down the street a
gradually increasing line of saddle-horses were “hitched.”
Women, old and young, arrived,  -  all of conventional dress,
and with horses singularly alike. Their bonnets were the long-
slatted poke-bonnet; their riding-skirts, of
<pb id="wise226" n="226"/>
coarse cotton. Alighting at the horse-blocks, they untied and
slipped off the skirts and tied them to their saddle-bows,
revealing their plain homespun dress. Their horses were broad-
backed, short on the leg, carried their heads on a level with
their shoulders, and moved with noses advanced like camels.
They had no gaits but a swift walk, a gentle fox-trot, or a slow,
ambling pace. When they had “hitched the critturs,” these
women went poking about the stores, or the tavern kitchen,
or the private houses, with chickens or butter, or other
farmyard produce, seldom speaking further than asking one
to buy; and when their sales were effected and little purchases
made, they went away as silently as they had come.</p>
        <p>The men came by themselves. Their principal occupation
seemed to be horse-trading. At times, the neighboring
stables, and even the street itself, were filled with men, leading
their animals about, and engaged in the liveliest of horse-
trading. A considerable proportion of the population ration
belonged to a religious sect known as Dunkards. In
appearance, they were solemn and ascetic. The men wore
long, flowing beards, and their homespun dress was of formal
cut. Their doctrinal tenets were opposed to slavery and to war.
Whenever political or military discussions arose, they
promptly withdrew. They were very strict temperance men,
and decent, orderly, law-abiding citizens, but horse-traders! It
must have been a part of their religious faith. A Dunkard was
never so happy as when he was horse-trading.</p>
        <p>There were others, too, to whom temperance was not so
sacred as to the Dunkards. By three or four o'clock, the tavern
bar was liberally patronized. The recruiting office had its full
quota of young fellows inquiring about the terms of
enlistment. The tavern porch was filled with people
discussing war news, and the quartermaster
<pb id="wise227" n="227"/>
down the street had more horses offered to him than he
was authorized to buy.</p>
        <p>At such times, a favorite entertainment was to draw General
Early out upon his views of men and events, for the
edification of the tavern-porch assemblage.</p>
        <p>He was a resident of Franklin, and at that time sojourning
at the tavern. He had been severely wounded in the battle of
Williamsburg in May, 1862, and was now quite convalescent,
but still on sick leave. He was a singular being.</p>
        <p>Franklin County had been strongly opposed to secession.
Jubal A. Early was a pronounced Union man, and was elected
from his county as her representative to the Secession
Convention. In that body he had opposed and denounced
secession until the ordinance was passed. As soon as the
State seceded, he declared that his State was entitled to his
services, and tendered them. He was a man of good family, a
graduate of the West Point Military Academy, and possessed
unsurpassed personal courage. In 1862, he was a brigadier-
general, and had been conspicuously brave in the battle in
which he was wounded. His subsequent career in higher
commands was disastrous. After the war, he became notorious
as the most implacable and “unreconstructed” of all the
Confederate generals. He was a man deeply attached to a small
circle of friends, but intensely vindictive and abusive of those
he disliked.</p>
        <p>At the time of which I write, he was the hero of Franklin
County, and, although he professed to despise popularity
and to be defiant of public opinion, it was plain that he
enjoyed his military distinction. It had done much to soften
old time asperities, and blot out from the memory of his
neighbors certain facts in his private life which had prior to
the war, alienated from him many of his own
<pb id="wise228" n="228"/>
class. In fact, I doubt not he was a happier man then
than he had been for many a year before, or was at a
later period, when he became more or less a social and
political lshmaelite.</p>
        <p>He was eccentric in many ways,  -  eccentric in appearance,
in voice, in manner of speech. Although he was not
an old man, his shoulders were so stooped and rounded
that he brought his countenance to a vertical position with
difficulty. He wore a long, thin, straggling beard. His
eyes were very small, dark, deep-set, and glittering, and
his nose aquiline. His step was slow, shuffling, and
almost irresolute. I never saw a man who looked less like
a soldier. His voice was a piping treble, and he talked
with a long-drawn whine or drawl. His opinions were
expressed unreservedly, and he was most emphatic and
denunciatory, and startlingly profane.</p>
        <p>His likes and dislikes he announced without hesitation,
and, as he was filled with strong and bitter opinions, his
conversation was always racy and pungent. His views
were not always correct, or just, or broad; but his wit was
quick, his satire biting, his expressions were vigorous, and
he was interestingly lurid and picturesque.</p>
        <p>With his admiring throng about him on the tavern porch,
on summer evenings in 1862, General Early, in my
opinion, said things about his superiors, the Confederate
leaders, civic and military, and their conduct of affairs,
sufficient to have convicted him a hundred times over
before any court-martial. But his criticisms never
extended to General Robert E Lee. For Lee he seemed
to have a regard and esteem and high opinion felt by him
for no one else. Although General Lee had but recently
been called to the command of the army, he predicted
his great future with unerring judgment. The arrival of
the stage not infrequently interrupted
<pb id="wise229" n="229"/>
General Early's vigorous lectures. For half an hour or
more before the event, the expectant throng would
increase, and, as those who “brace” themselves for the
crisis were there, as everywhere else, conversation grew
louder and agitation greater as the time approached. Then
the stage would heave in sight in the gloaming, and come
rattling down the rough street, the horseshoes knocking
fire from the flints. Before the smoking and jaded beasts
had fairly stopped, loud inquiries would be made on all
hands, of driver and passengers, for war news.
Somebody would throw down the latest newspaper;
somebody would mount a chair and read aloud; and, just
as the news was encouraging or depressing, there would
be cheering or silence. Then would come the rush for the
mail to the post-office across the way.</p>
        <p>The passengers, also, were a source of engrossing
interest. There was young So-and-so, with his empty
sleeve. A year ago he had left the place, and passed
safely through all the earlier battles; but at Malvern Hill a
grapeshot mutilated his left arm. Amputation followed,
and now, after a long time in hospital, here he was, home
again, pale and bleached, with an honorable discharge in
his pocket, and maimed for life. And there, collapsed
upon the rear seat, more dead than alive, too weak to
move save with the assistance of friends, was a poor,
wan fellow, whom nobody knew at first. How pitiful he
seemed, as they helped him forth, his eyes sunken yet
restless, his weak arms clinging about their necks, his
nubs scarce able to support his weight, his frame racked
by paroxysms of violent coughing! “Who is it?” passed
from mouth to mouth. “Good God!” exclaimed some one
at the whispered reply, “it can't be! That is not Jimmie
Thomson. What! Not old man Hugh Thomson's son,
down on Pig River? Why, man alive, I knew
<pb id="wise230" n="230"/>
the boy well. He was one of the likeliest boys in this whole
county. Surely, that ar skeleton can't be him! But it was. The
exposure of camp life had done for poor Jimmie what bullets
had failed to do.</p>
        <p>There, perched gayly in air, and tumbling down upon the
heads of the bystanders with joyous greeting, was the
sauciest, healthiest youngster in the village, come home on his
first furlough in a twelvemonth, wearing on his collar the bars
of a lieutenant (conferred for gallantry at Seven Pines), in place
of the corporal's chevrons on his sleeve when he marched
away. Camp life had made no inroads on his health. The sun
and rain had only given him a healthy bronze. His digestion
would have assimilated paving-stones. The bullets had gone
wide of him. And his little world, the dearest on earth to
him,  -  the little world which had laughed and cried over the
stories of his capers and his courage in the field,  -  stood there
surprised and delighted, with smiling faces and open arms, to
welcome him home, their own village boy, their saucy, gallant
fighting-chap, their hero,  -  home again, if only for a week!</p>
        <p>Each day opened and passed and closed, with its excitements.
It was all very narrow and primitive, the out of-the-way
world of the obscure village in an unknown region. Yet in it
were the same old hopes and fears and joys and tears,
hearteases and heartaches, loves and hates and all the moods
and tenses of human nature, to be found in the most
populous and cosmopolitan hives of humanity.</p>
        <p>I was now nearly sixteen. Many youths of my age were in
the army. I had written more than once for my father's consent
to enlist, but received stern denials. The war talk at the old
tavern, the stories of camps and fight and military glory, the
daily enlistments, the desire to appear a man in the eyes of
certain girls, were all coöperating
<pb id="wise231" n="231"/>
to inflame my desire to be a soldier. I was growing
mannish and rebellious. My brother saw it all, and heard me
threaten to run away, and wrote father seriously, advising him
that I was getting beyond his control, and urging him to send
me to the Virginia Military Institute, where I would be under
restraint, and receive instruction, instead of growing up in
ignorance and idleness.</p>
        <p>It was soon settled. September 1, 1862, I left Rocky Mount,
took the train at Big Lick, went to the neighboring station of
Bonsacks, and there perched myself upon the stage-top,
booked for Lexington. It was a long journey, occupying sixteen
hours. We started at six P. M., and, riding continuously,
reached Lexington at ten o'clock the following morning. It was
a glorious ride in brilliant autumn weather, with moonlight. We
passed through Fincastle and Buchanan, and over the Natural
Bridge.</p>
        <p>As we approached Lexington, and I caught sight of the
Virginia Military Institute and its beautiful parade grounds,
and professors' houses and other buildings, my mind was
filled with thoughts of glorious military life, and the
commission in the army which awaited me when I graduated
for I was now a cadet in the West Point of the Confederacy.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XVI</head>
        <head>PRESBYTERIAN LEXINGTON</head>
        <p>GREAT differences in soil, climate, and scenery exist
between the grand divisions into which Virginia is cut up
geographically. But they are not more striking than the
diversity of the populations, one from the other, in these
several sections, springing from differences in the time and the
manner in which, and the people by whom, her several early
settlements were made.</p>
        <p>Two or three centuries of common government would
ordinarily seem sufficient to produce a homogeneous
population ration in a State. While this result has been
attained in Virginia in essentials, it is nevertheless surprising
to observe in each section local peculiarities, types, and characteristics
plainly traceable to its earliest settlement.</p>
        <p>We were first introduced to the lower Tidewater section,
where the soil is sandy, the climate balmy, the landscape flat,
viewless, save as it is redeemed from monotony by the
boundless, ever-changing grandeur of old Ocean. The people,
while of her oldest strains, are simple in their mode of living,
and admit neither lineage nor wealth as basis for any caste or
class distinction. Then we turned to the region of the upper
and lower James, with Richmond as its centre, settled later
than Tidewater by the so-called Cavalier immigration of 1649-
60. There, of old, social relations were akin to those of Rome's
patricians and plebeians, patrons and clients. Not alone was
the haughty descendant of Charles I. owner of a plantation
<pb id="wise233" n="233"/>
and of slaves,  -  he was more: the poor whites and the
shopkeepers of country and town alike, consciously or
unconsciously, willingly or unwillingly, rendered him homage
as if he were their superior. And he, while often proclaiming
principles of social equality, seldom practiced them, and
quietly accepted, as his legitimate due, the preëminence
granted him by his humbler neighbors.</p>
        <p>Then, with a mere glimpse of the Roanoke region, we passed
into the rocky soil, the wild and mountainous landscape, and
the rough, new, and nondescript population which, from one
direction and another, has collected upon and taken
possession of the eastern slope of the Blue Ridge range. Here,
again, we found a democracy full of independence and
courage, but in all things of education and refinement, far
inferior to that in Tidewater.</p>
        <p>Now, at Lexington, we are in the heart of the valley lying
between the Blue Ridge and Allegheny ranges. It is a region
with a different soil, a different climate, different scenery, and
a population more distinctly <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">sui generis</foreign></hi> than any yet described.
The soil is based upon blue limestone. It is where the grasses
grow. The lands lie tumbled into knobby hills and rolling
fields, with here and there narrow fertile valleys traversed by
limpid streams, whose banks are cedar-clad bluffs of limestone
shale. The great valley is more broken here, less pastoral, and
not so charming as in its lower section to the north, where it
widens, and is watered by the Shenandoah; but this is the
bolder landscape, with a rugged beauty peculiar to self. The
mountain framing of the picture is the same; but the land is
higher, for, as the cloud-capped peaks of the Blue Ridge and
Alleghany ranges draw nearer to each other, the vale between
them is nearer to their own altitude We are in Rockbridge 
County, so called because
<pb id="wise234" n="234"/>
within its limits is the superb natural arch of limestone
known the world over as the Natural Bridge.</p>
        <p>Lexington, the county seat of Rockbridge is near the summit
of the transverse watershed of the great valley. Within a few
miles of the town, streams rise, some pouring their waters
southward into the tributaries of the James, and others
coursing northward, tributary to the Shenandoah, which
enters the Potomac at Harper's Ferry. The place itself is
beautiful. Looking east and south the rolling country falls
away to the base of the Blue Ridge, where the South River and
North River unite and flow onward to join the James, where
their united waters turn eastward through the pass at
Balcony Falls. The magnificent Blue Ridge range bounds the
eastern view and is last seen to southward, where the twin
breasts of the Peaks of Otter rear themselves against the
distant blue. Northward, beyond the wooded bluffs of the
North River, steep hills of farming lands are tilted towards us,
their sides dotted with cattle, their summits crowned with
forests. Beyond these, crest after crest of the smaller foothills
of the Alleghanies appear. To the northwest looming in
isolated majesty, is the House Mountain, with the peak of the
Devil's Backbone behind it, marking the route through historic
Goshen Pass. North and south, as far as the eye can reach,
shading away in their tints from deep emerald to dreamy blue
as they become more and more remote, are masses of hills. To
the west and south west, now strongly outlined, now melting
into the last visible things of the distance, are the azure peaks
of the Alleghanies. Such is the country about Lexington,
where Virginia has her Military Institute. It is a spot almost as
beautiful as West Point, and the school is second only to the
Military Academy in thoroughness. It is an ideal spot for
healthfulness, and the isolation of youth from the
<pb id="wise235" n="235"/>
temptations and distracting influences of crowded
communities. The boy who finds allurement to idleness and
vice in that town would discover it anywhere.</p>
        <p>It is a community of Scotch-Irish Presbyterians. For more
than a hundred years after the settlement of Jamestown, and
for over fifty years after Richmond was an incorporated city,
this valley remained unviewed by the eye of any white man.</p>
        <p>As early as 1608, Newport, on his second visit to the
Virginia colony, brought with him a boat built in sections, to
be transported by him under orders to find the South Sea
beyond the mountains. The extent to which he performed that
order was that he marched to the Monacon country, about
twenty miles west of Richmond, and his company returned
footsore to Jamestown.</p>
        <p>One hundred and two years later (1710), Governor
Spotswood wrote to the Council of Trade in London that a
party of adventurers had found the mountains “not above a
hundred miles from our upper settlements, and went up to the
top of the highest mountains with their horses,” and looked
over into the valley. This is supposed to have been near
Balcony Falls. It was not until 1716 that the first passage of
the Blue Ridge was effected. Then Governor Spotswood and
his “Knights of the Golden Horseshoe” entered the lower or
Shenandoah valley by way of Swift Run Gap, and took
possession in the name of George the First. Governor
Spotswood's expedition resulted in nothing important. The
only diary of its performance extant is 
principally devoted to description of the liquors which
the party carried with it, whereof eleven sorts are enumerated.
A few adventurers may have straggled into the valley after
this, but it was not until 1732-36 that it as settled by any
considerable population.</p>
        <p>Shortly prior to 1732, an immense number of Scotch-
<pb id="wise236" n="236"/>
Irish and Germans poured into Pennsylvania and the Jerseys.
Within thirty years, the population of Pennsylvania increased
from about thirty thousand to two hundred and fifty
thousand. The Scotsmen, who, for religious liberty, had
originally sought the north of Ireland, were the people who
saved Ireland to William and Mary from Catholic James. Their
loyalty was rewarded by new persecutions for non-
conformity, until they resolved to seek asylum in America. So,
also, about the same time came to America a great migration
of German Lutherans, who were induced to settle in
Pennsylvania. The Scotsmen occupied the regions about
Princeton, New Jersey, Easton, Carlisle, and Washington.
The Germans settled about York, Lancaster, Columbia, and
Harrisburg. Governor Logan, himself a Scotch-Irishman,
enforced some laws about 1730 which were so offensive to the
Presbyterians and Lutherans that great numbers of them left
the Pennsylvania colony, crossed the Potomac west of the
Blue Ridge, in the vicinity of Harper's Ferry, entered Virginia,
and settled the Blue Ridge valley.</p>
        <p>As if by agreement, the two bands separated. The
lethargic Germans, as soon as they escaped the Pennsylvania 
jurisdiction, occupied the lower valley from Harper's 
Ferry to Harrisonburg. The aggressive Scotch Irish pressed
on to the upper valley, then called West Augusta, now
divided into the counties of Augusta Rockbridge, Botetourt,
Roanoke, and Montgomery. From then until now, the two
races have retained possession of and dominated their
respective settlements.</p>
        <p>And a very striking race of men are these Scotch-Irish so
called yet with nothing Irish about them save them
for a little while they tarried in Ireland. Hated by
Irish because they were Protestants, persecuted by the
English because they were Presbyterians, they in turn
<pb id="wise237" n="237"/>
cordially detested both, and, in our Revolutionary struggles
were among the earliest and most intense rebels against the
king. For liberty, as they conceived it, whether it was liberty of
conscience or liberty of the person, the Scotch-Irishmen and
their descendants have never hesitated to sacrifice comfort,
fortune, or life. Their mountain origin has always manifested
itself by the places they have chosen in their migrations. The
few who went to the Puritan settlements of New England soon
moved from among them and sought the inhospitable
highlands of New Hampshire, where they bestowed on their
new settlement the name of Londonderry. The little band who
found asylum among the Dutch of New York pressed onward
from uncongenial associates to the mountainous frontier, and
named the county where they settled Ulster, in memory of their
Irish home. Those who wearied of Pennsylvania and went to
Virginia avoided the light society of the Cavaliers in Tidewater
and Piedmont, preferring the mountain wilds of West Augusta.</p>
        <p>Wherever they appeared, they seemed to be seeking for
some secluded spot, where, undisturbed by any other sect,
they might enjoy liberty unrestrained, and worship God after
their own fashion.</p>
        <p>And great have they been as pioneers. They populated
western New England, northern New York, western
Pennsylvania, and the Virginia valley. Then they pressed
onward through western North Carolina, even to northern
South Carolina. Then they spread westward through
Cumberland Gap to the settlement of Kentucky. In later days,
their Lewis and their Clarke were the explorers of the
Northwest; another Lewis was the first to view Pike's Peak,
and even the territory of Texas was in part reclaimed by Sam
Houston, son of a Rockbridge
<pb id="wise238" n="238"/>
County Presbyterian. The pioneer work of the Scotch-
Irish has been greater than that of all other races in America
combined.</p>
        <p>Great also have they been as fighters. John Lewis, their
first leader in the Virginia valley, was the terror of the frontier
Indians from the day of his arrival. Never after his coming did
the Indians come east of the Blue Ridge. Another Scotch-
Irishman, Patrick Henry, uttered the immortal sentence, “Give
me liberty or give me death.”</p>
        <p>General Henry Knox, of Revolutionary fame, the only New
England representative in Washington's cabinet, was a
Scotch-Irishman.</p>
        <p>It was the Scotch-Irish of Mecklenburg, North Carollina,
who framed the first resolutions embodying the principles of
the Declaration of Independence. It was of the Scotch-Irish
and their valley home that Washington was speaking when,
in the darkest hours of the Revolution, he declared that, if the
worst came to the worst, he would retire to the mountain
fastnesses of West Augusta, and there, with a few of his
brave followers about him, defy forever the power of Great
Britain. It was from the same spot that Stonewall Jackson,
another of the stock, went forth in our great civil war,
followed by his brave men of Scotch-Irish ancestry recruited
here, to revive, by his grim prowess and their unshaken valor,
the mentors of Old Ironsides and his Presbyterians.</p>
        <p>And great have they been as disseminators of learning.
They founded the ancient college of New Jersey now known
as Princeton University. To their efforts are we indebted for
the colleges of La Fayette at Easton and
Washington Jefferson College at Washington in
Pennsylvania and Liberty Hall Academy, now called
Washington and Lee University, at Lexington, Virginia;
and Chapel Hill in North Carolina.</p>
        <pb id="wise239" n="239"/>
        <p>And successful politicians and statesmen have they been;
for Calhoun, Andrew Jackson, Franklin Pierce, James
Buchanan, Ulysses S. Grant, Chester A. Arthur, Grover
Cleveland, Benjamin Harrison, and William
McKinley were all rich in this Scotch-Irish blood.</p>
        <p>In his great work upon the Puritans, Douglass Campbell
has admirably sketched the Scotch-Irish. Much has been
written of them of late years by writers less distinguished and
just now Professor John Fiske, under the title of “Old
Virginia and her Neighbors,” has published a most interesting
account of the great Scotch-Irish migration and its influences
on our American civilization.</p>
        <p>At Lexington, Virginia, these folk were and are, as their
ancestors have been for centuries, men of earnest,
thoughtful, and religious natures; simple in their lives to the
point of severity, sometimes severe to the point of simplicity;
intense in their religious fervor, yet strangely lacking, as it
seems to us, in that quality of mercy which is the greatest
attribute of religion; loving and possessing education, yet
often narrow-minded, in spite of thorough training; almost
ascetics in their wants, not bountifully hospitable, but
reasonably courteous and considerate towards strangers,
and methodically charitable; regarding revelry and
dissipation of body or mind as worthy of supreme contempt;
of dogged obstinacy, pertinacity, and courage; dominant
forces in all things wherein they take a part.</p>
        <p>I had heard of their race, and heard them described, long
before I went there; and now I was among them,  -   those old
McDowells, and McLaughlins, and McClungs and Jacksons,
and Paxtons, and Rosses, and Grahams and Andersons, and
Campbells, and Prestons, and Moores and Houstons, and
Barclays, and Comptons, and all the tribe of Presbyterians of
the valley. All they possessed,
<pb id="wise240" n="240"/>
and what they were, I curiously scrutinized as a type of
humanity wholly new to me.</p>
        <p>Their impress was upon everything in the place. The blue
limestone streets looked hard. The red brick houses with
severe stone trimmings and plain white pillars and finishings,
were stiff and formal. The grim portals of the Presbyterian
church looked cold as a dog's nose. The cedar hedges in the
yards, trimmed hard and close along straight brick pathways,
were as unsentimental as mathematics. The dress of the
citizens, male and female, was of single-breasted simplicity;
and the hair of those pretty Presbyterian girls was among the
smoothest and the flattest things I ever saw.</p>
        <p>Shall I describe their habitations? Would it violate the
laws of hospitality to do so? I hope not. We have entered a
hallway, tinted gray, furnished with an oaken hat-rack and
straight oak chair of Gothic features, and passed into a parlor.
Although it is autumn, the polished floors are uncovered
save by strips of deep-red carpet such as one sees in chapel
aisles. There is a fireplace but the fires are unlit. The furniture
is straight up and down mahogany covered over with
haircloth. I have often wondered what a Presbyterian would
do if he could not secure mahogany haircloth furniture for his
drawing room. The room is dark; the red curtains are half
drawn upon the black marble mantelpiece, under a glass
shade are cold, white wax flowers. On the walls are solemn
engravings of Oliver Cromwell, Stonewall Jackson, and The
Rock of Ages. A melodeon, with church music stands in the
corner. If, perchance, it be a pianoforte, it seems like a
profanation. There is also a Gothic table on top of which is
the family Bible, beside it a candle stick, Jay's “Morning
Exercises,” and the “Life of
Hannah More.” Drawn near to these is a long-armed
<pb id="wise241" n="241"/>
low easy-chair. Facing the fireplace are two rocking chairs, and
six others, all in haircloth, stand stiff as horseguards' sentries
about the walls.</p>
        <p>If your call is timed in the evening, you will learn the uses to
which these articles are put, for, as nine o'clock approaches,
the sweet little Presbyterian girl you are visiting will begin to
fidget; and when the hour strikes, the family will file into the
room with military silence and precision. Before you know it,
the head of the house will occupy that chair by the table, and
open that Bible, and give you the benefit of at least twenty
minutes of Christian comfort. Then, if you have not the good
sense to leave, he will proceed to fasten the window-blinds.</p>
        <p>If your visit is in the daytime, other things will suggest
themselves to your mind. For example, you will wonder what
is the family dinner-hour. If you are so fortunate as to receive
a formal invitation in advance, you will not only learn, but you
will have a bountiful and well-cooked meal,  -  not, perhaps, an
Episcopalian epicurean feast, but bountiful and nutritious
food. If, however our notion was to drop in unexpectedly, and
take an informal family dinner, let me beg you to give it up.
You may go a hundred times, and the sleek-headed girl in pop
will give no sign, and the bell will never ring. She could starve
before she would ask you out, but she would die before she
would ask you in, for Presbyterians are not built that way. Her
father would immolate her for taking such a liberty. The best
you can hope for, on an occasion like that, is a cold red pippin
on a cold white plate served where you sit shivering, in that
vault-like parlor. If you wish to be frisky with Miss Westminster, it is
possible in but one way. Ask her to go to church. Sunday
morning church is the most tumultuous of her gayeties;
Sunday night service is to her what an ordinary
<pb id="wise242" n="242"/>
dancing party would be, as compared with a state ball, to Miss
Litany; and Wednesday evening lectures are to her what
excursions for ice-cream or soda-water are to “unregenerate”
girls.</p>
        <p>My! for wild hilarity commend me to a coterie of strictly
reared young female Presbyterians. An evening spent among
them is like sitting upon icebergs, cracking hailstones with
one's teeth.</p>
        <p>Yet, dear reader, believe me, after one has tried it awhile,
surprising as the statement may seem, one comes to like it.
Now and again, one of them says something, or does
something, like ordinary mortals; and what she says or does is
in such a fetching, fascinating, feminine way that it makes one
want to go again, and makes one feel glad that such gentle,
pure, refined, simple, and true people countenance an outside
barbarian like one's self in their society.</p>
        <p>There is, believe me, a lot of outcome in one of these little,
demure Presbyterian lassies. Of course, if she has no better
luck than to marry one of her own people, that settles it! She
will go through life mooning and mincing about, like a turkey
hen come off her nest. She will pass her life thinking that
going to hear sermons and lectures is the chief end of man,
and that pipping, spiced gingerbread, and cracked walnuts,
served in a chilly parlor, are fit Christian entertainments.</p>
        <p>She may even live and die thinking she is happy, not
knowing any better.</p>
        <p>But if, perchance, good fortune brings her a knight with a
feather in his bonnet, and it catches her little meek eye, as it
is mighty apt to do; if, after prayerful consideration her strait-
laced parents decide that it is best or her happiness to let her
go, even at her soul's peril; if all doubts and dangers past,
she is borne triumphantly
<pb id="wise243" n="243"/>
away, her bonnet-box stuffed with the Shorter Catechism and
all orthodox kirk rudiments,  -  I assure you it is
surprising how promptly the little bud expands, and how
quickly she adapts herself to new surroundings.</p>
        <p>I speak whereof I know.</p>
        <p>How long we have been in Lexington without reporting for duty!</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XVII</head>
        <head>A NEW PHASE OF MILITARY LIFE</head>
        <p>LOOKING eastward from the front of the tavern where the
stage-coach deposited us, the barracks, mess-hall, professors'
houses, parade ground, and limits of the Virginia
Military Institute were in view upon a hill about half a mile
distant.</p>
        <p>My first care was to send a messenger with a note
announcing my arrival to my cousin Louis, who had preceded
me at the Institute by a year. When he came, he
explained that his tardiness was due to the length of time it
required for an application for permission to leave the limits of
the Institute to pass through the necessary official channels.</p>
        <p>His greeting was hearty and joyous, it had been a long
time since he had seen any relative from the outside world,
and this little release was quite a lark. How well and bright-
eyed he looked in his tight-fitting shell jacket! When we
parted at Norfolk a year before, he was an easy-going, slack-
twisted little civilian, without particularly attractive dress or
bearing. Now, he carried himself like a fighting-cock. Exercise
had hardened him and developed his figure, his clothing
fitted him like a glove, and there was an 
easy confidence in his manner. In a
word, he had been licked into military shape.</p>
        <p>We sallied forth together to report for duty at
office of the superintendent, General Francis H. Smith.
His study was a very attractive place: it was a hexagonal
<pb id="wise245" n="245"/>
room, well lit; bookcases stood about the walls, and it was
ornamented with a number of striking military pictures chiefly
French; a bright wood-fire crackled in the open fireplace. In a
former chapter I alluded to General Smith. He had, at the time
about which I write, been superintendent twenty-three years,
although he was then only about fifty.</p>
        <p>Your elderly soldier is generally of one of two types: one is
the rubicund, thunderous type; the other, the lean pale,
spectacled, quiet type. There are modifications and variations
of these two generic classifications, of course: but under one
or the other the great mass of elderly soldiers may be
grouped.</p>
        <p>To the latter belonged General Smith. He was tall thin, agile;
in youth he had been an extreme blonde, his lithe figure still
bore a soldierly aspect. His face was that of a student, with
that expression emphasized by the gold spectacles through
which he looked keenly; those spectacles were so much a
part of him that he was universally known as “Old Spex.” As
he sat in his office in his blue uniform, with one leg crossed
over the other, many a cadet has no doubt wondered how
thin those long legs really were, seeing how close they lay
together. His life had been given up entirely 
to his work as superintendent; he
had traveled abroad to study foreign schools and secure
their best features; he was author of several mathematical
treatises, as well as a most admirable teacher. A prominent
churchman; a man of abstemious habits and boundless
industry; one of the best politicians in the 
State-he knew every man of importance in Virginia
and had the faculty of enlisting the interest of politicians of all
parties in the success of the Virginia Military Institute. No
matter what might be the acrimony
of factions or the stress of public necessities in other
<pb id="wise246" n="246"/>
directions, his legislative appropriations never failed, and
support of his school never flagged. His tact in management
and insight into the character of cadets was marvelous. His
acquaintance with the minutest details of every department in
the school was perfect, and the personal interest which he
manifested in every cadet intrusted to his care was at once a
warning and a stimulus to the boy. He was in truth a very
remarkable man; his peculiarities were as marked as his
excellencies; and, while those peculiarities did not seriously
detract from him, they gave him a distinct individuality. A
monument to Colonel Thayer stands in front of the United
States Military Academy, describing him as the father of the
institution. One like it should be reared to General Smith at the
Virginia Military Institute, for to it he was even more a father
than was Thayer to West Point, or Arnold to Rugby.</p>
        <p>Behind those gold spectacles, and with those long, thin
legs lapped over each other, he sat at a table writing as we
entered and stood near the door, caps in hand, at attention.
He seemed engrossed; a moment later, he lifted his eyes;
squinting a little and peering through his glasses, he caught
sight of us and exclaimed, “Ah-h! who's this?” Louis
explained. “Well, young, man, how are you? Glad to see you.
How is your father? What have you studied? How far have
you been is mathematics? In French? In Latin?” And, going
straight at the matter in hand, he plied me with queries until he
knew all that was necessary; then “Fourth-class is best for
him,” he said.</p>
        <p>Soon fixed up by the adjutant, we started for the
commandant's office across the parade ground. The
commandant of cadets, Major Scott Shipp, was a large man
with close-trimmed black hair and beard, a solemn bearing,
<pb id="wise247" n="247"/>
and a deep voice. Although he was then but twenty-one
years of age, I thought he was forty. He remained commandant
for nearly thirty years after this, and is now superintendent. In
its fifty-eight years of life, the school has had but two
superintendents. Our business with the commandant
consisted of securing an assignment to a room and to a
company, and attending to some minor details. Then we
reported to my first sergeant, who was no other than Benjamin
Colonna, our room-mate.</p>
        <p>Louis and I found my trunk at the sallyport; whither it had
been sent from the hotel, and lugged it off to the arsenal,
which stood in the quadrangle, for no trunks were allowed in
rooms. Cadet clothing was kept in a large wardrobe, placed in
each room, divided into compartments which were assigned to
the respective occupants.</p>
        <p>The cadet barracks was a handsome four-storied building,
occupying three sides of a quadrangle, with towers at the
corners and at a sallyport with central arch. On the inner side
were three broad stoops running all around the building,
reached by stairways upon the stoops. The cadet quarters
opened upon these stoops. At the turrets the rooms were
double, occupied in most instances by tactical officers;
elsewhere, the rooms were single. The ventilation, light, and
heat of the quarters were excellent. The furniture of each room
consisted of a gun-rack, washstand, wardrobe; large oak table
in the centre of the room, under a gas-light; a chair for each
cadet, a book rack and a blacking-stool, beds and bedsteads.
Thirty minutes after reveille, the beds were required to be
rolled up, strapped, and stood in the corner, flanked by the
bedclothes folded. Beds could not be put down until after
tattoo. The occupants of the room were alternately detailed as
orderly for a week, and each was held responsible
<pb id="wise248" n="248"/>
for observance of regulations and for the police of the
room, which was inspected at least twice a day.</p>
        <p>On arrival at our rooms, I had a bluff but pleasant
welcome from Colonna, who called me “Mr. Rat,” and
as it was a rule of the Institute that every plebe should be
“bucked,” he and Louis proceeded to attend to my case.
A bed-strap was buckled about my wrists; I was ordered
up on the table and compelled to draw up my knees, over
which my bound arms were slipped; a ramrod was run
under my knees and over my arms, and then I was rolled
over on my side, and Louis and Colonna, with a bayonet
scabbard, spelled CONSTANTINOPLE. The taps given
by these laughing friends were light, but sufficiently
stinging to make me appreciate what it might have been.</p>
        <p>“Now, Rat, you have been bucked,” laughed Colonna,
as they set me upright and loosened the cords. “If
anybody asks you whether you have been ‘bucked,’ say,
‘Yes, <hi rend="italics">sir</hi>;’ be sure to say <hi rend="italics">sir</hi>, d' ye understand? Then, if
they ask you whose Rat you are, say, ‘Mr. Colonna's rat,
<hi rend="italics">sir</hi>.’ Be sure to say <hi rend="italics">sir</hi>, d' ye understand? And then you
take care to say as little more as you can, for it's these
long-tongued Rats that get into trouble, d' ye
understand?” Yes, I understood. I resolved to keep that
mouth, that has gotten me in trouble all my life, shut tight.</p>
        <p>Up to now, I had been agreeably surprised. I expected
that I should be seized upon as soon as I entered the
barracks, but so far I had seen very few cadets about. I
did not realize that it was study-hours, at which time the
cadets were in their class-rooms, or confined to quarters,
and were strictly forbidden to visit, or to loiter on the
stoops or about the archway.</p>
        <p>“What is that?” I asked, as a drum was beaten in
the area, its sounds reverberating through the
barracks.</p>
        <pb id="wise249" n="249"/>
        <p>“First drum for dinner,” said Louis; “dinner rollcall in
five minutes,” and he, Colonna, and Phillips began
polishing their shoes.</p>
        <p>“Now, Mr. Rat, if you don't want to be bullyagged,
you wait under the arch until I give the command ‘Fall in!’
when the clock strikes, and then run to your place in
ranks in front of barracks. My company is on the left; I'll
wait, before giving the command ‘Front,’ until I see you
are in ranks, so you will not be late.”</p>
        <p>This thoughtful advice from Colonna I obeyed strictly
so that nobody troubled me. I felt quite proud in ranks
and answered to my name clearly. The companies were
side-stepped together, and then the first captain assumed
charge, broke the battalion into columns of fours, and
marched us off to the mess-hall. I had never seen a
figure quite so trim, or heard a voice quite so clarion, as
the first captain's. The crunching cadence of the step of
three hundred boys upon the gravel walk would have
made a muley cow keep step. Tramp, tramp, tramp we
went up the broad stairway of the mess-hall, and, as we
reached the hall, companies filed away to their
respective seats at the eight long tables. When all were
in place the command “Seats” was given by the first
captain, and in another instant, where all had been silent,
it was a babel of voices. Colonna had his eye on me, and
assigned me a seat; not up with him, of course, but down
at the foot with some other plebes.</p>
        <p>It was a good, hot, smoking meal, better than I
expected and every one of us had a good, hot, smoking
appetite, as was evidenced by the quick disappearance
of the food, and the cries from the heads of tables “Beef 
here, waiter,” “Bread here, waiter,” “Potatoes 
here, waiter,” which soon resounded through the hall.</p>
        <pb id="wise250" n="250"/>
        <p>Nobody but the non-commissioned officers, stationed at the
head and foot of the table, could address the waiters. These
later fairly ran in filling orders. I found a little fellow sitting next
to me who had only been in a day or two, and we had some
quiet, timid talk between ourselves.</p>
        <p>“At-ten-<hi rend="italics">tion</hi>!” rang through the hall after twenty-five
minutes consumed in consuming. Dead silence reigned where
everybody had been talking. “Rise up!” and we rose, reformed
in front of the mess-hall, were broken into columns of
fours, marched back to barracks, and as the battalion reached
its original position the command came, “Break ranks, march,”
which was the signal for a general mix-up, in a leisure period
of thirty minutes which followed each meal, during which
cadets were allowed to visit one another's rooms, and dispose
of themselves as they saw fit, until “Study drum” beat. I
thought trouble was in store for me then, for I discovered in
the mess-hall not less than a dozen former acquaintances,
most of whom were old cadets, and they discovered me. I
apprehended that they would have something to say to me,
and, knowing of my recent arrival, might amuse themselves at
my expense; but it was not so bad as I expected. Such of them
as I met after the corps was dismissed spoke to me with civility
and passed on. It was, as I afterwards learned, etiquette in an
old cadet acquaintance not to torture a plebe whom he had
known elsewhere. Being old cadets, they would not associate
with a plebe, but, unless he was “impudent,” they so far
recognized former acquaintanceship as to let him alone.</p>
        <p>Before I reached the sallyport, however, several strange,
saucy, and piratical-looking young Hessians had their eyes
upon me, and my relief was very great when Louis, my
guardian angel, came hurrying down from A
<pb id="wise251" n="251"/>
Company, and with an air of authority said, “Here, sir Rat,
you come with me.” His whole manner changed as soon as we
were out of their presence, and he said, “Those chaps would
have drawn you into conversation in another minute, and then
they would have had a lot of fun out of you.”</p>
        <p>The permit to go out of limits, which Louis had obtained in
the morning, was good until dress parade, and he proposed
that we should go out and about. Before we left, I learned the
meaning of his talk about “buying apples with my coat.”
During the half hour after dinner, a number of mountain
women, with bags and baskets of apples, appeared in front of
barracks, and the cadets carried on the liveliest imaginable
trading with them, exchanging old clothes for apples.</p>
        <p>At West Point, the cadet old clothes are religiously
preserved and sold, and their proceeds are applied to a mess-
fund. The interest on that fund is expended upon the cadet
mess, and the fund has already grown so large that the
character of cadet fare is much improved, and the cost of the
mess to cadets is materially reduced. Think what might have
been accomplished at the Virginia Military Institute if this
same policy had been pursued! Instead of that, for fifty-eight
years the cadets have been allowed to throw away their old
clothes in the most reckless fashion. I have seen many a cadet
jacket traded off for half a peck of apples; and if a cadet were
really hungry, I think he would trade the coat on his back for
one apple-pie.</p>
        <p>That afternoon our stroll took us down to the river, where
the terminus of the canal was located. There were in those
days no railroads running into Lexington. The stage coach
and this primitive means of travel were its only public means
of communication with the outside
<pb id="wise252" n="252"/>
world. I soon learned where the laundries were, and where the
boys skated in cold weather, and what were the different points of
interest. Louis led me to the house of an old Irishman who sold
cider and cakes to the cadets, and we regaled ourselves. Then
we came back by the rear way up the stream called the Nile,
which runs behind the Institute grounds, and clambered up
the bluffs and stole around to the bakery where old Judge, the
baker, gave us a hot loaf just drawn from the oven, it having
been cooked for the cadets' supper. Louis explained that we
were out of limits now, as cadets were forbidden to visit the
bakery, and, if caught, received five demerits and an extra tour
of guard duty. The sensation of disobeying orders was rather
pleasant, I confess. Judge was a wonderful old negro; he had
been there many years. In appearance, he was a black Sancho
Panza, fat and puffing and jolly; he was a darkey of moods.
Sometimes his mood was religious, sometimes it was profane;
but, whether the one or the other, he was always amusing.</p>
        <p>Out of that first introduction grew a long friendship with
Judge, and when he confronted St. Peter, the pile of bread
stacked up against him in Heaven must hare been
tremendous; for every cadet who was at Lexington in the
thirty years of his stewardship received from him at least ten
loaves stolen from the Commonwealth of Virginia. Bless his
hot, jolly, fat, black, flour-smirched, roguish memory! His
portrait, with his baker's cap jauntily tipped, now adorns the
cadet mess-hall in the company of generals and other
distinguished citizen departed.</p>
        <p>Then we visited old Reilly, another famous character.
Stone blind, the old fellow earned a good living making hair
mattresses for the cadets. He measured, cut, sewed,
<pb id="wise253" n="253"/>
trimmed, bound, filled, and knotted mattresses as well as any
one could do with the finest eyesight. He was an ardent
politician, and a devoted admirer of my father. The old man
was always delighted to receive visitors, and was full of cadet
knowledge and reminiscence as he sat there, blind as a bat, but
working like a beaver.</p>
        <p>Then we strolled to the regions in rear of the professors'
houses, where Louis showed me, near the bluffs, in a wooded
spot, a sort of natural amphitheatre, which he described as the
“fighting-ground.” Seated on the edge of this depression, he
entered on a vivid and thrilling description of the last great
battle here, which had taken place between the present first
captain, in his third class year, and another cadet; it was very
interesting.</p>
        <p>“But,” he said, “of course he 
would not fight any more. First
and second class men are above fighting. They frown it down
and punish it. Only yearlings like myself and plebes like you
fight, you know.”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” said I; but I did not know any such thing until he
told it to me. Thus we went on, he teaching and I absorbing
like a sponge, all the while having a suspicion that I might see
the “fighting-ground” again some day. Just then we caught
the sound of a drum: “Rap, rap, rap,  -  rap, rap, rap,  -  rap, rap,
rap,  -  rap, rap, rap, rap,  -  rap, rap, rap.”</p>
        <p>Springing to his feet, he exclaimed: “Gracious! there is dress
parade; we must run for it.” So off we sped, running by the rear
of the professors' houses and scrambling over the stile,
reaching the barracks as the boys were streaming down the
stairways, pulling on their gloves and arranging their
accoutrements. Louis barely saved his distance, and came
tearing through the arch just as the command, “Fall in!” was
sung out by the four first sergeants. I went with a squad of
plebes, who
<pb id="wise254" n="254"/>
without arms were marched out after the companies and
formed on the left of the battalion.</p>
        <p>It was a brave sight when the drums and fifes struck up (we
had no band in those days); the colors marched forth and
gave the alignment; the companies followed and formed on
the colors, and the officer in charge put the battalion through
its drill. Then we marched back and were dismissed. Evening
parade, supper, study hours, tattoo, taps, came in their regular
order; and as I went to sleep, soon after taps inspection, it
was with the thought that this had been one of the most
eventful and delightful days I ever spent.</p>
        <p>Reveille! What part of cadet routine is so well remembered
as that? Awakened at crack of dawn from dreamless sleep by
the long-drawn notes of fife and drum, our first semi-
conscious impulse was to slumber on, soothed by the drowsy
tune. Not long such thoughts, however; for, with a quick rude
of the drums, the tune was changed. A gay and lilting
quickstep took its place, crashing up and down and through
the dormitories. Quick, responsive lights were twinkling in a
hundred rooms, where but a few moments before all was
silence. Three hundred youngsters were hurrying for the
ranks. As if to mock their haste, the tune changed again, and
the music went floating off once more into dreamland, while
tile cadets grew more impetuous in their preparations. Then
the last tune came. This was no sluggard's lullaby. It was a
ringing summons to the front, in which the drums seemed to
be trying to drown the air the fifes were piping gayly. The
latest plebe in barracks knew the words:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Wake-up-rats-and-come-to Reveille</l>
          <l>If-you-want to get-your-corp-orality,</l>
          <l>Wake up rats! Come to Reveille</l>
          <l>If you want to get YOUR corporalite-e-e-e-e!”</l>
        </lg>
        <pb id="wise255" n="255"/>
        <p>Then, with three long rolls and two final thumps, the music
ceased.</p>
        <p>Towards the close of this matin concert, stoops, stairs, and
archway swarmed with hundreds of cadets, half-awake,
hurrying to their places in the forming ranks. As the last
laggard whisked through the sallyport, struggling to avoid
being late, the chill morning air resounded with the commands
of the first sergeants: “Fall in A Compane-e-e-e! Fall in B and
C and D Compane-e-e e!” Then, after a moment's pause,
sergeant after sergeant gave the command, “Front!” and
away they went, rattling off the rolls with surprising noise and
speed. Then came another pause, in which, as the boys stood
shivering in the nipping daybreak, the first sergeants spotted
absentees by repeating their names with marvelous and
unerring accuracy.</p>
        <p>Ranks broken, the cadets, with heads drawn in and hands
stuck in their waistbands, went back to quarters in sullen
silence, or with deep anathemas upon reveille.</p>
        <p>Yet how beautiful it was! On the eastern face of forest, peak,
and barrack-tower the blush of morning shone, while all else
was in shadow. Against the glowing east, the undulating sky-
line of the distant Blue Ridge was cut clear and strong, with
purple shadows filling in the space between us and them, save
where the valley mists were tipped with morning light.
Correggio could not paint nor Claud attain the limpid high-
lights, the clear-obscure, the deep visible-invisible, of those
exquisite autumn daybreaks in the mountains.</p>
        <p>Old boys, wherever you may be, have you forgotten them?</p>
        <p>About them, even then, there was a sentiment,  -  a sentiment
which deepens as the years roll by. We were looking upon the
shining morning face not only of nature,
<pb id="wise256" n="256"/>
but of life also. Yes, in memory the shining morning faces
of those schoolboys still live, framed in a setting of mountain
peaks and barrack towers, gilded by the first faint rays of
sunrise.</p>
        <p>Thirty minutes after reveille found the plebes assembled
in squads of three or four, and marched away by old
cadets for awkward-squad exercises upon the parade ground.
Drill until the drum for breakfast dispensed
with all need of appetizing tonics.</p>
        <p>After breakfast, academic exercises not having been
resumed as yet, the squad drills were continued, and far and
wide on the parade the groups of plebes were to be seen, and
the voice of the drill-master was heard.</p>
        <p>So far, all had gone well with me. Beyond some little
chaffing, no old cadet had troubled me, and the squad-
marcher had complimented me on attention and promptness.</p>
        <p>We were resting. A squad of plebes, moved at double time,
were brought down to where we were standing and halted
near us, by a stocky, aggressive-looking old cadet. Having
ordered a rest, Sprague (that was his name) came over to
speak to our drill-master. “I'm giving those Rats thunder!”
said he, pointing to the panting plebes. And so he was. Instead
of practicing his squad in setting-up exercises, he was
prancing them all over the parade ground. “What sort of Rats
have you got?” said he, looking us over in an insolent way. 
“Oh, a fair enough lot,” said our squad-marcher, an easy-going
but efficient man. Sprague looked at us keenly, and asked our
names. Some look of mine, I presume, or the fact that I was
nearest to him, made him continue his probing of me, and I
was not very civil.</p>
        <p>“Why, Mr. Rat, you are impudent,” said he. Then
glancing around to see that the sub-professor in charge
<pb id="wise257" n="257"/>
was not looking, he commanded me to “hold up.” That meant
that I was to hold up my hand and let him twist my arm. By
this time I was piping hot, but had sense enough to keep silent.</p>
        <p>“Hold up, sir!” said he peremptorily.</p>
        <p>“Shut up, sir!” replied I; and there, all the wise counsel
which Louis and Colonna had given me, and all the good
resolves I had made, were vanished into thin air with those
three words.</p>
        <p>“Mr. Rat,” said he, drawing close to me, and shaking his
finger in my face as he hissed the words, “I will attend to you
as soon as we get back to barracks. I'll take some of that
rebellious spirit out of you. See if I don't.” I was about to
answer him with defiance, when our squad was called to
attention and drill was resumed. It is not difficult to appreciate
that the remainder of that drill was far from being a period of
happiness. All the time, I was calculating how to receive the
attack. Finally, I counted that if I could succeed in reaching
our room, I might take a musket, and defend myself with a bayonet.
Sprague looked like a game one, and I knew that he would
have plenty of backers. When the recall beat, our squad was
near barracks. We went in on double time and when the
squad was dismissed, I made a bold lash for the archway. I
thought I was safe, for I had nearly reached the sallyport; but
when almost in, I saw Sprague dismiss his squad and start
after me, calling, “Catch that Rat!”</p>
        <p>Through the arch we sped, and it seemed as if I would reach
our room upon the second stoop, for I was nearly at
the stairway. But! but! but! Just at that moment a
tremendous fellow shot like a goshawk from the door I
was about to pass, and, slipping his right arm about my
waist, nearly lifted me from the ground and held me tight
<pb id="wise258" n="258"/>
as a vise until Sprague and a dozen others came up. 
Infuriated beyond all control, I struck
out like a clever fellow, but they bore me straight along, up the
steps and into the first room on the second stoop, and in a
jiffy had me bound and on a table. In another instant I should
have felt the brass ferrule of a bayonet-scabbard administered
without pity. The room was filled with cadets, all bent on
disciplining a rebellious Rat.</p>
        <p>At the very crisis, the crowd near the doorway swayed
back and forth. Some one exclaimed, “Get out of the way, or I'll
plunge this bayonet into you!” and Louis bounded in, with
gleaming eyes, his jaws set like a bull pup's. Rushing up to
Sprague he said, “No, sir! You'll not buck that Rat!”</p>
        <p>“Yes, I will,” said Sprague.</p>
        <p>“Not unless you can whip me!” was the game reply of
Louis, as he began to slip off his jacket. “I bucked him
yesterday, and I asked Boggess all about what happened
on the parade ground, and he says you provoked and
teased the Rat until you forced him to be impudent. You
shan't touch him.” With that he sprang towards me to
unloose the fastenings. The crowd grew agitated. Sprague
made a motion to fight, and in another instant we should
have had a pretty mess, when  -  </p>
        <p>“Rap, rap, rap! Rap, rap, rap!” came sharp and
loud upon the door. Everybody knew what it meant.
Somebody, quick as lightning, undid the straps, jerked me off
the table, and stood me on my feet; and Captain
Semmes, the officer in charge, walked into the room serenely.
With a dignified and inquiring look at the cadets now
crowded back against the walls, he said, “Gentlemen, what's
all this disturbance?”</p>
        <p>Louis was slipping on his cadet jacket, and, sidling up
to me, said, “Don't say a word. Whatever you do, don't
peach.”</p>
        <pb id="wise259" n="259"/>
        <p>“What does this all mean, gentlemen?” repeated the
captain, in louder and more peremptory tones.</p>
        <p>Sprague at last spoke up: “Oh, nothing; I just had a little
misunderstanding with that gentleman there,” pointing to me.</p>
        <p>I was so elated by the unexpected turn things had taken that
my good-nature had returned, and when Captain Semmes
turned to me and asked what it all meant, I said, “Oh, we were
just trying to see who was strongest.”</p>
        <p>“Go to your rooms, gentlemen, all of you, at once!” said
Captain Semmes, waiting to see that his orders were carried
out; and then he departed, without seeking too many
explanations, for in his day he had been a terror to plebes.</p>
        <p>“Well, Mr. Rat!” said Louis, when we reached our rooms,
and found fat Colonna sitting there, still wearing his sword
and sash, laughing at our discomfiture, “you have put your
foot in it, sure enough. You have not only made yourself a
target, but I expect that round-shouldered long-armed, bull-
yearling of a Sprague will beat me to death about this
business.”</p>
        <p>Then Colonna, who was above the dignity of such scrapes,
but had witnessed my race and capture, nearly had fits
describing how big Wood had seized me, and how they had
turned me upside down going up the steps, and how I nearly
kicked Billy Mason's eye out, and a lot of other things that
did and did not happen; for Colonna was a great tease.</p>
        <p>Dinner drum was sounded, and I went down, reflecting
that the first twenty-four hours of my military life were
completed.</p>
        <p>A day or two afterwards, academic studies were resumed. With
mathematics, Latin, French, and drawing added to military
duties, there was little time for play.</p>
        <pb id="wise260" n="260"/>
        <p>A half day's holiday on Saturday, during which we were
permitted to leave the Institute limits, gave us but scant
opportunity for diversion. Even the letters of introduction I
had brought, to the families of some of the professors,
remained undelivered for lack of time.</p>
        <p>The winter of 1862-63 was cold enough. While the army of
General Lee was encamped about Fredericksburg, after a
gallant defense of the place, we, “the seed-corn of the
Confederacy,” as Mr. Davis called us, were very comfortably
cared for in barracks, which were heated and lighted as well
as if no war had been in progress.</p>
        <p>There was no lack of news from the front. An older
brother of Louis had been captured at Roanoke Island, and,
while awaiting exchange, was acting as tactical officer of A
Company, and sub-professor of mathematics. He was a sober-
minded, earnest fellow, always watchful over us, and he
occasionally sent for us to come to his quarters, that he might
advise, or warn, or rebuke us in an affectionate and
considerate way. We were devoted to him, and prized his good
opinion more than that of anybody else. He bore my father's
name, and counted me as much in his charge as his own
brother. By our access to his quarters opportunity was given
us from time to time to hear a great deal of news from the
front, for never a great battle came off but numbers of
Virginia Military Institute boys were in it, and they seemed
to have a talent for getting killed or wounded. Those from far
Southern States, instead of going to Alabama or Mississippi
or Louisiana during their short leaves, would come to the
Virginia Military Institute, room with some sub-professor of
their own class, and assist in teaching until sufficiently
restored to return to duty.</p>
        <p>Captain Henry A. Wise was a universal favorite with
<pb id="wise261" n="261"/>
the graduates, and his quarters were seldom without some
occupant of the class described above. Everybody 
connected with the Institute had a nickname: General
Smith was “Old Spex,” Colonel Preston 
was “Old Bald,”
Stonewall Jackson was “Old Jack,” 
General Colton “Old
Polly,” Colonel Williamson “Old Tom,” Colonel Gilliam 
“Old Gill,” and down to the youngest
“sub” all were nicknamed, and seldom
 referred to save by
their sobriquets. For some reason, Captain Wise was called
“Chinook.” Nobody knew exactly why. Among the cadets,
every man of prominence had a nickname: there was “Dad” 
Wyatt, so called for age, and “Dad” 
Nelson for extreme
youth, and “Duck” Colonna for his 
short legs, and “Bull”
Temple for his strength, and “Jane” 
Creighton for his
gentleness, and so on, <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">ad infinitum</foreign></hi> Louis and I escaped
naming until a third cadet of our name arrived. He was an
odd fish, a cousin of both of us, who, while not very studious
in things taught there, had studied “The Adventures of
Simon Suggs” until he knew them by heart, and quoted
them on all occasions. He soon became known as “Suggs,”
and the cognomen spread until all three of us were called 
“Suggs J.,” “Suggs L.,” and “Suggs W.,” as if we never had
any other names. One day the corporal of the guard reported
me for noise on the stoop, and inadvertently entered me on
the delinquent list as “Suggs J.” The adjutant knew
whom he meant, but reported him for carelessness.</p>
        <p>After the battle of Fredericksburg, we heard all about it in
the rooms of “Old Chinook,” from men who had
participated in its glories. I forget who they were, but it was
probably “Sheep” Floweree of Mississippi, or “Bute”
Henderson, or “Tige” Hardin, or “Marsh” McDonald, all
of whom, at one time or another, turned up
<pb id="wise262" n="262"/>
there. To the outside world, they were colonels and majors,
etc.: at the Virginia Military Institute, they were “Sheep”
and “Bute” and “Tige.” Many a day out of study hours,
from their lips we would drink in the story of the repulse of
Meagher's Irish Brigade at Marye's Heights, or how Hayes
made his stand at Hamilton Crossing, or Pender at the
railroad, or how Stuart's Horse Artillery raked Franklin's
Corps on the Rappahannockflats. Very few boys have had
such practical lessons in the art of war.</p>
        <p>Poor “Chinook,” who longed for his exchange, and chafed
at the delays which made him miss these battles, looked
dreadfully depressed, and as for ourselves, Louis and I felt
it was an outrage that we were penned up and kept away
from these wondrous sights and scenes.</p>
        <p>In February, we had a cold, hard freeze; all drills were
suspended; the North River was hard-frozen. At evening
parade on Friday, an order was published announcing
that a supply of ice for the following summer was most
desirable; that, owing to the number of laborers who
had volunteered, the superintendent was unable to secure
the necessary force to save the ice-crop; and that every
cadet who would volunteer for Saturday to work at filling
the ice-houses of the Institute should have three afternoons'
leave, from dinner to dress-parade, the following week, for
skating. At the call for volunteers the corps stepped to the
front as one man. Of course they did; what better fun than
that did anybody want?</p>
        <p>The next morning, cadets were ordered to put on old
clothes. The companies were divided into working squads,
and marched to the river. We had all the saws, and axes,
and ice-hooks, and slides, and horses we needed. The
strongest men went out and cut the ice; the smaller
<pb id="wise263" n="263"/>
chaps were worked in teams, with ropes to secure it and
drag it to the wagons. Some of the country boys were
detailed as teamsters. Squads were stationed at the ice-
houses to receive and dump the loads. Fires were built
along the river banks. Those drowsy country horses were
never pushed so hard, or heard the whips crack so loudly as
they did that day. We went to work in relays. “Old Spex”
had rations and hot coffee served upon the river bank. And
when the cold sun was sinking in a red western sky, the
corps, its work completely done, filled with joyous
anticipations for the coming week, was trotting homeward
across the bridge at a double-quick, the happiest, jolliest
set of youngsters in the Southern Confederacy.</p>
        <p>Then came the skating time. News of our holiday spread
over the town, and all the pretty girls in Lexington, and
many of the citizens, were there to see the sport.</p>
        <p>There was no lack of skates; the arsenal, long since
disappeared, stood in the barracks' quadrangle in those
days. It was the general depository of all the things left by
the cadets who marched to the war in 1861. I fear little
regard was paid to their vested rights. Nearly every old
trunk in that arsenal had by this time been rifled. Many a
cadet jacket and trousers, left there by some old cadet with
the purpose of returning for it some day, had been 
“appropriated” long ago, worn out, and traded off for
apples. In cadet morals, this is not stealing. The conditions
existing there at any time amount almost to communism;
at the period referred to, the seizure of everything required
was justified under the plea of military necessity.
Fortunately, the arsenal was burned by General Hunter in
1864, so that the absent cadets who had been robbed of their skates doubtless
<pb id="wise264" n="264"/>
thought their goods were destroyed by fate of war, and never
knew that they had been used by their own comrades; else
had there been, I fear, after the war, grave charges against
all of us.</p>
        <p>Among the débris piled helter-skelter in the arsenal,
after the sundry pickings-over to which its contents had
been subjected, somebody found an old drum-major's shako,
relic of the pomp and panoply of peace times. The first
appearance of this shako in public was on the head of a long-
legged cadet, who wore it in a game of shinny at our ice
carnival. It was not long before a bandy-stick knocked his
shako in the air. That was suggestion enough. Soon another
cadet took a crack at it, and its wearer, dodging and racing,
went streaming, away with fifty fellows following.</p>
        <p>Out of this grew a famous game called “tapping the
shako.” Whoever was fast enough to catch the wearer, and
tap his shako, became entitled to place it on his head, and
wear it until a fleeter-footed skater won it from him. It was
but a little while, of course, before it fell into the hands of
the best skater and most adroit dodger in the corps; and
then the concentrated energies of a hundred men to
overhaul its owner furnished marvelous excitement and
noble sport. In one of these contests, the race was prolonged
almost, if not quite, to Loch Laird, five miles down the river.
The sport elicited wonderful displays of endurance, agility,
and pluck.</p>
        <p>On our last day, we gave an unexpected exhibition. The
weather had moderated, but apparently not enough to
make the ice dangerous. In fact, however, the freeze had
been so sudden that the ice was filled with air-holes. Our
great game had now been regulated, for in its earlier stages
we found that certain cadets, like certain hounds instead of
running true to the line, would wait for the
<pb id="wise265" n="265"/>
quarry to double and then take a short cross-cut upon him.
So we staked the centre of the river, and forced every man to
follow the course if he claimed a touch. This afternoon, a
great crowd of spectators was assembled; we had had a
glorious breakaway, and the old black shako, on the head of
some fleet-footed fellow, went whirling down the river with
the pack in full cry, the crowds on the banks delighted. For a
little while the chase disappeared, and then came back on
the near side of the stream, but out towards the centre. The
boys were well bunched; not less than six or eight were close
upon the leader. The race grew intensely exciting; some men
on horse-back were galloping along the bank. The women
were waving their handkerchiefs and clapping their hands
with delight.</p>
        <p>The closest follower made a fine burst of speed, had
raised his stick to tap the shako, when crash went the ice,
and both men disappeared, the old black shako alone
remaining in sight floating on the water. A wail and
screams went up from the shore. One after another of those
in hot pursuit plumped into the hole before they could check
their headway, and in another moment six or eight of the
best fellows in the corps were floundering in the deep water,
the ice at the edges breaking under them at each attempt
they made to scramble out. Then came an instance of the
power of discipline.</p>
        <p>A number of us smaller boys had not followed the chase;
as soon as we saw the accident, we hurried towards the
scene. No doubt further misfortune would have beaten us,
but for the cool-headed behavior of Sam Shriver, a second-
class man. Darting up like a general,
his towering figure caught all eyes as he said, “Attention!”
All was silence.</p>
        <p>“Where are the safety ropes?” he demanded. We
<pb id="wise266" n="266"/>
had had them all the time until now; now, when we needed
them <hi rend="italics">most</hi>, they were gone, of course. He never
paused a second.</p>
        <p>Looking to the hole he cried, “Hold fast, boys. Don't
exhaust yourselves. I'll have you out in a moment. ”</p>
        <p>They were making a fearful splutter in the hole, some
calling for help, some swearing, some grunting, and one, as
we afterwards heard, praying. What frightened Louis and
myself most was that we saw dear old Colonna and Dad
Nelson in there.</p>
        <p>Turning to us, Shriver said, “Form a line  -  quick!”</p>
        <p>It was formed, consisting of about fifty men.</p>
        <p>“Let the far end of the line get well ashore,” said he, and
it was there in a jiffy. “Small men in front,” and small
men came to the front. That put Louis and myself well
to the front.</p>
        <p>“Lock wrists,” cried Sam, and each of us seized the wrist
of the man in front of and behind us, and he ours; we
stretched out.</p>
        <p>“Advance to hole,” said he. “Ten front files lie down.
Rear files shove away,” said he, as soon as we were down.</p>
        <p>“Louis, we're in for it,” said I.</p>
        <p>“Yes, I know,” he replied. “We'll probably break in, but if
we connect with them, the rear men will pull us all out
together.” So they shoved us over the ice on our stomachs
until the front man reached the nearest fellow in the hole,
and the man behind him fastened to him, and so on until
all were firmly clutched together. When all those in the
hole were fast to each other firmly, Sam gave command, 
“Haul away slowly!”</p>
        <p>As the rear men began to move backward, out came the
first man from the hole, and the next and the next, and
then their weight broke the ice and we all went down
<pb id="wise267" n="267"/>
together but were still moving shoreward, while Shriver
called to us not to let our hold break. Thus dragged, we soon
reached the sound ice, and man after man came up and out
of the water until all were saved, by the promptness of
gallant Sam Shriver, who became the lion of the hour. Men
never hugged each other's wrists more tightly than did we
that day, and the prints of fingers ,were so deep on my
wrists I thought the blood would start from them.</p>
        <p>Cold? It was fearful! “Old Spex” had witnessed it all. 
“Double-quick those men to barracks, Mr. Shriver,” said he;
“I'll ride forward to the hospital and have hot grog served
to them when they are well rubbed down. You know I am a
temperance advocate, but this is medicine. Look out there
for little Nelson and Barton; they are nearly frozen.” With
that he managed to spur his fat sorrel to a clumsy trot, and
we went jogging back to barracks, warm enough by the time
we reached there, but not averse to the china mugs of
steaming whiskey and ginger which were served from a tin
bucket by the hospital steward. Nobody was the worse for
it. Is it not surprising what youngsters of that age can
stand?</p>
        <p>The spring of 1863 opened, and with it began the hard
work, first in company and then in battalion drill. Besides
this, the period of examinations was approaching. I had
been neither studious nor soldierly, and now, after the
severe drills, it was difficult to bring one's self down to the
hard study necessary to pass examinations. More than
once during this springtime of 1863, the corps had lost
valuable time from study in attending the burial of
distinguished officers,  -  first, a Captain Davidson, who had
fallen with great distinction; then General Paxton a
resident of Lexington; and lastly came an announcement
which fell like a pall upon the school.</p>
        <pb id="wise268" n="268"/>
        <p>Stonewall Jackson was dead! Could it be possible,
We had believed that he bore a charmed life. The Institute
had sent a host of magnificent officers to the front.
There were Rhodes, Mahone, Lindsay, Walker, the Patton 
brothers, Lane, Crutchfield, McCausland, Colston,
and many others of lower rank; but “Old Jack” was,
“from his shoulders and upwards, tallest among the
people,” in the estimation of the cadets. His career had
not only been surpassingly brilliant, but it was altogether
surprising.</p>
        <p>Of the old Presbyterian stock of the valley, his people
had not much social prominence, and he had gone to West
Point without particular advantages. After faithful but not
exceptional service in Mexico, he had resigned from the
army and assumed a professorship here. His presence
was not striking, his manners were not attractive, and
his habits were so eccentric that he had not ranked high as
a professor; even at the time of his most astonishing
victories, and when any cadet there would have given all he
possessed to be with him, the stories of “Old Jack's”
eccentricities made daily sport for the cadets.</p>
        <p>For example, it was a famous joke how, when he had
been drilling the third class in light artillery, with the
plebes as horses, the boys had drawn the linchpins from
the cannon wheels, and, as the guns made the turn near the
parapet, the wheels had come off and sent the pieces
tumbling over the slope. When this would happen, as it
often did, Major Jackson would gallop up, look ruefully
down the slope, and remark, without the slightest
suspicion: “There must be something defective in the
construction of these linchpins; they seem inclined to fly out
whenever the pieces in rapid motion change direction.”</p>
        <p>He was not very friendly with General Smith; it was
<pb id="wise269" n="269"/>
said that he would have nothing to do with him, except
officially. Professors were required to make their weekly
report to the superintendent at four o'clock Friday
afternoon. It was told of “Old Jack” that Friday afternoon,
within a few minutes of four o'clock, he would appear in
front of the superintendent's office and walk up and down
until the clock struck four. It made no difference whether it
was raining, hailing, snowing, or freezing, he would not
enter until the clock struck; then, with military precision,
he would advance to the office of the superintendent, salute,
lay his report upon the table, face about, and walk out. It
was also related that during the recitations he was
frequently occupied in rubbing one side of himself, under
the impression, confided to a select few, that one side of his
body was not so well nourished as the other, and was
gradually wasting away.</p>
        <p>When the cadet corps, in the spring of 1861, was ordered
to Camp Lee at Richmond, and its members were put to
drilling recruits, it is safe to say that as little was expected
of Colonel Jackson as of any member of the faculty. Nobody
suspected the great military genius, the untiring energy,
the marvelous resourcefulness, the thirsting, fury, which
lurked beneath that impassive and eccentric exterior.</p>
        <p>But when the story of Manassas came, and men learned
that the day was saved by Jackson, standing like a stone
wall when, in his independent command, he fought and
won the battles of the valley campaign; when, in the seven
days, fighting at Richmond, he threw himself upon the
flank of McClellan; and as he went on and on, mounting ever
upward, until he became Lee's right arm,  -  then the men
who had known him only as an odd professor forgot his
idiosyncrasies, and exulted that our school had furnished
the paladin of the Confederacy.</p>
        <pb id="wise270" n="270"/>
        <p>It was a bitter, bitter day of mourning for all of us when
the corps was marched down to the canal terminus to
meet all that was mortal of Stonewall Jackson. We had
heard the name of every officer who attended the
remains.</p>
        <p>With reversed arms and muffled drums we bore him
back to the Institute, and placed him in the section-room
in which he had taught. There the body lay in state until
the following day. The lilacs and early spring flowers were
just blooming. The number of people who came to view
him for the last time was immense: men and women wept
over his bier as if his death was a personal affliction; then I
saw that the Presbyterians could weep like other folks.
The flowers piled about the coffin hid it and its form from
view. I shall ever count it a great privilege that I was one
of the guard who, through the silence of the night, and
when the crowds had departed, stood watch and ward
alone with the remains of the great “Stonewall.”</p>
        <p>Next day, we buried him with pomp of woe, the cadets
his escort of honor: with minute-guns, and tolling bells,
and most impressive circumstance, we bore him to his
rest. But those ceremonies were to me far less impressive
than walking post in that bare section-room, in the still
hours of night, reflecting that there lay all that was left of
one whose name still thrilled the world.</p>
        <p>The burial of Stonewall Jackson made a deep
impression upon the corps of cadets. It had been our
custom, when things seemed to be going amiss in the
army, to say, “Wait until ‘Old Jack’ gets there; he will
straighten matters out.” We felt that the loss was
irreparable. The cold face on which we had looked taught
us lessons which have been dropped from, the
curriculum in these tame days of peace. </p>
        <pb id="wise271" n="271"/>
        <p>Many a cadet resolved that he would delay no longer 
in offering his services to his country, and, although the
end of the session was near at hand, several refused to
remain longer, and resigned at once.</p>
        <p>The session of 1862-63 was drawing rapidly to a close.
Louis and I both became alarmed about passing our
examinations he, to pass to the second class and I to the
third. I had nearly the limit of demerits, for besides
other weaknesses, I had developed a love affair uptown
with a pretty little Presbyterian, and, being caught out of
limits, had been confined to barracks, and assigned to
several extra tours of guard duty. At last the eventful 4th
of July arrived, the day on which the graduating class
receives its diplomas and class standings, and cadet
officers for the ensuing year are announced; it is also the
day when the band plays “Auld Lang Syne,” at hearing
which a rat becomes an old cadet.</p>
        <p>When the announcements were read out, Louis and I
found that we had passed our classes fairly well, but far
from brilliantly; when it came to publishing commissioned
officers from the new first class, our old friend and room-
mate, Colonna, moved up to second captain. To our
agreeable surprise, Louis received a good sergeant's
appointment. I was left a private; I deserved it. All those
most interested in me had warned me such would be the
result if I pursued my trifling, heedless course; and now I
stood chagrined and crestfallen, while others received
the honors. Nevertheless, I acknowledged to myself that
it was just, and swallowed whatever disappointment I
felt, inwardly resolving, however, that next year should
tell a different tale.</p>
        <p>Those familiar with the history of that period will not
forget that on this 4th of July, 1863, when we were
engrossed with these petty concerns, the great battle
of
<pb id="wise272" n="272"/>
Gettysburg was being fought, and the surrender of
Vicksburgburg was taking place.</p>
        <p>A few days before the final ceremonies, we had gone into
camp for the summer in a grove in rear of the
superintendent's house: there we remained for two months
chiefly engaged in drilling the new cadets. It was a stupid
period for the graduates, and several of the sub-professors 
had departed for the war, and many of the
second class men had received furloughs. The monotony of
camp life was broken in the latter part of August, when we
were given an arduous march to Covington to meet a
raiding party from West Virginia under General Averill
but the general had displayed great good sense, as, we
thought, by going elsewhere before our arrival.</p>
        <p>The 1st of September, we broke camp, returned to barracks,
and resumed academic duties with great earnestness.</p>
        <p>I keenly realized the advantages lost by the trifling of
my first year, and, in the long periods for reflection in
camp, had fully determined to prove myself a better
student and soldier than I had yet been. It is well enough to
have people laugh at one's reckless escapades and foolish 
antics, but those things count against a fellow when
it comes to choosing the boys who have the sterling stuff in
them.</p>
        <p>Our old and tried mentor Colonna, being now an officer,
had gone to live with his own classmates in a tower room.
Louis and I, in solemn conclave, selected as our room-mates
“Squirrel” Overton, “Jack” Stanard, and a little
rat named Harris, a cousin of Overton. In these we felt we
had an earnest set of room-mates, and we resolved 
that there was to be no more skylarking, no more defiance
of discipline, and a strictly moral and studios aggregation.
Then came the sultry June days, when it
<pb id="wise273" n="273"/>
was work, work, work at books preparing for 
examinations and drill, drill, drill in the school of the battalion.</p>
        <p>From reveille until four o'clock P. M., we were in the section-room 
reciting, or studying in our quarters on review. At four o'clock, the
battalion was formed for drill, and exercised in the hot sun,
until time for dress parade, in every intricate manœuvre. More
than one little fellow fell exhausted from the intense strain,
and every cadet in the corps was longing for the time when our
arduous apprenticeship would end.</p>
        <p>One hot, steaming evening, Charley Faulkner, Phillips,
and I sat in an open window which overlooked the parade ,
ground. It was during the half hour of leisure after dinner,  -  
the only leisure time that was left to us. The parade
ground shimmered with the noonday heat. Not a leaf of
the guard-tree was shaken by the slightest breeze. We
were commiserating each other at the sweltering prospect of
two hours' drill in a tight-fitting uniform under the rays of
such a sun.</p>
        <p>“It's brutal,” exclaimed Faulkner. “It's enough to kill a
man.” We all called each other “men.”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” said Phillips, “somebody will be sunstruck. Poor
little Jefferson fainted yesterday, and to-day is worse.”.</p>
        <p>“Then why don't you faint, Reuben?” said I. “Charlie
and I will bring you off the field, and that will give us
all a rest.”</p>
        <p>“I'll ‘cut’ with you two fellows which shall faint,” said
Reuben. All matters of lot were decided by opening a book,
and the second letter, second line, left-hand page, decided 
the matter: “a” was best, and “z” was worst. Down came
the book, and Reuben cut the lowest letter; so it fell to
him to faint, and to us to bring him off the field. When the
drill-drum beat that afternoon, we fell
<pb id="wise274" n="274"/>
in line with Reuben between us. As the company was
divided into platoons, we came near being separated, for
Faulkner was last man in our platoon. Breaking the
battalion into column of platoons, Shipp marched us to the
drill grounds. Oh, it was hot,  -  hot enough to disarm 
suspicion at anybody's fainting.</p>
        <p>Through all the evolutions we went,  -  “Right of
company's rear into column;” “Close column by divisions
on second division, right in front;” “To the rear by the right
flank, pass the defile,” and what not. The file-closers were
so near to us we could not talk. All we could do was to nudge
Reuben, and we began to think he would never faint.</p>
        <p>At last Shipp trotted his great gray horse to the flank of
the battalion, and gave the command, “Forward into
line,  -  forward double time,  -  march.” The
perspiration was streaming from us.</p>
        <p>“Now, if ever, Reuben,” I whispered, as we started off;
and, sure enough, Reuben made a feint of stumbling, his
gun pitched forward from his shoulder, and he threw
himself forward in as beautiful a faint as ever was feinted.</p>
        <p>“Help him there, Faulkner and Wise,” said the left
guide, as the battalion swept on; and Charley and I bent
over him with infinite tenderness and concern. We were
about to pass some congratulations, when I looked up and
saw Shipp galloping, warning Phillips. That gave him all
the pallor he needed.</p>
        <p>“Who is that man?” said the major.</p>
        <p>“Phillips, sir,” said Faulkner and myself, rising and
saluting.</p>
        <p>“Is he seriously ill?”</p>
        <p>“No, sir, hope not,  -  seems to be overcome by heat.”</p>
        <p>“Eh! take him to barracks and summon the surgeon,”
said he, and, roweling the old gray, he galloped back to
<pb id="wise275" n="275"/>
the command. He did not order us to return, so Master 
Faulkner and I remained in barracks to nurse the invalid,
after making a brave show of his helplessness as we
assisted him across the plain. In barracks, we at once began
business. Faulkner hurried to the hospital for a bucket of
ice for the invalid. A happy thought struck me. I stole
around behind Colonel Williamson's, and milked his cow
into our drinking-pail. We three then sat up in a quiet room,
drinking iced milk, watching the battalion drill.</p>
        <p>It was all very well until next evening parade, when we
heard ourselves reported for not returning to ranks, and, in
spite of some very plausible excuses given to the
commandant, five more demerits were added to our already
overflowing score. The story of our ruse was all over
barracks, and I have always thought it had reached Shipp's
ears.</p>
        <p>Whether it did or not, I had by this time, and in many
ways, become known to the superintendent and
commandant as mixed up in, and capable of, any sort of
prank or dereliction which took place,  -  a reputation by no
means enviable, let me assure you.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XVIII</head>
        <head>A HUNT AND ALMOST A LICKING</head>
        <p>THAT was a great flight of wild pigeons in the Brushy
Hills in the autumn of 1863, and nobody ever before saw so
many squirrels there. Louis and I had been behaving well. Our
class standing was good, and our conduct exemplary.</p>
        <p>We found it easy now to secure special permits, and for
privileges were content to apply on Fridays for leave of
absence from Saturday dinner roll-call. This gave us
substantially all day for hunting. General Philip St. George
Cocke, a wealthy patron of the school, had presented
to it a stand of small smooth-bore muskets, which
we found to be excellent fowling-pieces.</p>
        <p>At this period of the war, no shot were purchasable in
stores. The devices to which we resorted to provide shot
may be interesting. Our lead we obtained from the roof of
an unoccupied outhouse. In our earlier efforts, we beat the
lead into thin sheets, then cut it into narrow strips, then
cross-cut the strips into cubes. These we rolled between
two drawing-boards until the pellets were approximately
round. That method proving slow, we shifted to another. We
obtained a piece of sheet tin, which we perforated with
small nail-holes. To this sheet of tin we attached a long
handle. Then we secured a brazier with some charcoal and
a ladle. With this outfit we heated the lead on the brazier.
When it was thoroughly melted one man poured it slowly
from the spoon upon the sheet
<pb id="wise277" n="277"/>
of tin, while the other shook the tin gently over a bucket of
water. The lead dropped into the water in little globules,
through the perforations of the tin. When the operation was
complete, we had shot shaped like exclamation points. All
that remained was to cut off their tails, and this we did
with a patience and perseverance worthy of a more
important cause. The shot were heavier than those we buy
in stores, and very deadly in their effects.</p>
        <p>One Friday night in October, 1863, we had obtained a
permit to be absent next day from breakfast roll-call until
dress parade. We had been so pressed with academic and
military duties that we had not manufactured our supply
of shot. Conic sections, Livy, and surveying had me in
their grip, and Louis was wrestling with calculus and
engineering. Something must be done, or our hunt, so
cherished in anticipation, would fall to the ground. True, we
were now good boys, but we had not been such so long that
our old tricks were forgotten. In the busy days preparatory to
examinations, a favorite method of studying out of hours
had been to wait until after taps inspection, affix blankets
around the sides of the square oaken table, and, crawling
under the table with a candle, to study there for an hour or
two. To-night we resolved to utilize that device.</p>
        <p>It is providential that the fumes of the charcoal in the
brazier did not smother us both. It was close quarters
under there. With brazier, bucket, and lead spoon, little
room was left for the workmen; but we made famous
progress. Our legs stuck out under the blankets, and now
and again we would pull out, or, so to speak, come to the
surface, and have a breathing spell. Oblivious of all else,
and unable to hear outside sounds, we had nearly finished
our task, when “Rap, rap, rap!” came the knock of
an inspector upon our door. We blew out the light,
<pb id="wise278" n="278"/>
and drew our legs inside, but the brazier sent forth a ruddy
glow which betrayed us.</p>
        <p>“Who is orderly her?” asked the voice of a sub-
professor. We crawled up, red and begrimed. “What does
this all mean?” said he.</p>
        <p>We mumbled out some explanations. “The sentinel has
been ordering lights out in this room for five minutes,”
said he sternly. I glanced at the confounded blankets and
saw that the corner of one of them had been sagged by our
scrambling about, so that an aperture was left, through
which a beam of light went straight out the glass doorway
and shone upon a pillar of the stoop, making a daring
signal. Coming into barracks late, the officer had seen it,
and this visit was the result of our calm disregard of
repeated cries of “Lights out in 28,” which cries we had not
heard.</p>
        <p>“Take that fire out and extinguish it. Open the windows, 
and let out these poisonous gases. It is a mercy you
are not smothered to death, and that the barracks have
not been set on fire,” said the officer, as he departed.</p>
        <p>On Monday morning, we answered to the following
reports: “Lights up after taps; repeated disobedience of
orders in failing to extinguish lights; introducing fire into
barracks.” We expected about ten demerits each, to say
nothing of extra tours and confinement to limits. But my
troubles were not ended with this episode. The
quartermaster's store was only opened upon Saturday after
breakfast. It was essential that both of us should have
certain things from the store in the morning before starting
on our hunt. With pass-books in hand, the cadets who
sought supplies formed in line, and were admitted to the
store in the order of their arrival. That we might leave as
early as possible, Louis and I cast lots to decide which
should remain from breakfast with the pass-books
<pb id="wise279" n="279"/>
and get near the store door. The one who went to breakfast
was to bring the other man's meal buttoned in the breast
of his jacket. The lot to remain fell to me. When Louis
came back from breakfast, he found a very damaged-
looking comrade in our room; and this is how it all came
about:  -  </p>
        <p>The store was on the fourth stoop, in a large room over
the archway. Only six or eight boys had remained from
breakfast. I was fourth or fifth in line. In front of me were
three plebes and an old cadet. While waiting, a quarrel
arose between the old cadet and the plebes about their
respective places in line. The old cadet insisted that they
should let him enter first, and they refused. It was a cold,
gray morning, and none of us were in pleasant humor at
being kept standing there shivering during the long delay.
The grumbling went on between them until at last the old
cadet punched the little fellow in front of him in the ribs,
and butted him with his knees, until he began to cry. The
boy's name was Logan. He was no match for his antagonist.
It was a mean piece of bullying and such as no old
cadet had the right to indulge in. The old cadet had been
there two years already, having been found deficient the
previous July; so that, while we were both now third-class
men, he had been an old cadet when I was a plebe. Our
class relations had been friendly enough, and at last I
ventured to remonstrate in a <sic corr="conciliatory">concilatory</sic> way with him
about his cruelty to Logan.</p>
        <p>To my surprise, he wheeled about and said: “What have
you got to do with it? Maybe you want to take the rat's
part. Ever since you came here, you have been that way.”
This was not true, for I had been a terror to plebes in
camp.</p>
        <p>“No,” I protested, still good-tempered. “But you
<pb id="wise280" n="280"/>
have no right to take his place in line, and he is too small to
defend himself.”</p>
        <p>“You're a liar!” he blurted out.</p>
        <p>“Don't say that,” said I. 
“You and I are friends. You don't
mean it, and will be sorry when you are cool.”</p>
        <p>“Yes, I do mean it!” shouted he. 
“You are a liar; and you
sneaked out of the first row you got into when you came
here.”</p>
        <p>He proceeded no further in that story. I popped him in the
eye with the best left-hander I could plant; and at it we went,
like a pair of jack-snappers, the plebes dancing about in
wonder. He had a great reach. He fetched me several very
substantial cracks. Nevertheless, the first blow I hit him
gave me a decided advantage, and I succeeded in closing
with him and getting his head in chancery. Thus holding
him, I punched his nose and eyes and mouth in fine form;
but, in spite of all I could do, I felt his long, sinewy arm steal
up my back, and his fingers close with a choking grip upon
my collar. Hug! I hugged his head with all my might and
main, as he tugged to extricate himself.</p>
        <p>“Stop that noise on fourth stoop!” shouted the sentry in
the area, time and time again; but we were too busy to pay
attention to his commands. We were panting like two young
bucks with locked horns. Renewing the whacking at his head
under my arm, I asked, “Have you got enough?” I knew he
did not have enough. Still I thought it would do no harm to
inquire.</p>
        <p>“No!” roared he; “I'll give <hi rend="italics">you</hi> enough before this thing
is over.” With that I slung him around and tried to throw
him; but his bow-legs seemed set as firmly as the towers of
the arch. I not only found that he could stand punishment,
but that he had the advantage of me in wind.</p>
        <pb id="wise281" n="281"/>
        <p>The sentinel shouted for the officer of the day, and the
two commanded, “Stop that noise in barracks!” as if their
throats would burst. At last, with a supreme effort, he
dragged himself out from under my arm, whirled me
about, seized me by the hair with both hands, dashed me
down to my knees, bumped my head upon the frozen oak
planks, and kicked me in the face. I saw a thousand stars.
The poor little rats were almost frantic.</p>
        <p>“Got enough, eh?” said he ironically, as, panting from his
triumphant efforts, he planted me a savage uppercut under
the arm with which I was trying to protect my face. “Maybe
<hi rend="italics">you've</hi> got enough now?”</p>
        <p>“Not much!” said I, trying to tear loose from his grip on
my hair; but down I went again, for he overmatched me.
Whack, hack, thump, bang! he began afresh. I'm glad I
don't have to tell how that fight ended. Thank heaven, it
didn't end. Just as matters seemed growing desperate, the
officer of the day, with jangling sword, came bounding up
the stairway three steps at a time, and, rushing to where
we were clinched, he caught us in the collars and snatched
us apart. Holding us at arm's length, and looking at us
covered with blood, he commanded the peace, and ordered
us to our rooms.</p>
        <p>My adversary walked sulkily away. He was no beauty. He
had a bulging eye like a crab, and some of his teeth were
very loose. But I? My! oh, my! but I was a physical wreck.
My jacket, where I held his head so long, was fairly
soaked with gore. Two or three buttons were torn off, and
my collar was under one ear. The toe of his shoe had raked
off about an inch of skin from the ridge of my nose. A knot
as large as a pigeon's egg was on my forehead, and the last I
saw of him he was picking my hair off his fingers.
“Carried almost too many guns for you, didn't he?”
<pb id="wise282" n="282"/>
said Shafer, the officer of the day, as we descended to
together.</p>
        <p>With a sickly grin, I answered, “I don't know. I was doing
my best. But I'm mighty glad you came, Shafer.”</p>
        <p>Then the kind fellow, who evidently sympathized with
my side of the story, went with me to the room and helped
me wash up and preen my badly ruffled plumage. About
this time, we heard the tramp of the corps returning;
and Louis, who had heard some rumors at the archway,
rushed up to know what it was all about.</p>
        <p>“Here, take the pass-books. Hurry, and you'll get in line
in time. I broke up the waiting line,” said I.</p>
        <p>“Are you able to go?” asked he.</p>
        <p>“Of course I am. I'll go to the hospital with the sick-list
and get my nose patched by the time you finish at the store.
Hurry!” So off he darted, and I fell in at sick-call. Thirty
minutes later, we were scampering across the hills with our
guns,  -  I slightly disfigured by a long patch of adhesive
plaster on my nose, and wearing my cap well back, to avoid
contact with that pigeon egg on my forehead.</p>
        <p>And a great day we had of it. As if to compensate us for
our tribulations, we struck a flight of pigeons and found
numbers of squirrels. In fact, we killed so many that we
found it necessary to sling our game upon a pole which we
bore between us on our shoulders. When we appeared in
barracks, in ample time for dress-parade, we were the envy
of the corps. We sent a nice bunch of game to the
superintendent's wife. Considering the great number of
delinquencies for which we were to make answer Monday
morning to the commandant, we seriously debated whether
it would be counted as “boot-licking” if we sent some of our
game to the officers' mess. “Boot
<pb id="wise283" n="283"/>
licking,” or seeking favor with officers, was looked upon as a
heinous crime in our code of deportment. However, as old
Chinook belonged to the officers' mess, we concluded to let
them have a few. Then we secured permit for private
breakfast in the mess-hall Sunday morning, and
to visit old Judge at the kitchens to deliver our game
and make preliminary arrangements.</p>
        <p>With invitations sent to a few to our choice symposium
next morning, the day's work was complete. We made no
effort that night, rest assured, to keep lights up after
taps.</p>
        <p>We came out of our troubles better than we expected.
Shipp possessed excellent good sense in dealing with
cadets. He rather sympathized with our venial struggles to
provide ourselves with ammunition, and did not punish us
severely, but warned us against fetching fire into barracks.
Shafer, the cadet officer, who might have made it go hard
with my foeman and myself, saw him, told him he was
wrong, made him come and apologize to me, and after that
he and I were good friends. And last, but not least, little
Rat Logan, whose pretty sister I had visited in their home
at “Dungenness” upon the James, memory of whose
charms had probably made me take his part, came grinning
around to our quarters to tell us he had a box from home.
He said it was poor pay for the punishment I had got in his
behalf. I suggested that he invite my antagonist also; but
he swore he should not have as much as a wishbone from
his turkey. We made short shrift of Logan's box. With
bayonets we ripped it open. Its stores of turkey, ham,
biscuits, pickles, preserves, and what not were soon spread
before us.</p>
        <p>The best simile descriptive of cadets around a box from
home is that of feeding a kennel of hounds. With
undisguised impatience they watch the display of food.
<pb id="wise284" n="284"/>
With frank gluttony they fall upon it. With pop-eyed
satiety they turn away only when all is consumed. And then
they lie about in semi-comatose condition, refusing to
attend meals until nature relieves itself of overloading.</p>
        <p>Another piece of good luck was in store for me. I had kept
the pledge about demerits, and stood well at the
January intermediate examinations. One evening at dress
parade, I had the unspeakable joy of hearing myself
announced pounced as a corporal, “vice Vaughan, resigned.”
Those chevrons were very stimulating. I even remembered
that Napoleon had once been a corporal.</p>
      </div1>
      <div1 type="chapter">
        <pb id="wise285" n="285"/>
        <head>CHAPTER XIX</head>
        <head>THE MOST GLORIOUS DAY OF MY LIFE</head>
        <p>IN the spring of 1864, I was still a cadet at the Virginia
Military Institute. “Unrest” is the word to describe the
feeling pervading the school.</p>
        <p>Rosser's brigade had wintered in Rockbridge, but a few
miles from the Institute. Lexington and the Institute were
constantly visited by Rosser, his staff, and the officers of his
brigade. They brought us in touch with the war, and the
world beyond, more than anything else we had seen. They
jangled their spurs through the archway, laughed loudly in
the officers' quarters, and rode off as if they carried the
world in a sling. In March, they broke camp, and came
ambling, trotting, galloping, prancing past the Institute,
their mounted band playing, their little guidons fluttering,
bound once more to active duty in the lower valley. Before
their departure, General Rosser presented a captured flag
to the corps of cadets. His escort on the occasion was decked
with leaves of mountain laurel, the evergreen badge which
the brigade had adopted. We felt ashamed of having flags
captured for us by others. When the Laurel Brigade took its
departure, many a cadet followed it longingly with eyes and
heart.</p>
        <p>Then, too, we heard that Grant had been transferred to
command in the East; and we all knew that there would be
great fighting at the front. Many cadets resigned. Good
boys became bad boys for the express purpose of
<pb id="wise286" n="286"/>
getting “shipped,” parents and guardians having refused to
permit them to resign.</p>
        <p>The stage-coaches for the railroad stations at Goshen and
Staunton stopped at the sallyport on nearly every trip to take
on cadets departing for the front.</p>
        <p>Many a night, sauntering back and forth on the sentry
beat in front of barracks, catching the sounds of loud talk and
laughter from the officers' quarters, or pondering upon the last
joyous squad of cadets who had scrambled to the top of the
departing stage, my heart longed for the camp and I wondered
if my time would ever come. I was now over seventeen, and it
did seem to me that I was old enough.</p>
        <p>The proverb saith, “All things come to him who waits.”</p>
        <p>It was the 10th of May.</p>
        <p>Nature bedecked herself that springtime in her loveliest
garb. Battalion drill had begun early, and the corps had never
been more proficient at this season of the year.</p>
        <p>The parade ground was firm and green. The trees were
clothed in the full livery of fresh foliage. The sun shone on us
through pellucid air, and the light breath of May kissed and
fluttered our white colors, which were adorned with the face
of Washington.</p>
        <p>After going through the manœuvres of battalion drill, the
corps was drawn up, near sundown, for dress-parade. It was
the time of year when townsfolk drove down, and ranged
themselves upon the avenue to witness our brave display;
and groups of girls in filmy garments set off with bits of color
came tripping across the sod; and children and nurses sat
about the benches at the guard-tree.</p>
        <p>The battalion was put through the manual. The first
sergeants reported. The adjutant read his orders. The fifes
and drums played down the line in slow time, and came
back with a jolly, rattling air. The officers advanced
<pb id="wise287" n="287"/>
to music and saluted. The sun sunk beyond the
House Mountain. The evening gun boomed forth. The
garrison flag fell lazily from its peak on the barracks' tower.
The four companies went springing homeward at double time
to the gayest tune the fifes knew how to play. Never in all its
history looked Lexington more beautiful.</p>
        <p>Never did sense of secluded peacefulness rest more
soothingly upon her population. In our leisure time after
supper, the cadets strolled back and forth from barracks to
the limits gate, and watched the full-orbed moon lift herself
over the mountains. Perfume was in the air, silence in the
shadows. Well might we quote:  -  </p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“How beautiful this night!</l>
          <l>The bonniest sigh that vernal zephyrs breathe in evening's ear</l>
          <l>Were discord to the speaking quietude</l>
          <l>That wraps this moveless scene. Heaven's ebon vault,</l>
          <l>Bestudded with stars unutterably bright,</l>
          <l>Through which the moon's unclouded</l>
          <l>Splendor rolls, seems like a canopy which</l>
          <l>Love hath spread, to shelter its</l>
          <l>Sleeping world.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>And so, tranquil, composed by the delightful scenes
around us, three hundred of us closed our eyes and passed
into the happy dreams of youth in springtime.</p>
        <p>Hark! the drums are beating. Their throbbing bounds
through every corner of the barracks, saying to the sleepers,
“Be up and doing.” It is the long roll.</p>
        <p>Long roll had been beaten several times of late, sometimes
to catch absentees, and once for a fire in the town. Grumblingly
the cadets hurried down to their places in the ranks,
expecting to be soon dismissed and to return to their beds. A
group of officers, intently scanning by the light of a lantern a
paper held by the adjutant, stood near the statue of George
Washington, opposite the arch. The companies were marched
together. The adjutant
<pb id="wise288" n="288"/>
commanded attention, and proceeded to read the orders in
his hands.</p>
        <p>They announced that the enemy in heavy force was
advancing up the Shenandoah valley; that General Lee
could not spare any forces to meet him; that General
Breckinridge had been ordered to assemble troops from
southwestern Virginia and elsewhere at Staunton; and
that the cadets should join him there at the earliest
practicable  moment. The corps was ordered to march, with
four companies of infantry and a section of artillery, by the
Staunton pike, at break of day.</p>
        <p>First sergeants were ordered to detail eight artillerists
from each of the four companies, to report for duty
immediately, and man a section of artillery.</p>
        <p>As these orders were announced, not a sound was heard
from the boys who stood there, with beating hearts, in the
military posture of parade rest.</p>
        <p>“Parade's dismissed,” piped the adjutant. The
sergeants side-stepped us to our respective company
parades.</p>
        <p>Methinks that even after thirty-three years I once more
hear the gamecock voices of the sergeants detailing their
artillery and ammunition squads, and ordering us to
appear with canteens, haversacks, and blankets at
four A.M. Still silence reigned. Then, as company after
company broke ranks, the air was rent with wild cheering
at the thought that our hour was come at last.</p>
        <p>Elsewhere in the Confederacy, death, disaster,
disappointment may have by this time chilled the ardor of
our people, but here, in this little band of <sic corr="fledglings">fledgelings</sic>, the
hope of battle flamed as brightly as on the morning of
Manassas.</p>
        <p>We breakfasted by candle-light, and filled our
haversacks from the mess-hall tables. In the gray of
morning, we wound down the hill to the river, tramped
heavily
<pb id="wise289" n="289"/>
across the bridge, ascended the pike beyond, cheered the
fading turrets of the school; and sunrise found us going at a
four-mile gait to Staunton, our gallant little battery
rumbling behind.</p>
        <p>We were every way fitted for this kind of work by our
hard drilling, and marched into Staunton in the afternoon
of the second day, showing little ill effects of travel.</p>
        <p>Staunton, small as it is, seemed large and cosmopolitan
after our long confinement. As we marched past a female
school, every window of which was filled with pretty girls,
the fifes were laboring away at “The Girl I Left Behind
Me.” There was no need for the girls to cry, “Fie! fie!” at
such a suggestion. Not one of us were thinking of the girls
we left behind us. The girls we saw before us were
altogether to our liking.</p>
        <p>We found a pleasant camping ground on the outskirts of
the town, and thither the whole population docked for
inspection of the corps, and to witness dress parade, for our
fame was widespread. The attention bestowed upon the
cadets was enough to turn the heads of much humbler
persons than ourselves. We were asked to visit nearly every
house in town.</p>
        <p>Having an invitation to dine at the home of a friend,
Louis and I waded in a creek to wash the mud off our shoes
and trousers. With pocket-comb and glass we completed
our toilet in a fence-corner. Then we walked about until our
garments were dry, and proceeded to meet our engagement.
Everything goes in war time.</p>
        <p>At night, the town was hilarious. Several dances were
arranged, and, as dancing was a cadet accomplishment, we
were in our element.</p>
        <p>The adoration bestowed upon us by young girls disgusted
the regular officers. Before our coming, they had had things
all their own way. Now, they found that fierce
<pb id="wise290" n="290"/>
mustaches and heavy cavalry boots must give place to the
downy cheeks and merry, twinkling feet we brought from
Lexington. A big blonde captain, who was wearing a
stunning bunch of gilt aiguillettes, looked as if be would
snap my head off when I trotted up and whisked his
partner away from him. They could not and would not
understand why girls preferred these little, untitled 
whippersnappers to officers of distinction. Veterans forgot that
youth loves youth.</p>
        <p>Doubtless some feeling of this sort prompted the band
of a regiment of grimy veterans to strike up “Rock-a-bye,
Baby,” when the cadets marched by them. Quick as 
soldiers' love of fun, the men took up the air, accompanying
it by rocking their guns in their arms as if putting them to
sleep. It produced a perfect roar of amusement with
everybody but ourselves. We were furious.</p>
        <p>All this on the eve of a battle? Yes, of course. Why not?
To be sure, everybody knew there was going to be a fight.
That was what we came for. But nobody among us knew or
cared just when or where it was coming off. Life is too full of
trouble for petty officers or privates, or young girls, to
bother themselves hunting up such disagreeable 
details in advance. That was the business of generals.
They were to have all the glory; and so we were willing they
should have all the solicitude, anxiety and preoccupation.</p>
        <p>At dress parade, May 12, orders were read for the
movement of the army down the valley the following
morning. We always moved on time. Now, who would have
believed that a number of girls were up to see us off, or
that two or three were crying? Yet it was so. And quick
work of the naked boy with the cross-bow I call that.</p>
        <p>As we passed some slaughter-pens on the outskirts, an
old Irish butcher, in his shirt sleeves, hung over his gate,
<pb id="wise291" n="291"/>
pipe in mouth. With a twinkle in his eye he watched the
corps go by, at last exclaiming, “Begorra, an' it's no
purtier dhrove av pigs hev passed this gate since this
hog killing began.”</p>
        <p>We made a good day's march, and camped that night
near Harrisonburg. During the day, we met several
couriers bearing dispatches; they reported the enemy
advancing in heavy force, and had left him near Strasburg
and Woodstock.</p>
        <p>Pressing on through Harrisonburg, which we reached
early in the morning, we camped the second night at Lacy's
Springs, in Shenandoah; rain had set in, but the boys
stood up well to their work, and but few lame-ducks had
succumbed.</p>
        <p>Evidences of the approach of the enemy multiplied on the
second day. We passed a great many vehicles coming up
the valley with people and farm products and household
effects, and a number of herds of cattle and other
livestock, all escaping from the Union troops; now and then
a weary or wounded cavalryman came by. Their reports
were that Sigel's steady advance was only delayed by a
thin line of cavalry skirmishers, who had been ordered to
retard him as best they could until Breckinridge could
march his army down to meet him.</p>
        <p>Towards evening, we came to a stone church and spring,
here a cavalry detail with a squad of Union prisoners were
resting; the prisoners were a gross, surly-looking lot of
Germans, who could not speak English. They evidently
could not make us out; they watched us with manifest
curiosity, and talked in unintelligible, guttural sounds
among themselves.</p>
        <p>When we reached camp, the rain had stopped and the
clouds had lifted, but everything was wet and gummy. To
add to my disgust, I was detailed as corporal of the
<pb id="wise292" n="292"/>
guard, which meant loss of sleep at night, and a alone some
time next day with the wagons in rear of the corps.</p>
        <p>Looking down the valley, as evening closed in, we could
see a line of bivouac fires, and were uncertain whether they
were lit by our own pickets or by the enemy. At any rate, 
we were getting sufficiently near to the gentle
men for whom we were seeking to feel reasonably certain 
we should meet them.</p>
        <p>Night closed in upon us; for a little while the woodland
resounded with the axe-stroke, or the cheery halloos of the
men from camp-fire to camp-fire; for a while the fire-lights
danced, the air laden with the odor of cooking food; for a
while the boys stood around the camp-fires for warmth and
to dry their wet clothing; but soon all had wrapped their
blankets around them and laid down in silence, unbroken
save by the champing of the colonel's eel's horse upon his
provender, or the fall of a passing,
shower.</p>
        <p>I was on duty as corporal of the guard; a sentry stood
post near the pike; the remainder of the guard and the
musicians were stretched before the watch-fire asleep. It
was my part to remain awake, and a very lonesome, cheerless
task it was, sitting there in the darkness, under the
dancing shadows of the wide-spreading trees, watching the
fagots flame up and die out, speculating upon the events of
the morrow.</p>
        <p>An hour past midnight, the sound of hoofs upon the pike
caught my ear, and in a few moments the challenge of the
sentry summoned me. The newcomer was an aid-de-camp,
bearing orders for Colonel Shipp from the commanding
general. When I aroused the commandant he struggled up,
rubbed his eyes, muttered something about moving at once,
and ordered me to arouse the camp without having the
drums beaten. Orders to fall
<pb id="wise293" n="293"/>
in were promptly given, rolls were rattled off, the battalion I 
was formed, and we debauched upon the pike, heading in the
darkness and mud for Newmarket.</p>
        <p>Before the command to march was given, a thing
occurred which made a deep impression upon us all,  -  a
thing which even now may be a solace to those whose boys
died so gloriously that day. In the gloom of the night,
Captain Frank Preston, neither afraid nor ashamed to
pray, sent up an appeal to God for his protection of our
little band: it was a humble, earnest petition, that sunk
into the heart of every hearer. Few were the dry eyes, little
the frivolity, when he had ceased to speak of home, of
father, of mother, of country, of victory and defeat, of life, of
death, of eternity. Captain Preston had been an officer in
Stonewall Jackson's command; had lost an arm at
Winchester; was on the retired list; and was subprofessor
of Latin, and tactical officer of B Company:
he was a typical Valley Presbyterian. Those who, a few
hours later, saw him commanding his company in the
thickest of the fight, his already empty sleeve attesting
that he was no stranger to the perilous edge of battle,
realized fully the beauty of the lines which tell that “the
bravest are the tenderest, the loving are the daring.”</p>
        <p>Day broke gray and gloomy upon us toiling onward in the
mud. The sober course of our reflections was relieved by the
lightheartedness of the veterans. We overtook Wharton's
Brigade, with smiling “Old Gabe,” a Virginia Military
Institute boy, at their head. They were squatting by the
roadside, cooking breakfast, as we came up. With many
good-natured gibes they restored our confidence; they
seemed as merry, nonchalant, and indifferent to the coming
fight as if it were their daily occupation. A tall, round-
shouldered fellow, whose legs seemed almost split up to
his shoulder-blades, came among us
<pb id="wise294" n="294"/>
with a pair of shears and a pack of playing cards, offering | 
to take our names and cut off love-locks to be sent home after
we were dead; another inquired if we wanted rosewood
coffins, satin-lined, with name and age on the plate. In a
word, they made us ashamed of the depressing solemnity of
our last six miles of marching, and renewed within our
breasts the true dare-devil spirit of soldiery.</p>
        <p>Resuming the march, the mile-posts numbered four,
three, two, one mile to Newmarket; then the mounted
skirmishers hurried past us to their position at the front
We heard loud cheering at the rear, which was caught up by
the troops along the line of march. We learned its import as
General John C. Breckinridge and staff approached, and we
joined heartily in the cheering as that soldierly man,
mounted magnificently, galloped past, uncovered, bowing,
and riding like a Cid. It is impost impossible to exaggerate
the gallant appearance of General Breckinridge. In stature
he was considerably over six feet high. He sat his blood-bay
thoroughbred as if he had been born on horseback; his head
was of noble mould, and a piercing eye and a long, dark,
drooping mustache completed a faultless military
presence.</p>
        <p>Deployed along the crest of an elevation in our front, I we
could see our line of mounted pickets and the smouldering.
fires of their last night's bivouac. We halted at a point where
passing a slight turn in the road would bring us in full view
of the position of the enemy Echols's and Wharton's brigades
hurried past us; this time there was not much bantering
between us. “Forward!” was the word once more, and,
turning the point in the road, Newmarket was in full view,
and the whole position was displayed.</p>
        <p>At this point, a bold range of hills on the left parallel
<pb id="wise295" n="295"/>
with the mountains divided the Shenandoah valley into I
two smaller valleys; in the easternmost of these lies
Newmarket. The valley pike on which we had advanced
passes through the town parallel with the Massanunten
Mountains on our right, and Smith's Creek, coursing along its
base. The hills on our left, as they near the town, slope down to
it from south and west, and swell beyond it to the west and
north. Through this depression  from the town to the
Shenandoah River in the stern valley runs a transverse road with heavy stone
walls. Between the pike by which we were advancing and
the creek at the base of the mountains lies a beautiful
strip of meadowland, extending to and beyond the village of
Newmarket; on these meadows, in the outskirts of the
village, were orchards, where the enemy's skirmishers
were posted, his left wing being concealed in the village.
The right wing of the enemy was posted behind the heavy
stone fence in the road running westward from the town,
parallel with our line of battle. Behind the infantry,
on the slope of the rising ground, the Union
artillery was posted: the ground rose behind this position
until a short distance beyond the town; to the left
of the pike it spread out in an elevated plateau. The
hillsides from this plateau to the pike were broken by
several gullies, heavily wooded by scrub cedar.</p>
        <p>It was Sunday morning at eleven o'clock. In a picturesque
little Lutheran churchyard, under the very shadow
of the village spire and among the white tombstones, a
six-gun battery was posted in rear of the infantry lines
of the enemy. Firing over the heads of their own troops,
that battery opened upon us the moment we came in
in sight.</p>
        <p>Away off to the right, in the Luray Gap, we could see
our parallel signal corps telegraphing the position and numbers 
<pb id="wise296" n="296"/>
the enemy. Our cavalry was galloping to the cover of the
creek to attempt to turn the enemy's left flank. Echols's
brigade, moving from the pike at a double-quick by the
right flank, went into line of battle across the meadow. its
left resting on the pike. Simultaneously its skirmishers
were thrown forward at a run and engaged the enemy. Out
of the orchards and on the meadows, puff after puff of blue
smoke rose as the sharpshooters advanced, the pop, pop,
pop of their rifles ringing forth excitingly. Thundering  down
the pike came McLaughlin with his artillery. Wheeling out
upon the meadows, he swung into battery action left, and
let fly with all his guns.</p>
        <p>The cadet section of artillery pressed down the pike a
little farther, turned the left, toiled up the slope in front of
us, and, going into position, delivered a plunging fire in
reply to the Federal battery in the graveyard. We counted it
a good omen when, at the first discharge of our little guns, a
beautiful blue-white wreath of smoke shot upward and
hovered over them. The town, which a moment before had
seemed to sleep so peacefully upon that Sabbath morning,
was now wrapped in battle smoke and swarming with
troops hurrying to their position. We had their range
beautifully. Every shell hit some obstruction, and exploded
in the streets or on the hillsides. Every man in our army
was in sight. Every position of the enemy was plainly
visible. His numbers were uncomfortably large; for,
notwithstanding his line of battle already formed seemed
equal to our own, the pike beyond the town was still filled
with his infantry.</p>
        <p>Our left wing consisted of Wharton's brigade; our centre,
of the 62d Virginia infantry and the cadet corps; our right,
of Echols's brigade and the cavalry. Until now, as corporal
of the guard, I had remained in charge of the baggage-wagon
with a detail of three men,  -  
<pb id="wise297" n="297"/>
Redwood Stanard, and Woodlief. My orders were to
remain with the wagons at the bend in the pike unless we
were driven back. In that case, we were to retire to a
point of safety.</p>
        <p>When it was clear that the battle was imminent, one
thought took possession of me, and that was, if I sat on a
baggage wagon while the corps of cadets was in its first,
perhaps its only engagement, I should never be able to look
my father in the face again. He was a grim old fighter at that
moment resisting the advance on Petersburg, and holding
the enemy in check until Lee's army could come up. I had
annoyed him with importunities for permission to
leave the Institute and enter the army. If, now that I had
the opportunity to fight, I should fail to do so, I knew what
was in store for me, for he had a tongue of satire and
ridicule like a lash of scorpions.</p>
        <p>Napoleon in Egypt, pointing to the Pyramids, told his
soldiers that from their heights forty centuries looked
down upon them. The oration I delivered from the tailboard
of a wagon was not so hyperbolical, but was equally
emphatic. It ran about this wise: “Boys, the enemy is in our
front. The corps is going into action. I like fighting no better
than anybody else. But I have an enemy in my rear as
dreadful as any before us. If I should return home and tell
my father that I was on the baggage guard when the cadets
were in battle, I know what my fate would be. He would kill
me with ridicule, which is worse than bullets. I intend to
join the command at once. Any of you who think your duty
requires you to remain may do so.”</p>
        <p>All the guard followed. We left the wagon in charge of the
black driver. Of the four who thus went, one was tilled and
two were wounded. We overtook the battalion as it
deployed by the left flank from the pike. Moving
<pb id="wise298" n="298"/>
at double-quick, we were in an instant in line of battle our
right resting near the turnpike. Rising ground in our
immediate front concealed us from the enemy.</p>
        <p>The command was given to strip for action. Knapsacks
sacks, blankets,  -  everything but guns, canteens, and
cartridge-boxes, was thrown upon the ground. Our boys
were silent then. Every lip was tightly drawn, eve cheek
was pale, but not with fear. With a peculiar, nervous jerk, we
pulled our cartridge-boxes round to the front, laid back the
flaps, and tightened belts. Whistling rifled shells screamed
over us, as, tipping the hill-crest in our front, they bounded
past. To our right, across the pike, Patton's brigade was
lying down abreast of us.</p>
        <p>“At-ten-<hi rend="italics">tion-n-n!</hi> Battalion forward! Guide center-r-r!”
shouted Shipp, and up the slope we started. From the left of
the line, Sergeant-Major Woodbridge ran out and posted
himself forty paces in advance of the colors as directing
guide, as if we had been upon the drill ground. That boy
would have remained there, had not Shipp ordered him
back to his post; for this was no dress parade. Brave Evans,
standing six feet two, shook out the colors that for days had
hung limp and bedraggled about the staff, and every cadet
leaped forward, dressing to the ensign, elate and thrilling
with the consciousness that this was war.</p>
        <p>Moving up to the hill crest in our front, we were abreast
of our smoking battery, and uncovered to the range of the
enemy's guns. We were pressing towards him at “arms
port,” moving with the light tripping gate of the French
infantry. The enemy's veteran artillery soon obtained our
range, and began to drop his shells under our very noses
along the slope. Echols's brigade rose up, and was charging
on our right with the well known rebel yell.</p>
        <pb id="wise299" n="299"/>
        <p>Down the green slope we went, answering the wild cry of
our comrades as their muskets rattled out in opening
volleys. “Double time!” shouted Shipp, and we broke
a long trot. In another moment, a pelting rain of lead
would fall upon us from the blue line in our front.</p>
        <p>Then came a sound more stunning than thunder. It burst
directly in my face: lightnings leaped, fire flashed, the earth
rocked, the sky whirled round. I stumbled, my gun pitched
forward, and I fell upon my knees. Sergeant Cabell looked
back at me pityingly and called out, “Close up, men!” as
he passed on. I knew no more.</p>
        <p>When consciousness returned, the rain was falling in
torrents. I was lying upon the ground, which all about was
torn and ploughed with shell, and they were still screeching
in the air and bounding on the earth. Poor little Captain
Hill, the tactical officer of C Company, was lying near me
bathed in blood, with a frightful gash over the temple, and
was gasping like a dying fish. Cadets Reed, Merritt, and
another, whose name I forget, were near at hand, badly shot.
The battalion was three hundred yards in advance of us,
clouded in low-lying smoke and hotly engaged. They had
crossed the lane which the enemy had held, and the Federal
battery in the graveyard had fallen back to the high ground
beyond. “How came they there?” I thought, “and why am I
here?” Then I found I was bleeding from a long and ugly
gash in the head. That rifled shell, bursting in our faces, had
brought down five of us. “Hurrah!” I thought, “youth's
dream is realized at last. I've got a wound, and am not dead
yet.”</p>
        <p>Another moment found me on my feet, trudging along
to the hospital, almost whistling at thought that the next
mail would carry the news to the folks at home, with a
taunting suggestion that, after all the pains they had
<pb id="wise300" n="300"/>
taken, they had been unable to keep me out of my share in the
fun. From this time forth, I may speak of the gallant behavior
of the cadets without the imputation of vanity, for I was no
longer a participant in their glory.</p>
        <p>The fighting around the town was fierce and bloody on our
left wing. On the right, the movements of Echols and Patton
were very effective. They had pressed forward and gained
the village, and our line was now concave, with its angle just
beyond the town.</p>
        <p>The Federal infantry had fallen back to the second line, and
our left had now before it the task of ascending the slope to
the crest of the hill where the enemy was posted. After
pausing under the cover of the deep lane to breathe awhile
and correct the alignment, our troops once more advanced,
clambering up the bank and over the stone fence, at once
delivering and receiving a withering fire.</p>
        <p>At a point below the town where the turnpike makes a bend,
the cavalry of the enemy was massed. A momentary
confusion on our right, as our troops pressed through the
streets of Newmarket, gave invitation for a charge of the
Union cavalry. They did not see McLaughlin's battery,
which had been moved up, unlimbered in the streets, and
double-shotted with grape and canister. The enemy's cavalry
dashed forward in column of platoons. Our infantry scrambled
over the fences and gave the artillery a fair opportunity to rake
them. They saw the trap too late; they drew up and sought to
wheel about.</p>
        <p>Heavens! what a blizzard McLaughlin gave them! They
staggered, wheeled, and fled. The road was filled with fallen
men and horses. A few riderless steeds came galloping
towards our lines, neighed, circled, and rejoined their
comrades. One daring fellow, whose horse became
unmanageable, rode straight at our battery at full speed,
<pb id="wise301" n="301"/>
passed beyond, behind, and around our line, and safely
rejoined his comrades, cheered for his courage by his enemies.
This was the end of the cavalry in that fight.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, the troops upon our left performed their allotted
task. Up the slope, right up to the second line of infantry, they
went; a second time the Federal troops were forced to retire.
Wharton's brigade secured two guns of the battery, and the
remaining four galloped back to a new position in a farmyard
on the plateau, at the head of the cedar-skirted gully. Our boys
had captured over one hundred prisoners. Charlie Faulkner,
now the Senator from West Virginia, came back radiant in
charge of twenty-three Germans large enough to swallow him,
and insisted that he and Winder Garrett had captured them
unaided. Bloody work had been done. The space between the
enemy's old and new position was dotted with dead and
wounded, shot as they retired across the open field, but this
same exposed ground now lay before, and must be crossed by
our own men, under a galling fire from a strong and well-
protected position. The distance was not great, but the ground
to be traversed was a level green field of young wheat.</p>
        <p>Again the advance was ordered. Our boys responded with a
cheer. Poor fellows! They had already been put upon their
mettle in two assaults, exhausted, wet to the skin, muddy to
their eyebrows with the stiff clay; some of them actually
shoeless after struggling across the ploughed field: they,
notwithstanding, advanced with tremendous earnestness, for
the shout on our right advised them that the victory was
being won.</p>
        <p>But the foe in our front was far from whipped. As the cadets
came on with a dash, he stood his ground most courageously.
The battery, now shotted with shrapnel and canister, opened
upon the cadets with a murderous
<pb id="wise302" n="302"/>
fire. The infantry, lying behind fence-rails piled upon the
ground, poured in a steady, deadly volley. At one discharge,
Cabell, first sergeant of D Company, by whose side I had
marched for months, fell dead, and with him fell Crockett and
Jones. A blanket would have covered the three. They were
awfully mangled by the canister. A few steps further on,
McDowell sank to his knees with a bullet through his heart.
Atwill, Jefferson, and Wheelwright were shot at this point.
Sam Shriver, cadet captain of C Company, had his sword
arm broken by a minie ball. Thus C Company lost her cadet as
well as her professor captain.</p>
        <p>The men were falling right and left. The veterans on the
right of the cadets seemed to waver. Colonel Shipp went
down. For the first time, the cadets appeared irresolute. Some
one cried out, “Lie down!” and all obeyed, firing from the
knee,  -  all but Evans, the ensign, who was standing bolt
upright, shouting and waving the flag. Some one exclaimed,
“Fall back and rally on Edgar's battalion!” Several boys
moved as if to obey. Pizzini, first sergeant of B Company, with
his Corsican blood at the boiling point, cocked his rifle and
proclaimed that he would shoot the first man who ran. Preston,
brave and inspiring, in command of B Company, smilingly lay
down upon his remaining arm with the remark that he would at
least save that. Colonna, cadet captain of D, was speaking
low to the men of his company with words of encouragement 
and bidding them shoot close. The corps was being
decimated.</p>
        <p>Manifestly, they must charge or fall back. And charge it
was; for at that moment Henry Wise, “Old Chinook,” beloved
of every boy in the command, sprang to his feet and shouted
out the command to rise up and charge, and moving in
advance of the line, led the cadet corps, forward
<pb id="wise303" n="303"/>
to the guns. The battery was being served superbly. The
musketry fairly rolled, but the cadets never faltered. They
reached the firm greensward of the farmyard in which the
guns were planted. The Federal infantry began to break and
run behind the buildings. Before the order to limber up could
be obeyed by the artillerymen, the cadets disabled the teams,
and were close upon the guns. The gunners dropped their
sponges, and sought safety in flight. Lieutenant Hannah
hammered a gunner over the head with his cadet sword.
Winder Garret outran another and lunged his bayonet into
him. The boys leaped upon the guns, and the battery was
theirs. Evans, the color-sergeant, stood wildly waving the
cadet colors from the top of a caisson.</p>
        <p>A straggling fire of infantry was still kept up from the gully
now on our right flank, notwithstanding the masses of blue
retiring in confusion down the hill. The battalion was ordered
to reform, mark time, and half wheel to the right; then it
advanced, firing into the cedars as it went, and did not pause
again until it reached the pike, having driven the last of the
enemy from the thicket. The broken columns of the enemy
could be seen hurrying over the hills and down the pike
towards Mount Jackson, hotly pressed by our infantry and
cavalry. Our artillery galloped to Rude's Hill, whence it
shelled the flying foe until they passed beyond the burning
bridge that spanned the Shenandoah at Mount Jackson.</p>
        <p>We had won a victory,  -  not a Manassas or an
Appomattox, but, for all that, a right comforting bit of news
went up the pike that night to General Lee, whose thoughts,
doubtless, from where he lay locked in the
death grapple with Grant in the Wilderness, turned wearily
and anxiously towards this attempted flank movement
in the valley.</p>
        <pb id="wise304" n="304"/>
        <p>The pursuit down the pike was more like a foot race than a
march; our fellows straggled badly; everybody realized that
the fight was over, and many were too exhausted to proceed
farther.</p>
        <p>As evening fell, the clouds passed away, the sun came
forth; and, when night closed in, no sound disturbed the
Sabbath calm save that of a solitary Napoleon gun pounding
away at the smouldering ruins of the bridge. Our picket-fires
were lit that night at beautiful Mount Airy, while the main
body of our troops bivouacked on the pike, a mile below
Newmarket. Out of a corps of 225 men, we had lost fifty-six,
killed and wounded. Strange to say, but one man of the
artillery detail received a wound. Shortly before sundown,
after having my head sewed up and bandaged, and having
rendered such service as I could to wounded comrades, I
sallied forth to procure a blanket and see what was to be seen.
When we stripped for action we left our traps unguarded;
nobody would consent to be detailed. As a result, the camp-
followers had made away with nearly all of our blankets.</p>
        <p>I entered the town, and found it filled with soldiers'
laughing and carousing as light-heartedly as if it was a feast
or a holiday. In a side street, a great throng of Federal
prisoners was corralled; they were nearly all Germans. Every
type of prisoner was there; some cheerful, some defiant, some
careless, some calm and dejected. One fellow in particular
afforded great merriment by his quaint recital of the manner of
his capture. Said he, “Dem leetle tevils mit der vite vlag vas
doo mutch fur us; dey shoost smash mine head ven I was cry
zurrender all de dime.” A loud peal of laughter went up from
the bystanders, among whom I recognized several cadets. His
allusion to the white flag was to our colors. We
<pb id="wise305" n="305"/>
had a handsome corps flag, with a white and gold ground and
a picture of Washington; it disconcerted our adversaries not a
little. Several, whom I have met since then, tell me that they
could not make us out at all, as our strange colors, diminutive
size, and unusual precision of movement made them think we
must be some foreign mercenary regulars.</p>
        <p>While standing there, my old partner Louis came running
up, exclaiming, “Holloa! Golly, I am glad it is no worse; they
said your head was knocked off.” Then he held up his
bandaged forearm, in which he had a pretty little wound. 
“Say, are you hungry? There is an old lady round here on the
back street just shoveling out pies and things to the
soldiers.”</p>
        <p>Louis and I were both good foragers, so away we
scampered, and relieved the dear old soul of a few more of her
apparently inexhaustible supply. Then we started off to hunt
up Henry. We had a good joke on him, but were afraid to tell it
to him. Several of the cadets declared that, notwithstanding
his piety, he had at the pinch in the wheatfield, when he
ordered the charge, so far forgotten himself that he used
some very plain old English expletives, as in days of yore.
When we ventured to suggest it, he grew indignant, and he
was such a serious fellow that we were afraid to press him
about it; when we found him, he gave us lots of sport. He was
very tall and very thin. He had gone into action wearing the
long-tailed coat of a Confederate captain. In the last
charge, an unexploded canister had literally carried away his
hind coat-tails and the pipe and tobacco in the pockets,
without touching him. Probably he was so close to the guns
that the bands of the canister had not burst when it passed
him. However this may have been, when we found him, his
coat-tails were hanging in short shreds
<pb id="wise306" n="306"/>
behind, while in front they were intact. He was involuntarily
feeling behind him, bemoaning the loss of his pipe and
tobacco, and looked like a Shanghai rooster with his tail-
feathers pulled out.</p>
        <p>The jeers and banterings of the veterans had now ceased;
we had fairly won our spurs. We could mingle with them
fraternally and discuss the battle on equal terms: glorious
fellows those veterans were. To them was due ninety-nine one-
hundredths of the glory of the victory, yet they seemed to
delight in giving all praise to “dem leetle tevils mit der vite
vlag.” The ladies of the place also overwhelmed us with
tenderness, and as for ourselves, we drank in greedily the
praise which made us the lions of the hour.</p>
        <p>Leaving the village, we sought the plateau where most of
our losses had occurred. A little above the town, in the fatal
wheatfield, we came upon the dead bodies of three cadets; one
wearing the chevrons of a first sergeant lay upon his face, stiff
and stark, with outstretched arms. His hands had clutched and
torn up great tufts of soil and grass. His lips were retracted; his
teeth tightly locked; his face as hard as flint, with staring,
glassy eyes. It was difficult indeed to recognize that this was
all that remained of Cabell, who a few hours before had stood
first in his class, second as a soldier, and the peer of any boy in
the command in every trait of physical and moral manliness. A
short distance removed from the spot where Cabell fell, and
nearer to the position of the enemy, lay McDowell. It was a
sight to rend one's heart! That little fellow was lying there
asleep, more fit indeed for a cradle than a grave; he was about
my own age, not large, and by no means robust. He was a
North Carolinian; he had torn open his jacket and shirt, and
even in death, lay clutching them back, exposing a
<pb id="wise307" n="307"/>
fair, white breast with its red wound. We had come too late:
Stanard had breathed his last but a few moments before we
reached the old farmhouse where the battery had stood, now
used as a hospital. His body was still warm, and his last
messages had been words of love to his room-mates. Poor
Jack,  -  playmate, room-mate, friend,   -  farewell! 
Standing there, my mind sped back to the old
scenes at Lexington when we were shooting together in the
brushy hills; to our games and sports; to the night we had
gone to see him kneel at the chancel for confirmation; to the
previous night at the guard-fire, when he confessed to a
presentiment that he would be killed; to his wistful, earnest
farewell when we parted at the baggage-wagon that morning;
and my heart half reproached me for my part in drawing him
into the fight. The warm tears of youthful friendship came
welling up to the eyes of both of us for one we had learned to
love as a brother; and now, thirty-four years later, I thank God
life's buffetings and the cold-heartedness of later struggles
have not yet diminished the pure evidence of boyhood's
friendship. A truer-hearted, braver, better fellow never lived
than Jacquelin B. Stanard.</p>
        <p>A few of us brought up a limber chest, threw our dead
across it, and bore their remains to a deserted storehouse in
the village. The next day, we buried them with the honors of
war, bowed down with grief at a victory so dearly bought.</p>
        <p>The day following that, we started on our return march up
the valley, crestfallen and dejected. The joy of victory was
forgotten in distress for the friends and comrades
dead and maimed. We were still young in the
ghastly game, but we proved apt scholars.</p>
        <p>On our march up the valley, we were not hailed as sorrowing
friends, but greeted as heroes and victors. At
<pb id="wise308" n="308"/>
Harrisonburg, Staunton, Charlottesville,  -  everywhere an
ovation awaited us such as we had not dreamed of and such
as has seldom greeted any troops. The dead and the poor
fellows still tossing on cots of fever and delirium were almost
forgotten by the selfish comrades whose fame their blood
had bought. We were ordered to Richmond: all our sadness
disappeared. What mattered it to us that we were packed into
freight-cars? it was great sport riding on the tops of the cars.
We were sidetracked at Ashland, and there, lying on the
ground by the side of us, was Stonewall Jackson's division.
We had heard of them, and looked upon them as the greatest
soldiers that ever went into battle. What flattered us most was
that they had heard of us.</p>
        <p>While waiting at Ashland, a very distinguished looking
surgeon entered the car, inquiring for some cadet. He was just
returning from the battlefield of Spotsylvania. I heard with
absorbed interest his account of the terrible carnage there;
and when he said he had seen a small tree within the “bloody
angle” cut down by bullets, I turned to Louis and said, “I
think that old fellow is drawing a longbow.” The person
speaking was Dr. Charles McGill. I afterwards learned that
what he said was literally true.</p>
        <p>At the very time when we were lying there at Ashland, the
armies of Grant and Lee, moving by the flank, were passing
the one all about us, the other within a few miles of us, from the
battlefields of Spotsylvania Court House and Milford Station
to their ghastly field of second Cold Harbor. We could
distinctly hear the firing in our front. We reached Richmond
that afternoon, and were quartered in one of the buildings of
the Fair Grounds, known as Camp Lee. It is impossible to
describe the enthusiasm with which we were received.
<pb id="wise309" n="309"/>
A week after the battle of Newmarket, the cadet corps,
garlanded, cheered by ten thousand throats, intoxicated with
praise unstinted, wheeled proudly around the Washington
monument at Richmond, to pass in review before the President
of the Confederate States, to hear a speech of commendation
from his lips, and to receive a stand of colors from the
Governor of Virginia.</p>
        <p>No wonder that our band, as we marched back to our
quarters, played lustily:  -  </p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“ There's not a trade that's going</l>
          <l>Worth showing or knowing, </l>

          <l>For the bowld soldier boy. </l>

        <head>CHAPTER XX</head>
        <head>THE GRUB BECOMES A BUTTERFLY</head>
        <p>AFTER a few days in Richmond, the cadets were ordered
back to Lexington. We resumed academic duties promptly,
and were just beginning to settle down to hard work, when
General Hunter advanced up the valley of the Shenandoah,
unopposed save by a small cavalry force under General
McCausland.</p>
        <p>McCausland was another Virginia Military Institute
graduate. “Well,” said we, when we heard the news, “we'll
have to whip 'em again.” But this time the story was to be
very different from the last. Following almost immediately
upon the heels of the first announcement came the alarming
statement that Hunter had reached Staunton, but thirty-six
miles to the north of us; and the next day we were advised
that he had not paused in Staunton, but pressed on, and that
his advance was skirmishing with McCauseland at Midway, but twelve
miles from Lexington.</p>
        <p>Resistance to a force like Hunter's being out of the
question, we were ordered to prepare for the evacuation of
Lexington. A detail of sappers was sent forthwith to the
bridge across the North River, with directions to load it with
bales of hay saturated with turpentine, leaving space just
sufficient for the passage of McCausland's retreating forces.
We were kept under arms all night. Before sunrise, the main
body of our troops came stream streaming down the hills
across the river; and, half a mile 
<pb id="wise311" n="311"/>
behind them, their rear guard emerged from the woods along
the hill-tops, skirmishing with, and hotly pressed by, the
enemy. At the river, after crossing the bridge, McCausland
deployed a force upon the bluffs above and below the bridge,
to cover the crossing of his rear guard.</p>
        <p>The rear guard, called in, rallied at a run to the bridge, and
the Union skirmishers, emboldened by their quick movements,
dashed after them down the hills. Coming too near to the force
behind the bluffs, they were compelled to retreat under a
heavy fire upon Hunter's advance guard, which was now
coming up. A battery of Union artillery, under Captain Henry
Du Pont, galloped out upon the hills overlooking Lexington
from the north side of the river, and opened fire upon the
Institute. A section of McCausland's artillery came up, after
crossing the bridge, and took position at the northeast corner
of the parade ground to respond to Du Pont. As soon as our
troops were across the bridge, it was fired, and a fine column
of black smoke rolled heavenward. Our sappers, their task
performed, hurried back at double time to rejoin their
respective companies. Along the pike in the valley in front of
the Institute, the cavalry, weary and depressed, was retiring to
the town.</p>
        <p>The whole panorama, front and rear, was visible from the
Institute grounds, and made a very pretty war scene.</p>
        <p>When the Union battery opened, the corps was drawn up in
front of barracks awaiting orders. It was, of course, invisible
to the enemy from his position directly in rear of barracks. If
his guns had been aimed at the centre of the building, his
shells would have exploded in our midst. But the massive
parts were at the corners, where the towers were grouped, and
thither the fire was directed. The first shell that struck crashed
in the hall of the Society of Cadets, sending down showers of
brickbats and
<pb id="wise312" n="312"/>
plaster when it exploded. Thereupon we were ordered to pass
over the parapet in front of barracks, and thence were marched
westward until clear of the building, so as to avoid the
splinters and debris. It was very well, for while several of his
guns turned their attention to our section of artillery on the
parade ground, Captain Harry filled the air with fragments as
he pounded away at our quarters.</p>
        <p>In our new position under the parapet, about opposite the
guard-tree, although fully protected, we were nearly in the line
of fire of the shots directed at our battery. A number of shells
struck the parade ground, some exploding there, and others
ricocheting over our heads.</p>
        <p>Soon after this we marched away. As we were leaving, the
artillery was limbering up, and the only force opposing the
entrance of the enemy was the thin line of skirmishers on the
river bluffs.</p>
        <p>With heavy hearts we passed through the town, bidding,
adieu to such of its residents as we had known in happier
days. Our route was southward to Balcony Falls, which we
reached late that evening. At a high point, probably five miles
south of Lexington, we came in full sight of our old home. The
day was bright and clear, and we saw the towers and turrets of
the barracks, mess-hall, and professors' houses in full
blaze, sending up great masses of flame and smoke. The only
building on the entire reservation not destroyed by fire was
the residence of General Smith. His daughter was very ill, and
as the physicians declared it would cost her life to remove her,
the house was spared through the intercession of Colonel Du
Pont. </p>
        <p>No words could describe our feelings as we rested on the
roadside, and watched the conflagration. The place was
endeared by a thousand memories, but above all other
<pb id="wise313" n="313"/>
thoughts, it galled and mortified us that we had been
compelled to abandon it without firing a shot.</p>
        <p>Thinking that the enemy might follow us and attempt to
reach Lynchburg through the pass at Balcony Falls, our
commandant determined, if that should prove to be the
purpose of General Hunter, to offer resistance there, for it was
a very defensible position. Accordingly, upon reaching
Balcony Falls, pickets were posted, the corps was deployed
along the mountain side, and we were held ready for a fight all
that night and until late in the following day. Then we
ascertained that General Hunter had passed on up the valley
to the approaches of Lynchburg by way of the Peaks of Otter.
We impressed a canal-boat, and resumed our journey to
Lynchburg, reaching there some hours in advance of the
enemy. On our arrival, Early's division was pouring into the
town, having just arrived by rail from Petersburg. It was
hurried forward to the fortifications in the outskirts.</p>
        <p>We remained in the streets of the town several hours,
awaiting orders, and were finally sent to the front in reserve.</p>
        <p>Our position was in a graveyard. The afternoon we spent
there, sitting upon graves and among tombstones in a cold,
drizzling rain, was anything but cheerful.</p>
        <p>The enemy, unaware of the presence of Early's division
advanced to a brisk attack with infantry and artillery.
Although he was roughly handled, the assault continued until
dark, and he had pressed up very close to a salient in our
front, at a point near the present residence of Mr. John
Langhorne. A renewal of the attack on the following morning
was confidently expected. About ten o'clock that night,
orders came for the cadets to move to the front to relieve the
troops in the salient, who had been fighting since midday.
<pb id="wise314" n="314"/>
When the corps was formed in line, Colonel Shipp, in
low tones, explained the nature of the service, and the
importance of silence. We were warned not to speak,
and, as the night was very black, each man was instructed
to place his left hand upon the cartridge-box of the man
in front of him, so as to keep distance and alignment.
Thus formed, we proceeded to the bastion, and entered it
in gloomy silence. The troops occupying it were drawn
up as we entered, and glided out after we were in, like the
shadows of darkness.</p>
        <p>The place was horrible. The fort was new, and constructed 
of stiff red clay. The rain had wet the soil, and
the feet of the men who had been there had kneaded the
mud into dough. There was no place to lie down. All
that a man could do was to sit plump down in the mud,
upon the low banquette, with his gun across his lap. I
could not resist peeping over the parapet, and there, but
a short distance from us, in a little valley, were the smouldering 
camp-fires of the enemy. Wrapping my blanket
about me, its ends tucked under me, so as to keep out the
moisture from the red clay as much as possible, I fell
asleep, hugging my rifle, never doubting that there would
be work for both of us at daybreak.</p>
        <p>I must have slept soundly, for when I awoke it was
broad daylight. The men were beginning to talk aloud,
and several were exposing themselves freely. No enemy
appeared in our front. He was gone. Hunter, discovering 
that he was overmatched, had retired during the
night, and was now in full retreat.</p>
        <p>Lexington was now accessible to us once more, and
thither we proceeded in a day or two.</p>
        <p>On our return to Lexington, we temporarily quartered
in Washington College. Nothing worth having was left
of the Virginia Military Institute. The scene was one of
<pb id="wise315" n="315"/>
such complete desolation, and so depressing, that I avoided
it as much as possible.</p>
        <p>We were furloughed until September 1, and ordered to
report at that time at the almshouse in Richmond.</p>
        <p>This apparently absurd announcement was another illustration 
of the resourcefulness of General Smith. The city
of Richmond had a very fine almshouse, but at this period
of the war all our people were paupers, and the city could
not maintain the almshouse. Knowing this, General
Smith had opened telegraphic correspondence from Lynchburg 
with the Richmond authorities, and secured the place
free of rent.</p>
        <p>For myself, I now saw a chance of entering the service
and had no idea of going to live in an almshouse. My
objective point was Petersburg, where my father's brigade
was stationed. He was in command of the city, having
been engaged with the enemy almost daily since his arrival
from South Carolina in May. Against overwhelming
odds, Beauregard had held the place until the arrival of
General Lee.</p>
        <p>It was about sundown on the 22d of June, 1864, that our
train from Richmond stopped in a deep cut about a mile
frown Petersburg. We could not safely approach nearer
to the city. When General “Baldy” Smith, with 22,000
men, attacked my father with 2200 men on the 15th of
June, he captured several redoubts, numbered from 5 to 9,
near the Appomattox River, just below Petersburg. From
these, with his siege-guns, he could shell the town, and
particularly the railroad depot and the Pocahontas Bridge
nearby across the Appomattox. As a consequence, the
trains stopped at a point of safety, whence passengers
could take a back route to the town, or go by way of the
railroad without attracting attention. The disagreeable
persons at the captured batteries soon ascertained the railroad 
<pb id="wise316" n="316"/>
schedules, and shelled the vicinity of the depot about
train time.</p>
        <p>Soldiers had become accustomed to shells, and did not
fear them much; so our party, consisting of several members 
of my father's brigade, followed the short route, not
withstanding quite a lively artillery fire. We crossed the
bridge at Pocahontas without incident. The firing seemed
directed higher up town. Passing on to Bolingbroke
Street, we saw evidences of recent damage in a great hole
made by a shell in the Bolingbroke Hotel, but a few
moments before, and a dead man was lying on the curb
stone near where the shell had exploded. Turning into
Bolingbroke Street, which ran nearly parallel with the line
of fire from Battery 5, two heavy shells went screaming
over our heads, and burst near where Bolingbroke Street
terminates in Sycamore Street. It was a decided relief
when we reached the latter, and struck off at right angles
from the range of those guns. The official headquarters
were in the court house, which, while it was in the line of
fire, was protected by heavy masses of intervening buildings. 
Thither we repaired, but found they were closed
for the day.</p>
        <p>The appearance of the town was exceedingly depressing. 
The streets were almost deserted, and the destructive
work of the shells was visible on every hand. Here a
chimney was knocked off; here a handsome residence was
deserted, with great rents in its walls, and the windows
shattered by explosion; here stood a church tower mutilated, 
the churchyard filled with new-made graves. As
we moved onward, one of our party pointed to where
Colonel Page of our brigade was buried. He had been
killed but a week before, and was buried near the front
door of a church, within three feet of the sidewalk.  On
the court-house steps a group of dirty soldiers were gathered
<pb id="wise317" n="317"/>
about a poor little half-starved white girl, who sat
singing. She had an attractive face, with large, wistful
eyes, and a sweet child-voice. When she sang, her whole
soul was in her song, which seemed to be highly appreciated 
by the soldiers. They joined in the chorus after
each verse. I remember the name of the song, the first
verse, and the chorus, although I never heard them before
or since. It was called “Loula,” and ran as follows:  -  </p>
        <lg type="song">
          <l>“With a heart forsaken I wander</l>
          <l>In silence, in grief, and alone;</l>
          <l>On a form departed I ponder,</l>
          <l>For Loula, sweet Loula, is gone.</l>
          <lb/>
          <l>CHORUS.</l>
          <lb/>
          <l>“Gone where the roses have faded,</l>
          <l>Gone where the meadows are bare,</l>
          <l>To a land by orange-blossoms shaded,</l>
          <l>Where summer ever lingers in the air.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>The soldiers seemed deeply touched by the plaintive
melody, and joined with genuine feeling in the mournful
chorus. Its sadness was in accord with their own desperate 
situation. They made her repeat it several times, and,
when it was over, paid her in food, or such little trifles or
trinkets as they possessed,  -  not in money, for they had
none.</p>
        <p>About the song, the singer, the soldiers, the scene, and
its surroundings there was something intensely pathetic
and depressing, and I turned away with a heartsick feeling, 
not relieved by the silence and desolation along the
route to my father's quarters at the residence of a Mr.
Dunlop in the western part of the town. I found him in
the act of going to tea with his staff, if a meal at which
there was neither tea nor coffee may be so designated.</p>
        <p>Our meeting after two years' separation  -  years in
which so much bad happened to both of us  -  was inexpressibly
delightful. In my father's greeting was blended
<pb id="wise318" n="318"/>
love for his “little Benjamin,” pride in recent events, and
solicitude concerning my fate in the dangerous present future.</p>
        <p>The two years of war since we parted showed their effects
upon him. He had aged decidedly. But his eye was as bright
and his spirit as unconquered as at the outset.</p>
        <p>We hugged and kissed each other as if I had been a boy of
ten, and then, turning to his staff and a visitor, he introduced
me as his boy, whose “head was so hard he had burst a bombshell
against it.” </p>
        <p>The evening being very warm, the tea-table was spread
under the trees in the Dunlop yard. Among those present
were: Colonel Roman, of Beauregard's staff, young Fred Fleet,
adjutant-general, my brother Richard, and Barksdale Warwick,
the two aids-de-camp. The conversation was jolly, and
the meal surprisingly inviting, for Lieutenant Warwick had
returned that day from a short leave of absence, bringing a
number of good things. My father occupied some
outbuildings, where his generous host, Mr. Dunlop, had
supplied him with knives, forks, plates, and table outfit, giving
our tea-table under the trees quite a luxurious appearance.
And there were my old companions, Joshua and Smith, two of
my father's young slaves, who performed all the offices of
grooms, butlers, and dining-room servants for the staff.
Lieutenant Warwick's Jim was the cook. As Joshua and Smith
appeared with plates and hot biscuits and a smoking pot of
parched-corn coffee, they broke into broad grins at sight of
me. Putting down their things unceremoniously; they rushed
up, exclaiming, “How you do, Mars' John?
Gord Amighty! how you is grow'd! Dey didn't hu't you much
when dey shot you, did dey?” When my father repeated his
joke about bursting a bombshell with my
<pb id="wise319" n="319"/>
head, they guffawed and said, “Spec' it's so, fur he certainly 
always did have a pow'ful hard head.” And then they hurried
off about their duties, reserving more confidential chats about
old times for later occasions when we should meet at the stables or
the kitchen.</p>
        <p>Although our beds were on the floor, the quarters were very
comfortable, with some features of decent living, such as
tables, chairs, and a few books. As we sat there, the picket-
firing along the lines from the Appomattox on the east to the
Salem plank road to the south of the city was unusually brisk,
making one think of corn rapidly popping. These sounds were
interspersed with exploding shells at intervals of less than a
minute, often as frequent as every few seconds. By stepping
out beyond the cover of the trees, we could see the trajectory
of the mortar-shells sent up from both sides. The burning
fuses gave us the line through the darkness. The firing
generally became more active in the evening. Our brigade was
already in the trenches, but my father, being still in command
of the city, had not yet joined his own command.</p>
        <p>“There has been heavy firing on the right this afternoon,
general,” said Colonel Roman.</p>
        <p>“Yes,” replied my father, “Grant is evidently trying to
extend his left as far as the Weldon Railroad. I met Mahone to-
day, who said that he and Wilcox were moving out to
intercept him. Whenever Mahone moves out, somebody is
apt to be hurt.”</p>
        <p>“Mahone is a Virginia Military Institute graduate,” said I,
with undisguised pride.</p>
        <p>“There he goes again,” said my father, smiling; “up to this
time we have had West Point, West Point, West Point. Now
we shall have Virginia Military Institute, Virginia Military
Institute, Virginia Military Institute,
I presume. But seriously speaking, colonel, since the
<pb id="wise320" n="320"/>
death of Stonewall Jackson, the two men who seem to me to
be the most gallant, enterprising, and ‘coming’ soldier of Lee's
army are this little fellow Mahone and young Gordon, of
Georgia.” He then proceeded to give a sketch of Mahone,
whom he knew well. Mahone was born in Southampton
County, at Jerusalem, the county seat. It was only about fifty
or sixty miles east of Petersburg. His father was known to
everybody in the county as Major Mahone, and kept the
tavern at Jerusalem. Keeping tavern did not imply that
he was not as good as anybody else in the community, and
in fact he was, although he may not have been of such
patrician extraction as some of the other people thereabouts.
He associated with the best of them, and they with him, and
he was respected as a man of many sterling good qualities,
possessed of strong individuality. Of Irish extraction, he
inherited the most prominent characteristics of his race; was
brave, open-hearted, free-spoken, a free liver, and not over-
prosperous.</p>
        <p>His son “Billy,” as everybody called him, grew up in the
atmosphere of a country tavern. He did not hesitate in his
youth to hold a horse for one of his father's guests, and take
a tip for the service. He saw a great deal of liquor drunk at his
father's bar, and a great deal of card playing in his father's
tavern. He was not, in his day, above taking in a tray of
toddies to the people in a private room playing draw poker, or
brag, or lou. He heard a great deal of hard swearing, and had
acquired that accomplishment 
himself. His youth was in the days of cock
fighting; and betting upon the result was by no means
deemed disreputable. He not only witnessed cocking mains
between the Virginia birds and those from Weldon and
vicinity in the adjoining counties of North Carolina but soon
had birds of his own, and scrupled not to fight them with all
comers, or to back them with all the means
<pb id="wise321" n="321"/>
he could command. It was the days of horse racing also, and
young “Billy” owned a crack quarter-nag, which he would
race with anybody for all he had, at any time and in any place.
He generally rode himself, for he was of very diminutive
stature. And he usually won, for he was a youngster of
precocious judgment, boundless enterprise, great ambition to
win at any game he played, and indomitable grit. He also had
the faculty of making friends, and interesting people in his
success. Everybody in Southampton County knew him, and
recognized in him elements of unusual power.</p>
        <p>His father was perhaps too much interested in his business
or his own diversions to concern himself overmuch about
Billy's education, but the subject did not escape a neighbor,
who had brought his influence to bear in favor of young,
Mahone. He was a state senator, with the right to appoint a
state cadet to the Virginia Military Institute. This meant that
the cadet so appointed received board and tuition free.
Interested in Billy, he persuaded his father and himself that he
ought not to waste his youth in dissipation and grow up in
ignorance, but should accept this appointment. Mahone was
prompt to do so. He entered the Institute, and graduated with
distinction at the age of twenty-one in the class of 1847. He
conscientiously performed the obligation which a state cadet
assumes, to teach school for three years after graduation;
and meanwhile made other powerful friends, who advanced
him in his subsequent career.</p>
        <p>At the Virginia Military Institute, he developed a decided
talent for engineering. Having completed his term as school
teacher, he secured a position as surveyor of a railroad running
from Alexandria, Va., to Orange
Court House. His talents were recognized; he was
promoted; and finally, through the influence mainly of
<pb id="wise322" n="322"/>
Colonel Francis Mallory, of Norfolk, he was made engineer
of a line from Norfolk to Petersburg. Here he was confronted
by the problem of securing a roadbed through the oozy
morasses of the Dismal Swamp. He solved the problem, built
the road, and made it straight as an arrow for sixty miles,
regardless of obstructions. His engineering methods
to obtain a solid roadbed on marshy ground, then pronounced
as impracticable, have now come to be accepted by the
profession as the best yet invented. He rose from position to
position, until, at the outbreak of the war, when but thirty-five
years old, he was president of the Norfolk and Petersburg
Railroad.</p>
        <p>He promptly formed, and was elected colonel of, the Sixth
Virginia Regiment, composed of the élite of Norfolk and
Petersburg, and, when that regiment was brigaded, was made
brigadier. Thenceforth, in every engagement in which it took
part, his command was conspicuous. In the peninsular and
Rappahannock campaigns, at second Manassas, in front of
Petersburg, his course was like the eagle's, “upward and
onward and true to the line,” and, after all his fighting and
losses, when Lee's army stacked arms at Appomattox,
Mahone's division had maintained its organization better, and
laid down more arms, than any in the Army of Northern
Virginia. The facts of his youth and the brilliancy of his career
up to date were that night the subject of conversation until the
visitors departed.</p>
        <p>We lay awake talking for some time after we retired. My
father recounted his hard fighting from June 15 to June 19
inclusive, in the effort to hold the city until General Lee's
arrival, and never seemed to tire of asking about the behavior
of the cadets, seeking ever to conceal his pride in our
achievements by denouncing the crime of putting such babies
into battle. In his own command, the
<pb id="wise323" n="323"/>
losses had been terrific. Many a fine fellow whom I knew well
had been killed or maimed in the hard fighting of the previous
week. Then we counted up the casualties in our own
immediate family. Since 1861 he, three sons, and nine
nephews had gone into the Confederate service.
Thus far, two had been killed and six wounded.</p>
        <p>“You must go down the first thing in the morning to the
hospital, and see your cousin Douglas. It may be the last
opportunity,” said he, his voice softening as he spoke.</p>
        <p>“Why, he is not much hurt, is he?” said I, for he had been
reported only slightly wounded. We were talking of his
brigade-inspector, a member of his staff, a favorite nephew,
who had always been more like a son than a nephew.</p>
        <p>“Yes, very seriously,” he said; “at first we thought it a mere
scalp wound like yours, but his brain is affected now, and I
apprehend the most serious result.”</p>
        <p>I soon discovered that my own future was causing him
great anxiety, and that before my coming, notwithstanding all
the cares and anxieties surrounding him, he had been
thinking and planning about me. He had not, perhaps, even
confessed it to himself, but his plans involved putting me in
a place of safety. He told me that General Kemper, of
Gettysburg fame, now permanently disabled by the wounds
received there, was organizing the Virginia reserve forces,
that is, men over forty-five years old and boys under
eighteen; that, in doing so, the services of a large number of
drill-masters would be required; that they would have the
rank of second lieutenants, and be assigned to staff duty in
active service as soon as their work as drill-masters was
completed; and, finally, that he had
already been in correspondence with General Kemper, 
who was an old friend, and had secured the promise of
one of these appointments for me.</p>
        <pb id="wise324" n="324"/>
        <p>It was all put very attractively and very seductively, but I
saw the motive very clearly. I felt rebellious about it, but could
not but love the dear old fellow all the more, and did not blame
him, so fearless himself, for loving me to the point of
pardonable cowardice concerning myself. Knowing his
sacrifices and sufferings, I felt that I had no right to be
refractory just then; and the idea of being a lieutenant, with
bars on my collar, tickled my vanity not a little.</p>
        <p>I was awakened in the morning by our servant Smith
exclaiming, as he awoke father, “I declar', Marster, it looks like
Gin'l Mahone dun caught de whole Yankee army.</p>
        <p>“What's that?” exclaimed father, springing out of bed.</p>
        <p>Then Smith informed us that during the night a great
number of prisoners, captured the preceding evening by
General Mahone, had been brought into Petersburg, and were
at that moment confined under guard on a piece of meadow in
rear of our stable, near what were known as the Ettrick Mills.
Dressing quickly, we walked down to where the prisoners
were, and there we found over seventeen hundred
Union soldiers, captured the preceding day from the
divisions of Generals Mott and Gibbons by General Mahone.</p>
        <p>We ascertained in a general way what had occurred. My
father inquired for General Mahone, and was told he would
be down a little later; he left a message requesting
General Mahone to call by his headquarters. They had been
warm friends, personal and political, for years; my father had
faith in his ability, and had helped him materially in his early
struggles, and he in turn thought the “Old General,” as he
always called him, one of the greatest of men. We had just
finished breakfast when trotting up through the yard,
followed by a Soldier on a
<pb id="wise325" n="325"/>
sway-backed, backed, flea-bitten gray, came little General 
Mahone.</p>
        <p>He was the sauciest-looking little manikin imaginable; he
rode a diminutive blood-like bay mare, fat, sleek, and well-
groomed, as if no war were going on; she was quick and
nervous, and tossed her head, and champed at her bit, and
sidled about like a real live horse, instead of being poor,
jaded, and half asleep, as were many others; her trappings,
too, were expensive, new, and stylish. The little general
looked like a perfect tin soldier. He threw his reins to the
orderly and dismounted. His person and attire were simply
unique: he was not over five feet seven inches tall, and was
as attenuated as an Italian greyhound; his head was finely
shaped; his eye, deep-set beneath a heavy brow, was very
bright and restless; his hair was worn long; his nose was
straight, prominent, and aggressive; his face was covered
with a drooping mustache and full beard of rich chestnut
color and exceeding fine texture; he wore a large sombrero
hat, without plume, cocked on one side, and decorated with a
division badge; he had a hunting-shirt of gray, with rolling
collar, plaited about the waist, and tucked into his trousers,
which were also plaited about the waistband, swelled at the
hips, and tapering to the ankle; while he wore boots, his
trousers covered them; those boots were as small as a
woman's, and exquisitely made; his linen was of the very
finest and softest,  -  nobody could guess how he procured it;
and when he ungloved one little hand, it was almost as
diminutive and frail as the foot of a song bird; he had no
sword, but wore a sword-belt with the straps 
linked together, and in his hand he carried
a slender wand of a stick. Altogether, he was the oddest and
daintiest little specimen of humanity I had
ever seen. His voice was almost a falsetto tenor.</p>
        <pb id="wise326" n="326"/>
        <p>“Ah! my dear general,” he exclaimed, advancing cheerily,
and extending his hand; “I received your message and
was delighted, for I can never pass you by.” Refusing to have
breakfast replaced, he said, “No, no, no you know I am
tortured with my old enemy, dyspepsia. I can take nothing but
milk; and I suffer so without that that I have brought my
Alderney cow along with me in all our campaigns.”</p>
        <p>Most of the staff he knew; as he looked inquiringly at me,
my father presented me. A bright, affectionate smile spread
over his face.</p>
        <p>“Good boy!” said he; “I knew the old Virginia Military 
Institute would show folks what fighting is, if she ever had a
chance.” Then he turned to my father and said, “General,
give him to me; I'll have plenty for him to do.” That remark
cost the old gentleman many an anxious hour.</p>
        <p>Then the party sat down, and Mahone with his little stick,
and in his peculiar graphic way, drew in the sand the diagram
of yesterday's operations, and explained how he and his
gallant division had “doubled 'em up,” as he loved to call it.
And this is how it was:  -  </p>
        <p>Grant's left and our right were south of Petersburg, near
the Jerusalem plank road. Grant had a way of putting one line
immediately opposite us to occupy us, and then forming a
second line a mile or so in rear, which he would extend
beyond the first, and then throw it forward. By this process
he sought to envelop our right flank. Learning that the Union
troops on our right were in this position, General Lee sent out
General Cadmus Wilcox, with a division of A. P. Hill's corps,
to take position in rear of the enemy's rear line, and General
Mahone with his division, to interpose between the enemy's
two lines and attack the line nearest to us. When Wilcox
<pb id="wise327" n="327"/>
heard Mahone's attack upon the first line, he was to attack the
rear of the second line.</p>
        <p>Mahone went in, took his position, attacked, “doubled up” 
Grant's left, ran the Union soldiers out of their own lines into
ours, and captured 1742 prisoners, four light guns, and eight
standards, and Wilcox spent the day fumbling and fiddling
about and doing nothing. From then until now he has been
explaining, sometimes saying A. P. Hill never fully informed
him of what he was expected to do, sometimes claiming that
Mahone acted without coöperating with him, and always
disposed to grumble and try to put the blame upon Mahone
for achieving a success so much more brilliant than his own.</p>
        <p>Be that as it may, “Little Billy Mahone,” that sunlit June
morning, was one of the brightest, merriest little soldiers in the
Confederacy, and never imagined, as he told us how it was
done and chuckled over the surprise of the enemy, that any
one would afterwards blame him for what he had done. Even
then he had, by his brilliant work, gained such lodgment in
General Lee's regard that he was rapidly taking rank in his
confidence alongside of Longstreet and A. P. Hill.</p>
        <p>As he mounted his little thoroughbred, clapped his spurs to
her, touched his hat, and galloped away, I felt as if I would
give anything in this world if my father would consent to his
proposition,  -  “Give him to me.”</p>
        <p>A little later, we walked down to the hospital, and found my
poor cousin delirious; in a day or two he was dead, and our
family contributed one more victim to the Juggernaut of war.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXI</head>
        <head>LIFE AT PETERSBURG</head>
        <p>FOLLOWING close upon Mahone's successful manœuvre
came the raid of General Wilson around our right flank,
whereby he attempted to destroy General Lee's line of
supply,  -  the Southside Railroad. He was promptly and hotly
attacked and driven off near Black's and White's Station by
General W. H. F. Lee; then, pursuing, the line of the Danville
Railroad, he was repulsed at Staunton River bridge by local
militia; turning back from that point to rejoin the Union army,
Hampton, Fitz Lee, Heth, and Mahone attacked him near
Reams's Station, and handled him so roughly that he became
the laughing stock of Lee's army. We at Petersburg saw
nothing of these operations, but the incidents of Wilson's
discomfiture and final rout furnished merriment for the camps
during the ensuing period of comparative inactivity.</p>
        <p>About the middle of July, I visited Richmond to inquire
about my appointment as drill-master. General Kemper's
reception was pompous; he was a striking-looking man,
notwithstanding a waxen pallor proceeding from the severe
wounds he had received at Gettysburg; he apparently suffered
great pain; hobbling back and forth upon his crutches, he
descanted, with loud voice and consequential manner, upon
the noble work of preparing raw troops for service in the field.
He also indulged in sentimental flights upon military glory, not
failing to refer to the fact that he was the only survivor of
Pickett's
<pb id="wise329" n="329"/>
three brigadiers who entered the fight at Gettysburg. General
Kemper had a good record as a soldier, both in Mexico and in
our own service; otherwise, judging by manner and
conversation alone, he would have been classed as a
Bombastes Furioso.</p>
        <p>The upshot of our interview was the promise of a
commission, coupled with the information that my duties
under it would not begin before October 1, as his 
department was not yet fully organized; that was delightful,
for Petersburg had fascinated me, and I hurried back there.
My father was not overpleased at my reappearance. He had
depended upon his friend Kemper to put me away in some
safe place; I, on the other hand, still cherished the hope that
he might yet listen to Mahone's request that he should give
me to him.</p>
        <p>If a boy just closing the Iliad, the Odyssey, or the Æneid,
should be permitted to behold their heroes in the flesh, and
performing the valorous deeds which immortalize them, fancy
what would be his ecstasy! Yet, for three years past, modern
heroes had come upon the stage who were, in my enthusiastic
estimate of their powers, second to no half-clothed ancient
whose deeds are celebrated by Homer or Virgil.</p>
        <p>Until now, I had lived in torturing apprehension lest a
perverse fate should deny me opportunity to see them, and to
follow, however humbly, leaders who had been the subject of
my thoughts by day and dreams by night since the great
struggle began. Here they were all about me; a house, or a
tent by the roadside, decorated with a headquarters flag,
guarded by a few couriers, was all that stood between their
greatness and the humblest private in the army. They were
riding back and forth, and going out and
coming in at all hours, so that everybody saw
them.</p>
        <pb id="wise330" n="330"/>
        <p>Two of the immortals of that army had been snatched away
before my day,  -  Stonewall Jackson of the infantry and Jeb
Stuart of the cavalry. But the presence of glorious company
still gave romantic interest to the deed of the Army of
Northern Virginia. Robert E. Lee, Beau regard, A. P. Hill,
Ewell, Anderson, Hampton, Pickett, Mahone, W. H. F. Lee 
(“Rooney”), Gordon, Fitz Lee, Fields, Heth, Hoke, and a host of
lesser lights were still actors in its heroic struggles. The first
shall be last in the description of these men as I saw them
almost daily. Of Anderson, Fields, and Hoke I remember very
little; and Longstreet was absent.</p>
        <p>Next to General Lee in point of rank and fame was General
Beauregard. He had been hurried up with his command in
May from Charleston to defend Petersburg until Lee's army
would reach the scene. Under him, my father's command had
borne the brunt of the first assaults upon Petersburg. He was
attached to General Wise, and as he frequently visited our
quarters, I saw him often. Beauregard was a soldier of decided
ability, and deserves great credit for the early defense of
Petersburg. He was heavily handicapped throughout the war
by the dislike of Mr. Davis. If he had been given more favorable 
opportunities, General Beauregard would occupy a more prominent
place in the history of the civil war. In appearance, he was a
petite Frenchman. His uniform fitted to perfection, he was
always punctiliously neat, his manners were faultless 
and deferential. His voice was pleasant and insinuating with
a perceptible foreign accent. His apprehension was quick, his
observation and judgment alert, his expressions terse and
vigorous. Like many of our other distinguished soldiers,
especially of his race, he was fond of the society of the
gentler sex, and at his best when in their company.</p>
        <pb id="wise331" n="331"/>
        <p>General A. P. Hill was the opposite of General Beauregard in
appearance and in manner. He was of the old-fashioned 
American type of handsome men. He was what
men call a “men's man.” He had a high brow, a large nose and
mouth, and his face was covered with a full, dark beard. He
dressed plainly, not to say roughly. He wore a woolen shirt,
and frequently appeared, especially in action, attired in a shell
jacket. About his uniform he had little or no ornamentation,
hardly more, in fact, than the insignia of rank upon his collar.
Beauregard, like a true Frenchman, was often accompanied by
a full staff. Hill, on the other hand, appeared to care little for a
staff. When he was killed, at the time our lines were broken
and Petersburg evacuated, although he was a lieutenant
general, he was in advance of his line, accompanied by a
single courier. General Hill gave the impression of being
reticent, or, at any rate, uncommunicative. Neither in aspect
nor manner of speech did he appear to measure up to his great
fighting record. Yet great it was, for he enjoys the unique
distinction of having been named by both Lee and Jackson
during the delirium of their last moments.</p>
        <p>When Stonewall was unconscious and dying, “A. P. Hill,
prepare for action,” was one of the last things he said. When,
long after the war had ended, General Lee lay unconscious,
breathing his last, in quiet Lexington, he exclaimed, “A. P. Hill
must move up.” A. P. Hill would seem to have been the one to
whom both these great leaders turned in a great crisis, as if
feeling that, if he could not save the situation, nothing could.
What nobler tribute from his commanders could a soldier
wish? Yet, illustrious as were the services of General Hill, I do
not recall ever hearing anybody speak of a close intimacy with
him, or of his being deeply attached to any individual.
<pb id="wise332" n="332"/>
He appeared to have no interest in the fair sex. His soul
seemed concentrated and absorbed in fighting. What success
he might have had in independent command, no one can
conjecture. His fame rests in his intelligent, tireless, and
courageous execution of the commands of Lee and Jackson. </p>
        <p>Dear old General Ewell! No Southern soldier can recall his
name without a flush of pride. Posterity will class him, under
Lee and Jackson, with men like Picton under Wellington. When
I first saw him, old “Fighting Dick,” as he was called, had lost
a leg; but he was still in the business enthusiastically, as if he
possessed as many legs as a centipede. He was attached to my
father. Our families were intimate. He would ride up to our 
quarters, and, seated on horseback, talk by the hour over the
military and political outlook. He said his wooden leg made it
too much trouble to dismount and remount. Removing his hat
to catch the summer breezes, he displayed a dome-like head,
bald at the top, the side-locks brushed straight forward; his
fierce, grizzled mustaches sticking up and sticking out like
those about the muzzle of a terrier. Fighting was beyond
question the ruling passion of his life. His eye had the
expression we see in hawks and gamecocks. Yet the man's
nature, in every domestic and social relation, was the gentlest,
the simplest, the most credulous and affectionate imaginable.
He was small of stature, and his clothes, about which he was
indifferent, looked as if made for a larger man. Up to the time he
lost his leg, he was regarded as the toughest and most
enduring man in the army. Not by any means an ascetic, he
could, upon occasion, march as long, sleep and eat as little,
and work as hard, as the great Stonewall himself.</p>
        <p>The commander of Lee's cavalry at this time was General
Wade Hampton, of South Carolina. My ideas
<pb id="wise333" n="333"/>
of cavalrymen had been derived to a large extent from Lever's
troopers in “Charles O'Malley,” one of the most fascinating
books ever placed in the hands of boys with military
inclinations. Jeb Stuart's leadership of the Confederate cavalry
had elevated that ideal somewhat, without detracting from the
gallant, devil-may care recklessness pervading the story of the
Irish dragoon. The fighting morale of Stuart's cavalry was
nowise impaired under the dashing leadership of Hampton. He
was as dauntless as Stuart, and, If anything, a more
distinguished-looking man. Thoroughly inured 
to fatigue by a lifetime spent in the
saddle or in the field, his reputation as a sportsman was second
only to his fame as a cavalryman. A born aristocrat, his
breeding showed itself in every feature, word, and look. Yet
his manners and bearing with the troops were so thoroughly
democratic, and his fearlessness in action so conspicuous,
that no man ever excited more enthusiasm. He rode like a
centaur, and possessed a form and face so noble that men vied
with women in admiration of General Hampton.</p>
        <p>His two most prominent lieutenants were William Henry
Fitzhugh Lee and Fitzhugh Lee; the former a son, the latter a
nephew, of the commander of the army. These cousins were
strikingly unlike.</p>
        <p>General William H. F. Lee, familiarly called “Rooney,” had
lost much time from active service. He was captured early in
1863, and detained in prison until about May, 1864. Upon his
return to active service, he quickly reëstablished himself by
energetic work; and the manner in which he attacked and
followed up General Wilson fixed upon him anew the
affections of the army. He was an immense man, 
probably six feet three or four inches tall
and, while not very fleshy, I remember that I wondered,
when I first saw him, how he could find a horse powerful
<pb id="wise334" n="334"/>
enough to bear him upon a long ride! In youth, he had figured
as stroke-oar at Harvard. Although of abstemious habits, his
complexion was florid. His hands and feet were immense, and in
company he appeared to be ill at ease. His bearing was,
however, excellent, and his voice, manner, and everything
about him bespoke the gentleman. Speaking of cavalry, a horse
simile is admissible. “Rooney” Lee, contrasted with Hampton,
suggested a Norman Percheron beside a thoroughbred;
General Fitzhugh Lee, a pony-built hunter. I have known all the
Lees of my day and generation,  -  the great general, his
brothers, his sons, nephews, and grandsons,  -  and General 
“Rooney” Lee I regarded and esteemed more highly than any of
the name, except his father. Yet he was the least showy of that
distinguished family. This gentleman   -  a gentleman always
and everywhere  -  would have made a more conspicuous
reputation in the cavalry, if the war had not ended so soon
after his return from his long imprisonment. He had not much
humor in his composition, although keenly appreciative of it in
others. He was a widower in 1864, and nothing of a society
man, although a gallant admirer of women. After the war, he
married a beautiful descendant of Pocahontas, Miss Tabb
Bolling, of Petersburg. He had none of the tricks which gain
popularity, but somehow he grappled to him the men of his
command with hooks of steel, and is remembered by his
veterans with as much affection as any officer in Lee's army.</p>
        <p>His opposite in everything but courage was his cousin,
Fitzhugh Lee, called “Fitz” by everybody. Fitz Lee combined
in himself not only the blood of the Lees, but of George
Mason, one of the greatest of our Revolutionary leaders. The
strain of jollity pervading him probably came from the
Masons; for while “Light Horse Harry”
<pb id="wise335" n="335"/>
was in his day a rattling blade, the Lees were, as a rule, quiet
folk. His father, Commodore Smith Lee was all gentleness and
urbanity. On the other hand, the Masons, from the first
George Mason, of Stafford, who sympathized with Bacon in
his rebellion, down to the grandfather of Fitz Lee, convey the
impression of a decided fondness for “fighting, fiddling, and
fun.” Fitz graduated at West Point in 1856, more distinguished
for horsemanship than anything else. Doubtless he might
have done better if he had tried. He had hosts of friends, and
no end of enjoyment, and took to the cavalry as a duck does
to water. In his service upon the plains prior to the war, an
Indian found his short, stout thigh a good pincushion for a
feathered arrow, and after his convalescence, he was assigned
to duty as cavalry instructor at the United States Military
Academy. From that position be resigned at the outbreak of
the war. He was now, at the age of twenty-nine, a brigadier-
general, a bachelor, and gay cavalier of ladies.</p>
        <p>The first time I ever saw him was in June, 1864, in
Richmond. In those days Third Street, leading out to the
pretty heights of Gamble's Hill, was the favorite evening
promenade. The people of Richmond, save such as visited
friends in the country, remained in town throughout the
summer, for no places of public resort were open and nobody
had the means to go, if they had been open. On summer
nights the better classes, maid and matron, old men, high
officers, soldiers, boys and girls,
strolled back and forth on Third Street to catch the
southern breeze upon the hill, cooled by its passage
across the falls of the James; to watch the belching
furnaces of the Tredegar cannon foundry on the river banks
below; and to listen to the band which sometimes played
upon the hill. While thus diverting myself one
<pb id="wise336" n="336"/>
evening with a party of young friends, we saw a string of
cavalry horses held in front of the residence of a prominent 
citizen, and, as we approached, heard the sound of a piano,
accompanied by a male and a female voice singing “The
Gypsy Countess.” The curtains of the parlor were drawn back
to relieve the intense sultriness and the party was visible
from the street. A strong, deep voice sang the familiar part
of the duet,  -  “Come, fly with me now.” The sweet answer
was returned in female, notes, “Can I trust to thy vow?”
Then the two warbled the refrain together, and the
performance finally concluded eluded amid merry laughter
and vigorous applause.</p>
        <p>The performance was varied by the appearance of a
cavalryman with his banjo. He gave them some jingling
music, which sent everybody's blood bounding. Knowing
the host, we felt no hesitation about joining the party of
onlookers upon the portico, and there we beheld Fitz Lee
with his staff, making a jolly night of it as they passed
through Richmond on their way to Petersburg. The house
was the home of one of his favorite young staff officers,
whose sister was Fitz Lee's partner in the duet. In
appearance, General Lee was short, thickset, already inclined
to stoutness; with a square head and short neck upon broad
shoulders, a merry eye, and a joyous voice of great power;
ruddy, full-bearded, and overflowing with animal spirits. At
last the banjo struck up his favorite air:  -  </p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“If you want to have a good time,</l>
          <l>Jine the cavalry,</l>
          <l>Jine the cavalry,</l>
          <l>Jine the cavalry.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Fitz and staff joined in the refrain with mighty zest making
the house ring with their hilarity.</p>
        <p>This over, they announced their departure for
<pb id="wise337" n="337"/>
Petersburg, and a mighty hubbub they made. The ladies of
the house and the young girls brought food and dainties for
their haversacks, and wearing apparel for use in camp: the
packing of these stores took place in the hallway, and then
followed the farewells. It was “Good-by, Lucy,” “Good-by,
Mary,” “Good-by, Jennie,” and Fitz Lee must have been kin
to a great many of those pretty girls. His young staff officer
kissed his mother and sister farewell; Fitz Lee, true to his
cavalry instincts; began kissing also; this doubtless inspired
his young captain to extend like courtesies to visitors as well
as the family, and wherever he led, Fitz followed. By the time
their plunder had been placed upon their steeds, and they,
with jangling spurs, had scrambled to their saddles, Fitz Lee
and staff had taken “cavalry toll” from every pretty girl in
sight. Finally, with many fond adieus and waving plumes,
they rode away down Cary Street, their mounted banjoist
playing the air, and they singing in chorus,  -  “If you want to
have a good time, jine the cavalry.”</p>
        <p>They passed over the bridge across the James, their route
to Petersburg illuminated by the harvest moon, and a day or
two afterwards were making it very uncomfortable for General
Wilson at Reams's Station. In later days, General Fitz and I
were political opponents, but that fact never obliterated my
affectionate remembrance of his merry, gallant cavalry
leadership, or of the debt I
owe him for the noble tribute he has placed upon record to
my father's unflinching courage upon the retreat and until
the last gun was fired at Appomattox.</p>
        <p>Less conspicuous than Hampton and the Lees was the
cavalry brigadier general, Deering. “Jim” Deering, as
everybody called him, was a very young man; if I mistake
not, he was a second-class man at West Point when
<pb id="wise338" n="338"/>
the war broke out; yet, when killed upon the retreat from
Petersburg, he had risen to the command of a brigade. He was
a man of remarkable health and strength and courage, with a
multitude of friends. Pursuing the horse simile, under which
the three others have been grouped, he may be likened to a
promising colt of faultless breeding, with a brilliant record in
his first year's performance. Deering was too young when
killed to be classed among the great leaders, but was a
youngster of unusual military instinct.</p>
        <p>Returning to the infantry, there was Pickett, whose name is
linked forever with that of Gettysburg. Pickett was a striking
figure: he was a tawny man, of medium height and of stout
build; his long yellow hair was thick, hanging about his ears
and shoulders, suggestive of a lion's mane. He was blue-eyed,
with white eyelashes, florid complexion, and reddish
mustache and imperial emphasizing his blonde appearance; he
was of the Saxon type. Pickett was a gentleman by birth. He
had a great number of relatives and friends in Richmond and
in the James River section; they were justly proud of his
military career. He was a high and a free liver, and often
declared that, to fight like a gentleman, a man must eat and
drink like a gentleman. General Lee was a very prudent and
abstemious man himself, but never censorious touching the
mode of life of his inferiors when they discharged the duties
assigned to them. In this respect he was different from
Stonewall Jackson, who rather expected those under his
command to conform to his simple mode of life. Pickett was a
trained soldier and loved fighting. Fitz Lee tells a characteristic
anecdote dote of him: As he rode into the fight at Gettysburg,
in passing General Lee he cried out, pointing to the front 
“Come on, Fitz, and go with us; we shall have lots of
<pb id="wise339" n="339"/>
fun there presently.” It was an odd sort of fun he had that
day; but I have no doubt it was the life in which he was
happiest.</p>
        <p>I have already described Mahone, and now come to John B.
Gordon, of Georgia, a division commander under General Lee,
who had attained marked distinction in spite of the fact that
he was not a West Pointer. Gordon is still alive, and not
appreciably changed from what he was in '64; he was then a
tall, spare-built young fellow, of very military bearing, his
handsome face adorned by a deep gash received in one of the
battles of the valley. The military genius of General Gordon
was never tested in any independent command, but his
fearlessness and eagerness to assail the enemy, whenever
and wherever he was ordered to do so, made him one of the
most conspicuous and popular commanders under General
Lee. Wherever he appeared, the soldiers flocked about him
and cheered him; wherever he commanded, they felt confident
of hot work; and wherever he led (he never followed), the
soldiers were willing to go, because they had sublime faith in
his fidelity and courage. We often saw General Gordon, who
was a warm admirer of my father; and to this day I delight to
honor him as one of the truest and bravest of Lee's
lieutenants.</p>
        <p>It has always seemed to me that sufficient recognition is
not given to the great service rendered by the artillery. This
is probably due to the fact that it is under the Command and
direction of some general officer, who receives credit for
success. Then, too, the numbers of the artillery are not
sufficient to attract attention, as in the case of cavalry or
infantry, when, in large bodies, they are conspicuously
courageous. General Lee's chief of artillery, General Long, is
seldom heard of in the accounts of the fighting about
Petersburg, and although artillery
<pb id="wise340" n="340"/>
played a prominent part in every engagement, the 
commanders are seldom spoken of, while infantry and cavalry 
officers are noticed conspicuously. No general ever
commanded a finer body of young artillery officers than
General Lee. Alexander, Pegram, Haskell, Carter, Braxton,
Parker, Sturtevant, Breathitt, and a number of others I might
name, were counted as the very flower of the army. Yet they
are gradually disappearing from view in the prominence given
to the officers in higher command.</p>
        <p>Colonel William J. Pegram was the most picturesque figure
among these many distinguished artillerists. Without early
military training, save in our little boy soldier company in
Richmond, he entered the service as a private,
and by his pronounced courage and military talents
became a colonel at the age of twenty-one and was killed at
the age of twenty-three years, when his promotion to
brigadier-general had been ordered. Pegram was a boyish
looking fellow, very near-sighted, and, with his gold
spectacles and clean-shaven face, looked more like a student
of divinity than a soldier. He was reticent, modest, but of
boundless ambition. He had indulged in none of the
dissipations of youth, and was extremely pious. He loved
fighting, feared nothing, and was an exacting disciplinarian.
General Lee, while undemonstrative in most things, regarded 
“Willie” Pegram, as everybody called him, with undisguised
affection and pride.</p>
        <p>John Haskell, of South Carolina, was another of his artillery
paladins, who was never so happy as when standing amid
the smoke of his own batteries. To him primarily was due in a
great measure the saving of Lee's army at the crater fight. But
I must pass from the description of these lesser lights to one
who, like Saul, towered, from his shoulders and upward,
tallest among all the people.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to speak of General Lee without seeming
<pb id="wise341" n="341"/>
to deal in hyperbole. He had assumed command of the
Virginia army under peculiar circumstances. It had been
organized at Manassas in '61 under Beauregard and
Joseph E. Johnston. In the winter of '61 and '62, it had been
transferred to the peninsula between the York and the James,
still under the command of General Johnston. Under him it
retreated towards Richmond, and he remained in command
until wounded in the battle of Seven pines. General Johnston
had inspired the army with great confidence in his ability, and
undoubtedly possessed the quality of securing the deep and
abiding faith and affection of his troops. During the period
above described General Lee had not gained ground in public esteem. In
'61, he had been assigned to the command and direction of
those impossible campaigns in West Virginia from which he
had emerged with a loss of prestige. They failed, as any
campaign must have done in such a country. Whether or not
due allowance was made for conditions, in judging of Lee's
ability, need not be discussed. Suffice it to say, that after the
termination of the West Virginia campaign, General Lee was
sent to Charleston, where he was engaged in strengthening
the fortifications until May, 1862, and that in June accident
called him to the command of the army about Richmond.</p>
        <p>It is no disparagement of General Lee to say that there were
many who, at the time, regarded the wounding of General
Johnston as a profound misfortune. But it was not long
before Lee established himself in the affection and confidence
of that army, and took a place never occupied by anyone
else. Before the last gun fired at Malvern Hill, at the close of
the seven days' fighting, the army had become known as
Lee's army. It never had another name, and as such it will go
down to history.</p>
        <p>I have seen many pictures of General Lee, but never
<pb id="wise342" n="342"/>
one that conveyed a correct impression of his appearance.
Above the ordinary size, his proportions were perfect. His form
had fullness, without any appearance of superfluous
flesh, and was as erect as that of a cadet, without the slightest
apparent constraint. His features are too well known to need
description, but no representation of General Lee which I have
ever seen properly conveys the light and softness of his eye,
the tenderness and intellectuality of his mouth, or the
indescribable refinement of his face. One picture gives him a
meatiness about the nose; another, hard or coarse lines about
the mouth; another, heaviness about the chin. None of them
give the effect of his hair and beard. I have seen all the great
men of our times, except Mr. Lincoln, and have no hesitation
in saying that Robert E. Lee was incomparably the greatest
looking man I ever saw. I say the greatest-looking. By this I do
not mean to provoke discussion whether he was, in fact, the
greatest man of his age. One thing is, however, certain. Every
man in that army believed that Robert E. Lee was the greatest
man alive, and their faith in him alone kept that army together
during the last six months of its existence.</p>
        <p>There was nothing of the pomp or panoply of war about
the headquarters, or the military government, or the 
bearing of General Lee. The place selected as his
headquarters was unpretentious. The officers of his staff had
none of the insolence of martinets. Oddly enough, the three
most prominent members of his staff  -  Colonel Venable,
Colonel Marshall, and Colonel Walter Taylor  -  were not even
West Pointers. Persons having business with his
headquarters were treated like human beings, and courtesy,
considerateness, and even deference were shown to the
humblest. He had no gilded retinue, but a devoted band of
simple scouts and couriers, who, in their quietness
<pb id="wise343" n="343"/>
and simplicity, modeled themselves after him. General Lee as
often rode out to consult with his subordinates as he sent for
them to come to him. The sight of him upon the roadside, or in
the trenches, was as common as that of any subordinate in
the army. When he approached or disappeared, it was with no
blare of trumpets or clank of equipments. Mounted upon his
historic war-horse “Traveler,” he ambled quietly 
about, keeping his eye upon
everything pertaining to the care and defense of his army. 
“Traveler” was no pedigreed, wide-nostriled, gazelle-eyed
thoroughbred. He was a close-coupled, round-barreled,
healthy, comfortable, gentleman's saddle horse. Gray, with
black points, he was sound in eye, wind, and limb, without
strain, sprain, spavin, or secretion of any sort; ready to go,
and able to stay; and yet without a single fancy trick, or the
pretentious bearing of the typical charger. He was a horse
bought by General Lee during his West Virginia campaign.</p>
        <p>When General Lee rode up to our headquarters, or
elsewhere, he came as unostentatiously as if he had been the
head of a plantation, riding over his fields to inquire and give
directions about ploughing or seeding. He appeared to have
no mighty secrets concealed from his subordinates. He
assumed no airs of superior authority. He repelled no kindly
inquiries, and was capable of jocular remarks. He did not hold
himself aloof in solitary grandeur. His bearing was that of a
friend having a common interest in a common venture with the
person addressed, and as if he assumed that his subordinate
was as deeply concerned as himself in its success. Whatever
greatness was accorded to him was not of his own seeking.
He was less of an actor than any man I ever saw. But the
impression which that man made by his presence, and by his
leadership, upon all who came in contact with him, can be
<pb id="wise344" n="344"/>
described by no other term than that of grandeur. When I
have stood at evening, and watched the great clouds banked
in the west, and tinged by evening sunlight; when, on the
Western plains, I have looked at the peaks of the Rocky
Mountains outlined against the sky; when, in mid-ocean, I
have seen the limitless waters encircling us, unbounded save
by the infinite horizon,  -  the grandeur, the vastness of these
have invariably suggested thoughts of General Robert E. Lee.
Certain it is that the Confederacy contained no other man like
him. When its brief career was ended, in him was centred, as in
no other man, the trust, the love, almost the worship, of those
who remained steadfast to the end. When he said that the
career of the Confederacy was ended; that the hope of an
independent government must be abandoned; that all had
been done which mortals could accomplish against the power
of overwhelming numbers and resources; and that the duty of
the future was to abandon the dream of a Confederacy,
and to render a new and cheerful allegiance to a reunited
government,  -  his utterances were accepted as true as Holy
Writ. No other human being upon earth, no other earthly
power, could have produced such acquiescence, or could
have compelled such prompt acceptance of that final and
irreversible judgment.</p>
        <p>Of General Lee's military greatness, absolute or relative, 
I shall not speak; of his moral greatness I need not. The
former, in view of the conditions with which he was
hampered, must leave a great deal to speculation and 
conjecture; the latter is acknowledged by all the world. The
man who could so stamp his impress upon his nation,
rendering all others insignificant beside him, and yet die
without an enemy; the soldier who could make love for his
person a substitute for pay and clothing and food, and could,
by the constraint of that love, hold together a naked,
<pb id="wise345" n="345"/>
starving band, and transform it into a fighting army; the heart
which, after the failure of its great endeavor, could break in
silence, and die without the utterance of
one word of bitterness,  -  such a man, such a soldier, such a
heart, must have been great indeed,  -  great beyond the
power of eulogy.</p>
        <p>Not in five hundred years does the opportunity come to any
boy, I care not who he may be, to witness scenes
like these, or live in daily contact with men whose names will
endure as long as man loves military glory.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XII</head>
        <head>THE BATTLE OF THE CRATER</head>
        <p>MUCH of the month of July we passed in the trenches.
Father was in command of Petersburg, and Colonel J. Thomas
Goode commanded the brigade, but we visited it almost daily.
It was assigned to Bushrod Johnson's division, and our
position was next to the South Carolinians under Elliott. Our
left was about a hundred yards south of a bastion known as
Elliott's salient.</p>
        <p>Life in the trenches was indescribably monotonous and
uncomfortable. In time of sunshine, the reflected heat from the
new red-clay embankments was intense, and unrelieved
by shade or breeze; and in wet weather one was ankle-
deep in tough, clinging mud. The incessant shelling and picket-
firing made extreme caution necessary in moving about; and
each day, almost each hour, added to the list of casualties.
The opposing lines were not over two hundred yards apart,
and the distance between the rifle-pits was about one hundred
yards. Both sides had attained accurate marksmanship, which
they practiced with merciless activity in picking off men. One
may fancy the state of mind of soldiers thus confined, who
knew that even the act of going to a spring for water involved
risk of life or limb.</p>
        <p>The men resorted to many expedients to secure some
degree of comfort and protection. They learned to burrow
like conies. Into the sides of the trenches and traverses
they went with bayonet and tin cups to secure shade
<pb id="wise347" n="347"/>
or protection from rain. Soon, such was their proficiency that,
at sultry midday or during a rainfall, one might look up or down
the trenches without seeing anybody but the sentinel. At sound
of the drum, the heads of the soldiers would pop up and out of
the earth, as if they had been prairie-dogs or gophers. Still, many
lives were lost by the indifference to danger which is begotten
by living constantly in its presence.</p>
        <p>To appreciate fully the truth that men are but children of a
larger growth, one must have commanded soldiers. Without
constant guidance and government and punishment, they
become careless about clothes, food, ammunition, cleanliness,
and even personal safety. They will at once eat or throw away
the rations furnished for several days, never considering the
morrow. They will cast aside or give away their clothing
because to-day is warm, never calculating that to-morrow they
may be suffering for the lack of it. They will open their
cartridge-boxes and dump their cartridges on the roadside to
lighten their load, although a few hours later their lives may
depend upon having a full supply. When they draw their pay,
their first object is to find some way to get rid of it as quickly
as possible. An officer, to be really efficient, must add to the
qualities of courage and firmness those of nurse, monitor, and
purveyor for grown-up children, in whom the bumps of
improvidence and destructiveness are abnormally developed.</p>
        <p>Thus, in spite of warnings and threat of punishment for
failure to approach and depart from the lines by the protected
covered ways, it was impossible to make the men observe
these reasonable precautions. For a long time they had been
shot at, night and day. A man, because he had not been hit,
would soon come to regard himself as invulnerable. The fact that his comrades had
<pb id="wise348" n="348"/>
been killed or wounded appeared to make little impression 
upon him. Past immunity made him so confident that he would
walk coolly over the same exposed ground where somebody
else had been shot the day before. The “spat,” 
“whiz,” “zip”
of hostile bullets would not even make him quicken his pace.
Mayhap he would take his short pipe out of his mouth and
yell defiantly, “Ah-h  -   Yank  -  yer  -  kain't  -  shoot,” and go on
his way tempting fate, until a bullet struck him and he was
dead, or maimed for life. At times I questioned whether these
soldiers were not really seeking relief by death or wounds
from the torture of such intolerable life. It was enough to make
men mad and reckless.</p>
        <p>Occasionally we had suspension of firing. At such times
even ladies visited the trenches. I recall particularly one party
of pretty girls who came over from Richmond, rode out on
horseback to a point in rear of our position, and, dismounting,
advanced boldly across the exposed ground, and stood for
some time on our parapets watching the Union lines. The
intrenchments of the enemy were lined with soldiers sunning
themselves, or engaged in a favorite occupation familiar to all
old soldiers, but not to be described in polite literature. 
“Hello, Johnnie! it's ladies' day, ain't it?” called out a fellow
from a rifle-pit, when he saw the riding-habits outlined against
the sky.</p>
        <p>We often talked to each other. Sometimes our 
conversation was civil and kindly enough. Sometimes it was
facetious. At others it was of the grossest and most
unmentionable character. On an occasion like this, the
presence of ladies was greeted as a high compliment by our
men, and accepted by the enemy as gratifying evidence of
our confidence in their good faith. By both sides the fair
visitors were treated with the utmost deference.</p>
        <pb id="wise349" n="349"/>
        <p>A truce like that described would be terminated by some one
calling out from the rifle-pits that orders had come to reopen
fire at a designated time, sufficiently remote to allow
everybody to seek cover. When the hour arrived, again
they would go, as fiercely as ever. The following incident will
convey some idea of the precision of marksmanship attained
by constant practice. It was told me repeatedly by Isaac
Newman, one of the most fearless and truthful men I ever
knew. He was the survivor of the episode. Newman and a
comrade, whose name was Blake, I think, were detailed as
sharpshooters in one of the rifle-pits in our front.
Sharpshooters were posted and relieved at night, and but
once in twenty-four hours. The attempt to reach or return from
a rifle-pit in the daytime would have been followed by certain
death. The pit was a hole in the ground large enough to
contain two men. A curtain of earth was thrown up in front,
with a narrow embrasure through which to fire. On the inside
was a small banquette in front, upon which the men could sit
or kneel when firing. Newman and Blake were reckless and
resourceful chaps. They hit upon the device of taking a small
looking-glass into the pit with them. This they hung opposite
the embrasure.</p>
        <p>By this arrangement they could sit on the banquette, with
their backs to the enemy, and see in the looking glass all that
was going on in front, without exposing their heads. They
were inveterate card-players. Neither had any money, but for
stakes they used square bits of tobacco cut the size of a 
“chew.” This was high stakes for Confederate soldiers. With a
greasy, well-thumbed pack of praying-cards, they indulged in
the excitement of seven-up for several hours. The stakes were
placed, and the cards thrown down upon the part of the
banquette which lay between them under the embrasure. As the
game
<pb id="wise350" n="350"/>
proceeded, both congratulated themselves that they had
discovered a device and diversion which made life in a rifle-pit
comparatively safe and endurable. Instead of craning and
peeping on the lookout, all that was necessary was to cast a
glance now and then at the looking-glass. Occasionally, one
or the other would stick his cap on the end of a gun, and put it
up above the breastwork, and some watchful sharpshooter
would bang away at it. After a while, Newman, who had lost all
his tobacco, seeing his last chew was to be won by Blake,
snatched the stakes, and stuck a chew into his mouth. This
was followed by some friendly scuffling and horse-play, in the
course of which Blake's head was incautiously exposed for an
instant at the embrasure. It was for but a moment, but that
moment was fatal. Zip! spat! came a bullet, quick as a flash. It
crashed through poor Blake's temples and broke the looking-
glass. Newman was left in the pit with the dead body of Blake
until midnight. When relieved, he returned to the lines bearing
the remains of his friend upon his shoulders.</p>
        <p>In telling this story, Newman always followed it by adding
that he believed the man who killed Blake had a personal
grudge against him, because the next morning he made a pot
of coffee, the last he had, and set it on the parapet to cool;
and just as he reached up for it, a shot, fired from the same
rifle-pit whence Blake had been killed, struck the coffee-pot,
and emptied its scalding contents down his jacket sleeve.</p>
        <p>When our troops first manned the lines, the things most
dreaded were the great mortar-shells. They were particularly 
terrible at night. Their parabolas through the air
were watched with intense apprehension, and their explosion 
seemed to threaten annihilation. Within a week they had
ceased to occasion any other feeling among the
<pb id="wise351" n="351"/>
men than a desire to secure their fragments. They had learned
to fear more danger from minie balls than from mortar-shells.
There was little chance of a shell's falling upon the men, for
they could see it and get out of the way. Unless it did actually
strike some one in its descent,
the earth was so tunneled and pitted that it was apt to fall into
some depression, where its fragments would be stopped and
rendered harmless by the surrounding walls of dirt. Iron was
becoming scarce. As inducement to collecting scrap-iron for
our cannon foundries, furloughs were offered a day for so
many pounds collected. Thus, gathering fragments of shell
became an active industry among the troops. So keen was
their quest that sometimes they would start towards the point
where a mortar-shell fell, even before it exploded.</p>
        <p>Such was life in the trenches before Petersburg. Looking
back at it now, one wonders that everybody was not killed, or
did not die from exposure. But, at the time, no man there
personally expected to be killed, and there was something  -  
nobody can define what it was  -  which made the experience
by no means so horrible as it now seems. I doubt if all these
little things made such deep impressions upon older men. I
was very young, very much interested, and, being without
defined duties or command, could come and go as I saw fit;
and so, I fancy, it was not so irksome to me as it must have
been to those more restrained.</p>
        <p>All during the month of July, the fact that the enemy as
mining in our front was discussed and accepted by the
troops. How soldiers get their information is one of the
mysteries of the service, yet they are often in possession of
more accurate knowledge than those high in 
authority. For some time the reports about the mine were
exceedingly vague. More than one Union picket had
<pb id="wise352" n="352"/>
hinted at a purpose to “send you to Heaven soon,” or
threatened that they were “going to blow you up next week.”
For some time, no less than three salients were discussed as the
possible points. Our engineers had some sort of information, for
countermining was begun at all these salients; but, for some
unknown reason, it was abandoned. Their information must,
however, have been more or less definite concerning the Elliott
salient, for while they abandoned countermining, they did erect
a gorge line, or retrenched cavalier, at this point, and planted
batteries of eight and ten inch Coehorn mortars bearing upon
the spot. The gorge line was a curved line of parapet in rear of
the salient, connecting with the main line of our breastworks; so
that, if the salient should be blown up, our troops could occupy
the gorge line in rear, and resist an assault at the breach. Placing
the Coehorn mortars so as to command the salient showed that
the explosion was apprehended. And these evidences of
knowledge made it all the more surprising that the men and guns
in this salient were not removed back to the gorge line in time
to save them. Whatever doubts the engineers may have felt,
the privates knew where the works were being mined. Elliott's
men told the fellows on the left of our brigade all about it long
before the explosion. Our men would go down there, and, lying
on the ground with Elliott's men, would listen to the work going
on below, and come back and tell all about it.</p>
        <p>About daybreak, July 30, the mine was exploded. We were so
accustomed to extraordinary explosions that nothing short of
an earthquake would have occasioned surprise. At our
quarters, the sound was not extraordinary, although we were
only about two miles distant; and I have I frequently heard
General Mahone, whose headquarters
were along the lines about the same distance from the 
<pb id="wise353" n="353"/>
mine as our own, say the same thing. It was fully half past six
o'clock when a messenger from our own brigade arrived
announcing the explosion, the breach in the line to the left of
my father's brigade, and the very perilous situation of our
army.</p>
        <p>This was the outcome of a long and patient series of
operations on the part of the Union forces. When Petersburg
was first attacked, our army had been driven from certain
positions on an outer or more extended line of defenses.
About one hundred yards in front of Elliott's salient, the
second division of Burnside's corps (Ninth) occupied a heavy
line of rifle-pits, from which we had retired. Behind these rifle-
pits, which originally faced to the east, the ground dipped, so
that operations at that point were fairly well concealed. The
troops located there were the 48th Pennsylvania Regiment,
recruited in the Schuylkill mining districts, and commanded by
Lieutenant-Colonel Henry Pleasants, a mining engineer. He it
was who conceived the idea of sinking the mine.</p>
        <p>While he secured official sanction of his plan, he seems
never to have had official support. General Meade and his
chief of engineers spoke of it contemptuously; and Pleasants,
in his testimony before the Committee on the Conduct of the
War, complained bitterly of lack of assistance.
Notwithstanding all obstacles, the mine was complete by July
23. It consisted of a shaft 510 feet long, with lateral galleries
under our works 38 and 37 feet long respectively; in these, 320
kegs of powder, containing 25 pounds each,  -  in all 8000
pounds,  -  were placed, and preliminary to the explosion, 81
heavy guns and mortars and over 80 light guns of the Union
army were brought to bear on the position to be mined and
attacked.</p>
        <p>General Grant was by this time fully aroused to the
<pb id="wise354" n="354"/>
dignity of the assault, and, in order to divert General Lee, made
a demonstration in force on the north side of the James.
General Sheridan with the cavalry and General Hancock with a
corps of infantry were sent across the James, necessitating the
withdrawal by General Lee from in front of Petersburg of all his
forces except the divisions of Bushrod Johnson and Hoke, and
two brigades of Mahone's division. General Lee, in fact, had
left to defend Petersburg, on the morning of the mine
explosion, but 13,000 men. It is proper I should state that, in
the many accounts from which I compiled this narrative, none
is so terse, and none so fortified by historic data, as that of
Captain Gordon McCabe, of Petersburg; and, while I have not
that paper before me, I am following it so closely that I should
be liable to the accusation of plagiarism if I did not make this
acknowledgment.</p>
        <p>Grant quietly recalled Hancock the night of July 29, and had
him in supporting distance of Burnside when the mine was
fired. The plan of attack was for Burnside to assault; Ord on
his right and Warren on his left were to close in and sustain
him. The preparations were elaborate. The assaulting column
numbered 15,000 men, and the supports brought the aggregate
Union forces employed up to 65,000 men. Burnside's negro
division was at first considered for leading, but the final
determination was to let the white troops take the advance,
and the choice fell by lot to the division of Major-General
Ledlie, who has been so severely denounced by his own
commander and comrades that I will not discuss his
merits or demerits. The columns were massed for the attack
overnight, and the fuse of the mine was lighted about 3<corr>:</corr>30 A. M.</p>
        <p>The ragged remnant of the Confederate army still left
<pb id="wise355" n="355"/>
before Petersburg enjoyed unusual repose that night, for the
firing along the lines had almost ceased. A long delay ensued.
After waiting more than an hour for the explosion, two Union
soldiers, at the risk of their lives, crawled into the gallery of
the mine and found that the fuse had failed; they relit it and
returned. Colonel Pleasants and his friends stood watching
with intense solicitude the culmination of their five weeks'
labors; fifteen thousand Union troops stood in hushed
expectancy behind the Union parapets, under orders that the
moment after the explosion they should leap the breast works
and advance across ground upon which, for weeks, certain
death had awaited any man who trod it, and mount into those
lines whence their oft-tried foe had so long hurled defiance.
While this was the condition of the Union troops, the
Confederate infantrymen and cannoneers at the doomed
salient slept on, as the fuse sparkled and 
sputtered inch by inch towards the four tons of
gunpowder which were to rend with the violence of an
earthquake the spot on which they were resting.</p>
        <p>“There she goes!” exclaimed one of the watchers. The ground
trembled for an instant; an immense mass of earth, cannon,
timbers, human beings, and smoke shot skyward, paused for an
instant in mid-air, illumined by the flash of the explosion; and,
bursting asunder, fell back into and around the smoking pit. The
dense cloud of smoke drifted off, tinged by the first faint rays of
sunrise; a silence like that of death succeeded the tremendous
report. Nearly three hundred Confederates were buried in the
debris of the crater; their comrades on
either side adjacent to the fatal spot fled from a sight so much
resembling the day of judgment. To the south of the crater, our
lines were unmanned even as far as our
brigade, and a similar condition existed on its northern
<pb id="wise356" n="356"/>
side; at least three hundred yards of our lines were deserted 
by their defenders, and left at the mercy of the
assaulting columns. Beyond that breach not a
Confederate infantryman stood to dispute their passage
into the heart of Petersburg. A prompt advance in
force, a gallant dash, not into the crater, but around it and three
hundred yards beyond it, would have crowned the great
explosion with a victory worthy of its grandeur. From
the eminence where Blandford church and cemetery,
stood, in rear of the mine, Grant's forces might, within
ten minutes after the mine was sprung, have looked
backward upon the Confederates, stunned, paralyzed
and separated; and, looking forward, they might have
seen the coveted city undefended and at their mercy.</p>
        <p>The imbecility which marked the commencement of
the assault, the folly which crowned its conduct, cannot
be explained save by the incompetency of General
Burnside. What occurred led to a bitter controversy
between himself and General Meade; and General
Grant is upon record as declaring that General Ledlie,
who commanded the leading division, was unfit for the
task assigned to him. Certain it is that General Meade
the commander of the army; ought not to have taken
personal charge of the advance; and equally certain it is
that General Burnside, intrusted with the conduct of a
movement of such moment, ought to have superintended
and led it in person. A soldier like Picton or
Ney, or Stonewall Jackson, or Phil Sheridan, would
never have frittered away an opportunity so glorious by
directing subordinates from a distant position of safety.
One can picture to himself the way in which
any one of a hundred great military lieutenants would
have seen and availed himself of this rare chance for
immortal fame. The very silence of the Confederates
<pb id="wise357" n="357"/>
after the explosion was in itself the loud-mouthed voice of
opportunity calling in tones which military genius would not
have failed to recognize. One can almost see the quick rush
of the assaulting columns through the uncleared smoke of
the crater, as they would have come under a real leader; and
can almost hear their cheering as they mounted the
abandoned trenches, paying no attention to the pit of their
own making, but pressing on beyond it without pause until
in full possession of the position in our rear. The
commanding generals knew the importance of such a course.
General Burnside had explicit instructions to pursue it. If he
had once shown himself at the head of his command, whether
it was organized or disorganized, it might, could, and would have
followed him to his objective point, and could and would
have carried his advantage to its legitimate results. Yet, in the
whole history of war, no enterprise so auspiciously begun
ever resulted in a conclusion more lame and impotent.</p>
        <p>The Union troops designated for the assault, instead
of drawing inspiration from the sight of the breach they had
effected, actually appeared to recoil from the havoc. For some
time no demonstration followed the explosion; when they
finally advanced, it was not with the eagerness of grenadiers
or guardsmen, but with rushes and pauses of
uncertainty; and when they reached our lines, instead of
treating the opening as a mere passageway to their objective
point beyond, they halted, peeped, and gaped into the pit,
and then, with the stupidity of sheep, <hi rend="italics">followed their bell-wethers
into the crater itself</hi>, where, huddled together, all semblance of organization vanished,
and company, regimental, and brigade commanders lost
all power to recognize, much less control, their respective
troops. Meade, from his position a mile away, was
<pb id="wise358" n="358"/>
demanding of Burnside why he did not advance beyond the
crater to the Blandford cemetery. Burnside, safely in the
Union lines, and separated from his assaulting columns, was
replying that difficulties existed,  -  difficulties which he could
not specify, for the double reason that he did not know what
they were, and that they did not in fact exist.</p>
        <p>If he, the well-known corps commander, had but shown
himself and placed himself at the head of his troops, there was
no obstacle in the way of that advance for fully three hours
after his troops were in full possession of our works. True, he
might have been killed; the chance was, however, remote
under the circumstances, but that was a legitimate
contingency connected with the business he had undertaken.
Whether killed or not, his presence would have put his
column in motion and accomplished the object, instead of
leaving his command to headless and huddled disaster. Many
a soldier would have deemed it a privilege to risk his life in
averting the slaughter of that day, and in converting a
threatened rout into a brilliant victory.</p>
        <p>But, if Burnside was deficient on the aggressive, the
Confederate officer in command of the division defending the
position was a Roland for his Oliver.</p>
        <p>Bushrod Johnson held the rank of major-general. How he
gained it, or why he retained it,  -  whether by accident or
favoritism,  -  is unimportant; he had under him as gallant
troops as ever fought. Elliott's South Carolinians, Gracie's
Alabamians, our own beloved brigade were ready to do and
die whenever called upon, and to follow wherever dauntless
leadership directed; but to their division commander they
were almost strangers He selected headquarters at a house in
rear of the lines It was tucked under the hill by the roadside,
just north of the Blandford cemetery, and there he had
remained, vegetating,
<pb id="wise359" n="359"/>
without any friendly intercourse with his command, or
communicating with it save through official channels. Seldom,
if ever, was the man seen in the trenches; he was barely known
by sight to his men; toward him they felt no affection, of his
prowess they had no evidence, and in his ability they felt no
confidence. So slight was the dependence of his brigadiers
upon him, so little their habit of communication, so indifferent
his own conduct, that when General Lee, some hours after the
mine had been exploded, reached General Johnson's
headquarters, Johnson knew no details of the disaster, or of
the disposition made to repair it, although it was his own
division that was involved, and the enemy over the hill was not
four hundred yards distant. If the, enemy had pressed forward
at any time within two hours after the explosion, they would in
all probability have found General Bushrod Johnson in bed.
When General Lee arrived about eight o'clock, he found him
actually ignorant of the peril.</p>
        <p>But the merciful Gods of War, if they permit such people as
Burnside and Johnson to masquerade as military men, atone
for it by furnishing others whose brilliant deeds divert us
from pity for incompetents.</p>
        <p>General Elliott promptly disposed the portion of his brigade
left to him in the traverses commanding the crater; Colonel
Goode, commanding our brigade, concentrated on his left
flank, and with the fragment of Elliott's brigade, which was
driven into ours by the explosion, opened a brisk fire upon the
assailants. From our ten-inch and eight-inch mortars in the
rear of the line, a most accurate fire was opened upon the
troops in the breach; and our batteries to north and south
began to pour a deadly storm of shell and canister upon their
crowded masses. The situation looked desperate for us,
<pb id="wise360" n="360"/>
nevertheless, for it was all our infantry could do to hold their
lines, and not a man could be spared to meet an advance upon
Blandford cemetery heights, which lay before the Union
troops. At this juncture, heroic John Haskell, of South
Carolina, came dashing up the plank road with two light
batteries, and from a position near the cemetery began the
most effective work of the day.</p>
        <p>Exposed to the batteries and sharpshooters of the enemy,
he and his men gave little heed to danger. Haskell, in his
impetuous and ubiquitous gallantry, dashed and dashed
about: first here, next there, like Ariel on the sinking ship. Now
he darted into the covered way to seek Elliott, and implore an
infantry support for his exposed guns; Elliott, responding to
his appeal, was severely wounded as he attempted with a
brave handful of his Carolinians to cover Haskell's position;
now Haskell cheered Lampkin, who had already opened with
his eight inch mortars; now he hurried back to Flanner, where
he had left him, and found him under a fire so hot that in mercy
he resolved to retire all his guns but six, and call for volunteers
to man them, but that was not the temper of Lee's army: every
gun detachment volunteered to remain. Hurrying to the right
again, he found but one group of cowards in his whole
command, and these he replaced by Hampton Gibbs, and
Captain Sam Preston of our brigade, whose conspicuous
bravery more than atoned for the first defection; both fell
desperately wounded, and were replaced by peerless Hampden
Chamberlayne, who left the hospital to hurry to the fight, and
won promotion by the brilliancy of his behavior; again, like
Ariel, Haskell, almost superhuman in the energy of his defense,
“flamed amazement” upon the foe, and staggered him with 
“the fire and crack of sulphurous roaring” until help came. To
whomsoever else honor
<pb id="wise361" n="361"/>
may be due for that day's work, the name of Haskell should
never be dissociated from it, for he was a born and a
resourceful artilleryman, and knew no such thing as fear.</p>
        <p>Where were the Confederate commanders during all this
time? Bushrod Johnson was near by, but nobody considered
him; Generals Lee and Beauregard had their headquarters on
the north side of the Appomattox. It was fully six o'clock before
General Lee heard the news, from Colonel Paul, of
Beauregard's staff! Colonel Paul lived in Petersburg, and,
being at home that night and learning of the disaster, galloped
out and informed General Lee as he was sitting down to his
breakfast. Before Lee even knew of the occurrence, General
Meade had had time to converse with prisoners captured at
the crater, sad to advise Burnside that Blandford cemetery
was unprotected; that none of our troops had returned from
the James; that his chance was <hi rend="italics">now</hi>; and to implore him to
move forward at all hazards, lose no time in making formations,
and rush for the crest.</p>
        <p>General Lee immediately sent Colonel Venable, of his staff,
direct to Mahone, with instructions to come with two
brigades of his division to Blandford cemetery to support the
artillery. The urgency was so great that he did not transmit
the order through General Hill, the corps commander.
Mounting his horse, General Lee proceeded to Bushrod
Johnson's headquarters, which he reached about seven A. M.,
but the information obtained from him was valueless: he knew
nothing of the extent of the disaster, and had not even been
to the front,  -  he probably learned more from General Lee
than he knew himself. Then General Lee was joined by General
Hill, and they passed into the lines at a traverse near the
Rives salient, where Colonel Venable found them sitting.</p>
        <pb id="wise362" n="362"/>
        <p>Meanwhile, Venable had communicated with Mahone and
Mahone, always cunning, had retired his two brigades from the
lines so quietly that General Warren, opposite to him, reported
that no troops had been withdrawn from his front. The Virginia
and Georgia brigades of Mahone's division were the troops
selected. The message to Mahone was to send them, but he
insisted that he should go with them. They passed rapidly by
way of a ravine from Mahone's position on the lines covering
the Jerusalem plank road to a point in rear of the crater. The
Virginia brigade, commanded by Weisiger, led. It was now eight
o'clock. One cannot but think of what might have happened
during all this time, if Burnside had acted upon Meade's urgent
appeals.</p>
        <p>The appearance of this infantry was balm and solace to the
artillery blazing away upon the crest just above them. For
hours they had been fighting there, almost decimated by the
artillery concentrated upon them, and the distant firing of
sharpshooters. They could not have withstood even a feeble
assault of infantry, and had expected it during every minute
they had been engaged: the coming of Mahone was their
deliverance. With but an instant's pause in the ravine to strip
for battle, Mahone's division, headed by their gallant little
general, clambered up the slope, crossed the Jerusalem road,
and passed in single file at double-quick into a covered way.
There was no cheering, and no gaudy flaunting of uniforms
or standards; with them, war's work had become too grim and
too real for all that. In weather-worn and ragged clothes, with
hats whose brims could shade their eyes for deadly aim, with
bodies hardened down by march and exposure to race-horse
lines, they came, not with earnest look or feelings of
mercenaries, but like anxious, earnest men whose souls were
in their work, who knew what the
<pb id="wise363" n="363"/>
crisis was, and who were anxious to perform the task which
that crisis demanded. Agile as cats, they sprang across the
road and entered the covered way; as they skipped by, many a
fellow kissed his hand to the artillerymen to right and left, or
strained on tiptoe to catch sight of the ground in front, before
entering the sheltered passage. For the first time during the
day, a line of infantry was between our guns and the enemy;
and the boys at the guns, knowing what reliance could be
placed upon Mahone's veterans, took new heart and new
courage and pounded away with redoubled energy.</p>
        <p>Venable parted with Mahone at the mouth of the covered
way, and, seeking General Lee, informed him that Mahone was
up, and proposed to lead his two brigades in person. The
general expressed his gratification, and gave a sigh of relief.
Soon leaving the Rives salient General Lee rode to the point in
the covered way at which Mahone had entered, and,
dismounting, proceeded on foot to a house at Lampkin's mortar
battery, about two hundred and fifty yards from the crater. The
house was riddled by shot and shell; from a window in its
basement. Generals Lee and Beauregard observed the fight.
The ground from the crater sloped to the north and west into a
little ravine, into which the covered way, by which Mahone
had entered, debouched; in this hollow Mahone formed his
troops for battle, the Virginia brigade on the left.</p>
        <p>Springing quickly from the covered way, the eight hundred 
Virginians lay flat upon the ground. The Georgians were
forming on their right. Before the Georgians could come into
position, the enemy, occupying our gorge line succeeded in
forming an attacking column, and advanced to the assault.
Weisiger, commanding the Virginians, was a grim, determined
man. Our boys were
<pb id="wise364" n="364"/>
lying down within one hundred and sixty yards of the works,
and saw within them a vast throng of Union troops and
counted eleven Union flags. A gallant Union officer, seizing a
stand of Union colors, leaped upon their breast-works and
called upon his men to charge. Fully realizing the paucity of
his own numbers, and the danger of being overwhelmed by
the mass of the enemy if they poured down upon him,
Weisiger determined to anticipate the threatened movement
by charging. Cautioning his men to reserve their fire, he
ordered them forward. Those who saw this assault pronounce
it to have been, in many respects, the most remarkable which
they ever witnessed. At the command “Forward!” the men
sprang to their feet; advanced at a run in perfect alignment;
absolutely refrained from firing until within a few feet of the
enemy; then, with their guns almost upon the bodies of their
foes, delivered a deadly fire, and, rushing upon them with
bayonets and clubbed muskets, drove them pell-mell back into
the intrenchments which they had just left.</p>
        <p>General Lee, when advised of this brilliant assault,
remarked, “That must have been Mahone's old brigade.” 
When news came confirming it, he again said, “I thought so.”</p>
        <p>My heart beat high when all the army rang with the praises
of “Mahone's old brigade.” Part of them were “our boys”
from Norfolk,  -  many of them little older than myself;
companions, playmates, friends. At the outbreak of the war,
they called them “tender-feet”
and “dandies.” Their uniforms were very smart, and their feet
were very tender. From one of their earlier marches they came
back limping, with their feet bleeding and their shoes upon
their bayonets; the boys named them in derision the “Bloody
Sixth.” But their hearts
<pb id="wise365" n="365"/>
were true, and soon their feet grew tough enough. They were
the sons of the best of the old Tidewater Virginians of English
descent, and, by the time second Manassas and Crampton's
Gap were fought, the “Bloody Sixth,” of “Mahone's old
brigade,” had earned its title by blood from the heart as well
as from the feet. To-day it crowned its record, for old F
Company of Norfolk, now known as K Company, Sixth
Virginia Regiment, a company modeled in happier days after
the aristocratic company of the New York Seventh, took
sixteen men into action and lost every man but one,  -  eight
killed outright and seven wounded.</p>
        <p>In the position gained by Mahone's old brigade, nothing
intervened between them and the enemy but the pile of
breastworks,  -  they on the outside, the enemy within the
crater and gorge line. The fighting by which they established
themselves was desperate and hand-to-hand.</p>
        <p>Superb Haskell once more came to their rescue: he moved
up his little Eprouvette mortars almost to our lines, and,
cutting down his charge of powder to an ounce and a half, so
that his shell scarcely mounted fifty feet, threw a continuous
hail of small shell into the pit, over the heads of our men. Our
fellows seized the muskets abandoned by the retreating
enemy, and threw them like pitchforks into the huddled
troops over the ramparts. Screams, groans, and explosions
throwing up human limbs made it a scene of awful carnage.
Yet the artillery of the enemy searched every spot, and they still had
a formidable force of fighting men.</p>
        <p>The Georgia brigade, charging a little after Weisiger's, was
decimated and repulsed. Our own brigade, which was
engaged from first to last and never yielded a foot of ground,
lost heavily, and Mahone's brigade, the
“immortals” of that day, was almost annihilated. About
<pb id="wise366" n="366"/>
one o'clock, the Alabama brigade of Mahone's division, under
Saunders, arrived upon the scene, formed and charged, and
the white flag went up from the crater. Out of it into our lines
filed as prisoners eleven hundred and one Union troops,
including two brigade commanders, and we
captured twenty-one standards and several thousand of small
arms. Over a thousand of the enemy's dead were in and
about the breach, and his losses exceeded five thousand
effective troops, while our lines were reëstablished just where
they were when the battle began.</p>
        <p>The crater fight was not only one of the bloodiest, but one
of the most brutal of the war. It was the first time Lee's army
had encountered negroes, and their presence excited in the
troops indignant malice such as had characterized no former
conflict. To the credit of the blacks be it said that they
advanced in better order and pushed forward farther than the
whites, on that day so unfortunate for the Union cause; but
when our men, in frenzy, rushed upon and drove the cold steel
into them, they did not show the stubborn power of
endurance for which the Anglo-Saxon is preëminent, nor do I
believe they ever will on any field. On the other hand, our
men, inflamed to relentless vengeance by their presence,
disregarded the rules of warfare which restrained them in
battle with their own race, and brained and butchered the
blacks until the slaughter was sickening.</p>
        <p>At the first report of the battle, my father promptly repaired
to the lines. His interest in and affection for his brigade was
like that of a father for his children; although not in actual
command, the duties of his temporary position were such that
he might with propriety go forth and reassure his own troops
by his presence. Moving out rapidly to the opening of the
covered way
<pb id="wise367" n="367"/>
leading to our brigade, we left our horses and hurried forward
to the lines. We came upon the outer works about midway of
the brigade, and found the troops manning them at intervals
of fully ten feet apart, for the brigade
was massed upon the left in the traverses and covered ways,
firing steadily and rapidly upon the crater. A tremendous
artillery fire from both sides raked the vicinity of the crater,
and the danger to our troops from several of our light
batteries to the north was almost as great as that from the
Union guns. Every shot which missed the crater came
bounding down our lines. Exchanging a
few words with the fearless Goode, who had his troop well in
hand, my father at once proceeded to report the
condition of affairs to General Lee, whom we had seen as
we entered the works, and to order up reinforcement from the
teamsters and cooks at our wagon camp.</p>
        <p>One of the first wounded men we saw was my cousin, “Old
Suggs,” whose eternal talk about the “Adventure
of Simon Suggs” had named the family at the Virginia
Military Institute. Now he was sergeant-major of our left
regiment, and a glancing ball had struck him on an eye tooth
and knocked it out. I presume he had his mouth open,
possibly talking about Simon Suggs. His wound proved
insignificant, but when we met him, he was as bloody as a
butcher's cleaver.</p>
        <p>Hurrying back through the covered way, we overtook
two stretcher-bearers with what seemed to be the dead body
of an officer.</p>
        <p>“Who is it?” exclaimed my father.</p>
        <p>“Captain Preston, of the 34th,” was the reply.</p>
        <p>Removing the handkerchief across his face, we saw that a
minie ball had pierced him over the eye. “Poor fellow,” almost
sobbed my father, as he bent over him,
“gallant and true to the last.” For in the lines we had
<pb id="wise368" n="368"/>
heard how a craven in one of our salients near the Baxter road
had deserted his guns, and Preston had called for volunteers,
manned them, and worked them until he was thus shot down.
He was a handsome fellow as he lay there, apparently dead:
thank Heaven he was not dead but lived to hear the army
resounding with praise of his courage. The minie which
pierced him was in sight, and the surgeons extracted it. He
recovered, and for years after peace returned was clerk of a
court in Lynchburg, where one might see him writing and the
deep scar over his eye, his handsomest dimple, throbbing
with his thoughts as he wrote them down.</p>
        <p>While we were back in the town, hurrying every available
teamster and clerk and cook and man of any kind to the front,
the famous charge of Mahone took place, and others were
reaping the glory of that day. By the time our work was done,
the Alabamians arrived, the surrender occurred, the firing
slacked, and the prisoners came running into our lines from
the ravine. It was a motley gathering, composed of troops,
white and black, from every command and every branch of
service in Burnside's corps. There they were, from the refined
and distinguished-looking General Bartlett, who bore his
misfortune like the Christian gentleman he was, down to the
wildest looking darkey, who expected every moment that he
would be massacred.</p>
        <p>The prisoners were corralled at Poplar Lawn, in Petersburg.
It was soon discovered that nearly all the negroes were
from eastern Virginia, many of them owned by the men they
were fighting. A notice was posted permitting owners to
reclaim their property, and the negroes were delighted at the
prospect of being treated as slaves, instead
of being put to death or sent to a Confederate military 
prison. Some of the reclamations made were drastic,
<pb id="wise369" n="369"/>
some pathetic, and some highly amusing. This last
expression seems out of place in connection with this 
tragedy, but it is true, nevertheless. The negroes had
witnessed such fierce butchery of their companions up
to the time they had raised the white flag, that they were I
frantic with fear, and saw no hope of escape. As they came
running into our lines through the dangers of the firing from
their own friends, they landed among our men, falling on their
knees, their eyes rolling in terror, exclaiming, “Fur God sake,
Marster, doan' kill me. Spar' me, Marster, and I'll wuk fur you as
long as I lib.” “Marster” never fell from their 
poor lips so glibly or so often
in all their lives; and even after they had been with us long
enough to know it was not our purpose to
put them to death, when one of them discovered his real 
“Marster,” he greeted him as if he beheld an angel of
deliverance. According to the story of every mother's
son of them, he was not a volunteer, but had been forced into
the Union service against his will. Of course we knew just
how much of these tales to believe; but it is safe to say that
every master who reclaimed a slave from the Federal
prisoners captured at the crater felt reasonably certain his
man would never again volunteer upon either side in any
war.</p>
        <p>It seems fitting to close this ghastly narrative with one
ludicrous incident, which shows that no situation is so 
bloody or so tragic that it has not some episode to relieve its
horrors. In our brigade was a young fellow who, while fighting
gallantly at the traverse near the crater, received a bullet in the
forearm. His wound was dressed, and he was given a ten
days' furlough. He was from Eastern Virginia, and his home
was in the Union lines. He had no friends, no money, and
nowhere to go. In this condition, he was wandering about the
streets of
<pb id="wise370" n="370"/>
Petersburg the day after the crater fight, when his eye fell
upon the notice to owners that they might reclaim
their slaves from the prisoners. Thinking that possibly he
might find one of his father's slaves among them, he
wandered down to Poplar Lawn. In vain he sought for a
familiar face, and was turning away, when an attractive,
smiling young darkey caught his eye and said, “Boss, fur
God sake, claim me fur yo' nigger.”</p>
        <p>“What do you mean, you rascal? I never saw you
before,” was the reply.</p>
        <p>“I knows it, sah,” said the darkey; 
“but ef I says I belongs
to you, who gwine to dispute it, if you don't?”</p>
        <p>“If I had you, I'd sell you to-morrow,” was the quick reply
of the young fellow, whose eye brightened with a happy
thought.</p>
        <p>“I doan' keer ef you does sell me, sah,” said the darkey. 
“Dat's a heap better den goin' to a Confederick prison pen.”</p>
        <p>“Done!” said the soldier; “when I come back here, you
speak to me and call me ‘Mars' Ben,’ and I'll attend to the
rest.”</p>
        <p>So out he went, and soon came back; and, as he went
searching for his slaves, accompanied by an officer in charge,
the darkey greeted him with “How you do, Mars' Ben?”
Then Ben swore at him, and denounced him for his
ingratitude and desire to kill his master and benefactor and
they carried it off so well that no one suspected the ruse, and
the darkey was delivered to “Mars' Ben”
as his owner, and “Mars' Ben” took him to Richmond and
sold him for $5000 in Confederate money. “Mars Ben” had a
great furlough with that $5000. At the end of ten days, he
returned to duty with a new suit of clothes and fed like a
fighting cock, but without a dollar in his pocket. The darkey
went to some plantation and never
<pb id="wise371" n="371"/>
saw a prison pen, and a year afterwards was a free citizen of
the United States, and probably wound up his career in some
scalawag legislature, or even as a member of Congress,  -  who
knows? Such things were possible in those
days.</p>
        <p>A short while ago, I met Ben. He is gray-headed now. I
asked him where he was going. He said to a protracted
meeting. He told me he had become religious, and said he
wished I would reform.</p>
        <p>“Is it an experience meeting, Ben?” said I.</p>
        <p>“Yes,” said he.</p>
        <p>“Have you ever told them about that darkey you sold after
the crater fight?” said I.</p>
        <p>“Now, look here, old fellow,” said he, growing confidential,
and with a genuine touch of pitiful pleading in his voice, “I
wish you would not give me away about that thing. I have
prayed for forgiveness for that many a night. But I don't
believe the Lord wants me to expose myself before my
neighbors, and I hope you will not.” I agreed to spare him, and
so I will; but, if necessity should demand it, I can put my hand
upon him now, within eight hours' ride from the spot on which

        <head>CHAPTER XXIII</head>
        <head>THE CONFEDERATE RESERVES</head>
        <p>IN September, 1864, the commission as drill-master with
rank and pay of second lieutenant, arrived, accompanied by
orders to report for duty October 1 to Colonel Robert Preston,
commanding a newly organized regiment of reserve forces at
Dublin Depot, in southwestern Virginia. The red seal and
signature of the Secretary of War, and the idea of being
addressed as lieutenant, made their distinct impressions, but
did not overcome the desire to remain with the army at the
front.</p>
        <p>Vain, however, were all pleadings; and even Mahone, when
appealed to intercede for my services, seemed indifferent,
and dwelt upon the honor to be gained by faithful work in
preparing raw troops for actual service, and the duty of
deferring to the judgment and wishes of a parent. It was easy
to see that he and “the old general” had been talking
together since that first meeting.</p>
        <p>When, September 30, I boarded a west-bound train at
Petersburg to join my command, the new, bright bar upon my
collar and gilt scrolls upon my sleeves gave little satisfaction.
I felt as if I had been treated like a baby, tucked away in a
place of safety, and was consenting to turn my back
upon the enemy just when every man was most needed in
Lee's army. And was I not a man? Of course I was. I was
nearly eighteen! When my father parted with me, after much
good advice and an
affectionate farewell, I know it was with the solacing
<pb id="wise373" n="373"/>
reflection that I, at least, was out of harm's way. If such were
his feelings and his purpose, great must have been his
astonishment on opening his first letter from me.</p>
        <p>When the train reached Dublin Depot next morning, I
inquired of a soldier standing on the platform for Colonel
Preston's headquarters. “He was camped on yonder bill,”
said the person addressed; “but him and his regiment left
here last night for Saltville. The Yankees is comin' over the
mountain from Kentucky to the saltworks.”</p>
        <p>Trains did not move, in those times, upon precise
schedules. Ours had not yet pulled out of the depot. It was
in a leisurely way taking on wood and water, and receiving or
discharging army stores. Without another word, I resumed
my place in the car, resolved to follow and
join the regiment. On and on we went, until we came
to Glade Spring Junction, near Abingdon and the Tennessee
line. There, to my great delight, I found Colonel Preston, with
his regiment of nondescripts, waiting for an improvised train
of flat cars, which was to bear them to Saltville, eight or ten
miles distant. Swinging off the car almost before it stopped, I
hurried up to the colonel. I told him who I was. He gave me a
merry and characteristic greeting.</p>
        <p>From the number of Prestons so far mentioned, one might
think this a history of the Preston family. It is, in truth, a large
family, but, so far as I know, none of those referred to were
kin to, or even connected with, each other. This dear old man,
known to everybody in the
army and in his section of the State as “Colonel Bob,” 
was one of the most lovable and unique characters it was
ever my good fortune to be thrown with. He was short, thick-
set, and had an immense snow-white beard, extending nearly
to his sword-belt. He often buttoned it into
<pb id="wise374" n="374"/>
and beneath his coat or waistcoat. When, as on this occasion,
it was unconfined, his appearance, figure, beard, merry
twinkling eye, and ruddy face instantly suggested Santa
Claus.</p>
        <p>At the outbreak of the war, he commanded a regiment in the
Manassas campaign; brave as a lion, he was utterly ignorant
of military tactics; and it was told of him that on one occasion,
when his regiment was attacked in flank while marching in
column of companies, he, after vainly endeavoring to think of
the command by which to wheel by companies into line and
charge the enemy, burst into an explosion of oaths and said, 
“Twenty-eighth! swing around in companies, like gates, and
sick 'em!” On an other occasion, reaching a fence and not
knowing how to defile his troops through an opening, he gave
the following startling order, “Battalion! Oh, battalion! bust
up! climb fence, and line up again on t'other other side!”
These were but samples of the many tales concerning him as a
tactician; notwithstanding these slight defects, Colonel Bob
was honored, respected, and counted one of the gamest
fighters in the army; and nothing but the infirmities of age had
reconciled his beloved “28th” to parting with him.</p>
        <p>When the growing necessities of the war forced upon the
authorities at Richmond the formation of these reserve
regiments, composed of old men and little boys. Colonel Bob
was among the first appealed to for aid in the undertaking, for
no man was more beloved or exercised a stronger influence in
his section.</p>
        <p>The day I joined him, he had a veritable Falstaffian army:
his regiment of eight companies presented every stage of
manhood, from immature boyhood to decrepit old age. One of
his companies drawn up in line looked as irregular as a pile of
barrel-hoops. There was no pretense
<pb id="wise375" n="375"/>
of uniform; they wore everything, from straw hats to coon-
skin caps. A vision of Colonel Bob's regiment 
must have presented itself to the mind of General Grant when
he informed the country that the Confederacy was, like
Micawber, “robbing the cradle and the grave.”</p>
        <p>One thing uniform they had,  -  every man had a Belgian rifle,
and a cartridge-box filled with pretty fair ammunition. To my
surprise, they handled these weapons effectively and most
courageously the following day.</p>
        <p>Nobody realized the ludicrous appearance of his soldiers, or
enjoyed it more thoroughly, than did Colonel Bob. He would
have had a laugh at his own funeral, if opportunity had
occurred. “Look at that!” said he, stroking his beard and
chuckling a comfortable, inside shaking laugh; “look at that!
Your cadets couldn't beat it.” He was pointing to his
command, scrambling pell-mell helter-skelter, upon the dirty
flats which now had been backed up. Two strapping young
fellows were tugging at an old one, who looked as if he would
come to pieces, pulling him up on the car, while a third was
pushing him from behind.</p>
        <p>“Henry!” shouted Colonel Bob, “you must ride Robin and
lead Bob down to the salt-works. Take your time, Henry;
you'll get there as soon as we do, I think. I
must stay with my ragamuffins, Henry; do you understand?”</p>
        <p>Henry was his smiling, handsome, and deferential mulatto
body servant, who looked after his comfort as if the colonel
were a baby. Bob was his strong, blood-bay, half-bred
charger. The way he uttered the word Henry, and the tone in
which he spoke of Bob, showed how he loved them, and how
dependent he was upon them. Both Henry and Bob were very
proud of their master. Henry bowed and smiled, assured him
all would be as he wished,
<pb id="wise376" n="376"/>
and, before departing, whispered to him that he had placed
some food for him in the locker of the caboose car which we
were to occupy.</p>
        <p>“Did you put my bottle of brandy there, Henry?” said the
colonel.</p>
        <p>“Yes, sir,” said Henry, grinning and looking around
suspiciously.</p>
        <p>“Well, don't do it,” said the old man, raising his voice;
“these  -  <hi rend="italics">soldiers</hi> are honest enough about other things,
but the last  -  one of them will steal whiskey, Henry, and you
ought to know that by this time. Fetch it right here and put it
in my haversack; even then it won't be safe.” The old fellow
chuckled and Henry grinned as he tucked the flask snugly
away in the corner of his bag. He was not a hard drinker, or at
all dissipated, but was at his age somewhat dependent upon a
regular stimulant.</p>
        <p>“Boy,” said he, turning to me, for by this time he had
begun to be familiar,  -  “boy, I hope you're not a little
drunkard; it's the meanest, lowest, dirtiest passion in the
world. When a man gets to loving whiskey, he'll steal it from
his best friend.” Then, lowering his voice, he told me it was
not the <hi rend="italics">soldiers</hi> he feared, but one of his officers, who never
left him a drop whenever he could lay hands upon his “poor
little flask.”</p>
        <p>By this time our troops were mounted on the train and, with
a snort and a jerk and a bump and a thousand thumps, we
began the trip to Saltville. After a most uncomfortable ride, we
reached the place. Darkness was upon us. Like other localities
where salt is found, it was a galled, cheerless spot, without
verdure in the vicinity of the wells and troughs and boilers.
The adjacent country was, however, pretty enough, and we
soon found a camp in a neighboring wood. The hills about
Saltville were
<pb id="wise377" n="377"/>
almost as regular as hemispheres; some were prettily
wooded and others were pasture lands to their summits. A mile
below the town flowed the Holston River, which on our side had
high, bluffy banks. The only crossing was at a ford, which was
very defensible. The Union general, Burbridge, with a force
organized in eastern Kentucky, was advancing to destroy these
salt-works, which were important to the Confederacy. We were not well informed
concerning the strength of the expedition, the direction of his
advance, or the troops opposing him. The orders received by
Colonel Preston had simply directed him to report with the
regiment at Saltville as quickly as possible. Now we were to
ascertain the situation.</p>
        <p>By the time we had located our camp, Henry arrived
with the horses. Our headquarters were established under a
wide-spreading sugar-maple, where he proceeded to build a
roaring fire, and spread our blankets upon the first incline of a
hill. After unbuckling his sword and standing it against a tree,
the colonel, seated upon a camp-stool, produced a comb, with
which he caressed his long beard, and proceeded to swear, in
livid and picturesque fluency, about everybody and everything
he knew, without any ill temper or malice whatsoever. Henry
busied himself brewing a pot of tea and preparing a really dainty
meal. He always had a mysterious store of good things supplied
by “Ole Missis,” who warned him to hide them from “Ole
Marster” until used, because she knew he would surely give them away to
some poor soldier, if they came into his possession. 
Whenever provisions ran low, Henry disappeared for a day
or two, and when he returned he came “bearing sheaves.” The
colonel's home in Montgomery County was not so far away
that it was out of striking distance
<pb id="wise378" n="378"/>
of the faithful slave, and there he found “Ole Missis,” one of
God's noblest and best creatures, praying for “Ole Marster”
and preparing comforts for him. Mrs. Preston was known far
and wide as the most devout woman in all the countryside.
She often wept at the unregenerate profanity of her husband,
whose only fault was that inveterate habit.</p>
        <p>Once I asked Henry if the colonel swore at home.</p>
        <p>“Yes, <hi rend="italics">sir</hi>, he do!” said Henry emphatically. “Ole Marster
will cuss anywhar, nothin' kain't stop him. But, Lord,
lieutenant, he doan' mean nothin' by it. Outside of cussin' he's
des as good and des as 'ligious as Ole Missis; and bofe of 'em
gwine to be saved, as sho' as you born, fur Ole Missis prays
enough to wipe out Ole Marster's swearin', an' neither doan'
do no harm in de world, and I know Gord ain't gwine to
separate no such pa'r of people ez dey is, in Heaven.”</p>
        <p>We sat in the cheery light of our camp-fire and refreshed 
ourselves with an excellent cup of tea. The autumn air was
nipping, and the newly risen moon struggled through the
mists which rose from the valley around the salt-wells.</p>
        <p>“How are the horses feeling, Henry?” inquired the colonel.</p>
        <p>“Fuss rate, sir. We tuk it easy comin' down, and they is
fresh as kittens.”</p>
        <p>“Can you ride, young 'un?” said the colonel, turning to
me, as he dropped a coal from his hand into his long pipe and
puffed away contentedly. Assured that I could he directed
Henry to saddle Bob and Robin, and said, “I want to ride out
somewhere and find out something I don't know what we
came here for, or who is coming, or who is going to do the
fighting.”</p>
        <p>We rode out together to the depot. Ascertaining there
<pb id="wise379" n="379"/>
that General Jackson, of Tennessee, called “Mudwall,” as the
commanding officer, we repaired to his headquarters. From
him we soon ascertained what troops were on hand, and the
location of the enemy. During the day, General Jackson's
forces north of the Holston had been skirmishing with
Burbridge's advance, and retiring before him. To-night,
Burbridge was camped a short distance across the river, and
our picket lines were only about three miles from town. Our
main body of cavalry was camped near the ford, and there it
was proposed to give the enemy battle on the morrow.</p>
        <p>Old “Mudwall” was a common-looking man, with a drawl in
his voice, and appeared to be taking things very easy. Still, he
showed courage and intelligence in his dispositions. He told
us he was expecting to be reinforced by Robertson's cavalry,
which was coming up from east Tennessee. He hoped they
would arrive before morning, but intended to fight whether
they reached him in time or not.</p>
        <p>“Kernel,” said he, “my men tell me the Yanks have got a
lot of nigger soldiers along. Do you think your reserves will
fight niggers?”</p>
        <p>“Fight 'em?” said the old colonel, bristling up; “by  -  ,sir
<hi rend="italics">they'll eat 'em up!</hi> No! not eat 'em up! That's too much!
By  -  , sir, we'll cut 'em up!”</p>
        <p>General Jackson explained the plan of battle to Colonel
Preston; showed him how his line of battle would be formed
upon the river, above and below the ford; explained what troops
he proposed to place in front; and then pointed out to us a
little valley on the left of, and at right angles to, the road to the
ford. In that valley we were to take our position in reserve as
soon as the enemy appeared area and firing began. It was but
a short distance from our camp. As we rode homeward, the
colonel visited 
<pb id="wise380" n="380"/>
the ground we were to occupy. It was now bright
moonlight. After going a short distance down the
depression he said, “This place is as snug and safe as a
dovecote. We can sleep here to-morrow until we are ordered
in.”</p>
        <p>He was jolly at the prospect of a fight. I told him what a
good joke on my father I considered it that, sending me
down here to get me out of harm's way, I had come straight to
a battle. He and my father were old and devoted friends. When
he heard that, instead of joining in my laughter, he grew silent,
and at last, with an effort at badinage, he said, “I don't care a  -  
whether <hi rend="italics">you</hi> get shot or not, but, <hi rend="italics">boy</hi>, I would not be
compelled to tell the general about it, if you are hurt, for all the
wealth of the Indies.” The idea seemed to prey upon him. In
the few short hours we had been together, he had evidently
begun to look upon me as his pet. He had few congenial
companions among his rough command, and he preferred
always the society of young people. When we reached camp,
he stood warming himself by the fire, musing, as he held out
his hands to the glare.</p>
        <p>“Fetch my woolen nightcap, Henry,” said he, at last; and,
as he fitted it over his white locks, he gave a sigh, saying, 
“what the devil did they send you here for anyhow? There's
nothing for you to do.” Changing his mood as he turned
towards his pallet, his face broke into a broad grin, and he
exclaimed, “Oh, I know! They sent you to keep my back warm.
I told Kemper I had the rheumatics, and he sent you to
snuggle up to me o' nights. Come on to bed.”</p>
        <p>So, doing as I was bid, I crawled up close to Colonel Bob,
and, for many and many a night thereafter, that was the way
we always fell asleep together. God bless him! I know he is in
heaven. A heart more tender, a soul
<pb id="wise381" n="381"/>
more generous, a courage more dauntless, no man ever
possessed; and in battle, in bivouac, or under his own roof-
tree he was the sweetest old man that ever granted to a young
one the privilege of his instruction and confidence,  -  barring
one fault, that he “swore like our army in Flanders.”</p>
        <p>Up betimes in the morning, we found the road to the ford
filled with cavalrymen. Some had fallen back before the
advance of the enemy; some had arrived from Abingdon
during the night. All were dismounting to fight on foot. Horse
details were leading the beasts back to positions of safety.</p>
        <p>We moved our command out promptly, and defiled to our
assigned position on the left. The hill in our front, on which
our advance line was posted, concealed us completely from
the enemy. Behind us, another hill of unusual
height, cleared on its summit, gave a battery planted there the
range of the ford and of the ground beyond. Our front lines
had not completed their formations on the river bluffs when
we heard first a volley, and afterwards a dropping fire of
musketry. Our pickets beyond the river were engaged, and
falling back before the advancing enemy. Climbing the hill
behind us, the view was excellent.</p>
        <p>Soon our videttes were all safely across the ford and within
our lines, and the next move in the game was to be made by
the enemy. Out he came in due time, in battle array,  -  infantry,
cavalry, and artillery,  -  showing himself 
along the edge of the woods which crowned the slopes
of pasture land beyond the ford.</p>
        <p>“Bang!” went the guns of the battery on the hill behind us,
and a flock of little six-pound shells flew singing
over our heads towards some cavalry debouching from the
woods a mile away. The artillery of the enemy promptly
<pb id="wise382" n="382"/>
took position and delivered a return fire, but was unable to
secure an elevation sufficient to reach our battery.</p>
        <p>Out of sight, fully protected, our regiment lay then between
those dueling batteries. It was very noisy, for the shells of the
enemy exploded in the woods on the hillside in our rear.
Curious to know how our raw recruits
would behave under fire, I returned to where they were and
was much gratified at the spirit of the men, especially the
youngsters. It was with difficulty that the colonel kept them
from scrambling up to the top of the hill in our front to watch
the fight. The men were conducting themselves like veterans.
Many of the boys were sighting their guns, and showing how
they would “shoot a nigger,”
if they had a chance.</p>
        <p>“Where are your field officers, colonel?” said I, observing
that he was the only one upon the ground. “The lieutenant-
colonel is on furlough, and the major cut his foot with an axe
last week, and is in the hospital at Dublin,” said he, apparently
unconscious that their absence made any difference, or
should be supplied. “Say, young'un, you'll have to give
orders to the left side. I'll attend to the right.” By the left side
he meant the left flank of the regiment. He proposed that he
should act as colonel and lieutenant-colonel, and was unconsciously
promoting me to be major.</p>
        <p>“But, colonel,” I protested, “will not your senior captains
take offense that you do not assign them to the positions to
which their rank entitles them?”</p>
        <p>“Shut up!” said he fiercely; “I'm running this regiment
They don't know, and don't care a  -  about that! I know what I want. If you put such notions in
their heads, there'll be no end of trouble here. You go and
do what I tell you! Do you hear?” So off I went, and perched
myself opposite the left battalion.
<pb id="wise383" n="383"/>
I did not know a man in the regiment, or half a dozen officers. It
would not have surprised me to hear them tell me to go to the
devil when I undertook to give them commands. It seems,
however, that they considered me as a <hi rend="italics">member of the
colonel's staff</hi>, and nobody raised any question of
precedence.</p>
        <p>The battle of Saltville was a very pretty affair. The enemy
advanced with great spirit to the attack, but our troops on our
first line had little difficulty in repulsing him. Only once were
we brought under fire. Near midday, some colored troops of
the enemy found a rather open place on the left of our line,
near where the streamlet, coursing through the depression we
occupied, entered the river, at a point where it was shallow
and rocky. They pushed up dangerously near to this possible
crossing, and their bullets began to search our valley. The
officer commanding the line in our front ran down to where we
were asking for reinforcements. Colonel Bob, without a
moment's hesitation, moved our left battalion down the valley
and up the hill.</p>
        <p>There the men laid down on the bluffs, and were hotly
engaged for fifteen minutes, driving the enemy back with a
loss of but one or two of our men. Then we were ordered to
withdraw and resume our place in reserve, and took no further
part in the action.</p>
        <p>The Confederate losses were quite heavy, especially upon
the hill in our immediate front. There Colonel Trimble, in
command, was killed in sight of, and but a
hundred yards in front of, our men. His death was remarkable.
He was standing still, directing the firing of his troops. Of a
sudden he sprang high in the air, with arms and legs extended
at full length. He leaped at least five feet, and fell to the
ground collapsed and stone-dead. We afterwards learned that
he was shot through the heart,
<pb id="wise384" n="384"/>
and were told that this spasmodic action is not at all unusual
in such instances.</p>
        <p>Our forces captured about two hundred prisoners, mostly
wounded. By three o'clock, Burbridge was in full retreat,
pursued by our cavalry. All danger being past, we were
directed the next day to repair to Wytheville and go into camp.
While our reserve regiment had not been seriously engaged,
another regiment of reserves commanded by Colonel Tom
Preston, was in the front line, acquired a great reputation for
its gallantry in the action, and sustained severe losses.</p>
        <p>“Not much of a fight for us,” said Colonel Bob
contemptuously, that night. He seemed graveled at the better
luck of his cousin Tom. His impatience to have a hand in the
sport had given me some very unpleasant moments. All during
the day he would beckon to me to leave my post as major, and,
converting me into a courier for a while, he would send me to
the general with requests for leave to “move up.” The general
was on the other side of the road leading to the ford. The
bullets were singing up that road like bumble-bees, and every
time I crossed it, my heart was in my mouth. My sudden
transitions from major to courier and back again were most
amusing.</p>
        <p>“Well, the Yankees didn't kill papa's little bouncing boy
after all,” said he contentedly, as we hugged up together
under the blankets that night. “I'm glad of it, for you're warm
as a toast, and my back is better already.” I knew how much
stronger his feeling was than he expressed it.</p>
        <p>At Wytheville, the regiment was ordered to drill, and an
additional drill-master arrived. We two toiled away at our
hopeless task of making men sixty years old stand straight
and keep step with sixteen-year-old boys. One day I
suggested to Colonel Bob that, if he would let me
<pb id="wise385" n="385"/>
make up a company of boys by selections from several
companies, I would give him a really efficient company.
He liked the idea, and before long we had a real slashing
company of soldiers, worthy of any regiment.</p>
        <p>About November 1, we were ordered to move to
Christiansburg, and march thence into Floyd County, deserter-
hunting. The mountainous regions of southwest Virginia;
western North Carolina, and east Tennessee were the places
of rendezvous for runaway Confederate soldiers. So numerous
and so bold had they become in Floyd County, Virginia, that
they not only defied arrest, but often formed bands, seized
Confederate supplies, and threatened the property and even
the lives of Confederate soldiers and sympathizers. Our
command was ordered there to break up some of these
organizations, and to capture the ringleaders. It was a
thankless task, but one requiring some ability, and not
unattended with danger.</p>
        <p>Marching out from Christiansburg to a point in the
mountains of Floyd, we went into camp in the very heart of
what was known as Sisson's Kingdom. That was the name of
a large family residing there. Many of them had volunteered,
and then deserted; and now they and their friends held sway,
defied the law, invited other runaways to join them, and
resisted all control of Confederate authority.</p>
        <p>When this state of affairs, extending over a wide stretch of
country, became known to me in the autumn of 1864, it
caused my first misgivings concerning our ultimate success;
it was so widespread, and so strangely in contrast with the
loyalty of the mountaineers in the Revolution, when
Washington proclaimed that to them he looked as his last
reliance in extremity.</p>
        <p>Colonel Preston, notwithstanding his genial nature, was a
man of resources and firmness. If he hated one mean
<pb id="wise386" n="386"/>
thing worse than another, it was a sneak. He counted these
deserters among the most contemptible of the human race;
and, while he was incapable of brutality towards any living
creature, he knew when to be severe, and believed it was
his duty to deal with them summarily, and break them up.</p>
        <p>His first advices upon our arrival were to the effect that our
presence had caused the deserters to abscond. He did not
believe a word of this, but pretended that he did. With great
cunning, he acted as if he proposed making no efforts to
secure them. At the same time, through a well-planned system
of spies, he was ascertaining accurately their
whereabouts and habits. More than once, he sent me many
miles away to receive reports from his spies, so as to avoid
having them seen about our own camp.</p>
        <p>In due time, he was ready to act. The deserters, who had in
fact left their homes when we appeared, began to make their
presence felt. Lured by our apparent indifference, they became
incautious. The old fellow knew the location of the house of
every deserter, and which were ringleaders, and which of them
were at home. He had also located several deserter camps in
the mountains. Now came the part of his plan most difficult of
execution. Awaiting the time when the moon rose late, he
divided several companies of our regiment into small parties
under command of intelligent officers. The men were not told
of the nature of the expedition. Only the officers intrusted with
the work were thoroughly instructed in the locations to be
sought, and the duties to be performed.</p>
        <p>Upon the night selected, we started forth. Those 
having the greatest distances to travel left earliest. The man
whom I was assigned to capture was a notorious fellow,
living about six miles away in a sequestered gorge
<pb id="wise387" n="387"/>
of the mountains, quite remote from any road. I had a party of
ten men. A guide conducted us, and the way in which he
threaded his course in the darkness through a
trackless forest was truly marvelous. Towards midnight he
whispered that we were nearing the deserter's cabin.</p>
        <p>Leaving the men behind us, we approached and walked
around the premises to get the correct location. Returning I
brought the men up and instructed them in their duties. They
were deployed in a circle around the premises and advanced
by signals given from man to man. It was a business 
calculated to make a man's blood run very
chilly. A dog barked! He came bounding out. One of the men
plunged a bayonet into his breast, between
his forelegs, so true that he never yelped or whined.</p>
        <p>“Who's there?” called a sharp, nasal, female voice
from within. No one answered. The words were repeated. I
was to do the talking.</p>
        <p>“Is that Mrs.   -  ?” I asked, as soon as I could control my voice.</p>
        <p>“Yes. Who are you? what do you want?” came
back quickly and excitedly. I dropped to the ground, placed
my ear to it, and was sure I heard shuffling about within the
house, and a sound like that of a closing door.</p>
        <p>When she had repeated her questions, I said quietly,
“We have come to arrest your husband. He need not attempt
to resist or escape. The house is surrounded.”</p>
        <p>Betraying her excitement by her strident answer, she
exclaimed: “William ean't here, thank God, and ean't
bin here for more 'n a month. I hope by this he has
reached the Yankee lines. Thar's whar he started fur, n' whar I
told him to go ef he didn't want to be killed.”</p>
        <p>“You must permit us to search the house, madam,”
as kindly as I could.</p>
        <pb id="wise388" n="388"/>
        <p>“Cert'nly. You kin search the house,” said she; but she
delayed some time before unbolting the door. </p>
        <p>While waiting for admission, I took four men and posted
them opposite the ends and sides of the house, telling them
to watch beneath it, and not to move or utter a word. One of
them sat down on what seemed to be a goods box, about twenty
feet from the gable end of the cabin. Then I detailed two other
men to build a fire in the yard. With the four other men, I entered
the cabin. It was a pathetic sight, and my heart chided me for
the part I bore in it. The woman's teeth were chattering with
excitement and fright. Three children sat up in a trundle-bed.
The poor woman had tried to beat up a feather-bed, and had
drawn the covering over it on one side, so as to give it the
appearance of having had but one occupant; but when I threw
the sheets back, there were the prints of two bodies, and it was
warm on both sides. The babies began to cry. One pleaded, 
“Where's my papa?” The mother hushed its mouth with her
hand.</p>
        <p>There was no doubt about his being there. The only
question was, where was he? Vain was the search in the
closets, under the bed, in the half room under the roof, and up
the chimney. At last we examined the floor, and found a
broad, loose plank. But the ground underneath the plank was
unbroken, and our men could, by the light of the newly-lit fire,
see under the whole structure. In one corner beneath the
house we noticed a pile of loose dirt, but it made no
impression at the time. We had almost abandoned the search,
when, of a sudden, a tremendous hubbub in the yard sent all
of us running there. It was on the dark side of the house. We
heard a stifled cry of “Help! Here he is! Help!” and, as we
came up, we saw two men, half buried in the earth, grappled and
struggling for the possession of a gun.</p>
        <pb id="wise389" n="389"/>
        <p>The deserter, escaping, had run into the arms of my sentinel.
Sitting there on the goods box, watching intently, the sentinel
heard a sound below him. He was an intelligent strapping
youngster of about eighteen. Remembering 
my caution to be quiet, he stepped aside and
listened. A moment later the box tilted towards him, and he
squatted behind it so that it concealed him. He saw the man's
head and shoulders emerge from a hole in the
ground. The deserter passed up his gun, and was scrambling
out of the hole, when the sentinel sprang upon him, and the
struggle in which we found them engaged began. The
deserter was the stronger of the two, and had nearly dragged
the young fellow back into the hole with him when we came
up. The other men promptly lent a helping hand, and we soon
had our prisoner secured.</p>
        <p>He had dug a tunnel under his house, so that when danger
threatened he could drop through the floor, crawl to the
opening of his secret passageway, and, passing through it,
come out beyond the cordon of sentinels and escape. No
one would have suspected that the box in the yard, with its
dirty flooring of planks and grass, was the outlet of his
subterranean gallery. On several previous occasions, he had
eluded arrest in this way. Catching him now was simply
accidental good luck. The fellow yielded without many
words. He was a superb specimen of manhood, and not bad-
looking. When we started away, he said, “Good-by, Sal. See
you ag'in soon, I reckin,” and then he looked at me and laughed, kissed the
children, and said, “Wall, I guess I'm ready.” The woman
had become defiant and abusive, and refused some money
which I offered her.</p>
        <p>The reticence and secretiveness of these people was
surprising. They were fearless, and hated inveterately.
They declined favors of any kind. Before we had gone
<pb id="wise390" n="390"/>
a quarter of a mile, we heard a cow's horn winded from the
cabin. It was the signal of the woman to her friends. It was
almost day when we reached the camp. Several other parties
had returned before us. By eight o'clock, all our raiders were
back. A few had made failures. One party had a sharp fusilade
with the deserters, and had a man wounded. Most of us were
successful, and our expeditions brought an aggregate of
between fifteen and twenty deserters into camp. They were
placed in charge of a strong guard, and sent back to
Christiansburg. Having secured the most notorious of their
leaders we flattered ourselves that we had broken the
back of their rebellion; but in this we deluded ourselves.</p>
        <p>Within a week, the surgeon of the regiment rode out with
me to a farm where we heard we could procure good butter.
As we were returning through a narrow pass, talking 
unconcernedly, and with no thought of danger,
we saw two puffs of smoke away up among the
rhododendrons on the mountain-side, and almost at the same
moment that we heard the reports my horse gave a snort and
plunge, and the doctor exclaimed, “I am shot!” I saw him
seize his bridle with his right arm. We put spurs to our horses,
and galloped out of that pass in a lively way.</p>
        <p>“Hurt much, doctor?” said I.</p>
        <p>“No; but my bridle arm is disabled,” he replied.</p>
        <p>Just as we cleared the pass, my horse, which had been
behaving singularly, stumbled and fell, and I found he was
shot through the body, back of the saddle-skirts. A trail of
blood marked our course along the road. By good luck the
beast belonged to the Confederate states. The doctor
and I lost no time riding home together on his horse. His
arm, although broken, soon healed; but we hunted for no
more butter on that trip to Floyd.</p>
        <pb id="wise391" n="391"/>
        <p>Winter was coming on. We were ordered to return to Dublin
Depot, and to build cabins or shelters for winter quarters. Soon
snow fell, and we entered on a period of dreary inactivity. As
Christmas approached, I obtained a short furlough, glad
enough to return from the mountains to friends and relatives
near Richmond. Two or three days after my departure, the
regiment was again suddenly ordered to Saltville, which
Burbridge captured December 20, with part of our command;
but I did not hear of it until a week after the occurrence.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XX</head>
        <head>THE BEGINNING OF THE END</head>
        <p>HINTS from home indicated that by this time visitors to the
Confederate capital were most welcome when they brought
their rations.</p>
        <p>I had been living in a land of milk and honey. In the rich
pasture lands of the southwest, people were still blessed with
comparative plenty. Their herds of cattle were unexhausted,
and supplied them with abundance of dairy products. Before
starting on furlough, I gathered together quite a supply of
butter, eggs, maple sugar, honey, and other household
comforts. We had no express service, and, to guard against
the plunder of my treasures, I rode with them in a baggage-car.
Butter cost only $8 a pound and eggs were but $3 a dozen, in
southwest Virginia, whereas the prices in Richmond were $25 a
pound and $6 a dozen.</p>
        <p>On arriving in Richmond, I was hailed as a shrewd trader
and rare purveyor. The city, in its chill winter garb, showed
signs of desperate depletion. The problem of sustenance had
become serious, even with the rich.</p>
        <p>The clothing of the most prosperous was simple, domestic, 
even rough. The poorer classes were scantily clad in every
kind of makeshift garment, ofttimes in rags. People without
overcoats met one another upon the streets, and talked over
the prospects of peace, with their teeth chattering, their thin
garments buttoned over their chests their shoulders drawn up,
their gloveless hands sunk deep
<pb id="wise393" n="393"/>
into their pockets for warmth. At meals, the dishes were
few and simple, procured at prices which sound fabulous.
Many a family existed upon little else than bacon and
cornfield peas. General Lee, who had a keen sense of
humor, and who, under less trying conditions, would have
owed his wit to play freely, was once asked by some
idle chatterer who, in his opinion, was the best friend
of the Confederacy. Answering a fool according to his
folly, he replied, with a twinkle of his eye, “The only
unfailing friend the Confederacy ever had was cornfield peas.”</p>
        <p>Many States have chosen flowers as their emblem. Some,
if not all, of the members of the Confederate sisterhood
ought, in gratitude, to select the blossom of the corn-field pea.
Time was when it was their “friend in need
and friend indeed.” Nobody knows how many people in the
Confederacy it kept from actual starvation. I never see a bag
of cornfield peas without feeling like taking off my hat and
saying, “Here is to you and the rest of your
family. May you live long and prosper.”</p>
        <p>Even the banked and economically screened coals in the
grates showed the pinch of hard times. When gas was
produced at all, it was of the most inferior quality, and at
such exorbitant prices that most people were reduced to the
use of tallow candles.</p>
        <p>Hospitable friends, with ample means, were ashamed
to invite visitors to share their humble fare. Long lines
of stores were closed: there was nothing to sell. Cigars of
ordinary quality were $10 each, and whiskey was $5 a
drink. I needed a uniform coat. After diligent bargaining I 
engaged one at $2000, payable on delivery. My
pay was $120 a month, but I borrowed the money, ordered the 
coat, and had to wait a month for it. A man who
brought articles through the Union lines, by making trips
<pb id="wise394" n="394"/>
in a canoe across the Chesapeake Bay, procured a black felt
hat for me. I considered it a bargain when he delivered it for
$100. I bought some leather from a tan-vat while in southwest
Virginia, and the making of the boots with my own leather cost
me $150.</p>
        <p>The town was filled with hospitals. Several of then took
their names from the people whose houses had been devoted
to these uses. Many ladies had volunteered as matrons, and
even as attendants. It was part of the daily life of Richmond for
women to save something from their scant sustenance, and
take or send it to the sick and wounded. One devoted woman
so distinguished and endeared herself to everybody by her
self-sacrifice that the name of Sally Tompkins is known to the
Confederate as well as Florence Nightingale to the British, or
Clara Barton to Americans. She was commissioned a captain.
and the boys all call her, even now, “Captain Sally.”
God will make her an officer of higher grade.</p>
        <p>My father had long since rejoined his brigade. They were
now transferred to the right of our army at Hatcher's Run. The
privations and sufferings which officers and men were
undergoing were very fearful. They were huddled in snow
and mud, without adequate supplies of food or fuel or
clothing. I went out to the camp, but had not heart to remain
long. The struggle was no longer a test of valor in excitement:
it had become one of inactive endurance.</p>
        <p>The Confederate authorities had adopted the policy of
enlisting negro troops. One sunny afternoon I visited the
Capitol Square, and witnessed the parade and drill of
a battalion of Confederate darkeys. The sight was in strange
contrast with other parades I had witnessed there,  -  that, for
example, of the New York Seventh in 1858
or of the cadets, even, in the preceding May.</p>
        <pb id="wise395" n="395"/>
        <p>“Ah!” I thought, “this is but the 
beginning of the end.”</p>
        <p>Yet were there thousands  -  many of them old, many of them
actually pale from insufficient nutriment, many of them
without money or employment to provide for present or
future  -  who still believed that the Confederacy would achieve
its independence.</p>
        <p>The Confederate Congress passed resolutions of hope, and
sent orators to the trenches and camps to tell the soldiers that
“the darkest hour was just before day.” One of these blatant
fellows I recall particularly. He had been a fire-eater, a nullifier,
a secessionist, a blood-and-thunder orator, foremost in urging
that we “fight for our rights in the Territories.” He was a
young man, an able bodied man, and a man of decided ability.
But never for one moment was his precious carcass exposed
to danger. There was something inexpressibly repulsive to me,
and irritating beyond expression, when I saw men like this,
from their safe places, in a lull in hostilities, ride down to
the Confederate lines during that awful winter, and counsel
our poor soldiers to fight on. Even if it was right to fight on,
they had no right to advise it. Old Jubal Early had opposed
the war until it actually came upon him, but
when it was inevitable, he fought. Things were turning out
just as he had predicted they would. When these people,
whose extravagant oratory had done so much to
bring on the fight, and who had then contributed nothing of
personal service to sustain it, came among his starving men to
urge them to sacrifices which they themselves had
never made, he treated them with undisguised scorn. He refused
to attend their meeting. From the door of his hut he blistered
them with his biting satire:  -  </p>
        <p>“well  -  ” he shouted; “still sicking them
on are ye?” “Before you leave, tell them what
<pb id="wise396" n="396"/>
you think of your rights in the Territories now.” “One day out
here with a musket would help the cause more than all your
talk.” “Don't talk the men to death. You can't talk the Yankees
to death. Fighting is the only thing that talks now.”</p>
        <p>“Old Jubal” had his faults, but skulking in bomb proofs was
not one of them. The men had implicit faith in his unflinching
courage. He punctured and embalmed the lip-service of these 
“last ditchers,” as he called them and his soldiers, taking the cue
from him, hooted and derided them, and long resented their
unwelcome intrusion.</p>
        <p>Yet have I lived to see fellows of that very class and coterie
successfully pose as surviving representatives of the
Confederate cause, and avail themselves of the false
assumption to belittle the loyalty and service of real 
Confederate soldiers, because, forsooth, those true and tried men,
long after the Confederate cause was dead and buried, dared to
differ from them on current policies.</p>
        <p>Let us turn to the more interesting description of social
conditions at Richmond during the last days of the
Confederacy.</p>
        <p>It is a merciful provision of Providence which supplies
diversion to mankind in the most desperate of situations. In the
beleaguered capital, even amid the darkest hours of our
fortunes, there were hearts throbbing with old emotions which
banish thoughts of grief; and places where people met, clothed
in the impenetrable armor of youth and joy, to dance and laugh
adversity to scorn. War, pestilence, and famine are impotent to
slay, infect, or starve the little naked archer.</p>
        <p>Richmond was filled with young girls betrothed to young
officers in the trenches about that city and Petersburg. It was
not surprising, for never did a city of its population contain
more beautiful and brilliant women than did Richmond at that
time.</p>
        <pb id="wise397" n="397"/>
        <p>The wedding bells chimed merrily in the wintry air for the
coming nuptials of Colonel William B. Tabb, 59th Virginia
Infantry, Wise's Brigade, and Miss Emily Rutherford.</p>
        <p>The Tabbs were among the oldest people of Tidewater, and
the Rutherfords were of the best of Richmond's earliest
business men. Colonel Tabb was a tall, brown-eyed winsome
youth of twenty-eight, whose gallantry on many a field gave
him more than ordinary title to his stars, and whose modesty
and gentleness had brought him troops of friends.</p>
        <p>Emily Rutherford, with her peach-bloom cheeks and
great, wondering, fawn-like eyes, was “queen of the rose
bud garden of girls” of her own circle; and Mr. and Mrs.
Rutherford presided over a home proverbial for its hospitality,
even at a time when the hunger and thirst of Richmond
society was abnormal.</p>
        <p>Thus, from every point of view, whether of pride in Tabb, or
love for Emily, or the hungry hopes and trust of society in the
gastronomic abilities of the old folks, all things conspired to
make the approaching wedding the social event of the season.</p>
        <p>The scene at the church was far more brilliant than one
would fancy it could be after the descriptions given. Few girls
with any social pretensions in Richmond had failed to wheedle
or cajole some admiring blockade-running magnate into
fetching them a silk or ribbon or feather from the outside world
for this occasion. These blockade-runners were the only
nabobs in the place: carrying their fortunes, their liberty, and
sometimes their lives in their hands, they alone seemed
possessors of the secret wherewith, even amidst poverty and
want, to conjure up wealth and luxury. They still wore
broadcloth and fine linen, drank French brandy, and smoked black
<pb id="wise398" n="398"/>
cigars. To them, and them alone, could bride and brides maids,
matron and maid, look for the brave toggery so essential upon
occasions like this; and the sea-dogs had not failed their fair
dependents.</p>
        <p>To me, the Tabb-Rutherford nuptials was an event of a
lifetime; it had been years since I had seen such a gorgeous
function. Nothing like it had been possible in Presbyterian
Lexington, or the Petersburg front, or in the western Virginia
mountains. Not only was it to seal the happiness of two dear
friends, not only were the brave and young to be there, but it
was to be a notable assembling of the great! What was I to
wear?</p>
        <p>I had a pair of “captured” trousers, originally destined for a
private in the Union army, now converted into a Confederate
officer's best attire. Pretty fair trousers they were, worn with a
long-tailed coat, but unfit for use with a jacket. My boots,
which cost me so much in the making were finished, but of fair
leather; that was a small matter: lamp-black and oil were still
plentiful, and, after half an hour of hard work, they shone black
and resplendent. But my $2000 coat: it was only in embryo.
There was no hope of its being finished in time. What was to
be done? Coats were coats in those days, and not to be found
hanging on every bush. Vainly, here and there, I sought for the
wedding garment. Every one whose coat might fit me was as
intent as myself upon attending that entertainment.</p>
        <p>We were talking it over at the mess, when, to my great relief,
Barksdale Warwick, one of my father's aids, took me aside and
whispered to me that he would be on duty the day of the
wedding, and, if I could use it, I might wear his new coat. Now
“Barkey” was a first lieutenant in the 
“Canaries,” as we called
the staff, while I was only a subaltern in the “Blues,” as they
dubbed
<pb id="wise399" n="399"/>
the infantry: arrayed in his coat with buff trimmings, with
infantry stripes on my trousers, my attire would indeed be
somewhat incongruous. President Davis, or the Secretary of
War, if there, might, on close scrutiny, wonder what branch
of service I represented. But these were minor
considerations, for I was going to that ball,
and this was my last chance.</p>
        <p>The real question was not one of style, but one of fit. Ay,
there was the rub! for Barksdale Warwick was fully six feet
high, and thin as a riding-whip, while I was short, and plump
as a partridge. But I gratefully accepted a note to his mother,
and, on the day of the wedding, marched proudly to my
lodgings with the coveted
article under my arm.</p>
        <p>It was not without grave misgivings that I stepped forth
attired for the wedding. The length of Barksdale's waist was
such that the bottom buttons of that coat somewhat
constrained the movement of my hips; the coat-tails nearly
reached my ankles; as for the sleeves, I was fortunate to get
occasional glances at my finger-tips. The whole effect was to
give me the appearance of a giant in body, a dwarf in legs,
and an unfortunate rate who had lost both hands. As I came
downstairs, drawing on a pair of new white thread-gloves, a
married sister nearly paralyzed me by a well-intended
compliment upon my “nice new overcoat,” and my witty wag
of a sister, whose escort I was, shrieked with merriment at my
remarkable attire.</p>
        <p>But what cared I? I would have gone in a meal-sack. The
larger the coat, the better; it gave more commodious
opportunity to fill it with Mr. Rutherford's good cheer. At
church, the judicious handling of a military cape veiled
somewhat this extraordinary outfit; but when the house was
reached, no subterfuges longer availed. We
<pb id="wise400" n="400"/>
stood revealed and undisguised, such as we were. If my
appearance was extraordinary, in the vernacular of to-day, 
“there were others.” The men had misfits of many
makes; some even displayed patches. As for the costumes
of the ladies, they were wonderful to behold They seemed to
have ransacked every old trunk in the garrets of Richmond,
and some had actually utilized the lace and damask window-
curtains of peace times. But a jollier and happier seeming
throng was never assembled.</p>
        <p>Tent-flies inclosed the large rear veranda, where a military 
band was stationed; holly and all kinds of evergreen had been
used for decoration. The bride and groom received under
an immense wedding bell of evergreens, a token of love for
their colonel, made with their own hands, from the bushes
growing about them, by the men of Tabb's regiment. Who
were there? Everybody that was anybody.</p>
        <p>There was Mr. President Davis: he was assuredly a very
clean-looking man; his manners were those of a dignified
gracious gentleman accustomed to good society. He claimed
his tribute kiss from the bride, and well he might, for seldom
had he culled one more sweet or pure. From the blushing girl
he turned with a gracious compliment to her husband: “For a
bribe like that, colonel, you may demand a week's extension of
your leave.” Tabb, with his hazel eyes, his red-brown hair and
beard, and two brilliant hectic spots glowing upon his cheeks,
towered above him, smiling, bowing, and supremely happy.
Mr. Davis looked thin and careworn. Naturally refined in
his appearance, his hair and beard were bleaching rapidly; and
his bloodless cheeks and slender nose, with its clear-cut, flat
nostril, gave him almost the appearance of emaciation. Yet his
eye was bright, his smile was winning, and manner most
attractive. When
<pb id="wise401" n="401"/>
he chose to be deferential and kindly, no man could excel him.
When strongly moved, few men of his day surpassed him in
eloquence. On occasion, he could touch the popular heart with
a master hand. On his arm was Mrs. Davis, his very opposite in
physique, looking as if, to use an old expression, “the gray
mare was the better horse.” Physically, she was large and
looked well fed. Among us “irreverents,” it was believed that
Mrs. Davis possessed great influence over her husband, even
to the point that she could secure promotion for us, if she liked.</p>
        <p>She was intensely loyal to him, took no pains to conceal her
pride in him, and was, perhaps, a trifle quick to show
resentment towards those not as enthusiastic as she thought
they should be in their estimate of his abilities. She had, among
those who knew her best, warm, enthusiastic friends.</p>
        <p>Close upon these came young Burton Harrison, the
President's private secretary, looking like a fashion-plate in his
perfect outfit. Harrison was popular, and everybody had some
cordial inquiry as to how he maintained such an immaculate
wardrobe, when all the world besides was in rags. Speaking a
gracious word here and there as he passed on, he soon joined
willowy Connie Cary for a waltz.</p>
        <p>When Breckinridge, Secretary of War, strode up, he brought
the perfume of Kentucky Bourbon with him. As he and Tabb
stood side by side, one thought of the widespreading forest
oak topping up beside the slender pine. There was the
frankness of the soldier, the breadth of the statesman, the
heartiness and courtesy to woman, of the Southern man of the
world, in his every look and word.</p>
        <p>The oleaginous Benjamin, Secretary of State, next glided in,
his keg-like form and over-deferential manner
<pb id="wise402" n="402"/>
suggestive of a prosperous shopkeeper. But his eye redeemed
him, and his speech was elegantly polished even if his nose
was hooked and his thick lips shone red amidst the curly black
of his Semitic beard. Tabb looking down upon him, suggested
a high-bred greyhound hound condescending towards a very
clever pug.</p>
        <p>Then bluff old Secretary Mallory of the Navy came,  -  with
no studied speech, but manly, frank, and kind,  -  one of the
most popular members of the Confederate Cabinet. After him,
Postmaster-General Regan, of Texas, a large, plain looking
citizen, of more than ordinary common sense, but ill at ease in
gatherings like this, and looking as if he might have left his
carry-log and yoke of oxen at the door.</p>
        <p>And so it went. There was Olivero Andrews, the most
insinuating beau of the capital; and Cooper de Leon, the poet,
wit, and wag; and John M. Daniel, the vitriolic editor of the
“Examiner,” whose mission seemed to be to torture the
administration with the criticism of his scathing pen; and Willie
Myers, soldier, dandy, dilettante artist, and exquisite; and the
pompous fellow, blazing with gilt, and bearded like a pard,
derisively called “the Count,” who was best known for his
constant absence from the front without leave when his
command was engaged; and Baron Heros von Boerck, a giant
German, who had come to fight as a volunteer upon Jeb
Stuart's staff. O Vanity Fair of the dead Confederacy! How
your actors troop before me once again!</p>
        <p>“Who is the red-headed fellow with the voice like a
foghorn?” I asked of a companion, as I pointed to a young
subaltern standing in a group of men and women, who were
convulsed at some extravagant story he was telling.</p>
        <p>“Tom Ochiltree, of course,” said she. “He is the
<pb id="wise403" n="403"/>
young Texan who distinguished himself at the battle of
Valverde, and afterwards as volunteer aid to Longstreet in the
seven days' fighting. He is the most unique character in
Richmond, and is counted one of the bravest fellows and
truest friends, and at the same time one of the drollest
raconteurs, in all the world.” A fresh peal of merriment from the
throng about him almost drowned her last words.</p>
        <p>“And who is the classic-looking young fellow near him,
with the scars upon his face?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“That is Clarence Prentice,” she said; “the oddest fish in all
the Confederacy. The scars you see are souvenirs of
Heidelberg, not wounds received in battle, although he has
been in many fights. He looks like a poet or musician, but that
man is everything: he plays divinely, speaks many tongues, is
an exquisite dancer, sings like an angel, gets drunk, kills men,
gambles, and is altogether startling. According to the mood in
which you find him, he is a gentleman or ruffian, athlete, all
round sportsman, exquisite, desperado, or eccentric.”</p>
        <p>“And who are the ladies of the coterie?”</p>
        <p>“Oh,” she said, “that is what we call the White House set.
The two large girls in white are the Misses Howell, sisters of
Mrs. Davis. The handsome blonde is the daughter of Senator
Wigfall, of Texas; the striking girl in pink is Miss Campbell,
daughter of the Confederate Chief Justice, Judge Campbell, of
New Orleans.”</p>
        <p>“And who is this Burmese elephant?” I asked, as men and
women fell back before a great waddling mass of obesity, who,
in gray clothes and not over-neat linen, came elbowing his way
into the room, puffing like a porpoise.</p>
        <p>“That,” said she, “is General Humphrey Marshall, of
Kentucky. They say he was a brave general, and is a shrewd
and brilliant politician; in fact, almost a statesman.
<pb id="wise404" n="404"/>
He is at present in the Confederate Congress. His chief
prominence now is as the most inveterate gambler and
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">bon-vivant</foreign></hi> in Richmond. He is the man who stakes
thousands on the turn of a card, and, while waiting lights
his $10 cigars with $5 Confederate bills.”</p>
        <p>In this grand rush of humanity there was more than
life enough, and enough that was startling; but how in
contrast with the gentle, elevating refinement of bygone
days! The grosser breath of war had penetrated even to
the innermost circle of society, and given it a heat and
noise and indiscriminateness which, to speak mildly, was
new, and by no means an improvement upon old
manners and old customs.</p>
        <p>As I saw them, it seemed to me that the men intrusted
with the civic administration of the Confederate
government were not of as fine clay as her immortal
soldiers, nor was it, I believe, a mere boyish fancy. Time
has deepened the impression.</p>
        <p>The crush was becoming less dense. The older folk
remained but a little while. The numbers of the guests
necessitated providing refreshments for the most
distinguished and the elderly people first, and for the
young folk a little later.</p>
        <p>The President and his cabinet had disappeared. The
stars of the generals went one by one into eclipse behind
the doors of the banquet-halls. Even colonels were rare.
Majors, captains, and lieutenants were of the grades
whence drafts were made for dancers, and here and
there might even be seen a saucy private; for, in our
army, many a private soldier was socially the peer of
anybody.</p>
        <p>A band of musicians with stringed instruments filed
into the drawing-rooms when they were sufficiently
cleared of the crowd to admit of dancing. Taking their
position
<pb id="wise405" n="405"/>
 in a corner, the tuning and preliminary flourishes
began, and people sought their partners for the cotillion.</p>
        <p>Until now, I had felt abashed by the presence of
distinguished people and superior officers; but when it
came to dancing, I considered that I was in my proper
element. Recollections of cadet triumphs were still fresh.
So forth I sallied for a partner. Meanwhile, a dreamy
waltz floated through the rooms, and the “White House
set” led off. Most striking among them was that Porthos
Von Boerck dancing with one of the lovely Carys. But
more striking still were the remarkable sounds which he
emitted when the dance was finished. Von Boerck, while
riding with Stuart, had been shot through the windpipe.
The injury caused him, when breathing hard, to utter a
sound like that made by a “roaring horse.” After the
violent exercise of waltzing, in defiance of instructions
from his surgeon, the great rosy fellow stood leaning
against a pillar, fanning his flushed face, and emitting this
remarkable noise. His fair companion was at first
alarmed. When assured that it was not dangerous, and
would cease in a few moments, her sense of the ludicrous
overcame both her fear and her sympathy, and she called
to her companions to “come and hear Von Boerck
whistle.” Poor Von Boerck! That most amiable and brave
fellow-universal favorite for both qualities among the
girls  -  was nearly overcome by this ridiculous exposure.
As the laughing maidens congregated about him, he grew
red, and protested, in his awkward German way: “Oh-h!
Whew-w!  -  I beg you  -  whew-w!  -  spare me  -  whew-w!”
But they did not spare him, and clapped their little
hands with merriment. At last, roaring, and enjoying his
own discomfiture as much as anybody, he burst through
their ranks, and fled to the cool veranda to recover his
composure and allow his whistle to subside.</p>
        <pb id="wise406" n="406"/>
        <p>My efforts to secure a partner were futile in several
directions. Nearly all the girls had escorts. Several looked
askance and declined, in a way which made me doubt
whether my costume was altogether a success. Just as I was
growing despondent, our gracious hostess apt approached
and said, “Come with me. I have a charming partner for you.”
Then, threading our way to a corner, I was presented.
Charming the young lady was, beyond question; and
desirable, no doubt, in many ways; but candor compels the
admission that she was older than myself, and not beautiful.
And her dress? Oh, that costume! Shall I ever forget it?</p>
        <p>Experience had not taught me then how dangerous thing it
is to permit a hostess, when the music has struck up and the
sets are actually forming, to seize one an drag him to a 
“charming” girl. A year in society, nay a month, teaches us
that “charming” girls of that description have some
inherent disqualification; for the young and pretty never
have to invoke the aid of the hostess at so late an hour.</p>
        <p>There she was, however, and it was too late to recede even
if I had wished to do so. I did not wish to recede. Why should
I? She was gracious, refined, and not a whit more anxious for a
partner than I was myself. Oh yes, our families were intimate.
Yes, I was aware that she knew my sisters. I did not mention
that I knew she was schoolmate of an elder sister, now
married. We were out for pleasant, not for unpleasant,
speeches. Thus we chatted as we stood waiting in our places
in quadrille.</p>
        <p>I could not help observing her costume. Indeed, herself
told me that the dress was her grandmother's, worn when La
Fayette came to Richmond in 1824. She had discovered it in
an old trunk. I think I never saw
<pb id="wise407" n="407"/>
anything either before or afterwards, exactly like it. I cannot,
for lack of technical knowledge, correctly describe female
attire, but from such vague efforts as I make, those versed in
costuming may gain some idea concerning it.</p>
        <p>First of all, the lady, viewed laterally, was the flattest lady I ever
beheld. Viewed from front or rear, she was, beyond unusually
wide. The laced bodice was cut with becoming modesty about
the neck, but that same bodice ran downward to a point,
until I thought it would never stop. I think that, in the vernacular
of the times of its construction, it was called a stomacher. Viewed
from rear, never a another back was so long, unless it was my own
in Barksdale Warwick's coat. At the hips, the dress rose up in 
fluffs. In coloring and texture, it resembled certain flowered 
goods I have since seen used in upholstering parlor furniture.
The head-gear accompanying it was indescribable able. Maybe it
was Pompadour. There were ostrich feathers with it. I think she
said she wore prunella slippers. Possibly it was some other kind.
All this I saw and learned as we were waiting for the music to
strike up. More I saw, and I heartily wish I had not, for it cost me a
newly formed and valued friendship. As we stood there waiting,
two mischievous girls  -  one a blonde, the other a brunette, the
brightest pair of wags and wits in Richmond  -  were leaning over
a large sofa at the further end of the room. They had preferred not
to dance. There they stood watching, laughing, giggling,
observing everything thing that was grotesque, and making
comments which were simply convulsing to all hearers. They were
my choicest intimates. At an unlucky moment, I caught wicked
eyes. They were carefully dissecting the appearance of my
partner and myself. Knowing what was coming, with a pleasant
reprobatory smile I pleaded
<pb id="wise408" n="408"/>
with my eyes that they should not laugh at us, as if to say “I
don't mind it for myself, but the lady is a comparative stranger,
and you must not embarrass her.”</p>
        <p>I might as well have tried to check the incoming tide. They
had seen us. They were watching us, wild with merriment.
They were pointing at us. They were attracting the
attention of others to us. I saw it. I knew intuitively the
inimitably funny things they were saying. Their mirth was
infectious, and I was scarce able to give heed to the polite
speeches my companion was making, or to suppress the
rebellious twitchings of my mouth. But I did not quite realize
how absurd our appearance really was. Thus charged with
merriment, I bowed, as the music sounded for the dance.</p>
        <p>A scream behind us nearly threw me off my balance. My
partner, all unconscious of the by-play, was serene and
gracious. On the opposite wall hung an old-fashioned mirror,
slightly convex, ornamented with a spread-eagle over its top. It
shone like burnished steel, but it was so tilted against the wall
that one could only see one's self when near the middle of the
room. “Balance to the centre.” We were doing famously.
Holding her tiny hand, we balanced forth. She was speaking
low, and was saying something very captivating. I had
regained control of my risibles. Oh! why did I look up?
Why did I catch, in that old mirror, the full reflections of
ourselves? The effect was irresistible. I gave one fatal
snort,  -  that snort which is so deadly to all check of mirth
when we are striving hardest to control ourselves. I was
hopelessly gone. I clapped both hands to my face, and
laughed and laughed until the tears ran down my cheeks.</p>
        <p>Wonder, perplexity, wrath, in turn came over the face of my
partner. She could not understand. I could not
<pb id="wise409" n="409"/>
explain. We finished the figure in silence. At its conclusion,
she asked that I take her to some friends. She bowed frigidly to
me, as if to say, “Go!” and go I went. She never again so
much as nodded her head to me. I rushed back to my
tormentors to reproach them. They called me “Wheelbench,”
and laughed anew. It was the name of a certain breed of little
vagabond dogs noted for their long bodies and short legs. My
rage only added fuel to the flames of their ridicule. Never did
such an attired pair dance together, I ween. Never were there
such hilarious spectators.</p>
        <p>A Cruikshank, a Nast, a Davenport might have supplied
himself for life with caricatures at that memorable gathering.
For myself, I danced no more that night.</p>
        <p>About midnight, a new and distinct coterie of guests arrived.</p>
        <p>They were a party of <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">bon-vivant</foreign></hi> friends of the host. By
one means or another, this band secured the best to be had.
To this feast of their companion, each and all had made their
contribution. And now they had come to join him in
celebrating the happy event of his daughter's marriage, and to
partake of his good cheer.</p>
        <p>There was big John Carvell, the Canadian blockade-runner,
who had sent a few bottles of champagne,  -  a luxury then
almost beyond price; and Major Robert Ould, the Confederate
Commissioner of Exchange of Prisoners, who never failed to
secure for himself, on his trip down the river to meet the Union
Commissioners of Exchange, an ample supply of the best food
and drink; and Major “Buck” Allen, of Claremont, whose
cellars were still unexhausted; and young Hatch, of Missouri,
Assistant Commissioner of Exchange; and Major Legh Page,
and Major Isaac Carrington, of the Subsistence Department.</p>
        <p>There was an air of business about these men. They
<pb id="wise410" n="410"/>
had come for good cheer. What of creature comforts they did not
secure was simply not to be had. What this party enjoyed in their
private room, what cigars they smoked, what games they played
with their host, how long they stayed, is beyond my ken. All that
we lesser lights knew was that they had the reputation of being
the only habitually well-fed and luxurious citizens of 
Richmond. </p>
        <p>Supper for the general public was announced in due time,
and, doubt it as you may, it was a sumptuous repast.</p>
        <p>There were no sweets and ices, such as are seen in piping 
times of peace. But there was ornamentation! The pyramids,
built of little balls of butter, were really pretty. They towered
like the spun sugar, and nougat, or divided oranges, we see to-
day. And great piles of rosy apples gave color to the feast.
Terrapin, canvas-back ducks, patés, and the like were missing.
Our friends, the enemy, had even cut us off from oysters. But
there were turkeys and hams and delicious breads, and most
beautifully stuffed eggs, and great piles of smoking sausages,
and dishes of unsurpassed domestic pickles. There were no
oils for salads, no sugar for preserves. Some one had given the
bride a wedding present of coffee, and the rooms were filled
with its delightful aroma. This we drank sugarless, with great
gusto. Great bowls of apple toddy, hot and cold, filled with
roasted pipping, stood on the tables, and furnished all needful
warmth and cheerfulness for any wedding feast.</p>
        <p>So you see, dear readers, that, even to the last, there were
times and places in the Confederacy where we got together and
did like other and more prosperous folk,  -  “Eat, drink, and be
merry, for to-morrow you die.”</p>
        <p>In the gray of a winter morning, the cold bright stars
<pb id="wise411" n="411"/>
twinkling above us, we men and women sought our homes
afoot. Vehicles and horses were not to be had for love or
money. Gathering their dainty skirts about them, matron and
maid, who in other days had never walked three blocks away
from home, picked their way through the deserted streets,
laughing over the delightful scenes they bad left behind. They
laid their heads upon their pillows that night, happy, not
discontented, because of the sacrifices they had made for a
cause we all loved.</p>
        <p>“Eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow ye die.” Let us not
inquire how many of the gallant souls who laughed and danced
and ate and drank that night fulfilled the whole prophecy in the
whirlwind of war which swept from Richmond to Petersburg, from
Petersburg to Appomattox, in the next three months. The story is
sad enough without such details.</p>
        <p>“Eat, drink, and be merry, for to-morrow ye die.” Within five
years from that joyous night, the blooming bride was laid to
rest in her Confederate wedding-gown. Within a decade, her
parents, host and hostess of that night, slept side by side in
the cemetery at Hollywood; and the soldier-groom, spared by
the bolts of war, but undermined in health by the exposure of
the camp, lost a sweet life for a cause which was already lost.</p>
        <p>The places which knew them know them no more. Their
names are almost forgotten now, under the rule of another
king that knew not Joseph.</p>
        <p>So wags the world away.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXV</head>
        <head>THE END IN SIGHT </head>
        <p>AT the time of the evacuation of Richmond, in 1865, I had
been in the Confederate army for about ten months, had
reached the mature age of eighteen, and had attained the rank
of lieutenant. I was for the time at Clover station on the
Richmond and Danville Railroad, south of the fallen capital. A
light glimmered in headquarters and at the telegraph station.
Suspecting that news of importance had been received, and
knowing the telegraph operator well, I repaired to his office. He
was sitting at his instrument, closely attentive to its busy
clicking.</p>
        <p>“Any news, Tom?” inquired I.</p>
        <p>Holding up his hand he said, “Yes! hush!” and continued
to listen. Then, seizing his pad and pencil, he
wrote rapidly. Again the clicking of the instrument
began, and he resumed his attitude of intent listening.
He was catching messages passing over the lines to 
Danville. During a lull, he informed me that heavy fighting
on the right of the army at Five Forks had been going
on all day, in which the slaughter on both sides had been
very great, and that there were reports of the evacuation
of Petersburg. Repairing to the quarters of General
Walker, I found that he had substantially the same 
advices. Vainly and despondently we waited until late
night for more particulars.</p>
        <p>Sunday morning broke clear and calm. It was one the first of
those heavenly spring days which to me seem
<pb id="wise413" n="413"/>
brighter in Virginia than elsewhere. Sitting in a sunny spot
near the telegraph station, a party of staff officers waited for
telegrams until nearly eleven o'clock. Then a storm of news
broke upon us, every word of which was freighted with deep
import to our cause.</p>
        <p>Click  -  click  -  click. “Our lines in front of Petersburg were
broken this morning. General Lee is retiring from the city.”</p>
        <p>Click  -  click  -  click. “General A. P. Hill was killed.”</p>
        <p>Click  -  click  -  click. “Colonel William Pegram of the
artillery also killed.”</p>
        <p>Click  -  click  -  click. “In the battle of Five Forks, which
continued until long after dark last night, Pickett
was overwhelmed by Sheridan with a greatly superior force of
cavalry and infantry, and the enemy is now endeavoring to
turn our right, which is retiring toward
the Appomattox, to make a stand there.”</p>
        <p>Click  -  click  -  click. “Petersburg is evacuated. Our army in
full retreat toward Burkeville.”</p>
        <p>Click  -  click  -  click. “General Lee has notified the
President that he can no longer hold Richmond, and
orders have been issued for the immediate evacuation of
the city. The town is the scene of the utmost turmoil
and confusion.”</p>
        <p>General Walker issued the necessary commands to place our own
house in order. There was not much to be done. Such government
stores and provisions as were at our post were promptly put on
freight cars, and every preparation was made for an orderly
departure, if necessary. We expected that Lee would make a stand at
or near Burkeville, forty miles distant, and that, if he must, he would
retreat along the line of the Richmond and Danville Railroad. From the
accounts of the fighting, I felt 
<pb id="wise414" n="414"/>
sure that my father's command was in the thick of it; and this
fear gave an added trouble to the gloomy reflections
of those sad hours.</p>
        <p>When we recall the way in which the most startling events
in our lives have happened, we note how differently they
unfolded themselves from our previous thought of them. Nay,
more: we all recall that when great events which we had
anticipated as possible or probable, have actually begun to
occur, we have failed to recognize them So it was now with me.
That the war might end disastrously to the Confederacy, I had
long regarded as a possibility; that our army was sadly
depleted and in great want, I knew; but that it was literally
worn out and killed out and starved out, I did not realize. The
idea that within a week it would stack arms at Appomattox,
surrender, and be disbanded did not enter into my mind even
then. I still thought that it would retreat, and, abandoning
Richmond, fall back to some new position, where it would
fight many other battles before the issue was decided.</p>
        <p>A few hours later, train after train, all loaded to their utmost
capacity with whatever could be transported from the doomed
capital, came puffing past Clover Station on the way
southward. These trains bore many men who, in the
excitement, were unwilling to admit that all was lost. They
frankly deplored the necessity of giving up the Confederate
capital, but insisted that the army was not beaten or
demoralized, and was retreating in good order. They argued
that Lee, relieved of the burden of defending his long lines
from Richmond to Petersburg, and of the hard task of
maintaining his communications, would draw Grant away from
his base of supplies, and might now, with that generalship of
which we all knew him to be master, be free to administer a
stunning if not a crushing blow to
<pb id="wise415" n="415"/>
Grant in the open, where strategy might overcome force.
These arguments cheered and revived me. I hoped it might so
turn out. I dared not ask myself if I believed that it would.</p>
        <p>Monday morning, April 3, a train passed Clover bearing the
President, his Cabinet and chief advisers, to Danville. They had
left Richmond after the midnight of that last Sunday when Mr.
Davis was notified, while attending St. Paul's Church, that the
immediate evacuation of the city was unavoidable. Mr. Davis sat
at a car window. The crowd at the station cheered. He smiled
and acknowledged their compliment, but his expression
showed physical and mental exhaustion. Near him sat General
Bragg, whose shaggy eyebrows and piercing eyes made him
look like a much greater man than he ever proved himself to
be. In this car was my brother-in-law, Dr. Garnett, family
physician to Mr. Davis. I entered, and sat with him a few
minutes, to learn what I could about the home folk. His own
family had been left at his Richmond residence, to the mercy of
the conqueror. The presidential train was followed by many
others. One bore the archives and employees of the Treasury
Department, another those of the Post Office Department,
another those of the War Department. I knew many in all these
departments, and they told me the startling incidents of their
sudden flight.</p>
        <p>I saw a government on wheels. It was the marvelous and
incongruous debris of the wreck of the Confederate capital.
There were very few women on these trains, but among the last
in the long procession were trains bearing indiscriminate
cargoes of men and things. In one car was a cage with an
African parrot, and a box of tame squirrels and a hunchback!
Everybody, not excepting the parrot, was wrought up to a pitch
of intense excitement. The last arrivals brought the sad news
that Richmond
<pb id="wise416" n="416"/>
was in flames. Our departing troops had set fire to the
tobacco warehouses. The heat, as it reached the hogs
heads, caused the tobacco leaves to expand and burst their
fastenings, and the wind, catching up the burning tobacco,
spread it in a shower of fire upon the doomed city. It was after
dark on Monday when the last train from Richmond passed
Clover Station bound southward. We were now the northern
outpost of the Confederacy. Nothing was between us and the
enemy except Lee's army, which was retreating toward us,  -  if
indeed it were coming in this direction. All day Tuesday, and
until midday Wednesday, we waited, expecting to hear of the
arrival of our army at Burkeville, or some tidings of its whereabouts. 
But the railroad stretching northward was as silent as
the grave. The cessation of all traffic gave our place a
Sabbath stillness. Until now, there had been the constant
rumble of trains on this main line of supplies to the army.
After the intense excitement of Monday, when the whole
Confederate government came rushing past at intervals of a
few minutes, the unbroken silence reminded one of death
after violent convulsions.</p>
        <p>We still maintained telegraphic communication with
Burkeville, but we could get no definite information 
concerning the whereabouts of Lee. Telegrams received
Tuesday informed us he was near Amelia Court House.
Wednesday morning we tried in vain to call up Amelia Court
House. A little later, Burkeville reported the wires cut at
Jetersville, ten miles to the north, between Burkeville and
Amelia Court House. When General Walker heard this, he
quietly remarked, “They are pressing him off the line of this
road, and forcing him to retreat by the Southside Road to
Lynchburg.” I knew the topography of the country well
enough to realize that if the army passed Burkeville Junction,
moving westward, our position
<pb id="wise417" n="417"/>
would be on the left flank and rear of the Union army, and
that we must retire or be captured. Many
messages came from Mr. Davis at Danville, inquiring for
news from General Lee. Shortly after General Walker reported
that the wires were cut at Jetersville, another
message came from Mr. Davis. He asked if General Walker had
a trusted man or officer who, if supplied with an engine,
would venture down the road toward Burkeville endeavor to
communicate with General Lee, ascertain from him his
situation and future plans, and report to the President. I was
present when this telegram arrived. By good luck, other and
older officers were absent. The suspense and inactivity of the
past three days had been unendurable, and I volunteered
gladly for the service. At first, General Walker said that I was
too young; but after considering the matter, he ordered me to
hold myself in readiness, and notified Mr. Davis that he had
the man he wanted, and requested him to send the engine. The
engine, with tender and a baggage car, arrived about eight P. M.</p>
        <p>General Walker summoned me to headquarters, and gave me
my final instructions. Taking the map, he showed me that in all
probability the enemy had forced General Lee westward from
Burkeville, and that there was danger of finding the Union
troops already there. I was to proceed very slowly and
cautiously. If the enemy was not in Burkeville, I must use my
judgment whether to switch my train on the Southside Road
and run westward, or to leave the car and take a horse. If the
enemy had reached Burkeville, as he feared, I was to run back
to a station called Meherrin, return the engine, secure a horse,
and endeavor to reach General Lee. “The reason that I suspect
the presence of the enemy at Burkeville,” said he,“ is that this
evening, after a long silence, we have
<pb id="wise418" n="418"/>
received several telegrams purporting to come from General 
Lee, urging the forwarding of stores to that point. From the
language used, I am satisfied that it is a trick to capture the
trains. But I may be mistaken. You must be careful to ascertain
the facts before you get too close to the place. Do not allow
yourself to be captured.</p>
        <p>The general was not a demonstrative man. He gave me an
order which Mr. Davis had signed in blank, in which my name
was inserted by General Walker, setting forth that, as special
messenger of the President, I was authorized to impress all
necessary men, horses, and provisions to carry out my
instructions. He accompanied me to the train, and remarked
that he had determined to try me, as I seemed so anxious to go;
that it was a delicate and dangerous mission, and that its
success depended upon my quickness, ability to judge of
situations as they arose, and powers of endurance. He ordered
the engineer, a young, strong fellow, to place himself implicitly
under my command. I threw a pair of blankets into the car,
shook hands cordially with the general, buttoned my papers in
my breast pocket, and told the engineer to start. I did not see
General Walker again for more than twenty years.</p>
        <p>I carried no arms except a navy revolver at my hip, with
some loose cartridges in my haversack. The night was chilly,
still, and overcast. The moon struggled out now and then from
watery clouds. We had no headlight, nor any light in the car. It
seemed to me that our train was the noisiest I had ever heard.
The track was badly worn and very rough. In many places it
had been bolstered up with beams of wood faced with scrap
iron, and we were compelled to move slowly. The stations were
deserted. We had to put on our own wood and water. I lay
down to rest, but nervousness banished sleep. The
<pb id="wise419" n="419"/>
solitude of the car became unbearable. When we stopped at a
water-tank, I swung down from the car and clambered up to
the engine. Knowing that we might have to
reverse it suddenly, I ordered the engineer to cut loose
the baggage car and leave it behind. This proved to be wise
precaution.</p>
        <p>About two o'clock, we reached Meherrin Station, twelve
miles south of Burkeville. It was dark, and the station
was deserted. I succeeded in getting an answer from an
man in a house near by, after hammering a long time
upon the door. He had heard us, but he was afraid to
reply.</p>
        <p>“Have you heard anything from Lee's army?” I asked.</p>
        <p>“Naw, nothin' at all. I heerd he was at Amelia Cote
House yisterday.”</p>
        <p>“Have you heard of or seen any Yankees hereabouts?”</p>
        <p>“None here yit. I heerd there was some at Green Bay
yisterday, but they had done gone back.”</p>
        <p>“Back where?”</p>
        <p>“I dunno. Back to Grant's army, I reckin.”</p>
        <p>“Where is Grant's army?”</p>
        <p>“Gord knows. It 'pears to me like it's everywhar.”</p>
        <p>“Are there any Yankees at Burkeville?”</p>
        <p>“I dunno. I see a man come by here late last evenin',
he said he come from Burkeville; so I reckin there weren't
none thar when he lef', but whether they is come
sence, I can't say.”</p>
        <p>I determined to push on. When we reached Green Bay,
eight miles from Burkeville, the place was dark and
deserted. There was nobody from whom we could get
information. A whippoorwill in the swamp added to the
oppressive silence all about. Moving onward, we
discovered as we cautiously approached a turn in the road
near Burkeville, the reflection of lights against the low
<pb id="wise420" n="420"/>
hanging clouds. Evidently, somebody was ahead, and
somebody was building fires. Were these reflections from the
camp-fires of Lee's or of Grant's army, or of any army at all? On
our right, concealing us from the village and the village from
us, was a body of pine woods. Not until we turned the angle of
these woods could we see anything. I was standing by the
engineer. We were both uncertain what to do. At first, I
thought I would get down and investigate; but I reflected that
I should lose much time in getting back to the engine, whereas,
if I pushed boldly forward until we were discovered, I should
be safe if those who saw us were friends, and able to retreat
rapidly if they were enemies.</p>
        <p>“Go ahead!” I said to the engineer.</p>
        <p>“What, lieutenant? Ain't you afraid they are Yankees? If
they are, we're goners,” said he hesitatingly.</p>
        <p>“Go ahead!” I repeated; and in two minutes more we were at
the curve, with the strong glare of many fires lighting up our
engine. What a sight! Lines of men were heaving at the rails by
the light of fires built for working. The fires and working parties
crossed our route to westward, showing that the latter were
devoting their attention to the Southside Road. In the
excitement of the moment, I thought they were destroying the
track. In fact, as I afterward learned, they were merely changing
the gauge of the rails. Grant, with that wonderful power he
possessed of doing everything at once, was already altering
the railroad gauge so as to fetch provisions up to his army. The
enemy was not only in Burkeville, but he had been there all day,
and was thus following up his occupation of the place. Lee
must be to the north or to the west of him, pushed away from
Danville Road, and either upon or trying to reach the Southside
Railroad, which led to Lynchburg. All these things I thought
out
<pb id="wise421" n="421"/>
a little later, but not just at that moment. A blazing meteor
would not have astonished our foes more than the sight of our
locomotive. They had not heard our approach, amid the noise
and confusion of their own work. They had no picket out in our
direction, for this was their rear. In an instant, a number of
troopers rushed for their horses and came galloping down
upon us. They were but two or three hundred yards away.</p>
        <p>“Reverse the engine!” I said to the engineer. He seemed
paralyzed. I drew my pistol.</p>
        <p>“It's no use, lieutenant. They'll kill us before we get under
away,” and he fumbled with his lever.</p>
        <p>“Reverse, or you're a dead man!” I shouted, clapping
the muzzle of my pistol behind his ear. He heaved at the lever;
the engine began to move, but how slowly! The troopers were
coming on. We heard them cry, “Surrender!” The engine was
quickening her beats. They saw that we were running, and they
opened fire on us. We lay down flat, and let the locomotive go.
The fireman on the tender was in an exposed position, and
seemed to be endeavoring to burrow in the coal. A shot broke a
window above us. Presently the firing ceased. Two or three of
the foremost of the cavalrymen had tumbled into a cattle-guard,
in their reckless pursuit. We were safe now, except that the
engine and tender were in momentary danger of jumping the
rotten track.</p>
        <p>When we were well out of harm's way, the engineer, with whom
I had been on very friendly terms til this last episode, turned to
me and asked, with a grieved look, “Lieutenant, would you have
blowed my brains out sure 'nuff if I hadn't done what you tole
me?”</p>
        <p>“I would that,” I replied, not much disposed to talk; for I was
thinking, and thinking hard, what next to do.</p>
        <p>“Well,” said he, with a sigh, as with a greasy rag he
<pb id="wise422" n="422"/>
gave a fresh rub to a piece of machinery, “all say is,
I don't want to travel with you no mo'.”</p>
        <p>“You'll not have to travel far,” I rejoined. “I'll get off at
Meherrin, and you can go back.”</p>
        <p>“What” exclaimed he. “You goin' to get off there in the
dark by yourself, with no hoss, and right in the middle of the
Yankees? Durn my skin if I'd do it for Jeff Davis hisself!”</p>
        <p>Upon our arrival at Meherrin, I wrote a few lines to General
Walker, describing the position of the enemy and telling him
that I hoped to reach General Lee near High Bridge by
traveling across the base of a triangle formed by the two
railroads from Burkeville and my route, and that I would
communicate with him further when I could.</p>
        <p>It was a lonesome feeling that came over me when the
engine went southward, leaving me alone and in the dark at
Meherrin. The chill of daybreak was coming on, when I
stepped out briskly upon a road leading northward. I knew
that every minute counted, and that there was no hope of
securing a horse in that vicinity. I think that I walked three or
four miles. Day broke and the sun rove before I came to an
opening. A kind Providence must have guided my steps, for at
the very first house I reached, a pretty mare stood at the horse-
rack saddled and bridled, as if waiting for me. The house was
in a grove by the roadside. I found a hospitable reception, and
was invited to breakfast. My night's work had made me ravenous.
My host was past military age, but he seemed dazed at
the prospect of falling into the hands of the enemy. I learned
from him that Sheridan's cavalry had advanced nearly to his
place the day before. We ate breakfast almost in silence. At
the table I found Sergeant Wilkins of the Black Walnut
Troop, from Halifax County.
<pb id="wise423" n="423"/>
He had been on “horse furlough.” Confederate cavalrymen
supplied their own horses, and his horse furlough
meant that his horse had broken down, that he had been
home to replace it, and that he was now returning to duty with
another beast. His mare was beautiful and fresh,  -  the very
animal that I needed. When I told him that I must take his
horse, he laughed, as if I were joking; then he positively
refused; but finally, when I showed the sign manual of
Jefferson Davis, he yielded, very reluctantly. It was perhaps
fortunate for Sergeant Wilkins that he was obliged to go home
again, for his cavalry command was engaged heavily that day,
and every day thereafter, until the surrender at Appomattox.</p>
        <p>On the morning of April 6, mounted upon as fine a mare as
there was in the Confederacy, I sallied forth in search of
General Lee. I started northward for the Southside Railroad. It
was not long before I heard cannon to the northeast. Thinking
that the sounds came from the enemy in the rear of Lee, I
endeavored to bear sufficiently westward to avoid the Union
forces. Seeing no sign of either army, I was going along
leisurely, when a noise behind me attracted my attention.
Turning in my saddle, I saw at a distance of several hundred
yards the head of a cavalry command coming from the east,
and turning out of a cross-road that I had passed into the road
that I was traveling. They saw me, and pretended to give
chase; but their horses were jaded, and my mare was fresh and
swift. The few shots they fired went wide of us, and I galloped
out of range quickly and safely. My filly, after her spin, was
mettlesome, and as I held her in hand, I chuckled to think how
easy it was to keep out of harm's way on such a beast.</p>
        <p>But this was not to be my easy day. I was rapidly
approaching another road, which came into my road from
<pb id="wise424" n="424"/>
the east. I saw another column of Union cavalry filing into my
road, and going in the same direction that I was going. Here
was a pretty pickle! We were in the woods. Did they see me?
To be sure they did. Of course they knew of the parallel column
of their own troops which I had passed, and I think they first
mistook me for a friend. But I could not ride forward: I should
have come upon the rear of their column. I could not turn back:
the cavalry force behind was not a quarter of a mile away. I
stopped, thus disclosing who I was. Several of them made a
dart for me; several more took shots with their carbines; and
once more the little mare and I were dashing off, this time
through the woods to the west.</p>
        <p>What a bird she was, that little mare! At a low fence in the
woods she did not make a pause or blunder, but cleared it
without turning a hair. I resolved now to get out of the way, for
it was very evident that I was trying to reach General Lee by
riding across the advance columns of Sheridan, who was on
Lee's flank. Going at a merry pace, just when my heart was
ceasing to jump and I was congratulating myself upon a lucky
escape, I was “struck flat aback,” as sailors say. From behind a
large oak a keen, racy-looking fellow stepped forth, and,
leveling his cavalry carbine, called “Halt!” He was not ten
feet away.</p>
        <p>Halt I did. It is all over now, thought I, for I did not doubt that
he was a Jesse scout. (That was the name applied by us to
Union scouts who disguised themselves in our uniform.) He
looked too neat and clean for one of our men. The words “I
surrender” were on my lips, when he asked, 
“Who are you?” I
had half a mind to lie about it, but I gave my true name and rank.
“What the devil are you doing here, then?” 
he exclaimed, his
whole manner changing. I told him. “If that is so,” 
<pb id="wise425" n="425"/>
said he, lowering his gun, to my great relief, “I must help to get
you out. The Yankees are all around us. Come on.” He led the
way rapidly to where his own horse was tied behind some
cedar bushes, and, mounting, bade me follow him. He knew the
woods well. As we rode along, I ventured to inquire who he
was. “Curtis,” said he,  - “one of 
General Rooney Lee's scouts.
I have been hanging on the flank of this cavalry for several
days. They are evidently pushing for the High Bridge, to cut
the army off from crossing there.”</p>
        <p>After telling him of my adventure, I added: “You gave me a
great fright. I thought you were a Yankee, sure, and came near
telling you that I was one.”</p>
        <p>“It is well you did not. I am taking no prisoners on this trip,”
he rejoined, tapping the butt of his carbine significantly.</p>
        <p>“There they go,” said he, as we came to an opening and saw
the Union cavalry winding down a real-clay road to the north of
us, traveling parallel with our own route. “We must hurry, or
they'll reach the Flat Creek ford ahead of us. Fitz Lee is
somewhere near here, and there'll be fun when he sees them.
There are not many of them, and they are pressing too far
ahead of their main column.”</p>
        <p>After a sharp ride through the forest, we came to a wooded
hill overlooking the ford of Flat Creek, a stream which runs
northward, entering the Appomattox near High Bridge.</p>
        <p>“Wait here a moment,” said Curtis. 
“Let me ride out and see
if we are safe.” Going on to a Point where he could reconnoitre,
he turned back, rose in his stirrups, waved his hand, and crying,
“Come on, quick!” galloped down the hill to the ford.</p>
        <p>I followed; but he had not accurately calculated the
<pb id="wise426" n="426"/>
distance. The head of the column of Union cavalry was
in sight when he beckoned to me and made his dash.
They saw him and started toward him. As I was 
considerably behind him, they were much nearer to me
than to him. He crossed safely, but the stream was deep,
and by the time I was in the middle, my little mare doing
her best with the water up to her chest, the Yankees
were in easy range, making it uncomfortable for me. The
bullets were splashing in the water all around me. I
threw myself off the saddle, and, nestling close under the
mare's shoulder, I reached the other side unharmed.
Curtis and a number of pickets stationed at the ford
stood by me manfully. The road beyond the ford ran into
a deep gully and made a turn. Behind the protection of
this turn, Curtis and the pickets opened fire upon the
advancing cavalry, and held them in check until I was
safely over. When my horse trotted up with me, wet as a
drowned rat, it was time for us all to move on rapidly. In
the afternoon, I heard Fitz Lee pouring hot shot into that
venturesome body of cavalry, and I was delighted to
learn afterward that he had given them severe
punishment.</p>
        <p>Curtis advised me to go to Farmville, where I would
be beyond the chance of encountering more Union
cavalry, and then to work eastward toward General Lee.
I had been upset by the morning's adventures, and I was
somewhat demoralized. About a mile from Farmville, I
found myself to the west of a line of battle of infantry,
formed on a line running north and south, moving toward
the town. Not doubting they were Union troops, I
galloped off again, and when I entered Farmville I did
not hesitate to inform the commandant that the Yankees
were approaching. The news created quite a panic.
Artillery was put in position and preparations were made
to
<pb id="wise427" n="427"/>
resist, when it was discovered that the troops I had seen
were a reserve regiment of our own, falling back in line
of battle to a position near the town. I kept very quiet
when I heard men all about me swearing that any
cowardly, panic-stricken fool who would set such a
report afloat ought to be lynched.</p>
        <p>I had now very nearly joined our army, which was
coming directly toward me. Early in the afternoon, the
advance of our troops appeared. How they straggled,
and how demoralized they seemed! Eastward, not far
from the Flat Creek ford, a heavy fire opened, and
continued for an hour or more. As I afterward learned,
Fitz Lee had collided with my cavalry friends of the
morning, and, seeing his advantage, had availed himself
of it by attacking them fiercely. To the north, about four
o'clock, a tremendous fire of artillery and musketry
began, and continued until dark. I was riding towards this
firing, with my back to Farmville. Very heavy detonations
of artillery were followed time and again by crashes of
musketry. It was the battle of Sailors' Creek, the most
important of those last struggles of which Grant said, 
“There was as much gallantry displayed by some of the
Confederates in these little engagements as was
displayed at any time during the war, notwithstanding the sad
defeats of the past weeks.” My father's command was
doing the best fighting of that day. When Ewell and
Custis Lee had been captured, when Pickett's division
broke and fled, when Bushrod Johnson, his division
commander, left the field ingloriously, my fearless father,
bareheaded and desperate, led his brigade into action at
Sailors' Creek, and, though completely surrounded, cut
his way out, and reached Farmville at daylight with the
fragments of his command.</p>
        <p>It was long after nightfall when the firing ceased. We
<pb id="wise428" n="428"/>
had not then learned the particulars, but it was easy to see that
the contest had gone against us. The enemy had, in fact, at
Sailors' Creek, stampeded the remnant of Pickett's division,
broken our lines, captured six general officers, including
Generals Ewell and Custis Lee, and burned a large part of our
wagon trains. As evening came on, the road was filled with
wagons, artillery, and bodies of men, hurrying without
organization and in a state of panic toward Farmville. I met two
general officers, of high rank and great distinction, who seemed
utterly demoralized, and they declared that all was lost. That
portion of the army which was still unconquered was falling
back with its face to the foe, and bivouacked with its right and
left flanks resting upon the Appomattox to cover the crossings
to the north side, near Farmville. Upon reaching our lines, I
found the divisions of Field and Malone presenting an
unbroken and defiant front. Passing from camp to camp in
search of General Lee, I encountered General Mahone, who
told me where to find General Lee. He said that the enemy had 
“knocked hell out of Pickett.” “But,” he added savagely, “my
fellows are all right. We are just waitin for 'em.” And so they
were. When the army surrendered three days later, Mahone's
division was in better fighting trim and surrendered
more muskets than any other of Lee's army.</p>
        <p>It was past midnight when I found General Lee. He
was in an open field north of Rice's Station and east of
the High Bridge. A camp-fire of fence-rails was burning 
low. Colonel Charles Marshall sat in an ambulance,
with a lantern and a lap-desk. He was preparing orders
at the dictation of General Lee, who stood near, with
one hand resting on a wheel and one foot upon the end
of a log, watching intently the dying embers as he spoke
in a low tone to his amanuensis.</p>
        <pb id="wise429" n="429"/>
        <p>Touching my cap as I rode up, I inquired, “General Lee?”</p>
        <p>“Yes,” he replied quietly, and I dismounted and explained
my mission. He examined my autograph order from Mr. Davis,
and questioned me closely concerning the route by which I
had come. He seemed especially interested rested in my report
of the position of the enemy at Burkeville and westward, to the
south of his army. Then, with a long sigh, he said: “I hardly
think it is necessary to prepare written dispatches in reply.
They may be captured. The enemy's cavalry is already flanking
us to the south and west. You seem capable of bearing a verbal
response. You may say to Mr. Davis that, as he knows, my
original purpose was to adhere to the line of the Danville Road.
I have been unable to do so, and am now endeavoring to hold
the Southside Road as I retire in the direction of Lynchburg.”</p>
        <p>“Have you any objective point, general,  -  any place where
you contemplate making a stand?” I ventured timidly.</p>
        <p>“No,” said he slowly and sadly, “no; I shall have to
be governed by each day's developments.” Then, with a touch
of resentment, and raising his voice, he added, “A few more
Sailors' Creeks and it will all be over  -  ended  -  just as I have
expected it would end from the first.”</p>
        <p>I was astonished at the frankness of this avowal to one so
insignificant as I. It made a deep and lasting impression on me.
It gave me an insight into the character of General Lee which
all the books ever written about him could never give. It
elevated him in my opinion more than anything else he ever
said or did. It revealed him as a man who had sacrificed everything to perform a
conscientious duty against his judgment. He had loved the
Union. He had believed secession was unnecessary; he
<pb id="wise430" n="430"/>
had looked upon it as hopeless folly. Yet at the call of his
State he had laid his life and fame and fortune at her
feet, and served her faithfully to the last.</p>
        <p>After another pause, during which, although he spoke
not a word and gave not a sign, I could discern a great
struggle within him, he turned to me and said: “You must
be very tired, my son. You have had an exciting day. Go
rest yourself, and report to me at Farmville at sunrise. I
may determine to send a written dispatch.” The way in
which he called me “my son” made me feel as if I
would die for him.</p>
        <p>Hesitating a moment, I inquired, “General, can you give
me any tidings of my father?”</p>
        <p>“Your father?” he asked. “Who is your father?”</p>
        <p>“General Wise.”</p>
        <p>“Ah!” said he, with another pause. “No, no. At
nightfall, his command was fighting obstinately at Sailors'
Creek, surrounded by the enemy. I have heard nothing
from them since. I fear they were captured, or  -  or  -  
worse.” To these words, spoken with genuine sympathy,
he added: “Your father's command has borne itself nobly
throughout this retreat. You may well feel proud of him
and of it.”</p>
        <p>My father was not dead. At the very moment when
we were talking, he and the remnant of his brigade were
tramping across the High Bridge, feeling like victors, and
he, bareheaded and with an old blanket pinned around
him, was chewing tobacco and cursing Bushrod Johnson
for running off and leaving him to fight his own way out.</p>
        <p>I found a little pile of leaves in a pine thicket, and lay
down in the rear of Field's division for a nap. Fearing that
somebody would steal my horse, I looped the reins
around my wrist, and the mare stood by my side.
<pb id="wise431" n="431"/>
We were already good friends. Just before daylight, she
gave a snort and a jerk which nearly dislocated my arm,
and I awoke to find her alarmed at Field's division,
which was withdrawing silently and had come suddenly
upon her. Warned by this incident, I mounted, and
proceeded toward Farmville, to report, as directed, to
General Lee for further orders. North of the stream at
Farmville, in the forks of the road, was the house then
occupied by General Lee. On the hill behind the house,
to the left of the road, was a grove. Seeing troops in this
grove, I rode in, inquiring for General Lee's
headquarters. The troops were lying there more like
dead men than live ones. They did not move, and they
had no sentries out. The sun was shining upon them as
they slept. I did not recognize them. Dismounting, and
shaking an officer, I awoke him with difficulty. He
rolled over, sat up, and began rubbing his eyes, which
were bloodshot and showed great fatigue.</p>
        <p>“Hello, John!” said he. “In the name of all that is
wonderful, where did you come from?” It was
Lieutenant Edmund R. Bagwell, of the 46th. The men, a
few hundred in all, were the pitiful remnant of my
father's brigade.</p>
        <p>“Have you seen the old general?” asked Ned. “He's
over there. Oh, we have had a week of it! Yes, this is
all that is left of us. John, the old man will give you
thunder when he sees you. When we were coming on
last night in the dark, he said, ‘Thank God, John is out of
this!’ Dick? Why, Dick was captured yesterday at
Sailors' Creek. He was riding the general's old mare,
Maggie, and she squatted like a rabbit with him when
the shells began to fly. She always had that trick. He
could not make her go forward or backward. You ought
to have seen Dick belaboring her with his sword. But
the
<pb id="wise432" n="432"/>
Yanks got him!” and Ned burst into a laugh as he led
me where my father was. Nearly sixty years old, he lay
like a common soldier, sleeping on the ground among his
men.</p>
        <p>We aroused him, and when he saw me, he exclaimed.
“Well, by great Jehoshaphat, what are you doing here? I
thought you, at least, were safe.” I hugged him, and
almost laughed and cried at the sight of him safe and
sound, for General Lee had made me very uneasy. I told
him why I was there.</p>
        <p>“Where is General Lee?” he asked earnestly,
springing to his feet. “I want to see him again. I saw him
this morning about daybreak. I had washed my face in a
mud-puddle, and the red mud was all over it and in the
roots of my hair. I looked like a Comanche Indian; and
when I was telling him how we cut our way out last
night, he broke into a smile and said, ‘General, go wash
your face!’” The incident pleased him immensely, for at
the same time General Lee made him a division
commander,  -  a promotion he had long deserved for
gallantry, if not for military knowledge.</p>
        <p>“No, Dick is not captured. He got out, I'm sure,” said
he, as we walked down the hill together. “He was
separated from me when the enemy broke our line. He
was not riding Maggie. I lent her to Frank Johnson. He
was wounded, and, remembering his kindness to your
brother Jennings the day he was killed, I tried to save the
poor fellow, and told him to ride Maggie to the rear. Dick
was riding his black horse. I know it. When the Yankees
advanced, a flock of wild turkeys flushed before them
and came sailing into our lines. I saw Dick gallop after a
gobbler and shoot him and tie him to his saddlebow. He
was coming back toward us when the line broke, and,
mounted as he was, he has no doubt escaped, but is cut
off from us by the enemy.</p>
        <pb id="wise433" n="433"/>
        <p>“Yes, the Yanks got the bay horse, and my servants
Joshua and Smith, and all my baggage, overcoats, and
plunder. A private soldier pinned this blanket around me
last night, and I found this hat when I was coming off the
field.”</p>
        <p>He laughed heartily at his own plight. I have never
since a seen a catch-pin half so large as that with which
his blanket was gathered at the throat. As we passed
down the road to General Lee's headquarters, the roads
and the fields were filled with stragglers. They moved
looking behind them, as if they expected to be attacked
and harried by a pursuing foe. Demoralization, panic,
abandonment of all hope, appeared on every hand.
Wagons were rolling along without any order or
system. Caissons and limber-chests, without
commanding officers, seemed to be floating aimlessly
upon a tide of disorganization. Rising to his full height,
casting a glance around him like that of an eagle, and
sweeping the horizon with his long arm and bony
forefinger, my father exclaimed, “This is the end!” It
is impossible to convey an idea of the agony and the
bitterness of his words and gestures.</p>
        <p>We found General Lee on the rear portico of the
house that I have mentioned. He had washed his face
in a tin basin, and stood drying his beard with a coarse
towel as we approached. “General Lee,” exclaimed my
father, “my poor, brave men are lying on yonder hill more
dead than alive. For more than a week they have been
fighting day and night, without food, and, by God, sir,
they shall not move another step until <hi rend="italics">somebody</hi> gives
them something to eat!”</p>
        <p>”Come in, general,” said General Lee soothingly.
“They deserve something to eat, and shall have it; and
meanwhile you shall share my breakfast.” He disarmed
everything like defiance by his kindness.</p>
        <pb id="wise434" n="434"/>
        <p>It was but a few moments, however, before my father
launched forth in a fresh denunciation of the conduct
of General Bushrod Johnson in the engagement of the 6th. I am
satisfied that General Lee felt as he did; but, assuming
an air of mock severity, he said, “General, are you aware that
you are liable to court-martial and execution for
insubordination and disrespect toward your commanding officer?”</p>
        <p>My father looked at him with lifted eyebrows and flashing
eyes, and exclaimed: “Shot! You can't afford to shoot the men
who fight for cursing those who run away. Shot! I wish you
would shoot me. If you don't, some Yankee probably will
within the next twenty-four hours.”</p>
        <p>Growing more serious, General Lee inquired what he
thought of the situation.</p>
        <p>“Situation?” said the bold old man. “There is no situation!
Nothing remains, General Lee, but to put your poor men on
your poor mules and send them home in time for spring
ploughing. This army is hopelessly whipped, and is fast
becoming demoralized. These men have already endured more
than I believed flesh and blood could stand, and I say to you,
sir, emphatically, that to prolong the struggle is murder, and
the blood of every man who is killed from this time forth is on
your head, General Lee.”</p>
        <p>This last expression seemed to cause General Lee great
pain. With a gesture of remonstrance, and even of impatience,
he protested: “Oh, general, do not talk so wildly. My burdens
are heavy enough. What would the country think of me, if I
did what you suggest?”</p>
        <p>“Country be d  -  d!” was the quick reply. “There
is no country. There has been no country, general, for a year or
or more. You are the country to these men. They have fought
for you. They have shivered through a long
<pb id="wise435" n="435"/>
winter for you. Without pay or clothes, or care of any sort,
their devotion to you and faith in you have been the only
things which have held this army together. If you demand the
sacrifice, there are still left thousands of us who will die for
you. You know the game is desperate beyond redemption, and
that, if you so announce, no man or government or people will
gainsay your decision. That is why I repeat that the blood of
any man killed hereafter is upon your head.”</p>
        <p>General Lee stood for some time at an open window, looking
out at the throng now surging by upon the roads and in the
fields, and made no response. Then, turning his attention to
me, he said cheerfully that he was glad my father's plight was
not so bad as he had thought it might be, at the time of our
conversation the night before. After a pause, he wrote upon a
piece of paper a few words to the effect that he had talked with
me, and that  I would make a verbal report. If occasion arose,
he would give further advices. “This,” said he, “you will
deliver to the President. I fear to write, lest you be captured,
for those people are already several miles above Farmville. You
must keep on the north side to a ford eight miles above here,
and be careful about crossing even there.” He always
referred to the enemy as “those people.” Then he bade me
adieu, and asked my father to come in and share his breakfast.</p>
        <p>I hugged my father in the presence of General Lee, and I saw
a kindly look in his eyes as he watched us. Remembering that
my father had no horse, I said, “Take
my mare. I can easily get another.”</p>
        <p>“What!” said he, laughing, 
“a dispatch-bearer giving away
his horse! No, sir. That is too pretty a little animal to make a
present to a Yankee. I know they will bag us all, horse, foot,
and dragoons, before long. No.
<pb id="wise436" n="436"/>
I can walk as well as anybody. Have you any chewing tobacco?”</p>
        <p>I was immensely flattered at this request, and gave him a
plug of excellent tobacco. It was the first time that he had
recognized me as entitled to the possession of all the “modern
improvements” of a soldier.</p>
        <p>And so I left them. As I rode along in search of the ford to
which General Lee had directed me, I felt that I was in the midst
of the wreck of that immortal army which, until now, I had
believed to be invincible.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXVI</head>
        <head>THE END</head>
        <p>EIGHT miles of brisk riding carried me beyond the flotsam
and jetsam of the Army of Northern Virginia. I was alone in the
meadows on the north of the Appomattox River. The sun
shone brightly, and under the wooded bluffs upon the
opposite bank of the narrow stream the
little valley up which my route led was warm and still.</p>
        <p>The dogwood was beginning to bloom; the grass near the river
banks was showing the first verdure of spring; the willows
overhanging the stream were purpling and swelling with buds.
A cock grouse among the laurels was drumming to his mate,
and more than once I heard the gobble of the wild turkey.
Behind me, in the distance, were sounds of artillery; from time
to time, our guns opened to hold the enemy in check, or he,
pursuing, availed himself of some eminence to shell our
retreating masses. In due season the designated ford was
reached. The little mare, her neck and flanks warm but not
heated with exercise, waded into the stream up to her knees,
and, plunging her nose into the water, quenched her thirst. A
gray squirrel, startled from a hickory near the ford, ran out upon
a limb, swung himself to another tree, and scampered away
through the sunlight and the shadows to gain his castle in the
hollow oak upon the hillside. In a neighboring cedar, a redbird
(cardinal grosbeak), warmed by the sunlight, uttered the soft
call with which he wooes his mate in springtime.
<pb id="wise438" n="438"/>
How peaceful, how secluded, how inviting to repose,
seemed this sheltered nook! It was hard to realize what a
seething caldron of human life and human passion was
boiling so near at hand. I needed rest. It was Friday and
since I left Clover Station, Wednesday night, I had slept
but three hours. Oh, the heartache of those last eight
miles of travel, with time to reflect in solitude upon what I
had seen! The hopeless, quiet dignity of General Lee, the
impassioned desperation of my father, were present like
a nightmare. The shattered idols of boyish dreams lay
strewn about me on the road along which I had been
traveling. I had seen commands scattered and blasted
which, until now, had represented victory or unbroken
broken defiance. I had beheld officers who, until
yesterday, had impersonated to my youthful ardor nothing
but gallantry, demoralized, separated from their
commands, and with all stomach gone for further
fighting. Ever and again, my thoughts went back to the
brave troops through whose ranks I had ridden the night
previous in search of General Lee; and then my pride
rose afresh. Yet in my heart I knew that they were but a
handful to resist the armies of Grant; that the Army of
Northern Virginia was a thing of the past; that its
surrender was only a question of a few days at furthest;
and that the war was virtually ended. Then would come
the sickening thought, so eloquently expressed by my
father, that every man thenceforth killed was a noble life
literally thrown away. And, knowing my father as I did, I
felt that it was more than likely he would be one of those
to fall; for his counsel was not the counsel of a coward.
His courage and spirit of defiance were still unbroken.
His proudest testimonial is that recorded concerning his
conduct on the retreat by Fitzhugh Lee, who in describing
it declared that, until the order of surrender went forth at
Appomattox,
<pb id="wise439" n="439"/>
he fought with the fervor of youth, and exposed
himself , unhesitatingly as when he was full of hope at
the opening of the war.</p>
        <p>Alone, torn by these bitter thoughts, patriotic and
personal, exhausted by two days and nights of
excitement and fatigue, and contemplating with no
pleasant anticipations seventy miles of hard riding before
me, I gathered my reins, touched the flank of my horse,
and resumed my journey. The country south of the
Appomattox was wooded and somewhat broken. The
roads led between “hogback” hills, as they are called. I drew out my
brierwood pipe and consoled myself with a smoke; for
among my other military accomplishments I had acquired
the habit of smoking.</p>
        <p>I was taking it easily, and was riding “woman fashion,”
to rest myself in the saddle. The mare moved quietly
forward at a fox trot. I felt sure I was well ahead of the
flanking  column of the enemy. Of a sudden my ear 
caught the sound of a human voice. It was distant,  -  a
singsong note, resembling the woodland “halloo” we
often hear. For a moment I thought it might be the
voice of a darkey singing as he drove his team along. But
it ceased, and in its place I heard, in a direction which I
could not determine, sounds like falling rain, with heavy
drops distinctly audible in the downpour. I recognized
the sound.</p>
        <p>When we were studying Virgil, our tutor delighted to
take up those lines of the Æneid wherein the poet
describes the footfall of many horses as the cavalry
approaches  -  </p>
        <q direct="unspecified">
          <lg>
            <l>
              <foreign lang="la">“It clamor, et agmine facto</foreign>

              <foreign lang="la">Quadrupedante putrem sonitu quatit ungula

            </l>
          </lg>
        </q>
        <p>After reading them he would look around and ask, “Eh?
don't you hear the very sound of the horses'
feet in the
<pb id="wise440" n="440"/>
words?” Well, of course we did not, and Parson Dudley
thought we were trifling young cubs not to see the
beauty of Virgil's verbal horseplay. Still, the words stuck,
and I often repeated them afterward. Now, who would
have imagined that the little Latin I had acquired, partly 
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">a
priori</foreign></hi> and partly <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">a

escaping capture? I listened. I repeated: <foreign lang="la">“Quadrupe  -  
dantepu  -  tremsoni  -  tuquatit  -  ungula  -  campum.”</foreign>
I said to myself: “That sound is the sound of
cavalry. That voice was the voice of command. Which
way shall I go?”</p>
        <p>“Plague take you, be quiet!” I said to the mare, slapping
her impatiently on the neck; for at that moment she
lifted her head, pointed her ears, and, raising her ribs,
gave a loud whinny. By good luck, almost at the same
instant the sound of clashing cymbals and the music of a
mounted band came through the forest. The hostile
forces were but a few hundred yards away. As I soon
learned, they were moving on a road leading to the ford,
but entering the road that I was traveling just beyond the
spot where I first heard them. The hill on my left ran
down to a point where the advancing column was coming
into the road on which I was. The summit of the hill was
covered by a thick growth of laurel and pine. I sprang
from the saddle, led the mare up the hillside, tied her, and,
reflecting that she might whinny again, left her, ran along
the hill-crest as near to the enemy as I dared go, lay
down behind an old log, covered myself with leaves and
bushes, and was within a hundred yards of the spot which
the enemy passed. I could see them from behind the end
of my log.</p>
        <p>“Hurrah! hurrah!” they shouted, as the band played “Johnny
Comes Marching Home.” They were elated and
full of enthusiasm, for the Johnnies were on the run, and
<pb id="wise441" n="441"/>
the pursuit was now little more than a foot-race. The
band struck up “Captain Jenks of the Horse Marines” 
as they swept on to the ford, walking, trotting, ambling,
pacing, their guidons fluttering in the spring breeze.
“Hurrah! hurrah! hurrah!” How different was the
cheering from the wild yell to which I was accustomed!
I lay there, with my pistol in my hand, watching them,
really interested in contrasting their good equipment and
their ardor with the wretched scenes that I had left
behind. A wild turkey hen, startled from her nest near the
roadside, came flying directly up the hill, alighted on the
further side of the log behind which I was lying, and,
squatting low, ran within three feet of my nose. Peering
into my face with frightened eyes, she gave a “put!” of
amazement and sheered off. I convulsively clutched my
pistol to shoot her. No, I did not shoot. I had reasons for
not shooting. But I am sure this was the only wild turkey
that ever came within range of my weapon without
receiving a salute.</p>
        <p>The cavalcade swept by, and did not suspect my
presence. When all was still again, hurrying back to the
filly, I mounted, rode down to the forks of the road, took
the one that led westward, and galloped away. I felt sure,
from the rapidity with which I had traveled, that this must
be the advance of the enemy, and I resolved to take no
further risks. I was right, for I saw no more Union
troops. Late that afternoon, in Charlotte County, I passed
the plantation of Roanoke, once the home of John
Randolph. It looked desolate and overgrown.</p>
        <p>“Oh, John Randolph, John, John!” thought I, as I rode
by, “you have gotten some other Johns, in fact the whole
breed of Johnnies, into a peck of trouble by the
governmental notions which you left to them as a legacy.
By the way, John,” changing into a merrier vein, “I wish
<pb id="wise442" n="442"/>
some of those thoroughbreds you once owned were still in
your stables; my gallant animal is nearly done for by the
murderous pace of the last six hours.” Neither the spirit nor the
horses of John Randolph responded, either to maintain his
principles, or to supply me a fresh mount from the skeleton
stables, and I rode on.</p>
        <p>I reached the Episcopal rectory at Halifax Court House after
midnight. My brother Henry was the minister. He was a glorious
fellow, who, if he had not been a preacher, would have made a
dashing soldier. I hammered upon the door, and he came
down. I was now only twenty miles west of my post at Clover
Station. I had visited him several times while I was quartered
there, but since the evacuation of Richmond he had heard
nothing from any of us, although he had made many inquiries,
for me particularly.</p>
        <p>When I told him of my last three adventures, he looked me
over, and, seeing how red my eyes were, said that he was afraid
I was drunk. “Not much,” I replied; “but if you have anything
to eat and to drink, get it out quickly, for I am nearly famished.
You may think I am drunk, Henry, but come out and look at the
mare. Probably you will think she has the delirium tremens.” He
was soon dressed, and we went out to minister to the faithful
brute.</p>
        <p>She stood with head hung low, her red nostrils distending
and contracting, her sides heaving, her knees trembling, her
flanks roweled and red, the sweat dripping from her wet body.
Poor little Tulip (that was her name), I had not done it
wantonly. I was performing a duty of life and death.</p>
        <p>“You cannot ride her to Danville,” said Henry, who was a
good horseman.</p>
        <p>“No, of course not. I came after your bay horse.”</p>
        <pb id="wise443" n="443"/>
        <p>Henry loved his mare, and under other circumstances he
would not have listened to such a proposition; but patriotism
overcame him, and he simply answered, with a sigh, “Very
well.”</p>
        <p>I count it a creditable episode in my life that I took off my
coat, tired as I was, and gave Tulip a good rubbing flown, and
fed her and bedded her, bless her game heart!</p>
        <p>“You cannot go forward at once,” Henry urged, when we
returned to the house. He started a fire in the dining room, and
placed an abundance of cold victuals and drink upon the table,
and his pretty young wife entered to hear the war news.</p>
        <p>“Well, I thought I might, but blamed if I don't believe I'm
forced to take a rest,” I replied. “Will you have your mare
saddled and me waked at daybreak?”</p>
        <p>It was so arranged, and, after I had eaten like a glutton, I lit a
pipe and tried to stay awake to answer Henry's eager questions;
but I fell asleep in the chair, and the next I knew he was leading
me by the arm up to a large bedroom, the like of which I had
not seen for many a day. Tumbling into bed, I knew no more
until he roused me at daybreak, fed me, put me on his mare, and
said a “God bless you!” I went off sore and reluctant, but
soon limbered up and grew willing, as his horse, fresh and
almost as good as Tulip, strode gallantly on to Danville.</p>
        <p>“Man never is, but always to be blest.” I was envying
preachers, and thinking what a good time Henry was having;
and he, poor fellow, had spent the night striding up and down the
floor, bemoaning the hard fate which had made him a non-
combatant.</p>
        <p>It was about eight o'clock in the evening of Saturday, April
8, 1865, when the hoofs of my horse resounded on the bridge
which spans the Roanoke at Danville. I do
<pb id="wise444" n="444"/>
not recall the exact distance traversed that day, but it was
enough for man and beast. I had a good, comfortable ride.
Henry had filled my saddle-pockets with excellent  food, and
two flasks of coffee made by him, while I slept, from a precious
remnant that he had preserved for the sick of his congregation.
He was a prince of hospitality and common sense. He had
liquor, and was no blue-nose; but he said that he would give
me none, for the double reason that I seemed to like it too well,
and that, in case of protracted effort, it was not so reliable a
stimulant as coffee.</p>
        <p>The lights of Danville were a welcome sight. The town was
crowded with people, the result of the recent influx from
Richmond. Riding up Main Street to the principal hotel, I
learned that President Davis was domiciled at the home of
Major Sutherlin, and thither I directed my course. The house
stands upon Main Street, near the crest of a steep hill. As I
approached, I saw that it was brilliantly illuminated. A sentry at
the yard gate challenged me. I announced my name, rank, and
mission, and was admitted. At the door, a colored man, whom
I recognized as the body servant of the President, received me.
In a few moments, Burton Harrison appeared, giving me a
kindly greeting, and saying that the President and his Cabinet
were then holding a session in the dining-room, and desired me
to enter and make my report. I laughed, drew forth the short
note of General Lee to the President, and remarked that my
dispatches were for the most part oral.</p>
        <p>I felt rather embarrassed by such a distinguished audience,
but Mr. Davis soon put me at ease. In his book he mentions my
coming, but, after the long interval between 1865 and the time
at which it was written, he had forgotten, if indeed he ever
knew, that I had been
<pb id="wise445" n="445"/>
sent by him to General Lee. Probably he never learned what
name General Walker inserted in the blank order sent, when he
requested the detail of an officer to communicate with General
Lee. At any rate, I was the first person who had brought him
any direct news from General Lee since his departure from
Richmond.</p>
        <p>Those present, as I remember them, were, besides the
President and Burton Harrison, Mr. Benjamin, General
Breckinridge, Secretary Mallory, Secretary Reagan, perhaps 
General Bragg, and several others whom I did not know, or
do not recall. They sat around a large dining table and I stood
at the end opposite Mr. Davis. He was exceedingly
considerate, requested me to make my report, which I did
as briefly as possible, and then asked me a number of
questions. When he had done examining me, several others of
the party made inquiries. One thing I remember vividly.
Somebody inquired how many efficient troops I thought General Lee had left. I was
prepared for this question to the extent of having tried to
conjecture. In doing so, I had assumed that at the time he
started from Petersburg he had nearly one hundred thousand
men. That was the popular impression. With this in my mind as
a basic figure, I believed that his army had dwindled to one
third of its number when it left Petersburg; and so I ventured
the opinion that he might still have thirty thousand effective
men, although I was cautious enough to add that Mahone's
and Field's divisions were the only two that I had seen which
seemed to be intact and to have preserved their organization.
When I said thirty thousand, I thought I detected a smile of
sad incredulity on several faces; and I have often wondered
since how much that statement detracted from the weight
attached to my report in other respects.</p>
        <pb id="wise446" n="446"/>
        <p>One question I answered as I felt. “Do you think
General Lee will be able to reach a point of safety with
his army?”</p>
        <p>“I regret to say, no. From what I saw and heard, I am
satisfied that General Lee must surrender. It may be that
he has done so to-day. In my opinion, Mr. President,
it is only a question of a few days at furthest, and, if I
may be permitted to add a word, I think the sooner the
better; for, after seeing what I have seen of the two
armies, I believe the result is inevitable, and postponing
the day means only the useless effusion of noble, gallant
blood.”</p>
        <p>I am sure none of them had heard such a plain
statement of this unwelcome truth before. I remember
the expression of face  -  almost a shudder  -  with which
what I said was received. I saw that, however convinced
they might be of the truth of it, it was not a popular
speech to make.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis asked me to remain. He said that he wished
to talk with me further. While I was waiting for him in
the hallway, Major Sutherlin, who had known me from
childhood, beckoned to me and asked,“Aren't you
hungry after your ride?”</p>
        <p>I grinned. I was always hungry then.</p>
        <p>“Jim,” quoth the major, “see if you can't get something
for the lieutenant to eat.”</p>
        <p>Jim went out, but in a few minutes returned, and, 
bowing, invited me into a butler's pantry. He apologized
for the place, and explained that the house was so
crowded he had nowhere else to spread the repast. He
had provided milk, corn-coffee, butter and rolls, and cold
turkey. I said, “Jim, shut up. You know I am not used to
as good as this.” With that I tossed off a glass of milk,
swallowed a cup of coffee, and, opening my haversack,
<pb id="wise447" n="447"/>
tumbled the butter and rolls and turkey-legs into it, and
buttoned it up. Jim stood there, highly amused at the short 
shrift I made of his feast, and remarked, “You's a first-
class forager, ain't you, lieutenant?” “Yes,” I responded. 
“You must keep fire in the box, Jim, if you want the
engine to run. Now I'm ready for the President.”</p>
        <p>I slipped back into the hallway, and sat down to wait
until the President should call me. In a little while the
conference  broke up, and he came to the door. “Now,
lieutenant, I'll see you,” and he led the way into the
drawing-room; there we had a long talk, I going more
into details.</p>
        <p>At the close of our conversation, he sat for some time
peering into the gloom outside, and finally broke the
silence by saying, “You seem to know the roads. Do
you feel equal to another trip?”</p>
        <p>“Assuredly,” I answered. “I now have a relay of
horses, and am more than glad to serve in any way I
can.”</p>
        <p>“Very well,” said he. “Leave your horse in Major
Sutherlin's stable, so that it will be well fed, and report
for orders to-morrow morning at eight o'clock.”</p>
        <p>I took the mare to the stable. It looked so inviting that I
clambered up a ladder to the loft, opened my haversack, 
enjoyed Major Sutherlin's food, placed some hay under
me and drew some over me, and had a glorious night's
rest.</p>
        <p>When I reported next morning, the President did not
ask at what hotel I was stopping. I received my return
dispatches, and I set forth to rejoin General Lee.
Apprehending the probability of my capture, Mr. Davis
gave me a brief letter of credentials, and said that I
would explain his wishes.</p>
        <pb id="wise448" n="448"/>
        <p>Upon the same day that General Lee surrendered at
Appomattox (April 9), I reached Halifax Court House on the
return trip. My brother Richard was there, with his own horse
and the horse that my father had lent the wounded man. They
had been cut off at Sailors' Creek and forced southward. The
enemy, flanking General Lee, had advanced by moving at least
ten miles beyond Sailors' Creek, thus rendering it impossible for
them to rejoin General Lee except by going through the Union
lines. My brother was greatly perplexed concerning the course
he should pursue, and after we had discussed the matter, he
resolved to leave one of the horses and to go back with me.
Monday morning we resumed the journey; and that afternoon
we met the first of our men, who, paroled at Appomattox the
day before, were mournfully wending their way homeward.</p>
        <p>Upon hearing of the surrender, we turned back toward
Danville to report to President Davis the failure of my mission.
On arriving there, we learned that he had left the place, and
gone to Greensboro, North Carolina. From the paroled men we
met, we ascertained that our father was safe. We resolved to
join Johnston's army. After leaving Danville, two days' ride
brought us to Greensboro, and there we found Johnston's
forces. We reported to Major-General Carter Stevenson,
commanding a division of infantry. General Stevenson was a
Virginian, one of the few in that army. A cousin of ours was on
his staff. The army was bivouacked in and about the town of
Greensboro, awaiting the result of negotiations for its
surrender. Men and officers alike understood this, and there
was a general relaxation of discipline.</p>
        <p>We were among the first to arrive from Lee's army. General
Stevenson gave us a cordial welcome. We told him we had not
been captured, and had come to serve
<pb id="wise449" n="449"/>
under him. He asked us what we wished to do. We replied that
we were ready to serve in any capacity in which we could be
useful; I added facetiously that I was not much of a lieutenant
anyhow, and none too good for a private. On our way, we had
seriously discussed the formation of a command composed
of officers of Lee's army who had escaped from the
surrender. Inviting us to make his headquarters our home until
something definite was concluded, General Stevenson said,
with a smile, that he feared we had jumped out of the frying-
pan into the fire, and that Sherman and Johnston were already
conferring about a cessation of hostilities. I must describe one
of the conferences as General Johnston himself narrated it
many years afterward.</p>
        <p>One cold winter night about 1880, Captain Edwin Harvie, of
General Johnston's staff, invited me to join him in a call upon
the general, who was then living in Richmond. Harvie was one
of his pets, and we were promptly admitted to his presence. He
sat in an armchair in his library, dressed in a flannel wrapper, and
was suffering from an influenza. By his side, upon a low stool,
stood a tray with whiskey, glasses, spoons, sugar, lemon,
spice, and eggs. At the grate a footman held a brass 
teakettle of boiling water. Mrs. Johnston was preparing hot
Tom-and-Jerry for the old gentleman, and he took it from time
to time with no sign of objection or resistance. It was snowing
outside, and the scene within was very cosy. As I had seen him
in public, General Johnston was a stiff, uncommunicative man,
punctilious and peppery, as little fellows like him are apt to be.
He reminded minded me of a cock sparrow, full of self-
consciousness, and rather enjoying a peck at his neighbor.</p>
        <p>That night he was as warm, comfortable, and communicative
as the kettle singing on the hob. He had been
<pb id="wise450" n="450"/>
lonesome, and he greatly enjoyed both the Tom-and
Jerry and the visitors. Harvie knew how to draw him out
on reminiscences, and we spent a most delightful
evening. Among other things, he told us an episode of the
surrender, under promise that we should not publish it
until after his death.</p>
        <p>Johnston had known Sherman well in the United States
army. Their first interview near Greensboro resulted in
an engagement to meet for further discussion the 
following day. As they were parting, Johnston remarked:
“By the way, Cumps, Breckinridge, our Secretary of
War, is with me. He is a very able fellow, and a better
lawyer than any of us. If there is no objection, I will
fetch him along to-morrow.”</p>
        <p>Bristling up, General Sherman exclaimed, “Secretary
of War! No, no; we don't recognize any civil
government among you fellows, Joe. No, I don't want
any Secretary of War.”</p>
        <p>“Well,” said General Johnston, “he is also a
major general in the Confederate army. Is there any
objection to his presence in the capacity of major-general?”</p>
        <p>“Oh!” quoth Sherman, in his characteristic way, 
“major-general! Well, any major-general you may bring, I
shall be glad to meet. But recollect, Johnston, no
Secretary of War. Do you understand?”</p>
        <p>The next day, General Johnston, accompanied by
Major-General Breckinridge and others, was at the
rendezvous before Sherman.</p>
        <p>“You know how fond of his liquor Breckinridge was?”
added General Johnston, as he went on with his story. 
“Well, nearly everything to drink had been absorbed. For
several days, Breckinridge had found it difficult, if not
impossible, to procure liquor. He showed the effect of his
enforced abstinence. He was rather dull and
<pb id="wise451" n="451"/>
heavy that morning. Somebody in Danville had given 
him a plug of very fine chewing tobacco, and he chewed
vigorously while we were awaiting Sherman's coming.
After a while, the latter arrived. He bustled in with a pair
of saddlebags over his arm, and apologized for being late.
He placed the saddlebags carefully upon a chair.
Introductions followed, and for a while General Sherman
made himself exceedingly agreeable. Finally, some one
suggested that we had better take up the matter in hand.</p>
        <p>“ ‘Yes,’ said Sherman; ‘but, gentlemen, it occurred to
me that perhaps you were not overstocked with liquor,
and I procured some medical stores on my way over.
Will you join me before we begin work?’”</p>
        <p>General Johnston said he watched the expression of
Breckinridge at this announcement, and it was beatific.
Tossing his quid into the fire, he rinsed his mouth, and
when the bottle and the glass were passed to him, he
poured out a tremendous drink, which he swallowed with
great satisfaction. With an air of content, he stroked his
mustache and took a fresh chew of tobacco.</p>
        <p>Then they settled down to business, and Breckinridge
never shone more brilliantly than he did in the discussions
which followed. He seemed to have at his tongue's end
every rule and maxim of international and constitutional
law, and of the laws of war,  -  international wars, civil
wars, and wars of rebellion. In fact, he was so
resourceful, cogent, persuasive, learned, that, at one stage
of the proceedings, General Sherman, when confronted
by the authority, but not convinced by the eloquence or
learning of Breckinridge, pushed back his chair and 
exclaimed: “See here, gentlemen, who is doing this
surrendering anyhow? If this thing goes on, you'll have
me sending a letter of apology to Jeff Davis.”</p>
        <p>Afterward, when they were nearing the close of the
<pb id="wise452" n="452"/>
conference, Sherman sat for some time absorbed in deep
thought. Then he arose, went to the saddlebags, and fumbled
for the bottle. Breckinridge saw the movement. Again he took
his quid from his mouth and tossed it into the fireplace. His eye
brightened, and he gave every evidence of intense interest in
what Sherman seemed about to do.</p>
        <p>The latter, preoccupied, perhaps unconscious of his action,
poured out some liquor, shoved the bottle back into the saddle-
pocket, walked to the window, and stood there, looking out
abstractedly, while he sipped his grog.</p>
        <p>From pleasant hope and expectation the expression on
Breckinridge's face changed successively to uncertainty,
disgust, and deep depression. At last his hand sought the plug
of tobacco, and, with an injured, sorrowful look, he cut off
another chew. Upon this he ruminated during the remainder of
the interview, taking little part in what was said.</p>
        <p>After silent reflections at the window, General Sherman
bustled back, gathered up his papers, and said: “These terms
are too generous, but I must hurry away before you make me
sign a capitulation. I will submit them to the authorities at
Washington, and let you hear how they are received.” With
that he bade the assembled officers adieu, took his saddlebags
upon his arm, and went off as he had come.</p>
        <p>General Johnston took occasion, as they left the house and
were drawing on their gloves, to ask General Breckinridge how
he had been impressed by Sherman.</p>
        <p>“Sherman is a bright man, and a man of great force,” replied
Breckinridge, speaking with deliberation, “but,” raising his
voice and with a look of great intensity, “General Johnston,
General Sherman is a hog. Yes, sir, a hog. Did you see him take
that drink by himself?”</p>
        <pb id="wise453" n="453"/>
        <p>General Johnston tried to assure General Breckinridge that
General Sherman was a royal good fellow, but the most absent-
minded man in the world. He told him that the failure to offer
him a drink was the highest compliment that could have been
paid to the masterly arguments with which he had pressed the
Union commander to that state of abstraction.</p>
        <p>“Ah!” protested the big Kentuckian, half sighing, half 
grieving, “no Kentucky gentleman would ever have taken
away that bottle. He knew we needed it, and needed it badly.”</p>
        <p>The story was well told, and I did not make it public until
after General Johnston's death. On one occasion, being intimate
with General Sherman, I repeated it to him. Laughing heartily, he
said: “I don't remember it. But if Joe Johnston told it, it's so.
Those fellows hustled me so that day, I was sorry for the drink I
did give them,” and with that sally he broke out into fresh
laughter.</p>
        <p>While these scenes were being enacted, Johnston's army lay
about Greensboro, and I saw a great deal of the men and the
officers. I will not attempt a comparison between its personnel
and that of Lee's army. I was a prejudiced observer, and
such comparisons can produce no good results. But I am free
to say, from what I saw, then and thereafter, of Sherman's army,
that I believe it was a be better army than that of General Grant.
If Lee's army and Sherman's had come together when they were
at their best, the world would have witnessed some very
memorable fighting. The spirit of General Johnston's men was
much finer than, under the circumstances, anybody would
have expected. They were defiant, and more than ready to try
conclusions with Sherman in a pitched battle. Many expressed
disgust and indignation when the surrender
<pb id="wise454" n="454"/>
of the army was announced. An epidemic of
drunkenness, gambling, and fighting prevailed while we
were waiting for our final orders. Whatever difficulty
General Breckinridge may have experienced in procuring
liquor, the soldiers seemed to have an abundance of colorless
corn-whiskey and applejack, and the roadsides were 
lined with “chuck-a-luck” games. The amount of
Confederate money displayed was marvelous.
Men had it by the haversackful, and bet it recklessly upon
anything. The ill-temper begotten by drinking and
gambling manifested itself almost hourly in free fights.</p>
        <p>During this period of waiting came the news of the
assassination of Mr. Lincoln. Perhaps I ought to chronicle
that the announcement was received with demonstrations
of sorrow. If I did, I should be lying for sentiment's sake.
Among the higher officers and the most intelligent and
conservative men, the assassination caused a shudder of
horror at the heinousness of the act, and at the thought of
its possible consequences; but among the thoughtless, the
desperate, and the ignorant, it was hailed as a sort of
retributive justice. In maturer years I have been ashamed
of what I felt and said when I heard of that awful
calamity. However, men ought to be judged for their
feelings and their speech by the circumstances of their
surroundings. For four years we had been fighting. In that
struggle, all we loved had been lost. Lincoln incarnated to
us the idea of oppression and conquest. We had seen his
face over the coffins of our brothers and relatives and
friends, in the flames of Richmond, in the disaster at
Appomattox. In blood and flame and torture the temples
of our lives were tumbling about our heads. We were
desperate and vindictive, and whosoever denies it forgets
or is false. We greeted his death in a spirit of reckless
hate, and hailed it as bringing agony and 
<pb id="wise455" n="455"/>
bitterness to those who were the cause of our own agony
and bitterness. To us, Lincoln was an inhuman monster,
Grant a butcher, and Sherman a fiend.</p>
        <p>Time taught us that Lincoln was a man of marvelous
humanity. Appomattox and what followed revealed Grant
in his matchless magnanimity, and the bitterness toward 
Sherman was softened in subsequent years. But, with our
feelings then, if the news had come that all three of these
had been engulfed in a common disaster with ourselves,
we should have felt satisfaction in the fact, and should not
have questioned too closely how it had been brought
about. We were poor, starved, conquered, despairing; and
to expect men to have no malice and no vindictiveness at
such a time is to look for angels in human form. Thank
God, such feelings do not last long, at least in their
fiercest intensity.</p>
        <p>The army moved westward to a place named Jimtown,
since dignified as Jamestown. There we were all paroled.
We received one dollar and fifteen cents each. Of this,
one dollar was in Mexican coin. I cut my initials upon my
dollar, but it was stolen from my pocket the next day. We
were ready to disperse to our homes. Our headquarters
were in a tent.</p>
        <p>That night we had our last army fright. By some
means, a rumor had become prevalent that certain
officers had distributed among themselves bolts of
valuable cloth far beyond their own needs, leaving the
soldiers ragged. The men formed bands, declaring they
would ransack the officers' wagons and have this cloth.
A friendly fellow brought us the news that one of these
parties was approaching to search General Stevenson's
headquarters wagon. Major Reeve, of the staff, indignant
at such an accusation but more indignant at the proposed
insult to his commanding officer, swore he would die
rather than
<pb id="wise456" n="456"/>
submit to such ignominy. He called upon us to defend our
manhood. Of course we were ready. Armed only with
our swords and revolvers, we were deployed by him
behind trees. It was moonlight. We could see the 
raiders coming through the woods. When within thirty
yards they halted. Major Reeve, who was as gallant as
he was impetuous, challenged, and asked what they
wanted. A leader replied. “Are you men soldiers of
Stevenson's division?” inquired Reeve. On learning that
they were, he proceeded to deliver an address which, for
eloquence, pathos, and defiance, was as fine as anything I
ever heard.</p>
        <p>He reproached them for thinking for an instant that
such a base rumor could be true. He reminded them of
the days when he had led them, and they were touched
by his references to their common struggles and common
sufferings. He asked them what General Stevenson or
any of his staff had ever done to deserve this distrust or
justify this degrading search. Finally, he told them that if
they still persisted, but one course was left to us, and that
was to die at the hands of our own men rather than
submit tamely to such dishonor. We who were deployed
behind the trees felt that we were in a ticklish place.
Reeve was exalted by his own oratory. We were trying
to count the number of our assailants. For a moment after
he finished speaking there was a dead silence, a very
awkward silence. Then a voice shouted, “Three cheers
for Major Reeve!” They were given with a hearty
goodwill, followed by cheers for everybody. The
marauders broke, crowded around Reeve, and hugged
and wept over him, and we sneaked back to the tent,
much relieved that this particular phase of the war was
over.</p>
        <p>The next day, the Army of the Tennessee dissolved.
To every point of the compass its officers and men
dispersed.
<pb id="wise457" n="457"/>
Our course was directed to Danville. We did not
encounter any Union forces until we approached that
place. Then we saw mounted Union pickets outlined
against the sky, at the top of the hill. They looked just as
we had often seen them before. It was hard to realize
that they would not fire upon us, and gallop away to give
the alarm. It was equally hard to realize that we soon
should pass them and be within the Union lines. In we
went, giving and receiving salutes. For the first time, we
were in the midst of a body of Union soldiers. What we
felt then is not important.</p>
        <p>A week later, having been to Halifax to return to her
owner the finest mare I ever bestrode, I boarded a train
for Richmond, the brass buttons on my uniform covered
with black, a fit badge of mourning for the dead
Confederacy. The cars were crowded with Union
soldiers and negroes flocking to the towns. The bearing
of the Union officers and soldiers toward Confederates
was, with few exceptions, extremely civil and
conciliatory. One fellow was so kind that, after he had
offered me money, which I refused, he slipped it into my
pocket with a card saying, “This is not a gift, but a loan,
and when you are able you can return it to me. ”I did
subsequently return it, but never forgot his delicate
attention.</p>
        <p>The bridges across the James at Richmond had all
been destroyed. Our train stopped at Manchester,
opposite Richmond. Thence we were compelled to
proceed to the city by way of a pontoon bridge thrown
across the river at the lower end of Mayo's Island. At the
Manchester terminus, we found a number of improvised
vehicles,  -   wagons, ambulances, etc.,  -  with improvised
drivers, too, seeking passengers to carry over the bridge.
These drivers were in many instances my old army
comrades. One of them was Colonel George, a former schoolmate,
<pb id="wise458" n="458"/>
not five years older than myself, a man of the highest so
social standing, a young soldier of distinguished gallantry,
who a month before had commanded one of the best
regiments in Lee's army. It was pathetic, the sight
of those army boys, with their war-horses converted into
teams, trying to earn an honest penny to feed the folks at
home. I saw George stand at the rear of the ambulance
that he drove, open the door, collect the fares from the
sleek Union commissaries and quartermasters who
patronized him, mount his box, and drive away as humbly
as if that business had been, and was to be, his lifelong
occupation.</p>
        <p>It was fortunate for our boys that the negroes, who
until now had done this class of work, were so elated by
their freedom that they had performed no sort of labor
since the evacuation. They had thronged the city, but not
for work. The weather was warm, and they were living
in all kinds of makeshift habitations, ofttimes in the ruins
of burned buildings, procuring food from the Freedmen's
Bureau, and spending their time in the Capitol Square,
where the older ones shouted and sang for hours, and the
children played at games.</p>
        <p>I was too poor to indulge in the luxury of a ride, and
young and strong enough to walk to town. Slinging our
knapsacks, a party of us walked across the pontoon,
lifting our eyes from time to time to the grinning ruins
before us. It was past noon; the day was warm, and the
sun was bright. It revealed, without concealing anything
from us, the complete destruction of the business portion
of the town. Through these ruins we wended our way.</p>
        <p>The hand of reconstruction was already stretched
forth. Men were engaged in pulling down walls and
cleaning bricks. Already mortar beds had been built in the
streets, puddlers were at work, and, where work had
progressed far enough, foundations were being laid
anew.
<pb id="wise459" n="459"/>
The streets were already burdened with lumber for joists
and woodwork, and every evidence was given of a
rebuilding of the town. Nearly all the laborers were white
men. Many of them I knew well,  -  men of as good social
position as my own; soldiers come home and resolved not
to be idle, but to work for an honest living in any way in
which they could make it. Sitting in the sun with their
trowels, jabbing away in awkward fashion at their new
and unaccustomed tasks, covered with dust and plaster,
they were the same bright, cheerful fellows who had
learned to labor in that state of life to which it had pleased
God to call them, just as they had been willing followers,
in sunshine and in storm, of their beloved Lee. At night,
with their day's wages in their pockets, they would go
home, change their clothing, take a bath, and associate
with their families,  -  not at all ashamed of their labors, but
making a joke of their newly discovered method of
earning a sustenance. With all the hardship of such
unaccustomed work, it was the best and most
comfortable and least dangerous employment that they
had been engaged in for years. Richmond rose from her
ashes, and soon became, in great part by their efforts, a
more beautiful city than ever before.</p>
        <p>Passing through the business portion of the town, we
reached the residential section, which was still intact. The
trees were in full leaf. They cast their deep shadows
everywhere, and a Sabbath stillness pervaded the streets,
strangely in contrast with the air of busy life always
presented when Richmond was the crowded and
beleaguered capital. Few men and no women were upon
the streets. Business had not been resumed, and the
presence of Union soldiers and great numbers of negroes
made women cautious about venturing forth unattended.</p>
        <p>I had no home. The nearest approach to one was that
<pb id="wise460" n="460"/>
of my brother-in-law, Dr. Gannett. There my mother and an
unmarried sister were, and thither I repaired. My father, as I
learned, had not returned to Richmond. Eliza, our faithful
servant, whose kinspeople resided in Philadelphia, had made a
short visit to that place, and among other things had brought
back civilian clothes for me. They had been bought by
Philadelphia relatives, who knew me only as an eighteen-year-
old boy, and the clothes were of the style worn by Philadelphia
cousins of my own age. In my room I found a civilian's attire
laid out for me, and I proceeded to divest myself of my uniform.
For the first time in two years and eight months, I appeared in
citizen's dress. The sensation was peculiar. The lightness and
softness of the cloth was delightful, but the sack coat and the
straw hat made me feel bobtailed and bareheaded; and when I
looked in the glass, instead of confronting a striking young
officer, I beheld a mere insignificant chit of an eighteen-year-old
boy. Nothing brought home to me more vividly the fact that the
stunning events of the last month had ended the career on
which I had started, and that I had received a great setback in
manhood. This feeling was emphasized when some one startled
me by asking where I was going to school.</p>
        <p>The house had a broad veranda. That evening we sat upon
it, after tea, quiet and sad, but enjoying the refreshing air and
sense of peace. On the opposite side of the street lived a family
consisting of a mother and several handsome daughters. They
had been such ardent Confederates that they had been sent out
of Alexandria into the Confederate lines by the Union
commander. That they were still loyal Confederates we never
had reason to doubt until we saw a party of young Union
officers ride up, followed by their orderlies. We felt sure they
had
<pb id="wise461" n="461"/>
come to arrest the occupants of that house. Imagine our
surprise, therefore, when, in a few moments, we saw the lights
go up in the drawing-rooms, and discovered that this was a
social call. One of the girls was soon banging away on the
piano and singing to her admirers. The voices of hilarity, the
sounds of mirth and music, horrified us. We looked upon the
conduct of those girls, in making merry, singing, playing, and
receiving the attentions of Union officers, as grossly indelicate,
heartless to our dead and to us, and treason to their
Confederate comrades. It was years before they regained social
recognition in the community. Their faithlessness to the lost
cause chilled my heart, and was a fresh reminder that the cause
was dead.</p>
        <p>That night I tossed upon my bed, reflecting on the past,
contemplating the present, speculating as to the future. The
next morning I arose, and before breakfast I wrote my will, as
follows:  -  </p>
        <p>I, J. Reb., being of unsound mind and bitter memory, and
aware that I am dead, do make, publish, and declare the
following to be my political last will and testament.</p>
        <p>1. I give, devise, and bequeath all my slaves to Harriet
Beecher Stowe.</p>
        <p>2. My rights in the territories I direct shall be assigned and
set over, together with the bricabrac known as State
Sovereignty, to the Hon. J   -   R  -   T  -   , to play with for the
remainder of his life, and remainder to his son after his death.</p>
        <p>3. I direct that all my shares in the venture of secession shall
be canceled, provided I am released from my unpaid
subscription to the stock of said enterprise.</p>
        <p>4. My interest in the civil government of the Confederacy
I bequeath to any freak museum that may hereafter be
established.</p>
        <pb id="wise462" n="462"/>
        <p>5. My sword, my veneration for General Robert E. Lee, his
subordinate commanders and his peerless soldiers; and my
undying love for my old comrades, living and dead, I set
apart as the best I have, or shall ever have, to bequeath to
my heirs forever.</p>
        <p>6. And now, being dead, having experienced a death to
Confederate ideas and a new birth unto allegiance to the
Union, I depart, with a vague but not definite hope of a
joyful resurrection, and of a new life, upon lines
somewhat different from those of the last eighteen years.
I see what has been pulled down very clearly. What is to
be built up in its place I know not. It is a mystery; but
death is always mysterious. AMEN.</p>
        <p>I read this will at the breakfast-table. It amused the
family, but with me it was no joke. I was dead.
Everything that I had ever believed in politically was
dead. Everybody that I had ever trusted or relied upon
politically was dead. My beloved State of Virginia was
dismembered, and a new State had been erected out of a
part of her, against her will. Every hope that I had ever
indulged was dead. Even the manhood I had attained was
dead. I was a boy again, a mere child,  -  precocious,
ignorant, conceited, and unformed. I had set my heart and
soul on the career of a soldier. What hope was left for
that? The night's reflections had made all these things
clear as never before. Boy as I was, I felt it as keenly as
did the embittered Moor when, in his agony, he
exclaimed:  -  </p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,</l>
          <l>That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!</l>
          <l>Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,</l>
          <l>The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,</l>
          <l>The royal banner, and all quality,</l>
          <l>Pride, pomp, and circumstance of glorious war!</l>
          <pb id="wise463" n="463"/>
          <l>And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats</l>
          <l>The immortal Jove's dread clamours counterfeit,</l>
          <l>Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>In hopelessness I scanned the wreck, and then  -  I went
back to school.</p>
        <p>In June, 1865, a boy named John Sergeant Wise, a
visitor at the home of his uncle, General Meade, in 
Philadelphia, was a witness of the triumphant return of
the armies of the Union. He was regarded as such a
mere child that he was not invited to the table when
company came, but dined with the other children in the
nursery. A little later, he sat in overalls and a straw hat
fishing near the shores of the blue Chesapeake. In
September, he was sent to school. In October, he was
playing furiously on the scrub nine of his college baseball
team. Two years later, he was admitted to the practice of
law, and even then he had not attained his majority.</p>
        <p>It is incredible that this stripling was the same person as
the young officer whose observations and career have
been chronicled in these pages. Nor is it more difficult
now for the reader than for the writer to realize that this
narrative is aught but a dream.</p>
