        <p>This narrative is printed in pamphlet form 
to comply with the request of numerous friends and to 
meet the suggestion contained in the editorial notice 
of the Louisville Evening Post in its issue of May 29, 
1919, as follows:   </p>
        <div2 type="section" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">

          </head>
          <p>“The Evening Post has received a copy of an address 
delivered a short time ago before the George B. 
Eastin Camp of Confederate Veterans, by Col. Henry 
L. Stone, of the Louisville bar, general counsel of the 
Louisville &amp; Nashville Railroad Company, the address 
being largely in the nature of a narrative by the 
speaker of his personal experiences as a soldier in the 
famous cavalry command of Gen. John H. Morgan.  </p>
          <p>“The Evening Post much regrets that it can not 
find the space for this exciting and instructive story. 
It covers thirty type-written pages, or seven or eight 
columns in our print, and the story is so well told that 
we feel that nothing could be eliminated, and all that 
is possible is to express the hope that either Colonel 
Stone or the local camp of veterans will later see fit 
to issue the address in pamphlet form. Certainly we 
have never seen elsewhere in so condensed a form so 
vivid a picture of the war-time experiences of those 
dashing cavalrymen that the people of the South still 
allude to as “Morgan's Men.”</p>
          <pb id="stone2" n="2"/>
          <p> “Passing by this narrative as something that one 
who did not participate therein is incompetent even 
to review, the Evening Post would call attention, 
if only for the importance it may have relative to the 
soldiers now returning to civil life, to the part played 
in the affairs of Kentucky and the Union by these 
soldiers of Morgan's command after the war was 
over. It was a very creditable part. No doubt there 
were the few exceptions that prove the rule, but, as a
broad proposition, wherever one of “Morgan's Men” 
settled, the community gained a good citizen. We 
will not attempt to call the roll of those who helped 
to make the history of Louisville in the past fifty 
years. Many of them, indeed, have passed away -
Basil W. Duke, John B. Castleman, George B. Eastin, 
Thomas W. Bullitt and others whose names recall 
the best traditions of Louisville. Henry L. Stone 
remains with us, vigorous in body, keen in mind, always
ready to fight, and fight hard, for a good cause, 
an ornament to the bar and a splendid specimen of 
that splendid manhood that the soldiers of the Confederacy 
furnished a reunited country.”</p>

        <p>I was asked by Col. Milton, our commander, 
to give a “talk” to our Camp this evening. I see, though, 
in his notices which he sent out - I received one -
and in the newspapers, he has dignified what I am to 
say to you as an “address.” I will leave it to you, 
after I get through, whether it is one or the other, or 
both. </p>
        <p>I regret that I have not had an opportunity to 
prepare much that would be worth while to my Comrades 
who are here to-night, but will deal with some 
of my own experiences during the Civil War and 
give you a narrative of them. This I will undertake 
to do, with the hope my account may prove somewhat 
interesting to you. I can only vouch for the truthfulness 
of what I shall detail from my own personal 
knowledge.</p>
        <p>There is no tie of friendship so strong and lasting
as that wrought by a common service among soldiers 
engaged in a common cause. Time and distance are 
powerless to sever such a tie or to erase from memory 
the vivid recollections of dangers encountered and    
hardships endured.  </p>
        <p>On a September night nearly fifty-eight years ago, 
John H. Morgan led forth from the City of Lexington 
his little squadron of faithful followers, who 
formed the nucleus of that gallant command which 
afterward, under his matchless leadership, executed 
so many brilliant military achievements and won for    
 <pb id="stone4" n="4"/>   
him and themselves imperishable renown. Gen. Morgan's 
bold, original, and skillful methods of warfare 
attracted the admiration of thousands of young 
men in Kentucky, and even other States, who enthusiastically 
gathered under his banner.</p>

            <emph rend="bold">EARLY TRAINING. ADVOCATE OF STATE RIGHTS.</emph>
          </head>
          <p>As already stated, I propose on this occasion to 
give an account of some of my own experiences as one 
of Morgan's Men. A native of Bath County, Ky., 
when a boy nine years old, I became a resident of 
Putnam County, Ind., to which State my father removed
in the autumn of 1851. In the presidential 
campaign of 1860, at the age of eighteen, I canvassed 
my County for Breckinridge and Lane. There were 
three other young men representing the tickets of 
Abraham Lincoln, John Bell and Stephen A. Douglas, 
respectively. We styled ourselves: “The Hoosier 
Boys - All Parties Represented,” and canvassed the 
County, speaking on Saturday afternoons at as many 
as ten or a dozen points before the day of election.</p>
          <p>When the War between the States came on, I was 
an earnest advocate of State rights, and determined 
to embrace the first opportunity offered to go South 
and enlist in that cause, which I believed to be right. 
Three of my brothers were in the Federal army, 
but I could not conscientiously go with them.</p>

          </head>
          <p>On September 18, 1862, after the battle of Big 
Hill, near Richmond, Ky., and the occupation of
this State by the forces of Gens. Smith and Marshall, 
I put aside the study of law, bade farewell to my 
parents, and left Indiana to join the Confederate 
army. I came to Cincinnati while it was under martial 
law, passed the pickets above the city, in a 
countryman's market wagon, took a boat at New 
Richmond, Ohio, and landed on a Sunday morning 
at Augusta, Ky. That day I attended Sunday-school 
in Augusta, and walked to Milton, in Bracken 
County, where I stayed all night. The next day I 
reached Cynthiana, and found there the first confederate 
soldiers I ever saw, being a portion of Morgan's 
Men under Col. Basil W. Duke. I remember 
I was struck with the odd appearance of some of 
these soldiers, particularly observing their large rattling 
spurs and broad-rimmed hats, many of which 
were pinned up on one side with a crescent or star.  </p>

            <emph rend="bold">DUKE'S FIGHT AT AUGUSTA, KY.</emph>
          </head>
          <p>This was but a few days before Col. Duke's desperate 
fight at Augusta.</p>
          <p>An incident occurs to my mind here. Ten years 
later I was Democratic Elector for the Ninth Congressional 
District, making a campaign in behalf of 
Greeley and Brown, and Augusta was one of my 
points to speak. While at the hotel that night, a 
young man came to my room and that of Hon. John    
<pb id="stone6" n="6"/>
D. Young, who was the Democratic candidate for 
Congress and traveling with me, and he told us all 
about the fight of Col. Duke, what a bloody affair 
it was, and how the people had noticed a young man 
a few days before passing through Augusta and going 
to Sunday-school, and they attributed Duke's 
plans to that young man's story of how conditions 
were in Augusta; in other words, that he had acted 
as a spy for Duke. I said, “Young man, you are 
mistaken about that matter and your people are mistaken. 
I was the lad that came through your town 
and went to Sunday-school, but I had then no idea 
of Duke's contemplated fight whatever, and did not 
know anything about it until after it occurred, so you 
are all laboring under a mistake in thinking I had 
anything to do with it.”</p>

          <p>I arrived at Mount Sterling, and set foot “on my 
native heath,” in Bath County, within a week after 
my departure from Indiana.</p>
          <p>On October 7, 1862, I enlisted at Sharpsburg in 
Capt. G. M. Coleman's company, composed chiefly 
of my boyhood schoolmates and belonging to Maj. 
Robert G. Stoner's battalion of cavalry, which was 
subsequently, in Middle Tennessee, consolidated with 
Maj. Wm. C.P. Breckinridge's battalion, thus forming 
the 9th Kentucky Regiment in Morgan's command.</p>
          <p>I was appointed sergeant major of Maj. Stoner's 
battalion, and served in that capacity until the consolidation

            <emph rend="bold">THE BATTLE AT HARTSVILLE.</emph>
          </head>
          <p>Sixty days after my enlistment our regiment was    
engaged in its first fight at Hartsville, Tenn., where    
Col. Morgan won his commission as brigadier general    
and achieved, perhaps, his most brilliant victory by    
killing and wounding over four hundred of the enemy and    
capturing two splendid Parrott guns with more than two   
thousand prisoners. On the day after this battle, I wrote a    
letter to my father and mother (the original of which has    
been preserved), headed as follows: “In camp two miles    
from Gen. Morgan's headquarters and eight miles from    
Murfreesboro on the Lebanon Pike, Monday, December    
8, 1862.” The fight <sic corr="occurred">occured</sic> on Sunday. </p>
          <p>Among other things, I gave in this letter the    
following account of our engagement at Hartsville,    
which may serve to illustrate the exuberance of spirits    
felt over that victory by a soldier of twenty years of age,    
after only two months' service:  </p>
          <p>We've had only one battle yet, and that was 
on yesterday at Hartsville, in this State. I'll 
give you a short description of it. Day before 
yesterday morning at nine o'clock we left camp 
with all of Morgan's Brigade, except two regiments
 (Duke's and Gano's), and also the Ninth
<pb id="stone8" n="8"/>  
and Second Kentucky Regiments of Gen. Roger
Hanson's brigade of infantry - in all about 
twenty-five hundred men, with five or six pieces 
of artillery. We marched through Lebanon, and 
went into camp after traveling thirty-four miles. 
Our battalion and two pieces of artillery were 
within four miles of the enemy. The other portions 
of our force took another route, crossing 
the Cumberland in the night and getting in the 
enemy's rear. We left camp after sleeping one 
hour and a half, and got in position in five hundred 
yards of the enemy at five o'clock in the
morning, before it was light. This hour was set 
by Morgan to begin the attack on the enemy on 
all sides; and well was it carried out, Morgan's 
portion firing the first gun. The firing soon became 
general, and of all the fighting ever done 
that was the hottest for an hour and fifteen 
minutes. The bombs fell thick and fast over our 
heads, while Morgan's men yelled at every step, 
we all closing in on the Yankees. I fired my 
gun only two or three times. We took the whole 
force prisoners, about twenty-two hundred men, 
the 10th Illinois, 106 and 108th Ohio, and two 
hundred Indiana cavalrymen, with two pieces 
of artillery. We took also all their small arms, 
wagons, etc.</p>
          <p>Then occurs in this letter what may seem now
somewhat ludicrous, but it is here and I will read it:</p>
          <p> I captured a splendid overcoat, lined through 
and through, a fine black cloth coat, a pair of
 new woolen socks, a horse muzzle to feed in, 
an Enfield rifle, a lot of pewter plates, knives and
<pb id="stone9" n="9"/>
forks, a good supply of smoking tobacco, an extra 
good cavalry saddle, a halter, and a pair of 
buckskin gloves, lined with lamb's wool - all of 
which things I needed.”</p>
          <p>The officers of the forces captured were paroled 
and sent through the lines. One of them promised to 
see that this letter reached its destination, and in it 
I stated:</p>
          <p>I'll tell you how I've met with a chance to 
send this to you. It is by a very gentlemanly 
Yankee lieutenant whom we captured yesterday 
who says he'll mail it to you from Nashville, and 
I think he'll be as good as his word. I shall leave 
it unsealed, and he'll get it through for me without 
trouble, I think.  </p>
          <p>But he failed to discharge the trust he had assumed.    
Some three weeks afterwards it was found 
at Camp Chase, Ohio, and sent to my father by a man 
named Samuel Kennedy.</p>

</head>
          <p>On our celebrated raid into Kentucky during the    
Christmas holidays of 1862 we captured at 
Muldraugh's Hill an Indiana regiment of about eight 
hundred men, who were recruited principally in Putnam 
County, many of whom were my old friends and 
acquaintances. I saw and conversed with a number 
of them while prisoners in our charge, and had my 
fellow-soldiers show them as much kindness as possible 
under the circumstances. This regiment had
  <pb id="stone10" n="10"/>  
only a few months before been taken prisoners at 
Big Hill, Ky., and after being exchanged were armed 
with new Enfield rifles, all of which fell into our 
boys' hands and took the place of arms much inferior.</p>
          <p>That was my first acquaintance with the Louisville 
&amp; Nashville Railroad. We burned all the trestles 
on Muldraugh's Hill, and thus cut the connections 
of the Federal army in Tennessee.</p>

            <emph rend="bold">THE INDIANA AND OHIO RAID.</emph>
          </head>
          <p>There are doubtless some here to-night who were 
on Morgan's remarkable raid into Indiana and Ohio, 
nearly fifty-six years ago. The first brigade crossed 
the Cumberland River at Burksville, Ky., July 2, 
1863, when it was out of its banks, floating driftwood, 
and fully a quarter of a mile wide. The crossing 
of our twenty-four hundred men and horses was 
effected by unsaddling and driving the horses into 
the swollen stream, twenty or thirty at a time, and 
letting them swim to the opposite bank, where they 
were caught and hitched, while the men went over in 
two flat-boats and a couple of indifferent canoes. I 
shall never forget the perilous position I was in on 
that occasion. There were twelve of us, who crossed    
over between sundown and dark, with our twelve 
saddles in one canoe. The surging waters came lapping 
up to within three inches of the edges of the 
canoe, and on the upper side once in a while they 
splashed in. The two men at the oars were inexperienced, 
and made frequent mistakes during the passage, 
<pb id="stone11" n="11"/>    
but finally landed us safely on this side. I 
breathed much freer when I got out.</p>
          <p>On this raid, after the disastrous attack of July 
4, upon the stockade at Green River bridge, where 
we lost so many brave officers and men, we, the next 
day, drove Col. Charles Hanson's infantry regiment, 
the 20th Kentucky, into the brick depot at Lebanon, 
Ky.  Our troops surrounded the building, but were 
greatly exposed to the enemy's fire, and suffered 
under the heat of a broiling sun for four hours. Some 
of our men concealed themselves by lying down in or 
behind the tents just vacated by the Federal troops. 
When the order was given by Gen. Morgan to charge 
the enemy, I witnessed an admirable exhibition of 
courage on the part of Col. D. Howard Smith. He 
mounted his horse and led the assault himself, calling 
on us to follow him, in plain view of the enemy and 
under a terrific fire from the depot, not exceeding a 
hundred yards from our advancing columns. On 
the other side of the building, in the charge of the    
Second Kentucky, just before the surrender, Lieut.    
Thomas Morgan, a younger brother of Gen. Morgan 
was killed - shot through the heart. He was idolized 
by his regiment, and many of his comrades, infuriated 
by his death, in the excitement of the moment, 
would have shown no quarter to the Federal soldiers 
had it not been for the noble and magnanimous conduct 
of Gen. Morgan himself. Although stricken 
with grief over the lifeless body of his favorite brother, 
and with his eyes filled with tears, I saw him rush
<pb id="stone12" n="12"/>
to the front inside the depot, and with drawn pistol 
in hand he stood between Col. Hanson's men and his 
own, and declared he would shoot down the first one 
of his own men who molested a prisoner. And here 
I may venture the assertion that no officer in either 
army, as far as my knowledge extends, was kinder to 
prisoners or more considerate of their rights than 
Gen. Morgan.</p>
          <p>When our command crossed the Ohio River at    
Brandenburg, in two steamboats we had captured, 
I experienced some peculiar sensations as I set foot 
on Indiana soil and realized that I was engaged in 
a hostile invasion of my adopted State. I soon got 
over this feeling, however, and regarded our march 
into the enemy's country as one of the exigencies of 
war and entirely justifiable. I was in the advance 
guard under Capt. Thomas H. Hines (afterward one 
of the judges of the Court of Appeals of Kentucky) 
through Indiana and Ohio, and was captured at 
Buffington Island. I rode down eight horses on that 
raid, and although this number was perhaps above 
the average to the man, there were doubtless fifteen 
thousand horses ridden at different times by Morgan's 
Men on the Indiana and Ohio raid.</p>
          <p>About seven hundred of our command under Col.    
Richard Morgan, surrendered at Buffington Island, 
and we were started down the river on a boat next 
day in charge of some Ohio troops (the 12th Ohio 
Infantry, as I recall), who treated us with great 
courtesy. Gen. Morgan and the remainder of his
<pb id="stone13" n="13"/>
troops (except four hundred of them under Col. 
Adam R. Johnson who crossed the Ohio River at 
Buffington Island and thus escaped) were not captured 
until a week later.  </p>

war, and that, too, within forty miles of the home of

would be the fate of a Rebel from the Hoosier State. 
I was, however, shown much kindness by one of the

          </head>
          <p>On the night of October 16, 1863, having been    
confined in prison three months, accompanied by one 
of my messmates, William L. Clay, I tied my boots 
around my neck and in my sock feet climbed the 
prison fence, twelve feet high, between two guards 
and made my escape. I still have the handkerchief
<pb id="stone14" n="14"/>
which I tied around my neck and from which my 
boots swung down my back under my coat, on that
occasion. I have it here in my pocket. (This handkerchief 
was exhibited to the audience.) I have kept 
it all these fifty-five years. It is a cotton handkerchief 
of the bandana order. I do not know whether 
it is still intact or not. It seems to be in fairly good 
condition. I have said I keep it, but the truth is my 
wife did so as a cherished relic. My brother, Dr. R. 
French Stone, who afterward practiced his profession 
at Indianapolis until his death, five years ago, 
was then attending Rush Medical College at Chicago. 
We found him next morning after making my escape 
as he was entering the college building. He showed 
us over the city, and during the day we dined at the 
Adams House, an excellent hotel. It was the first    
“square meal” Clay and I had eaten in several 
months, and I have often thought since that it was 
the best dinner I ate during the war.</p>
          <p> My comrade and I left the city by the Illinois    
Central, going to Mattoon, thence to Terre Haute, 
where we tarried at a German hotel two days, most 
of the time playing pool, having written home to some 
of my family to meet me there. After seeing two of 
my brothers and obtaining some additional funds, 
we came by rail to Cincinnati, thence by boat to 
Foster's Landing, Ky., and from there footed it 
through Bracken, Nicholas and Bourbon Counties. 
Clay separated from me in the latter county. He 
died several years ago in this city, where he practiced

medicine, and is buried in our lot at Cave Hill. I

          <p>I reached Bath County a few days afterward, and 
early one morning I was captured in the very house 
where I was born by a squad of home guards in 
charge of Dr. William S. Sharp, who was my father's 
family physician when we lived in Kentucky. I was 
taken to Mount Sterling, and there lodged in jail -
in the dungeon. To keep the rats from eating my 
bread I tied it up to the wall with the chains which 
were said to have been used in the confinement of 
runaway slaves before the Civil War. My imprisonment 
there, however, was greatly relieved by the 
visits of kind friends, among whom was the one destined 
to become my wife. I saw that old jail building    
every day, when at home, during the seven years I 
resided and practiced law in Mount Sterling from 
1878 to 1885, when I removed to Louisville. It had 
been converted into a dwelling-house, and was then

          <p>To make good my escape from Camp Douglas and

          </head>
          <p>Having serious apprehensions as to the reception 
I would meet with at the hands of Gen. Burbridge 
(who had about that time an unpleasant way of 
hanging and shooting such Rebels as he caught in 
Kentucky, having only a short time before so disposed 
of Walter Ferguson, one of Morgan's men, 
whom I knew quite well), I succeeded in making my 
escape in the nighttime at Winchester, eluding the 
vigilance of Lieut. Curtis and his thirty mounted 
guards, who fired a few harmless shots at me as I 
disappeared in the darkness.</p>
          <p>That night I made my way to Alpheus Lewis', an 
old gentleman who lived near our camp as we went
South at the beginning of the war. We had camped
there around a sulphur spring. It was an exceedingly 
cold evening, the latter part of November. In 
crossing a water-gap over  Stoner Creek, I slipped 
and fell into the water and got pretty well soaked. 
I had on a suit of butternut jeans clothing, and in 
ten minutes after I had gotten out, the water had 
frozen and my clothing rattled like sheet iron.  I 
found my way to Lewis' home, and stayed there part 
of  the night and then left, because I had made some    
inquiries on the road, and was fearful I might be 
caught if  I remained all night.</p>
          <p>A few days later, finding no opportunity to get    
South, owing to the presence of Federal troops in    
Eastern Kentucky, with the aid of friends I got on 
the train at Paris, Ky., and went to Canada via Cincinnati, 
<pb id="stone17" n="17"/>                      
Toledo, and Detroit. I went from the house 
of a friend, residing near Mt. Sterling. A colored boy 
about eighteen years old named “Wash,” was sent 
with me to Paris. We rode horse-back, and he was 
to take my horse back. He knew I was a Confederate 
soldier, but he was faithful to his trust. He afterward 
joined the Federal army.</p>
          <p>Just before entering Paris, I saw two guards in    
Federal uniform, and “Wash” told me there was 
difficulty in getting passes out of Paris, and it was 
right difficult to get into Paris. As soon as I saw 
these soldiers - I had to make up my mind quickly - 
I addressed them first, before they had time to say or 
do anything. I said “See here, gentlemen, I have 
got a boy here with me that is going to take my horse 
back. I am going to Cincinnati with stock, and I 
want to know if he will need a pass to get out?” One 
of the guards answered “No, that will be all right. 
We will recognize him and let him through,” and    
so they did.</p>

          <p>I stayed in Canada, at Windsor and Kingsville, 
four months. During that winter (1863-4) occurred 
cold New Year's Day. I went to a Methodist watch 
meeting the night before and stayed until after midnight. 
When I got back to my hotel at Kingsville 
it was blustering and getting cold fast. The next 
morning by seven or eight o'clock it was so cold that 
neither the young man that was with me nor myself 
could hardly get out of bed. It was eighteen degrees
    <pb id="stone18" n="18"/>
below zero then, and got worse during the day. Lake 
Erie froze over from side to side so thick as to allow 
heavy teams to cross over it a distance of forty miles. 
Some Confederate prisoners who were confined at 
Johnson's Island made their escape on the ice to 
Canada. One of these in making his escape was 
wounded by the Federal guard and was taken to a 
farmhouse near Kingsville. Everybody skated in 
that country, and I soon learned the sport. While 
so engaged I became acquainted with the Misses 
Harris, two handsome and refined young ladies, residing 
at Kingsville, who were the granddaughters 
of  Simon Girty, the renegade. Their mother, the 
daughter of  his infamous character in the pioneer 
days of our country, was then still living.</p>
          <p>I learned to make cigars while I was up there in   
Canada, and I got short of funds before I left, and 
my landlady took my stock of cigars which I had 
left for a balance on my board-bill. It was very 
small, - only $1.75 a week for board and lodging.</p>
          <p>When I went to Canada, I got to the Hirons 
House in Windsor and thought I would register. I 
looked over the register to see if I knew anybody 
stopping there. I knew there was a lot of Confederates 
who had gotten out of Camp Douglas and gone 
to Canada. I looked over the page, and nearly every 
one whose signature I saw on it - I recognized a good 
many of them - had registered his name, Company, 
Regiment, Brigade, Confederate States Army. 
Thinks I, if they can so register, I can too. So I
<pb id="stone19" n="19"/>
wrote my name in full with Company and Regiment,    
Gen. John H. Morgan's Command, C. S. A.</p>

          <p>When I prepared to leave Canada, I knew a Confederate 
soldier was watched by detectives from    
across the Detroit River. I got on the train from the 
East as it slowed up and came into Windsor. I do not 
recall whether it was a Grand Trunk train or the 
Canadian Pacific, but at any rate I got off the train 
before we reached the depot, and some detective 
evidently saw me. When I got out among the other 
passengers and undertook to get on the ferry boat, he 
was following me. Thinks I, this <sic corr="won't">wont</sic> do, and I got 
off and mixed up with the other passengers again. 
After eluding him, I went down in the engine room 
of the ferry boat, and stayed there until I crossed 
over to Detroit, and he was thus unable to find me.</p>
          <p>Another thing: I thought I had become pretty 
well known, and to disguise myself, I had my hair 
dyed before leaving Windsor. You can imagine 
what a sight I was. My moustache and chin whiskers 
were dyed a deep black with nitrate of silver or some 
sort of preparation. I paid five dollars for it, I    
know. In that way, I came on to Kentucky without 
being detected. I came to Covington, and at a restaurant 
there I sat right opposite a man that was with me 
and knew me well in Windsor. He had gone up 
there, I think, to evade the draft. He did not recognize 
me at all. I did not say anything to him, nor he 
to me. I was pretty well disguised.</p>
          <pb id="stone20" n="20"/>
          <p>It was in April, 1864, when I returned to Kentucky 
from Canada. While watching a chance to go 
back to the confederacy, I worked on a farm three
weeks near Florence, in Boone County, a town afterward 
celebrated, in John Uri Lloyd's novel, as
“Stringtown-on-the-Pike.” While there I visited, on
Sundays, my aunt and family, who lived nearby.</p>

          </head>
          <p>On General Morgan's last raid into the State, I
joined a small portion of his forces near Mount Sterling, 
having made my way to them alone on horseback
from Boone County.  By the way, I got my horse -
borrowed it, of <sic corr="course">couse</sic> - from the enemy. There were 
a lot of Government horses in the neighborhood
where I was at work. On reaching Virginia, in June,
1864, I attached myself temporarily to Capt. James
E. Cantrill's battalion, which was a remnant of Gen.
Morgan's old command, with which I remained until
the following October, when after the defeat of Gen.
Burbridge at the battle of Saltville I got with my old
regiment, commanded by Col. Breckinridge then
forming a part of Gen. John S. Williams' Brigade.
Meantime Gen. Morgan was killed at Greenville,
Tenn., on September 4, 1864, where I was present as
a member of Cantrill's battalion (under the command 
of Gen. Duke, who had been exchanged), and
a few days later was one of those who went,
with a flag of truce, to recover his dead body,
which was sent to <sic corr="Richmond">Richmand</sic>, Va., for burial. After

Ky., whose beautiful cemetery is its last resting 
place. In that city in later years, as you know, a 
magnificent and life-like equestrian monument to our 
beloved General's memory was dedicated in the presence 
of a vast throng of people, including many survivors 
of his old command.</p>

Davis and his Cabinet officers joined us at Greensboro, 
N. C., and our command escorted them from     
there to Washington, Ga., where it disbanded. I rode 
to Augusta, Ga., with Lieut. William Messick, who 
was from Danville, Ky., and there I surrendered to 
the 18th Indiana Infantry Regiment, then occupying 
the city, and received my parole May 9, 1865.</p>
          <pb id="stone22" n="22"/>
          <p>Before we were disbanded at Washington, Ga.,
the remnants of the funds of the Confederate States, 
in specie, that had been hauled by wagons through 
from Richmond, was distributed among the troops at 
that time. I remember the men of our brigade got 
$26.00 a piece. Most of it was in Mexican dollars, 
silver money. I brought it home with me. Fortunately, 
I had enough to get home on without using that 
money, and, after our marriage, my wife and I 
thought it would be a good idea to have that silver 
made into spoons. We took it down to Duhme &amp;
Company, at Cincinnati, and enjoined upon them to 
use that silver, and no other, in a set of  tablespoons, 
and those spoons are on our table today.</p>
          <p>No man can fully or correctly appreciate the 
value of personal liberty who has never been a prisoner. 
At least three-fourths of Morgan's men felt 
what it was to endure the fearful life of a Northern 
military prison, and many of them were humiliated 
by incarceration in the loathsome dungeons and cells 
of penitentiaries while prisoners of war. Fortunately 
for me, I escaped from Camp Douglas in time 
to avoid the starvation policy subsequently inaugurated 
there, which was said to have been enforced 
by way of retaliation for the treatment Federal prisoners 
received at Andersonville, Ga. The difference 
between the two was that at Andersonville the 
Confederates did not have the food to give the prisoners.    
<sic corr="While">while</sic> in the North, the Federal authorities had 
plenty, and refused to supply it to Confederate prisoners 
<pb id="stone23" n="23"/>
in sufficient quantities. Of the seven members 
of our mess Clay and I left in Camp Douglas, three 
died there, one took the oath, and the other three, 
after twenty-one months of horrid prison life, were 
exchanged a few weeks before the close of the war. 
Only one of these three is now alive. He is living in 
Montgomery County, near Mount Sterling. Of the 
three who died there, one was James Richard Allen, 
who, in the presidential campaign of 1860 by the 
“Hoosier Boys” referred to, was the representative 
of Douglas; and afterward, in 1862, came South, and 
joined the Confederate Army as I had done. He
had been captured somewhere in Virginia, as I now

while leading him and wearily walking in the column

older than I, and he was the brother who, as one of 
the “Hoosier Boys,” advocated the cause of Bell and
Everett in 1860. He afterward went into the Army, 
the 5th Regular U. S. Artillery. I will have
more to say of him directly. On learning where 
he had been assigned, I wrote to him, giving an account 
of Col. Grenfell's kindness to me on the occasion 
referred to, and requested him to do all in his
power, consistent with his duty, to alleviate the 
prison life of my old army friend, who was, as a true 
soldier and gentleman, worthy of such consideration. 
With this request there was a  faithful compliance 
on the part of my brother, which Col. Grenfell gratefully 
<pb id="stone27" n="27"/>
appreciated. I was permitted to correspond 
with Col. Grenfell, and several letters passed between us.</p>
          <p>In September, 1867, yellow fever broke out at 
Fort Jefferson. Col. Grenfell, having had large experience 
with this dreadful disease, faithfully nursed 
all who were stricken down among the garrison as 
well as other prisoners. My brother's wife was one 
of the first victims. After her death, my brother        
started North with his little three-year-old boy, but        
was taken ill of yellow fever while aboard the vessel, 
and died at Key West. In a letter written by Col.    
Grenfell the next day, in which he gave me an account 
of my brother's death, he stated:</p>
          <p>I deeply regret that his leaving this place    
prevented my nursing him throughout the malady. 
Care does more than doctors, and he had 
great confidence in my nursing. . . . I am 
tired and grieved, having been now twenty-one 
days and nights by the bedsides of the sick (last 
night was my first night passed in bed) - grieved 
on account of the death of your brother, who 
was the only officer that ever showed me any 
kindness since I first came here. I wish I could 
say that they had not been positively inimical 
and cruel. But your brother's arrival put an 
end to all that. I am much afraid that the old
system will soon again be in force.</p>
          <p>From this grand old soldier I received a few 
months later the following interesting letter:</p>
          <pb id="stone28" n="28"/>
          <div3 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
            <opener>
              <dateline>Fort Jefferson, January 15, 1868.</dateline>
            </opener>
            <p>H. L. Stone, Esq. - Dear Sir: Your always welcome 
letter of the 22nd of December was duly 
received, and, believe me, I appreciate and 
reciprocate your kind expressions of regard. I 
owe to your friendship the knowledge imparted 
to Gen. Basil Duke that the heavy restrictions 
placed on me for no fault of mine by former 
commanders had been removed by the humanity 
of your poor brother, and I am happy to say 
that the present commander, Maj. Andrews,    
walks in Maj. <sic corr="Stone's">Stone''s</sic> steps. As long as our conduct 
is good, we need fear no punishment. I was 
rather afraid when I read in your letter that you 
had published mine to you. I do not know what 
I wrote, but believe that you would not have 
done so if I had said anything unguardedly 
which might get me into trouble. This is not to 
be wondered at when I tell you that I was shut 
up in a close dungeon for ten months, every orifice 
carefully stopped up except one for air denied 
speech with any one, light, books, or papers. 
I could neither write nor receive letters. I was 
gagged twice, tied up by the thumbs twice, three   
times drowned (I am not exaggerating), and all 
this for having written an account to a friend 
of some punishment inflicted on soldiers and 
prisoners here, and the bare truth only, which 
statement he (Gen. Johnson) published in the 
New York World. I fear, therefore, giving publicity 
to anything; not that I am afraid of Maj. 
Andrews (I have really not a fault to find with 
him), but tigers have claws and sometimes use 
them.</p>
            <pb id="stone29" n="29"/>
            <p>It was gratifying to hear that your poor little    
orphan nephew arrived safely at his maternal    
grandfather's. I knew little of the child, but 
from what I heard he was a very shrewd one. 
He was too young to feel his loss deeply. I have 
two cypresses which I am taking care of (they 
came from Havana) and mean to place on Mrs. 
Stone's grave, which is on an island about a mile
from this.</p>
            <p>Maj. Stoner's bridal trip was nearly turned        
into a funeral. (I forget that instance. I wrote    
him something about it. Perhaps some of you    
remember Maj. Stoner's bridal trip when he    
married Miss Rogers. He had some trouble with   
the conductor. I forget now what it was.) </p>
            <p>What a savage the conductor must have been!    
The Major wanted two or three of his command 
to be near him at the time of the assault.</p>
            <p>Basil Duke and Charlton Morgan write that 
they are busy enlisting in my favor all the <sic corr="influence">infuence</sic> 
that they can command - Mr. G. Pendleton 
and others. I have also a very good letter from 
a Mrs. Bell, of Garrettsville, Ky., wife of Capt. 
Darwin Bell, who promises that Garrett Smith 
and some other friends of hers will interest 
themselves to procure my release. She read in 
some local paper an extract from, I suppose, my 
letter to you, and she says: “My husband, who 
bears a kindly remembrance of you in the war, 
and myself, felt ashamed to sit over our happy 
fireside whilst his old comrade was wearing out 
his life in captivity, and we determined to work    
until we obtained your liberty.” I have also a 
letter from Mr. S. M. Barlow, of New York, a
<pb id="stone30" n="30"/>
prominent Democrat and friend of Mr. Johnson's. 
He had written to the President and to
Gen. Grant, but had received no direct answer;
but Montgomery Blair, whom he had commissioned 
to see the President, says: “I have seen 
the President for Grenfell. He has promised to 
try to pardon him, although he says there are 
several hard points in his case.” Yes, the case
is full of hard points, but they all run into me. 
The hardship is mine. I do not build much on 
all this, and yet if a regular system of petition 
was gotten up by many influential parties at once
the President might yield. I wish that my    
friends by a concerted movement, combined with    
the Archbishops of Ohio and Missouri, R. C., 
would petition His Excellency. Bishop Quintard, 
of Tennessee, would, I am convinced, willingly 
help an old friend and comrade. But, alas! 
I am in prison and can combine nothing.</p>
            <p>I shall be happy to receive your scrawls, as 
you call them, whenever you have time to indite 
one, although I can offer you nothing but wails 
and lamentations in return.</p>
            <p>Whilst you are blowing your fingers' ends 
from cold, I keep close to an open window with 
one blanket only, and that oftener off than on. 
I have tomatoes, peppers, and melons in full 
bloom. Salad, radishes, and peas and beans at 
maturity in the open air, of course. In fact, I 
am obliged to use sun shades from ten to three 
all through the garden, for be it known to you 
they have turned my sword into a shovel and a 
rake, and I am at the head of my profession 
here. What I say or do (horticulturally) is law.

to myself, believing that I would prize it very highly, 
and delivered it to me at a family reunion at my

            <p>Here (showing it) is that autograph letter. If 
any of you would like to see it, I have it here for that
purpose. I have preserved it since I received it fifty-three 
years ago from my brother.</p>
            <p>Speaking of my brother being in charge of Fortress 
Monroe (which was after the cruel treatment 
of Jefferson Davis at the hands of his predecessor), 
in the book of Mrs. Davis on the life of her husband,

speak of my brother's kindness to President Davis 
while he was in charge at Fortress Monroe, and before 
he went to the Dry Tortugas.</p>
            <p>In February, 1868, the remains of Maj. Stone 
and wife were removed and re-interred in Montgomery 
Cemetery, overlooking the Schuylkill River, at    
Norristown, Penn., the home city of his father-in-law, 
Judge Mulvaney. Some ten years ago my 
brother, Dr. Stone, and I caused a monument to be 
erected over our brother's grave, with the following 
inscription thereon:</p>
            <p>Valentine Hughes Stone, Major Fifth Artillery, 
U. S. Army. Born in Bath County, Ky., 
December 22, 1839, and died aboard the steamer 
from Fort Jefferson to Key West, Fla., Sept. 
24, 1867. He was enrolled April 18, and mustered
into service April 22, 1861, in the 11th Indiana 
Infantry Volunteers, Gen. Lew Wallance's 
Regiment of Zouaves, being the first Volunteer 
from Putnam County, Ind., to respond to the 
call of President Lincoln. He was appointed 
First Lieutenant, 5th U. S. Artillery, May 14,
<pb id="stone33" n="33"/>    
1861; was the heroic defender of Jones' Bridge    
across the Chickahominy in the Seven Days' 
Battles about Richmond. In command of Battery 
No. 9 his artillery was the first to enter 
Petersburg, Va., March 25, 1865. He was promoted 
to the Captain and brevetted Major, same
regiment, upon the personal request of General
U. S. Grant, for gallant and meritorious services 
on the battle field. He died of yellow fever while
in command of Fort Jefferson, Dry Tortugas, 
Gulf of Mexico.</p>
            <p>This monument was erected and dedicated to    
his memory by his brothers, Henry L. Stone, 
who served in the Confederate Army, and R. 
French Stone, who served in the Union Army, 
during the Civil War.</p>

          </head>
          <p>The course of ex-Confederates since the war 
closed deserves, as a rule, the highest commendation. 
As far as my observation extends, good soldiers in
time of war make good citizens in time of peace. The 
toils and hardships of army life fit and prepare them 
for the battles of civil life. The success of ex-Confederates 
as civilians has been commensurate with 
their success as soldiers. Kentucky has selected 
from Morgan's men some of her highest legislative, 
judicial and <sic corr="executive">excutive</sic> officers. From our ranks this 
and other States have been furnished mechanics, 
farmers, merchants, bankers, teachers, physicians, 
lawyers, and ministers of the gospel. There was 
hardly a neighborhood in Kentucky in which there
<pb id="stone34" n="34"/>
did not reside after the war closed one or more ex-Confederate 
soldiers, while many became useful and    
honored citizens of other States. Coming out of the    
army, most of them ragged and poor, some of them    
crippled for life, with no Government pension to depend    
upon, they went to work for a living, and their 
labors have not gone unrewarded.</p>

          <p> I want to say for myself, I got back from the

I clerked in a dry goods store at Ragland's Mills, on 
Licking River, in the east end of Bath County. How

          <p>After the surrender in April, 1865, President    
Andrew Johnson issued a proclamation, whereby the   
rights of citizenship were withheld from certain 
classes who participated in waging war against the 
United States Government, among whom were those 
who had left a loyal State and joined the Confederate 
Army. It becomes necessary, therefore, for me 
to obtain a special pardon from the President, which
I did in the summer of 1865, through the aid of my 
uncle, Henry S. Lane, then United States Senator 
from Indiana.</p>

          </head>
          <p>Most of us have passed far beyond the meridian 
of life, but I trust there is much usefulness in store 
for us yet. We should not content ourselves with    
the victories and honors of the past. The present and    
future have demands upon us. The welfare of our    
respective communities and States, as well as of our    
common country, calls for our continued labors in 
their behalf.</p>
          <p>I shall always remember a remark made by my    
friend, Jerry R. Morton, of Lexington (one of Morgan's    
men, and, for many years after the war, Circuit 
Judge of that district), who has passed on ahead 
of us, one day while we were in Canada together.        
We were walking along the Detroit River, and as      
we took in the broad landscape view that stretched    
out before us, and saw the United States flag floating       
from a fort below the city on the other side, he 
stopped and, pointing across the river, exclaimed: 
“I tell you, Stone, that's a great country over yonder!” 
I acknowledged the correctness of his estimate 
of the American republic. Standing on foreign 
soil, poor, self-exiled Rebels as we were, we did not 
feel at liberty to call this <hi rend="italics">our</hi> country then. But all       
of us have the right to call it <hi rend="italics">our</hi> country today.     
With peace and prosperity throughout the land and 
all sections again united in fraternal feeling, we 
have, even in this progressive age, beyond question 
the greatest country in the world.</p>
          <pb id="stone36" n="36"/>
          <p>In the world war that has practically, if not entirely,    
closed, we know what our country did for the 
cause of human liberty. The boys in khaki went 
across the seas, - the descendants of those who wore 
the gray and those who wore the blue, and they 
turned the tide of battle against the foe. That is conceded. 
We are today looked up to by all the nations 
of Europe to bring about a Treaty of Peace, and a 
League of Nations, that will prevent, as far as possible, 
wars for the future. We have, in my opinion, 
dealing with the situation and laboring with it in 
Paris, as great a President as this country has ever 
had; and if he come back home, as I believe he will,    
with this League of Nations secured, and a Treaty 
of Peace that shall do justice to all the belligerents,   
including our recent foes, as well as the other nations
of the world, he will go down in history, in my 
opinion, as the greatest statesman of all times -
Woodrow Wilson. May God bless him! (Great applause.)  </p>
