        </head>
        <p>The matter contained in the succeeding pages
was never intended for publication.  It represents a
short sketch of incidents, and participation in the late
war, by the late MAJOR-GENERAL BRYAN GRIMES,
and extracts from letters to his wife, written from
the camp, and on the fields of battle, and such other
matters of record and interest as have seemed to
me fit and proper to be inserted therein.</p>
        <p>GENERAL GRIMES had for years after the surrender
 determined to write out his recollections of
the war, solely for the benefit, pleasure and curiosity
of his children and their posterity, to be read in
after years, with no view whatever of their publication,
but simply to be kept as a matter of record in 
his family.  He had commenced this work, as shown
in his original manuscript, and, as far as executed,
it is printed in the following pages.</p>
        <p>In his letters to his wife, he gave briefly an
account of what almost daily transpired, and being
written on those respective days, was fresh in
his recollection, and maybe received  as strictly
<pb id="grimes4" n="4"/>
authentic.  His known integrity and truthfulness
will need no corroboration of what he has written
or related.</p>
        <p>These sketches and incidents demonstrate the
character, honor and chivalry  -  the obligation of
duty, and love of country, of a true citizen and a
brave soldier.  They present a truthful and impartial
history, and will be read with interest and gratification
by his friends and surviving comrades in
war, and with this view they are thus publicly presented.</p>
        <p>It will be observed that in one or two places 
disconnected notes appear, indicating clearly his 
intention to refer to them at some other time, and to
extend more fully their subject matter.  I have
thought proper to have them printed just as they
appear, and as they are written in the original 
manuscript.</p>
        <p>It will also be seen that mention has been once
or twice made of his horse “Warren.” His affection for this animal was very great.  He had been
released from all work since the war, except now
and then his own occasional riding, and the best
attention had been given him.  I have frequently
heard him say, that however much he might need
the money, he would not part with him for thousands
<pb id="grimes5" n="5"/>
of dollars in gold.  This old war horse died
only a few weeks ago, at the age of twenty-eight,
and in accordance with the General's known wishes,
was buried as carefully and as decently as a human
being near the spot where his dead master now
rests.</p>
        <p>MAJOR-GENERAL BRYAN GRIMES was born in
the county of Pitt, on the south side of Tar River,
about eight miles from the town of Washington, N.
C., on the 2nd day of November, 1828.  He received
a good <sic>academical</sic> education, and entered Chapel
Hill in June, 1844, and graduated in June, 1848.  In
about a year after leaving college, his father gave
him the plantation upon which he lived up to the
time of his death, and whereon his family now 
reside.  He had no desire for political life, and with
the exception of the few days he was a member of
the Convention of 1861  -  known as the Secession
Convention  -  he led the quiet life of a farmer, 
combining industry and good judgment, from his early
manhood to the close of his life.</p>
        <p>He was on the 9th day of April, 1851, married
to Miss Elizabeth Hilliard, daughter of Dr. Thomas
Davis, of Franklin county, who died on the 7th
day of November, 1857.  The only living issue of
this marriage is a daughter, the wife of Samuel F.
<pb id="grimes6" n="6"/>
Mordecai, Esq., of Raleigh, N. C.  On the 15th
day of September; 1863, he was again married to
Miss Charlotte Emily, daughter of the late Hon.
John H. Bryan, of Raleigh, N. C., who with eight
children now survives him.</p>
        <p>My relations to GENERAL GRIMES forbid me to
speak in such extended teams of praise as my feelings would dictate to speak of one of the truest and
bravest of men.  For honesty of purpose  -  for devotion to principle  -  for firmness of friendship  -  for
honor in all things  -  for truthfulness in all things  -  
for faithfulness to all promises and obligations, and
for true, genuine courage, he stood on the day of
his death the peer of any living human being.</p>
        <p>On Saturday evening of the 14th of August,
1880, while returning from the town of Washington,
when at Bear Creek, within two miles of his home,
he was, just at sun-set, shot from an ambush by a
concealed assassin, and almost instantly killed.  A
little boy, about ten years old, a neighbor's son, was
his only companion to whom he said, “I am shot
and will die,” and immediately thereafter fell slowly
to the foot of the buggy and expired.  Several
buck-shot struck the ribs and the top of the buggy,
but only one shot took effect on his person, which
<pb id="grimes7" n="7"/>
passed through the thick part of his left arm, and
lodged deep in the heart.</p>
        <p>That evening's sun, just sinking into darkness,
left its frowning shadows upon this terrible deed.
Its morning rays fell upon a household saddened
by affliction, and saw the mother and her children
still bending over the lifeless form.  Its midday
brightness, on the succeeding day, rested upon the
large and solemn assemblage gathered at the 
homestead to render the last and only tribute of respect
and affection.  The end was soon over, and the
tomb received all that remained of him who would
have made any sacrifice to maintain his honor, and
who did freely peril his life for his State and for his
section.</p>
        <p>The rounded mound marks now, and will 
continue to mark, the resting place of one who, in life,
bore the type of God's highest creation  -  the 
attribute of a Creator's mightiest perfection,</p>

        <argument rend="sc">
          <p>An account of his own recollections of the War, and a brief account
in part of his own participation therein, by the late MAJOR-
GENERAL BRYAN GRIMES, taken from his original manuscript.  -  
Extracts taken from letters to his wife from the fields of battle.  -   
His own account of the last fight at Appomattox.   -   General Orders.   -   Reports.  -  Other interesting matter, &amp;c., &amp;c.</p>
        </argument>
        <div2 type="part">
          <p>I returned from Europe in the middle of the
great political excitement over the election of 
Lincoln to the presidency, and about the time of the
secession of South Carolina from the Union, and
became deeply interested in the action of the South;
and upon the bombardment of Sumpter by Beauregard,
had gone down there for the purpose of 
witnessing the fight, but was too late to see the 
capitulation.</p>
          <p>Thence I went to Montgomery, the then seat
of government, and from there to Pensacola, to
witness the threatened attack of Bragg at that
point.  After remaining there a few days, and seeing
no prospect of the bombardment, I visited New
<pb id="grimes10" n="10"/>
Orleans, and came up the Mississippi river to 
Tennessee, and was on the train with the first troops
sent from Alabama to Richmond, and happened to
occupy a seat immediately in front of Andrew
Johnson, afterwards President of the United States,
and then heard the first groans given in contempt
of his treachery to the South, which wires repeated
at every station, when it was made known that he
was on board the train.</p>
          <p>On returning home to North Carolina, I found
myself a candidate for the Convention which had
been called by the Legislature during my absence,
to which Convention I was elected without opposition.  
The election was on the 13th May, and I
proceeded at once to Raleigh, and signed the 
Ordinance of Secession on the 20th May, 1861, and
whilst a member advocated the most extensive war
measures.  In a short time after the organization of
the ten regiments of “State Troops” raised for, and
by request of the Confederate government, I was
offered by Gov. Ellis the Lieutenant-<sic>Colonelcy</sic> of
the 8th Regiment, or the majority of the 2nd 
Cavalry, or majority of the 4th Regiment, which latter 
accepted.  I felt my deficiency of a knowledge of
military tactics, and Col. Geo. B. Anderson, a 
graduate of West Point, was Colonel of the 4th Infantry,
<pb id="grimes11" n="11"/>
whilst the others were <sic>officered</sic> by inexperienced
civilians like myself, and I preferred a subordinate
position with an efficient officer, to higher rank with
officers without experience.  In consequence of this
appointment I resigned my seat in the Convention
and revisited my home for three days to arrange my
business matters, and then reported to the 
commanding officer of my regiment, which was
organizing at camp, near Garysburg, where the regiment
remained drilling until ordered forward, July 20th,
1861, to Richmond, to be in supporting distance
to be called to Manassas in case of need, and 
arrived at Manassas 29th July, 1861, a few days after
Bull Run and Manassas fights, when the change of
habits induced a serious attack of sickness.</p>
          <p>I received permission to visit the Bull Run
mountains to recuperate.  After a short absence I
returned to my command, and remained with the
regiment until the evacuation of Manassas under
Gen. Jos. E. Johnston in March, 1862, then in command of my regiment, as Col. Anderson was in
command of the post of Manassas and the troops
in that section.  Camped on Clark's mountain, near
the Rapidan river, until April 8th, when the command
was ordered to Yorktown, which point was
reached on the 9th.  Accompanied Col. Anderson
<pb id="grimes12" n="12"/>
when he reported to Gen. Rains for duty, and after
assignment to certain posts, civilian like suggested
to Gen. Rains that the regiment be not divided for
duty as he instructed, but kept intact, and a smaller
regiment placed where these posts were intended,
not wishing to be left in separate command, the
Lieutenant-Colonel being absent.</p>
          <p>Here for the first time I became acquainted with
the fire of the enemy and was assigned the post of
commander of the picket line which I sustained
until the evacuation on the night of the 3rd of May,
when I was left in charge of the picket line of 
infantry, with instructions to keep up as usual the
firing throughout the night, and retire about dawn,
which was very  perilous, as torpedoes had been
planted on all the roads and streets leading into
Yorktown, and my picket had to be kept outside of
the enemy's fire.  About the middle of the day I
regained my command, and encamped with them
near Williamsburg for the night, and next day asked
leave of absence to visit the venerable institution,
“William and Mary's College,” during which visit
the fight commenced, and carried off by the 
excitement, I followed the sounds of strife until in the
midst of the battle, and never realized my danger
until I saw several officers and couriers of Gen.
<pb id="grimes13" n="13"/>
Johnston killed, thinking that there was no great
danger so long as I was no nearer the strife than the
commanding General, it then being a prevalent idea,
which was afterwards exploded on our side, that the
General officers never occupied posts of danger.
Seeing the flag of my regiment advancing, I rode up
to go in with it and remarked to Col. Anderson, “I
hope you have not required my services.” And
then in the only severe and abrupt manner used towards me before or after, I was informed that my
conduct was unmilitary, and my proper position was
with my regiment.</p>
          <p>The participation of the 4th Regiment in this
battle was slight, and the Brigade Commander being
placed in command of the field of battle, the
command of the Brigade devolved upon Col. Anderson
and that of the regiment upon me, when Col. Anderson remarked that he would take advantage of
my knowledge of the field of battle, I having been
present during most of the engagement and knew
the localities, and thus riding over the field we 
continued together until near daylight, when we were
withdrawn.  This night, though in May, was one of
the most disagreeable of my army experience, a
heavy penetrating mist, nearly freezing the men to
the bone when all would huddle together for the
<pb id="grimes14" n="14"/>
mutual warmth of their bodies, and when my horse
became the centre for the regiment, around which
they collected, the first few attracted by the animal
heat from the horse's body, until they formed a complete
mass of men.</p>
          <p>From thence the army retired slowly, but always
on the alert, to the Chicahominy river.  While there
by an alarm of the approach of the enemy, the
tents were all struck and wagons sent toward Richmond,
leaving the army tentless and comfortless in
the midst of a cold drizzling rain, when taking 
possession of a rice-<sic>tierce</sic>, or hogshead, which I
shared with Col. Anderson, I became perhaps
the most comfortable of all that host, as all comfort
goes by comparison.</p>
          <p>I was then ordered with the regiment near Richmond, 
and ordered to report to Gen. Garland, Col. 
Anderson being in temporary command of 
Featherstone's Brigade, and withdrawn and returned to Col.
Anderson in time to participate in the battle of
Seven Pines on May 31st, 1862, which engagement
entered into with 25 officers and 520 non-
commissioned officers and privates.  All the officers
were killed, or wounded except myself, with 462
men killed and wounded.   I attacked the fort and
redoubt where my horse's head was blown off, and
<pb id="grimes15" n="15"/>
falling so suddenly as to catch my foot and leg
under the horse.  The regiment seeing me fall, 
supposed I was killed or wounded, and began to falter
and waver, when I, still penned to the earth by the
weight of my horse, waved my sword and shouted
forward! forward!  Whereupon some of my men
came to my assistance and pulled the horse off,
when seeing the flag upon the ground, the flagbearer
and all the color-guard being killed or
wounded, I grasped it and called upon them to
charge! which they did, and together with others
captured the fortifications.  Here John Stikeleather,
from Iredell, (Company K, 4th N. C. State Troops),
came up and requested to be allowed to become the
standard-bearer, promising to bear it with credit to
himself and the regiment so long as strength and
life lasted.  After a few moments the enemy began
to rally in rear of their tents, and upon my calling
Gen. Garland's attention to the fact, I was ordered
by him in Col. Anderson's absence, to take possession of a wood near by, and begin firing upon
them.  In double-<sic>quicking</sic> across an open space of
arable land to get to the cover of these woods, I
perceived that the enemy were engaged in throwing
up an earthwork to my right, when giving the command by the right flank I charged the works taking
<pb id="grimes16" n="16"/>
many prisoners, and fired upon the enemy for the
remainder of the day.  That night I slept between
Gen. Garland and Col. Anderson on one horse
blanket and covered by another, surrounded by dead
and wounded, both men and animals.</p>
          <p>The next day was not actively engaged, but
retired that night, the enemy having been heavily 
reinforced.  From then until the 26th of June there
were daily skirmishes along the lines, when on that
day we passed the Chicahominy, near Mechanicsville, 
and although not actively engaged, was held
under terrific infantry fire, and commanded to 
support other troops and artillery, and remained in that
position until near daylight, when we were ordered
off to report to Gen. Hill by his special orders.
Whereupon he directed me to “charge that battery,”
which was the only obstacle on the road to Cold
Harbor.  Whereupon I asked Gen. Hill if he was
aware that I had no officers, and only about sixty
men, when I was told to hold myself in readiness to
charge, if others who were ordered forward a second
time failed to take it.  I deployed my men on the
line and instructed them to fire upon any of these
troops who failed to move forward to the charge.
They were then successful but found other impediments 
further on, whereupon Gen. Hill determined
<pb id="grimes17" n="17"/>
to accomplish his purpose without further sacrifice
of life, and by a circuitous route caused them to
abandon their position, and then marched us down
to near Cold Harbor, where we again found the
enemy in our front, whereupon Gen. Hill, seeing a
battery and not being positive whether they were
Jackson's men expected at that point or the enemy,
ordered a flag forward to be waved, when I took the
flag of the 4th regiment and galloped my horse 
towards the battery, when they opened with the whole
battery on the line in column, in my rear, and here
was on the extreme left of the long continuous
line of battle and kept the enemy in check, until
late in the afternoon there came an order to charge!
and forward they went.  My horse was killed
and I continued on foot, driving the enemy from
his breastworks through their camps, taking their
artillery and supplying myself with another horse.
Here I captured a fine St.  Bernard dog, which was
protecting the corpse of a Colonel of a 
Pennsylvania regiment, who upon inspection was found to
have on steel breast plates, which had protected him
so long as his face was to the fire, but upon retreating
had received a mortal wound in the rear.</p>
          <p>This dog (“General”) became the pet of the
regiment, and remained with it for over two years,
<pb id="grimes18" n="18"/>
when in pursuit of Hunter in the Valley of 
Virginia in 1864 he succumbed to the hard marching,
broke down and was lost, not having the endurance
of men.  That night heard the rumbling of wagons
and artillery and the tramp of troops, until in the
morning it was found that the enemy had crossed
the Chickahominy.  Here, for the first time, I had
the honor of being introduced to the great Jackson,
and I now have the mess-chest upon which he joined
us at dinner, dining from the contents of a sutler's
wagon captured the day previous.</p>
          <p>Crossed the river at Grapevine bridge and 
pursued the enemy as far as the White Oak, when
against the consent and protest of Gen. Anderson,
who had been made Brigadier, I was detailed by
Gen. Hill to take charge of the captured stores and
prisoners, and report at Richmond with them.  Gen.
Anderson saying “that although small in numbers
Colonel Grimes and regiment is the keystone of my
brigade.”  I remained around Richmond until about
the middle of July, when an attack of typhoid fever
compelled me to visit Raleigh and recruit my health.
My visit home was of short duration, returning in
time to the army to take a part in the first invasion
of Maryland and the battles previous to the crossing
of the Potomac.</p>
          <pb id="grimes19" n="19"/>
          <p>I recall the circumstance near Savage Station of a
man perfectly rigid in death, with his musket up to
this face, and in the act of taking aim; burning of
the trains  -  pile of metallic coffins  -  Catholic Priests  -  
a Federal soldier claiming exceptional kindness on
account of his being a native of North Carolina, &amp;c.
My command did not participate much in the 
battle of Second Manassas, but were in the field and
assisted in driving the enemy beyond Centreville,
when the line of march was taken up for Maryland,
and reached Leesburg 4th September, and on the
5th, when crossing the Potomac at White's Point,
near Edwards' Ferry, I received a very severe hurt
from the kick of a horse, which incapacitated me
from active duty, not being able to either walk or
ride, but had myself carried in an ambulance in 
anticipation and hopes of a speedy recovery.  Here
we were encamped near Frederick City for several
days, and then moved up to the vicinity of 
Hagerstown.  On the 14th of September the command
was called upon to proceed down the turnpike to
Middletown, near the pass over South Mountain,
when seeing an engagement with the enemy was 
inevitable, I had myself placed upon my horse and
took the command of my regiment, and was first
sent with the command to the left of the turnpike,
<pb id="grimes20" n="20"/>
and subsequently withdrawn and ordered with
another regiment to proceed to the assistance of
Gen. Garland, then engaged on the right.  In 
advancing was met by the corpse of that gallant officer
being brought off the field.  Here the fight
continued all day.  Here my horse was killed under me
on the mountain and to my own and the surprise of
my command I commanded my troops in the battle
until nightfall, when I threw myself down to rest
by my brigade commander, Gen. G. B. Anderson,
who seeing me so exhausted after the excitement of
the day, insisted upon my going to the rear, and
called up four litter bearers and had me carried to
the hospital, upon reaching which I encountered a
new danger, as the enemy were threatening the
wagon trains, and in consequence as a matter of
safety the wounded who were able to be moved
without danger were ordered to be transported
across the Potomac at Williamsport, where a few of
the enemy's cavalry intercepted a portion of the
train and turned them down the wrong road, and
had by this means secured very many of our
wagons and ambulances, before the trick was 
discovered, and then there were not more than half a
dozen wagons intervening between the wagon 
carrying me and the road which led into the enemy's
<pb id="grimes21" n="21"/>
lines.  Together with others of the wounded and
wagoners the enemy were driven off and I was safely
landed once again on Virginia soil, having crossed
the river near Williamsport.</p>
          <p>The next two days, kept with the train and was
carried to Shepardstown where I remained, being
unable to report to my command, which was then
engaged in battle at Boonsboro, where my friend
and mess-mate, Gen. G. B. Anderson, received the
wound from which he subsequently died after returning home.  The regiment with Gen. D. H. Hill's
command went into quarters on the Opequon, near
Bunker's Hill, in  <del hand="bg"/> county, I having to be sent
to Winchester on account of the serious nature of
the injury to my leg, as amputation began seriously
to be talked of.  Here and at camp I remained
until in November, and would have asked for a
furlough but for the ride, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>I reported for duty though not recovered (and
still have an indentation in the bone from the 
injury), when Gen. Hill relieved Col. Cristie, who had
been assigned to the command of Anderson's
Brigade, and put me in charge.</p>

          <p>The command was reorganized and perfected in
drill and then assigned to destroy the Baltimore and
Ohio railroad from Charlestown, the site of the 
execution of the notorious Kansas Ruffian, John
Brown, who was executed at this point within two
miles of Harper's Ferry.  The work was done
effectually at night by tearing up the cross-ties and
<pb id="grimes23" n="23"/>
putting them in large piles of twenty to thirty, and
then crossing the iron rails over them and piling a
few ties on top of each end of the rails, and just
before day-light setting fire to them  -  the whole at
once  -  the fire so warping the rails as to unfit them 
for use.</p>
          <p>We were then encamped for some time near
Berryville until <del hand="bg"/> crossed the Potomac after
the removal of McClellan from command, when we 
crossed the Shenandoah, breaking ice for the passage
of the men, who had to wade one bitter cold day
over the river to meet the enemy who were reported
as advancing on Paris.  Here, for the first time,
General R. E. Rodes, one of the bravest and best
officers of the Confederate army, took temporary
charge of the division which subsequently became
so distinguished as “Rodes Division” in the history
of the Army of Northern Virginia.  Here occurred
a misunderstanding between Gen. Rodes and 
myself, which continued until the spring of 1864, and
then ended by a gentlemanly and chivalrous action
on the part of Gen. Rodes.  The circumstances
were as follows: Not knowing that Gen. Rodes was
in command of the Division, and supposing that
Gen. Rodes like myself was in sole command of his
own brigade, came up when the troops were crossing 
<pb id="grimes24" n="24"/>
the river, and expressing my opinion to Gen.
Rodes as to the severity of the order forbidding the
men to remove their pants, or shoes, which I thought
ought to be done so as to enable the men to be dry
after crossing, when the exercise would in a short
time warm them up, Gen. Rodes said in a sharp tone
he saw nothing hard in the order and that I had
better go to the river and see it obeyed, that he was
in command of the division, and the order emanated
from him.  The order was reluctantly obeyed, and
after crossing the Shenandoah, as the men had
necessarily straggled out of ranks, I ordered a 
temporary halt to enable the troops of my command to
close up and recover their proper position in line.
In the meantime Gen. Rodes riding to the front,
upon seeing me, asked why I disregarded Gen.
Jackson's order, No. <del hand="bg"/>, requiring the arms to be
stacked at all halts.  The explanation was given
and the men ordered to stack arms.  Gen. Rodes
then instructed me to await where I was and allow
the artillery to pass him. Hour after hour passed,
and no artillery came up.  Finally Gen. Rodes sent
a courier to know what detained me.  I sent word
to him that I was waiting for the artillery.  He
then sent back ordering me forward.  Upon 
reaching the small town of Paris, about two miles distant,
<pb id="grimes25" n="25"/>
as I approached Gen. Rodes was standing on the
piazza of the hotel, and enquired in a very cross
manner, “What has kept you so long?” My reply
was, “Obeying your order.”  “What was that
order?” “To let the artillery pass me.”  “When
you saw that no artillery came up, you should have
come on, as the enemy are advancing.” I replied
“You had just reproved me for not obeying 
General Order No.<del hand="bg"/>, and if you had not 
countermanded your order to await the arrival of the 
artillery, I should have remained there until Gen. Hill
resumed command.”  He then placed himself by
my side, and went on to place the command in 
position and said, “Halt your men here.”  “When I
give the command 'Order arms' preparatory to
stacking arms,” he said, “you need not stack arms.”
My reply was, “It is Gen. Jackson's order, and you
have just reproved me for its violation, and I shall
do it.” He then ordered us forward about a mile
to await the advance of the enemy.  We had 
several slight skirmishes with the enemy's cavalry, and
then marched parallel with the Federal troops across
the mountain at Fisher's Gap, thence down near
Madison C. H. to Orange C. H., and thence down
the plank road to Guiness Station, which we reached
on the 1st of December, 1862, and on the 3rd were
<pb id="grimes26" n="26"/>
moved to Port Royal, twenty miles below 
Fredericksburg, where we had the first snow of any
depth of the winter, and remained here protecting
the river until the night of the 12th, when the enemy
effected a crossing at Fredericksburg, and we were
marched all night, and reached Hamilton Crossing
about day, and were placed in the reserve on the
extreme right of Jackson's line, and consequently
the right of the Confederate forces, where we 
suffered considerably from the artillery of the enemy.
Towards the evening of the 13th, when the first
charge by the Federal troops was made, the brigade
was moved forward to support the troops in the
trenches, and took the front line.  The cries of the
wounded in the hedged old field in our front, where
the enemy had charged, was heart-rending and 
sickening  -  pleading prayers to the Almighty for mercy,
and begging for water to quench their thirst, which
was continued all night.  The expected charge of
next day was deferred, and feeling anxious to meet
the enemy, the officers of the command petitioned
Gen. D. H. Hill to allow us to remain in the front
line until the enemy did advance.  Then was given
us the task of burying the horses belonging to the
artillery that had been killed to prevent the awful
stench, not knowing how many days we would have
<pb id="grimes27" n="27"/>
to keep in line of battle.  We found it a difficult
task and not easily accomplished.  During this
night knew there was commotion among the enemy,
and could see a light in the distance flash up and
then again be darkened, and inferred that the enemy
were moving to their right, and that the light was
obscured as the troops passed, and flashed out at the
interval between the passage of one regiment and
the head of another, and sent to report the 
circumstance to Gen. D. H. Hill, whose reply was that I
need not be uneasy, they were not going to retreat
until after another effort, and be ready for their
charge in the morning.</p>
          <p>Before day next morning we were up, every man
at his post, awaiting the expected charge.  The fog
hung low, and we waited impatiently for it to rise
and show us the plain below.  When I saw the 
enemy were not in sight, I then went forward some
few hundred yards to reconnoitre, and in the 
meantime sent word to Gen. Hill that the enemy had 
disappeared from my front.  Gen. Hill sent my report
to Gen. Jackson, and had himself only been there a
few minutes, when Gen. Jackson, accompanied by
Gen. Lee, rode up to this spot, the highest eminence  
on that part of the field, and asked, “Who says the
enemy have gone?” Gen. Hill replied, “Col.
<pb id="grimes28" n="28"/>
Grimes,” then turning to me, Gen. Jackson said,
“How do you know?” I replied, “I have been down
as far as their picket line of the day previous, and
can see nothing of them.” He said, “Move your
skirmish line as far as the line, and see where they
are.” There was a look of deep chagrin and 
mortification, very apparent to the observer, on the countenance 
of each, though nothing of the sort was 
expressed in words.  The brigade that I then 
commanded was composed of the 30th, Col. Parker;
14th, Col. Bennett; 4th Regiment (my own) State
Troops, 2nd Regiment State Troops under Col.
Bynum.  We then went into winter quarters, near
Corbin's, and picketed the Rappahannock from 
Prestonburg to <del hand="bg"/> by Taylor's house.  Opposite
Taylor's house there were ladies, who constantly
tried to signal us the movements of the enemy, 
particularly when Hooker moved on in April following.</p>
          <p>During the month of February was relieved of
the brigade command by Brigadier-General 
Ramseur.  Obtained a furlough for a short time and I
visited home, and upon returning was occupied in
drilling and disciplining the 4th Regiment, which
regiment was not excelled in the army of Northern
Virginia and was noted for its <foreign lang="fr">esprit du corps.</foreign></p>
          <p>On Friday the 1st of May; before the break of
<pb id="grimes29" n="29"/>day, we were on the march down the old Fredericksburg 
road towards Chancellorsville to meet Hooker's
army, which had just crossed the Rapidan and
striking out for Gen. Lee's rear.  On this march,
for the first time, Gen. Jackson appeared in full 
military costume, and conveyed by his personal 
appearance an idea of the great military hero he was.
My regiment and a Mississippi command were 
detailed for the purpose of feeling the enemy, and
were deployed to drive them in when found, my left
resting on the road and acting as an extended
skirmish line.  Gen. Jackson rode down the 
turnpike with the artillery, and whenever necessary
would have it to unlimber and feel the woods in our
front, and would then ride along my line and upon
much resistance being shown by the enemy, would
say in suppressed tones, “Press them, Colonel.”</p>
          <p>In this manner, without halting, we marched
down near their main body, driving them from every
position, and several of their regiments leaving their
knapsacks piled up where they had been thrown off
when called out to oppose our onward march.
Upon crossing a creek and mill-pond, driving the
enemy before us, all wet, tattered and torn, and
marching over the brow of the opposite hill, the
whole line of the main army opened fire upon us,
<pb id="grimes30" n="30"/>
and if they had, reserved their fire until we had
gained the summit, my command would have been
annihilated.  As it was, they were so astounded by
the suddenness of this alarming fire, that they began
to fall back in confusion, when I rallied them, ordered
them to “lie down” as we were protected by the
eminence upon the hill above, and went forward to
reconnoitre in person, when I saw that we had come
upon a large force entrenched.  Made a report of
these facts to Gen. Jackson, and was ordered to
hold my position until relieved, which was done
about 12 o'clock that night, and we then went down
near the turnpike to bivouac for the night.  When
about 8 o'clock, after noticing Generals Lee and
Jackson in close conference for some time, we took
up that long march for the flank movement which
resulted so seriously to the Confederate cause by
the loss of Gen. Jackson, though successful in an
unprecedented degree in the result of the 
movement.  After a long, tedious and circuitous route to
get in the rear of Hooker's army, about 3 o'clock
on Saturday evening, the 2nd of May, we were in
position with Rodes, Division in front, and 
unexpectedly to them, fell upon Seigel's Corps that was
in reserve, and drove them back for miles upon their
lines behind the entrenchments, attacked them, and
<pb id="grimes31" n="31"/>
carried the line of earthworks, took the enemy's
camp baggage, the meals, and hot <sic>coffe</sic> then boiling
hot on the fire, which we found very refreshing, and
just at dark when we supposed the fighting over, and
was in the act of eating my supper, by an enemy's
camp-fire and from his larder, then unexpectedly a
brisk fire commenced, and in a few minutes 
cannonading, the enemy raking the woods and plank-road
with grape and canister.  Fearing the enemy were
about to charge, I called upon my troops to occupy
the breastwork which we had captured an hour 
previous, and be prepared for the attack.</p>
          <p>After getting in position, and near the plank-
road, I went up the road to see if I could hear anything to account for the sudden firing, when I met
a party bearing a litter off the field, and enquired
who it was.  Someone said “Lieutenant Sumter,”
and upon going a step or two further I encountered
Gen. Rodes, who informed me that the wounded
officer was none other than Gen. Jackson, but he
thought it advisable that it should be concealed
from the troops for fear of disheartening them in
view of the serious work ahead of us in the morning.  We lay down behind the breastworks, and
rested for the night.</p>
          <p>Sunday; May 3rd, Chancellorsville.  Before daybreak
<pb id="grimes32" n="32"/>
this morning we were called upon to hold ourselves
in readiness to support other troops when
called upon, as in consideration of our having borne
the brunt of the fights for the two previous days, others
were to take the advance.  We rested just in rear of
the <del hand="bg"/> Brigade, a brigade of previous good 
reputation, which occupied the breastworks captured by us
the day previous.  A staff officer rode up and directed
by command of Gen. J. E. B. Stuart (who had assumed
command after Gen. Jackson was wounded) the
officer in command of this brigade to advance and
charge the enemy, Gen. Ramseur and myself being
on the plank-road and hearing the order given. 
This brigade commander declined to move forward
his command  -  except by order of his division 
commander.  Gen. Ramseur then said to this staff
officer, “Give me the order and I will charge.” I
remonstrated with him, saying as we had done the
fighting of the two previous days, let this brigade
move forward and we would support them.  Gen.
Ramseur said no, repeated his offer to advance,
when this officer said, “Then you make the charge,
Gen. Ramseur.”Gen. Ramseur then turned to me,
saying, “Let us hurry back.  Call your men to 
attention!” which I did upon reaching the command,
when he ordered the three regiments of his brigade
<pb id="grimes33" n="33"/>
to advance, the other regiment being detached to
<sic>pretect</sic> our right.  The command “Forward!” was
given, and we moved up to the earthwork occupied
by this brigade, and had to climb over these men
now lying down behind it for protection, and over
the breastworks, and again form in line of battle.
Our men were entirely disgusted at their cowardly
conduct, and I, myself, put my foot on the back
and head of an officer of high rank in mounting the
work, and through very spite, ground his face in the
earth.  I heard one exclaim, “You may double
quick, but you will come back faster than you go.”
Mine, the 4th Regiment, was on the left of the 
command, and our left rested on the plank-road.  The
command was given and we advanced in a “double
quick.” The 4th Regiment and three companies of
the 2nd Regiment never halted or fired until we had
taken the enemy's works in our front and bayonetting 
Federal soldiers on the opposite side of the
earthwork.  The hill across the ravine was covered
by many batteries of artillery, from forty to fifty
guns, which had been scouring the woods through
which we had just passed with grape and canister
Seeing their infantry driven from their works, they
abandoned this artillery. The enemy made three
distinct attempts to retake this work, forming their
<pb id="grimes34" n="34"/>
men in column by taking advantage of a ravine just
beyond the turnpike, but each time were driven 
back with severe loss, our men acting with great
courage, enthusiasm and determination.</p>
          <p>The artillerists seeing only a small portion of the
line held, now rallied again to their guns and opened
upon us.  About the same time my attention was
called to my right and rear where I saw large numbers of the enemy fast closing up our line for retreat
(the right of Ramseur's Brigade having halted to
deliver their fire upon encountering the enemy where
they were engaged, while we had taken the breast-
work).  Seeing these Federal troops in my rear, I
gave the order to abandon the captured works and
fall back to the protection of the earthwork still occupied by this (<del hand="bg"/>) Brigade, through whose cowardice
we had suffered so severely.  We crossed to the right
of the plank road, and got back to our line in the best
manner possible.  In this charge my sword was severed by a ball, my clothes perforated in many places,
and a ball embedded in my sword belt and the scabbard, and I received a very severe contusion on the
foot; and upon reaching the earthwork from which
we had first started, I had only sufficient strength to
get over, and lost consciousness from exhaustion
and pain.  One of my own ambulance corps seeing
<pb id="grimes35" n="35"/>
my condition, came to my relief, and from a canteen
was pouring water over my head when I was recalled
to my senses by the voice of Gen. R. E. Rodes, our
Division Commander, inquiring, “What troops are
these?”  The commanding officer who had refused
to advance when ordered by Gen. Stuart's staff 
officer, said the <del hand="bg"/> Brigade.  Gen. Rodes said,
“Why have you not joined in the charge?” The 
reply was, “We have had no orders to advance.”
Under the stimulus of this falsehood, I fully aroused,
pronounced it a <hi rend="italics">base lie</hi>; that I had heard the order
given myself, and repeated his reply.  Whereupon,
Gen. Rodes took out his pistol, rode up to this officer,
presented the muzzle to his head, and, with an 
epithet of odium, told him to forward his men, or he
would blow his brains out.  He then gave the 
command, and this (<del hand="bg"/>) Brigade then moved forward,
and, without firing a gun, reached the breastworks
that we had taken, and found the Federal forces had
evacuated the hill, and safely carried off all their 
artillery posted there.  If these troops had moved
forward in obedience to orders, and encountered the
enemy, we would have advanced quickly to their
support, and captured the principal part of Hooker's
artillery.  As it was, we met with terrific slaughter
<pb id="grimes36" n="36"/>
in my command, and failed to take the artillery.
This closed the fighting at Chancellorsville, for the
infantry.</p>
          <p>I was taken upon a litter to the hospital, where
my contused foot was attended to The next day
rode over the woods we had charged through, and
examined the works we had taken, and found scores
upon scores of the enemy killed, around and in front
of the work, doubtless killed by my command and
the three companies of the 2nd Regiment.  Forty-
six officers and men out of less than 300 (4th Regiment) were buried near this breastwork the next day.</p>
          <p>This charge was as gallant, noble, and self-
sacrificing as the world-renowned charge at Balaklava
of the immortal “six hundred.” Here Polk, my faithful servant, 
was tempted by the offer of $500 to sell
the forage that had been procured by him for my
horse, but could not be bought off.</p>
          <p>From here we returned to near “Hamilton's 
Crossing,” and turned in the woods to recover from our
severe trials of the several previous days, and 
re-organized, examined, and recommended for 
appointment and accustom our new officers to command.
Here we passed the time in drilling until about the
first of June, when we took up our march for 
Pennsylvania.  We crossed the Shenandoah near Front
<pb id="grimes37" n="37"/>
Royal on the 12th of June, and attacked the enemy
at Berryville.</p>

          <head>REPORT OF THE FOURTH REGIMENT.</head>
          <p>In compliance with orders, I have the honor of
submitting the following report of the part taken by
the 4th Regiment N. C. State Troops in the 
engagements around Gettysburg, Pennsylvania.  On 
Wednesday, the 1st of July, we were encamped near 
Heidelburg, and were under arms and on the march
by sunrise. About 4 p. m. arrived near the battlefield, 
and formed in line of battle, being on the left
of our Brigade.  After waiting a few minutes, were
ordered to advance in line of battle, which was soon
countermanded, and then moved by the right flank.  
After proceeding a few hundred yards, this Regiment,
together with the 2nd Regiment were recalled by
Maj. Gen. Rodes and <sic>fronted</sic> on a hill to repel any
attack from that quarter, as at that time there were
indications of an advance on the part of the enemy. 
This position was parallel with the road down which
the other two Regiments of our Brigade had moved.
After a very few minutes, the enemy not advancing,
<pb id="grimes38" n="38"/>
and a Brigade of theirs heretofore <sic>obliquing</sic> to the 
left instead of advancing towards us, Gen. Rodes 
ordered me with the 2nd Regiment to advance.  After
getting from under cover of the hill, we were exposed
to a severe, galling and enfilading fire from a wood
to our right, which compelled me to change front
towards the right.  We then advanced upon the
enemy, joining our Brigade, and driving them in
great confusion, and but for the fatiguing and 
exhausting march of the day would have succeeded in
capturing a very large number of prisoners.  As it
was, we captured more by far than the number of
men in our command, but the troops were too 
exhausted to move rapidly, as they otherwise would
have done.  We were the first to enter the town of
Gettysburg, and halted to rest on the road leading
to Tomsfield.</p>
          <p>We remained in that position during that night
and Thursday.  On Thursday evening about dark
we advanced to make a night attack upon the 
enemy's works, but when we had approached to within
a few hundred yards, and drawing the fire of their
pickets, which wounded several of my men, we were
recalled and placed on a road, where we remained
until 3 a. m. Saturday morning, at times subjected
to severe cannonading.  We were then taken to the
<pb id="grimes39" n="39"/>
crest of hills in our rear, which position we retained
until Sunday morning, when we were withdrawn.
Appended is a list of casualties during this engagement.  
(Omitted.)</p>
          <p>Two much cannot be said in praise of both officers
and men of my command, all conducting themselves
most admirably.</p>

Snicker's Gap, thence to Orange Court House.  Sent
to Morton's Ford to prevent the enemy crossing. 
On 9th Oct., 1863, ordered to Orange C. H., and
went by Madison C. H. to flank the enemy near 
Culpepper.  Enemy made formidable resistance at 
Warrenton Junction, and <del hand="bg"/>, which was overcome, and

on the 14th the Regiment reached Bristoe's Station,
tore up and destroyed railroad track, and fell back to
Kelly's Ford on the Rappahannock.  After remaining

the Rapidan river.</p>

several hours on Wednesday, 14th inst., a running
fight.  Loss from North Carolina greater than from
any other State.  Drove the enemy beyond 
Centreville.  Now tearing up bridges and destroying 
railroads; in a few days fell back to original position.
October 20th, returned home to make arrangements

          <p>You have learned through the
papers that we have been at the Yankees again, or
<pb id="grimes44" n="44"/>
rather it would be more proper to say that they
have again taken up their “Onward to Richmond,”
but after a short time and a few volleys of musketry
they did not move on quite so expeditiously and
confidently, and upon examination of our works and
defenses, concluded to “change front faced to the
rear,” which was done and that hurriedly, much to
our chagrin, for our men had never felt more confident
of victory than on that occasion.  Our position was
equally as strong, if not more so, than that at 
Fredericksburg, which you remember you considered almost
impregnable.  Upon the discovery that they had
disappeared, our Brigade pursued with the old 4th
Regiment in the lead, as usual, taking up a goodly
number of stragglers  -  the meanest in appearance
that we have ever encountered yet, being the lowest
scum of the Yankee foreign population.  It was
really a source of congratulation and encouragement
to see that they were reduced to such straits for
filling their ranks.  One good soldier, I know, must
be equal to ten such specimens of the <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">genus homo</hi></foreign>.
Not one in twenty of those we captured were natives
of the United States.  It was reported by these
prisoners that Gen. Warren's Corps was ordered to
attack, but refused to do so.</p>
          <pb id="grimes45" n="45"/>
          <p>I have just written a brief history of the Regiment 
(4th N. C. State Troops) which you can see by
calling on Capt. Foote, Adjutant General, officer in
charge of the “Roll of Honor.” I give you leave to
call for it and revise and correct it, and embellish it,
if you wish it.  Modesty forbids my saying near as
much as I could have done in praise of it.  By 
calling soon you can read it before Capt. Foote
has transcribed it on his books.  In reference to
other enclosures which I have had forwarded to him,
you will perceive that our loss from disease and the
casualties of battle exceed five hundred.  I don't
know if any other Regiment can show such a record. 
Our Regiment is now in tolerably fair trim, but not
such as it used to be.</p>
          <p>Bye-the-bye, there has been a piece of music composed and dedicated to the Old Fourth.  I sent a
copy to Mrs. Grimes.  Call and have her to sing it 
for you.  I wish you to make her acquaintance.
You will find her at her father's, Mr.  Bryan.  <del type="stars" resp="ns" hand="bg"/>      I learn
that your Legislature is disposed to be fractious and
intractable, like it was last winter.  Can't you correct it?  John, your son, is still at Richmond under

            <p>[A copy of a request made of our Representatives in Congress.] </p>
          </argument>
          <p>We, the undersigned, officers of the Confederate
States Army from the State of North Carolina, 
desire to call the attention of our Representatives to
the unjust and arbitrary manner of selecting general
officers, and earnestly request that you call 
attention of the Senate to this matter before the present
appointments are confirmed by that body.  We 
believe there are instances where officers of great
worth and skill, and of unexceptionable habits, and
who had recommendations from general officers of
high standing under whom they had served, have
been overslaughed, their juniors, who were not 
superior to them in military skill or deportment, being
appointed over them upon the recommendation of
a single general officer.  In some instances lieutenant-
colonels, upon the recommendation of a single
<pb id="grimes47" n="47"/>
general officer, have been appointed over many
Colonels serving in the same Brigade or Division,
some of whom had received recommendations from
general officers under whom they had served, and
had also been mentioned in official reports for 
distinguished gallantry in battle.  We believe this 
system of appointment to be unjust, and calculated to
injure our cause, that it places the reputation of an 
officer at the mercy of his immediate superior, who,
from favoritism or other impure motive, may injure
his military standing by the recommendation of the
appointment of a junior over him. </p>
          <p>We would therefore suggest that resolutions to
the following effect be submitted before these 
appointments are confirmed:</p>
          <p>That all appointments to brigadier-generalship,
now for confirmation of officers who were not 
entitled to expect such promotion by seniority, i. e. 
who were not next in rank to the vacant position;
that the number of battles in which such officer
has been engaged exercising a commission at least
equal to the command next below that to which he
has been appointed; also how often and by whom such
officer has been recommended for promotion, and
in what battles he has been <sic>complimented</sic> in official
<pb id="grimes48" n="48"/>
reports for distinguished conduct, be laid before the
Senate for information.  That the same be shown
of those officers from this State amongst whose
troops the vacancy is to be filled who have been
passed over by such appointments.  That the 
selection of the lower grade of general officers be not
confined to the Brigade or Division in which such
vacancy occurs, unless all other things are equal,
then the Brigade or Division to have preference, but
whenever a vacancy occurs amongst the troops of a
particular State, the selection for promotion to be
made from all the troops of that State serving in the
army in which the vacancy occurs.  We would state
that the War Department has adopted a system of
promotion for all grades below that of general,
which we think just and efficient.  That an officer
cannot be promoted over his seniors unless they have
been examined by a board and failed to pass their
examination, or any especial act of conspicuous 
gallantry entitles him to such promotion.  It is not
sufficient to show that the officer whose promotion
is asked for has behaved in battle with great skill
and gallantry, but some <hi rend="italics">special act</hi> must be stated.</p>
          <p>Whilst we do not desire to limit the selection of
general officers so much, as is necessary with the
<pb id="grimes49" n="49"/>
lower grades, we do desire that the appointment of
juniors over seniors shall not be made without
cause.</p>

<pb id="grimes50" n="50"/>
Troops, for promotion to the command of the 
Brigade about to be formed of the 1st, 3rd, 55th and 
another North Carolina Regiment.  We do also 
recommend for this position Col. W. R. Cox, 2nd North
Carolina.</p>
          <p>Col. Grimes is among the senior Colonels from
our State.  He has commanded his Regiment from
the battle of “Seven Pines” through all the battles
in which the Army of Northern Virginia has 
participated, except “Sharpsburg” when he was disabled,
and “1st Fredericksburg” when he commanded the
Brigade of which he was senior Colonel.  In the 
official reports of all their actions, Colonel Grimes' 
conduct is highly spoken of by his senior officers.  In
battle Colonel G. is conspicuous for skill and 
gallantry.  He commanded for several months (from
Maryland to Fredericksburg) the Brigade now commanded by Brig. Gen. Ramseur.  As a disciplinarian
Col. Grimes has few superiors.  He is ever zealous
in the performance of military duty, and in providing 
for and taking care of his men.</p>
          <p>We believe the claims of Col. Grimes and Col.
Cox to be very strong  -  by the appointment of either,
the good of the service will be secured.</p>
          <pb id="grimes51" n="51"/>
          <p>We, therefore, earnestly recommend their claims
to his Excellency the President for promotion.</p>

battles of the year 1862 except Sharpsburg (when he
was ill).  He has been in many pitched battles, and
has behaved most gallantly in them all.  I think
that he has seen more service than any Colonel from
North Carolina.  His gallantry, ripe experience, 
admirable training, intelligence and moral worth 
constitute strong claims for promotion.</p>

          <p>May 6th.  -  Whipped the enemy like fury last 
evening.  6th.  Have whipped them badly.  Burnside's
Corps particularly stampeded like sheep.  Some of
our troops did not behave so well as expected, 
permitting the enemy to break lines, or falling back in
confusion.  Gen. Lee took command in person.
With waving hat in hand, charged, driving helter

Burnside's Corps, who broke and run before we got
a good chance at them; Indians, also, who did no

          <p>6 o'clock Saturday morning.  -  Enemy are moving.
<pb id="grimes53" n="53"/>
Sharp shooters feeling to see if they be in position, 
but hear nothing from them.  Spoils immense  -  
looks bright for Confederacy.</p>
          <p>May 7th.  -  Enemy active, but nothing 
accomplished by them; regarded as badly whipped and
demoralized.  Walker Anderson killed, Col. Avery
mortally wounded, Lieut.  Col. Davidson prisoner,
Haywood wounded. </p>
          <p>May 9th.  -  Well, but greatly exhausted; was only
slightly wounded in instep of left foot.  Will keep
on duty.  Are getting the best of fights.</p>
          <p>Battle field of Spottsylvania, May 11th.  -  By grace
of God am still spared.  The Yankees have been
punished severely.  We now have good breastworks,
and will slay them worse than ever.  Major Iredell
killed yesterday; shot through the head while
bravely rallying his Regiment.</p>
          <p>May 14th.  -  On Thursday the enemy attacked
Major-General Johnson's line, breaking through, capturing himself and Brigadier-General Stuart of Maryland, together with two thousand prisoners and
twenty cannon.  About 5 o'clock A. M., Ramseur's
Brigade were ordered up to check the enemy, who
were pressing our men, and kept them at bay for
about two hours when we were ordered to charge,
drove them (Ramseur's Brigade <hi rend="italics">alone</hi>) back to the
<pb id="grimes54" n="54"/>captured works, rested a few minutes, and Ramseur
having been shot in his right arm and not able to
keep up, and seeing no one to apply to, and seeing
the necessity for speedy action, I ordered a second
charge, myself leading them, and by the very 
boldness of the move recovered the entire works and all
the guns, capturing many prisoners and killing more
Yankees than the Brigade numbered men.  They
made repeated efforts to retake works but we 
successfully repulsed every attack and held possession
until 4 o'clock A. M. Friday, when we were ordered
to move out, which we did just before day.  Gen.
Lee rode down in person to thank the Brigade for
its gallantry, saying, “we deserved the thanks of the
country, we had saved his army.” Gen. Daniel who
was engaged on our left was seriously wounded and
yesterday morning, at his request, I was assigned to
his Brigade.  He died last night.  He was an 
excellent officer, and although I probably gained a
Brigade by his death, I would have preferred to 
remain in <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">statu quo</hi></foreign> rather than his services should be
lost to the country.  North Carolina has suffered
seriously.</p>
          <p>May 16th.  -  My escapes are regarded as 
miraculous when account is taken of number killed, 
particularly as I never order my men to perform any
<pb id="grimes55" n="55"/> 
duty attended with danger without sharing it with
them. </p>
          <p>May 17th.  -  Little fighting.  Yesterday enemy
moved forward to move hospital with 1500 wounded
which they carried to Fredericksburg.  Loss to
North Carolina has been very great.  Many most
gallant officers killed.  Gen. Daniel had been 
recommended by Gen. Lee for Major-General.</p>
          <p>May 18th.  -  Yankees charged in front but were
repulsed.  Considerably strengthened Grant 
continues to run them against us.  They can't hold out
much longer.</p>
          <p>May 19th.  -  Enemy have disappeared; have 
orders to be prepared to move so as to meet them.
This is the fifteenth day since we have met them.
Have been fighting more or less every day.  If they
would retire beyond the river and give us a breathing, 
spell, it would be decidedly advantageous.
Nearly all are fagged out and need rest.</p>
          <p>May 20th.  -  We made a flank movement last
evening and had a very sharp fight with the enemy.
Two of the “Old Guard” killed  -  Gus Byees and
Taylor.  The old Fourth lost sixty-five killed and
wounded.  Daniel's Brigade behaved most gallantly,
conducting itself most excellently.  The bullets fell
<pb id="grimes56" n="56"/>thick and heavy around me and amid it all has my
life again been spared.</p>
          <p>May 22d, Hanover Junction.  -  We reached here
today after a most fatiguing jaunt.  The enemy 
attempting to flank us as we moved down.</p>
          <p>May 25th.  -  Yankees still continue obstinate and
still continue to rush on to their doom, as more of
them did yesterday when they came on my line.
We drove them with considerable slaughter, losing
but few in Daniel's Brigade, who bore the brunt of
the fighting.  Have now been in line of battle forty-
eight hours.</p>
          <p>May 31st.  -  Yesterday a hard day; the exertion
made and the fatigue undergone almost superhuman. 
Again this Division was called upon to make
a flank movement.  Whipped them, but at 
considerable loss to Daniel's Brigade.  At least three-
fourths of the killed and wounded were from this
Brigade.  There is no doubt its being a fine body, 
of men and will do credit to my command.  Major
Smith was killed and Lieutenant Lemay of Raleigh.</p>
          <p>June 5th, 1864.  -  Received commission as 
Brigadier-General, which, according to Gen. Rodes, 
request, bore date of 19th of May, 1864, on which 
occasion on a flank movement near Fredericksburg,
towards the rear of Grant's army, I handled the 
<pb id="grimes57" n="57"/>Brigade with such efficiency that Gen. Rodes 
approached me soon after the battle, and shaking me
by the hand, said: “You have saved Ewell's Corps,
and shall be promoted, and your commission shall
bear date from this day.”  After remaining in 
position sufficiently long for the wounded and stragglers
to come up, retired to position of the Corps in the
morning.  My rank is permanent, so direct your
letters hereafter to Brig.-Gen. Grimes.</p>
          <p>June 7th.  -  Another flank movement last evening;
did not amount to much.  Last night came to this
spot near Richmond, and for the first time in thirty
odd days have come in the woods to encamp, massed
by regiments.  Have heretofore rested on our arms
in line of battle.</p>
          <p>June 8th.  -  Had orders to be prepared to move 
at daylight, but are still here near Cold Harbor.  
My old Regiment made application to be transferred 
to this Brigade, which I hope will be granted.  I 
have an affection for them, having been associated 
with them so long.</p>
          <p>June 13th, near Southana River.  -  Marched over
thirty miles to-day over sandy road.  Everything  
and everybody exhausted.  Left Cold, Harbor at 2
o'clock A. M.  Appears as if we are going to the 
Valley of Virginia.  Are now on the Charlottesville 
<pb id="grimes58" n="58"/>
road.  Must either be after Hunter or going into
Maryland.  I pray Christ that it will end more 
successfully than the other invasion.</p>
          <p>June 15th, near Gordonsville.  -  Stopped here to
camp for night.  Think we will move up the Valley.</p>
          <p>June 18th.  -  In the morning we take the cars for
Lynchburg, after a most fatiguing and oppressive
march.  During Gen. Rodes, absence to visit his
wife, I have command of the Division.</p>
          <p>June 21st, 1864, Top of Blue Ridge.  -  Have been 
pursuing Yankees at such a rapid gait, haven't had
time to write.  Been almost without rations  -  hard
marching, and nothing to eat.  Start before day, not 
stop till dark, except to rest for ten minutes.  We
move immediately.</p>
          <p>June 22nd, Salem, Va.  -  Since leaving Richmond
have scarcely rested any to invigorate our exhausted
energies, and with it all a deficiency of rations.  For
the duration of forty-eight hours my Brigade did not
have a mouthful of bread, and but little flesh  -  very
little straggling and very little complaining.  
Occasionally, when Gen. Rodes or Early passed the line,
the cry was, “Bread, bread, bread” but through it
all, we made a forced march for the last day, and
arrived too late to inflict much damage on the enemy, 
which was very annoying, as we expected to get supplies

 from them; but instead found only empty wagons
and worthless provisions.  At Lynchburg the  
ladies sent us supplies of good edibles for the 
General officers.  At Liberty I was invited out to 
breakfast, which I enjoyed very much.</p>
          <p>NOTE.  -  JULY  -   1864, I returned home on sick
furlough, being so completely worn out from fatigue
arid hardship as to bring on a severe attack.  Was
in hospital in Lynchburg a few days before leaving 
for Raleigh.  Was quite unwell when I returned,
and had surgeon's certificate of unfitness for duty,
but imagined that duty called me back to the army.</p>
          <p>Staunton, August 6th.  -  Arrived here sooner than
expected.  Found Polk and my horse Warren, who
had been sent home to be taken care of, waiting for
me.  Shall leave early in the morning for Winchester.
Learn that our troops moved into Maryland
Thursday.</p>
          <p>New Market, August 8th.  -  Have stopped for
dinner.  I have found a very-agreeable travelling
companion in Captain Burrill, a first cousin of 
General Lee.  Without his company this horseback ride
of one hundred miles would have been very lonely.</p>
          <pb id="grimes60" n="60"/>
          <p>August 10th, North Fork of Shenandoah River.  -  
Have learned that our troops have returned, and are
encamped at Bunker Hill, where I will rejoin them
to-night.</p>
          <p>Stevenson's Depot, August 12th.  -  My surmises
that they would not remain long at Bunker Hill are
correct, and the indications are that we will not stay
here long, but cannot conjecture in what direction
we will move.  General Early out-generals all of us.
No one can guess when he is going to move, or
where he will next bring up.  The Yankees begin to
think him ubiquitous.</p>
          <p>Strasburg, Aug. 13th.  -  Have been expecting a
fight ever since I rejoined my command last Wednesday,
but have had none as yet.  We have through
strategic movements fallen back from Bunker Hill
to this place.  Have been sick, but am better.  Have
felt so badly, I regretted having gone contrary to
advice in returning so soon.</p>
          <p>August 14th.  -  The enemy are very quiet to-day.
This morning we drew up to attack them, but they
fell back, and we quietly returned to our rest in the
woods.</p>
          <p>Strasburg, Aug.  15th.  -  Another day of rest and
free from fighting.  Had a delightful serenade from
my old command.</p>
          <pb id="grimes61" n="61"/>
          <p>Strasburg, Aug. 16th.  -  Another quiet day, and
from indications think it may be several weeks
before we have an engagement; for the enemy,
as well as ourselves, are erecting breastworks.  
General Anderson will join us, when, as we will be 
tolerably strong, we may strike a blow at them.</p>
          <p>August 18th, Near Winchester.  -  Again have we
driven the enemy from position, and followed them
to this place, they still falling back, and not showing 
much fight.  Their numbers are double ours.  
We were joined by Gen. Anderson's force this morning; 
also a Division of Cavalry.  Could not write
yesterday, was on the march all day.  Now 2 o'clock,
and have not broken my fast.  Am invited out to
dinner, which I accept with pleasure.</p>
          <p>Bunker Hill, Aug. 19th.  -  The enemy continue to
fall back, and we have pressed until reaching the
present position.  What is Gen. Early's intention I
can't say.</p>
          <p>Bunker Hill, Aug. 20th.  -  We have an admirable
camp, but have had nothing but beef and flour, not
even hog meat or salt, to help along.  We remain here
a day or two to threaten the enemy.  I received orders
this morning, when it was thought the enemy were
advancing, to make a big show of fight and bluff
them off, if possible; but if they came in force, to 
<pb id="grimes62" n="62"/>
hold them a little while, to give the others time to
retreat, and then fall back.</p>
          <p>Charlestown, Va., August 21st.  -  I have had 
today a good many killed and wounded, we being in
advance, but have not had all my command 
engaged.  The enemy have a large force between us 
and Harper's Ferry, which Early is demonstrating
upon, and are contesting the ground most 
stubbornly.  This is a mere feint to frighten them and
cover some important move on our part.  I have no
idea we will fight here, for the enemy outnumber us
three to one, and Early knows two well the 
importance of preserving his army.</p>
          <p>Charlestown, August 22d.  -  My experience 
today has been varied.  Early this morning we pitched
into the Yankees and drove them through 
Charlestown to their position on Boliver heights where they
are watching us and occasionally throwing a shell
at us.  I have command of the front line, and this
morning while visiting the picket line as soon as
they spied us their artillery opened upon us, which
passed within a few feet of my horse.</p>
          <p>August 23rd, near Harper's Ferry.  -  Amid the
fighting have escaped injury so far.  Find 
everything more plentiful here than in any part of the
valley, and the people anxious to conduce to our
<pb id="grimes63" n="63"/>
pleasure by every means in their power.  They are
loyal to the backbone.</p>
          <p>Charlestown, August 24h.  -  Another day spent
between Charlestown and Harper's Ferry, the enemy
occasionally demonstrating, and about 12 o'clock
to-day their cavalry charged our picket line and
drove them in, and for the first time in many a day
doubled <sic>quicked</sic> to reach my command in time
to form line of battle, so as to give them a fitting
reception.  At the time I was visiting a neighboring
Brigade, but reached my own and formed line of 
battle before any other troops.  After remaining in
line half an hour found there was no use and 
returned to our resting place.</p>
          <p>August 27th, Leestown, near Shepardstown, Va.  
Have been so busy for two days have not had time
to write.  Wednesday we left Charlestown and 
advanced towards Shepardstown.  When about half
way the enemy's cavalry attacked Breckinridge's
command, which caused a halt, when Rodes' 
Division came up, my Brigade being in advance, we
formed line of battle, threw out one Regiment as
skirmishers, and advanced upon them, driving them
before us.  We chased them for upwards of two
hours, many of the men fainting from exhaustion. 
We drove them entirely from the Baltimore and 
<pb id="grimes64" n="64"/>
Ohio Railroad and beyond the turnpike, when we
halted to rest and found ourselves two miles in 
advance of any other troops, when at the beginning we
were the third Division in the line.  And again that
morning, when near Shepardstown, and the others
had halted for our approach, we came upon the
enemy and followed them until they crossed the
Potomac.  Whenever we are able to get them in a
run, I feel really like a boy and enjoy the sport 
immensely.  After halting, as we supposed for the
night, and I had engaged supper for self and staff,
we received orders to move on the Martinsburg
pike, but I could not leave without that supper, as
I had eaten nothing since sunrise that morning.
About 10 o'clock that night reached the ground
allotted to us, and after placing men in position,
laid down and slept as quietly as an infant.</p>
          <p>Bunker's Hill, August 29th.  -  Am well.</p>
          <p>August 30th.  -  Still at Bunker's Hill quiet.</p>
          <p>August 31st.  -  Severe march and skirmishing.</p>
          <p>September 1st, 1864.  -  At 8 A. M. we were called
out and moved down the road a few miles when we
encountered the Yankee cavalry and pushed on,
driving them through Martinsburg, leaving large
quantities of pork, corn, oats, clothes, shoes, boots,
&amp;c.  I enjoyed the sport, and after driving them ten
<pb id="grimes65" n="65"/>
miles beyond Martinsburg, came back to camp 
without the loss of a single man, and few wounded
We inflicted a right severe punishment upon the
enemy; besides a big fright.  They thought we were
on the route to Williamsport, Md.  My Brigade was
the only one which went beyond the town, the 
others being halted on the edge of town.</p>
          <p>Camp near Winchester, September 4th.  -  We are
having quite a stirring time, and giving the Yankees
a hot time, and doing a great deal of marching 
ourselves.</p>
          <p>September 6th, 1864, Stevenson's Depot.  -  We
have moved down in the direction of Berryville
where we formed to attack the enemy, but found
them so strongly entrenched after skirmishing for a
couple of hours we retired for the night, when we
reached camp wet, and exhausted, and hungry, 
without a wagon or tent to shelter us from the rain,
spent the night all exposed and woke up next morning drenched to the skin.  About ten o'clock began
to retire from the front of the enemy, and moved
down toward this point, where we started from the
day before.  When within a couple of miles learned
that the enemy was between us and our encampment, 
and driving our cavalry before them.  My
Brigade being in advance formed and prepared to
<pb id="grimes66" n="66"/>fight.  Charged them at double quick, and had a
most exciting chase, breaking them in every effort
they made to make a stand and drove them until 
night came on and prevented further pursuit.  This
fight was during one of the severest rains that I
have ever seen fall.  Tom Devereux had his horse
killed under him, and kept up with me on foot until
ordered him to stop.  Both he and Tuck Badger
behave remarkably well under fire.</p>
          <p>September 7th, '64, Stevenson's Depot.  -  Weather
terrible.  No orders to move to-day.</p>
          <p>September 10th, 1864, Stevenson's Depot.  -  The
weather continues very rainy.  We are now very
much in need of clothes and shoes, there being at
least two hundred barefooted and half naked men
in my command.  Am using every exertion to get
them clothed, but with all our rags and nakedness
can put up a most beautiful fight.  The men go into
action with spirit, and I feel like a boy after being
in a fight a few minutes.  To-morrow we break up
camp and again go to Bunker Hill.  Gen. Early has
been very successful in all his <sic>manoeuvres</sic>.</p>
          <p>September 11th, 1864, Bunker Hill.  -  We have
again changed.  Are now nearer the Potomac than
on yesterday.  Expect to move again to-day.  Had
to drive the enemy from this point so we could take
<pb id="grimes67" n="67"/>
possession.  I learn that the enemy's loss was very
heavy Monday when my Brigade charged them.</p>
          <p>Stevenson's Depot, September 13th, 1864.  -  We
are under marching orders.  From the report of 
artillery it will be up the Valley, as the enemy 
appears to be advancing in that direction.  The nights
are very cold, find two or three blankets comfortable
Stevenson's Depot, September 16th and 17th.  -  
Had a serenade last night given by the band of the
“Old Fourth Regiment,” which I appreciate as a
mark of respect and esteem from my old command.
Anderson's Division returned to Richmond.  Only 
our original force left.</p>
          <p>Strasburg, September 20th, 1864.  -  Yesterday we
had a most terrible fight at Winchester, and we were
very roughly handled by the enemy.  We lost a
great many men, and our troops did not behave with
their usual valor.  With great exertion on my part
and that of my staff mine did better than any other,
but that was not as well as I desired.  Gen. Rodes
was killed.  Capt. London, Capt. Still and Lieut.
Barnes, of my staff, were wounded.  The horse of
one of my couriers and my own horse killed under
me, and for nine hours was under heavy fire, and
men falling around me almost every instant.  Have
been as near exhausted as a man could well be, not
<pb id="grimes68" n="68"/>
slept ten hours in forty-eight.  It was the most 
trying day of the war to me, when after whet I 
supposed was a victory, I saw the enemy break over
our cavalry and dash in rear of our troops and cut
and hack away at them.  Am truly thankful for my
safety.</p>
          <p>Strasburg, September 22d.  -  Requested Lieut.
Barnes to telegraph you for fear the report currently
in the rear of my being killed might reach you.  It
was a most terrible day.  In the beginning we drove
the enemy and killed many, and could have driven
them into Harper's Ferry but for the troops on our
left.  Our cavalry first gave way, our infantry were
flanked, then there was a general fall back.  
Ramseur has been assigned to this Division and Pegram
to Ramseur's old command.  Gen. Rodes' place 
cannot be supplied.  He is a serious loss to the 
Confederacy.  Capts. London, Still and Lieut. Barnes
are a great loss to me; their aid was invaluable.
Lieut. Howard was mortally wounded and fell into
the hands of the enemy.</p>
          <p>New Market, September 24th.  -  Have been so
busy no time to write.  Am well and safe after most
fatiguing and dangerous fighting for five days.  My
escapes have been miraculous.</p>
          <p>Camp near Port Republic, September 25th.  -  We
<pb id="grimes69" n="69"/>
have reached a place of safety, after one of the most
harassing weeks of anxiety ever spent by me, less
on my own account than that of others.  It has
been fight all day and retreat all night.  Am 
completely exhausted.</p>
          <p>Near Port Republic, Sept.  26th.  -  A week this
morning since we left camp on September 9th at
Stevenson's Depot, when, in less than one hour, 
encountered the enemy, and, forming line, attacked
him; drove some distance, inflicting most terrible
punishment upon him, and then halted.</p>
          <p>Everything up to 4 o'clock in the afternoon looked
bright, and promised well for a complete victory.
The enemy had turned their wagons back to 
Harper's Ferry about 4 o'clock, then their Cavalry
charged our Cavalry, which was on the left of our
Infantry, which gave way in confusion, and their
forces came down on the left and rear of our column,
when the troops began to give way in that quarter.
About which time I received orders to swing back
and front them from that direction, allowing the
right of my Brigade to remain stationary.  Upon
coming into the open field, I perceived everything
to be in the most inextricable confusion  -  horses
dashing over the field, cannon being run to the rear
at the top of the horses, speed, men leaving their
<pb id="grimes70" n="70"/>
command, and scattering in confusion.  My men
seeing this state of things began also to show 
symptoms of alarm, which I in a great measure checked, 
threatening to blow the brains out of the first man 
who left ranks, and succeeded in quieting them down
and keeping them under control.  Then directed my
attention to arresting the flight of others, and many
a fellow felt the full weight of my best blows from
my sword.  During this time the Yankee Cavalry
was dashing among them, cutting and hewing right
and left.  We then attempted to fall back slowly,
confronting them and fighting every inch of the
ground which was done through to Winchester and
some four miles south of that point.  The ladies of
Winchester came out in the streets when the 
stampede first began and formed across the streets and
entreated the stragglers to return, but without 
success.  I have already told you about having my
horse killed under me, and my escapes from death
on that day appeared marvelous, for from ten o'clock
in the morning until after eight at night, I was in
the thickest of the fight.  Capt. London, poor
 fellow, was shot, and caught by me as he fell.  Capt.
Foster the same day was killed.  That night we
marched until about 2 o'clock when we lay down
and slept until about 4, at which time we were again
<pb id="grimes71" n="71"/>
on the road and reached Strasburg about 12 M. on
Tuesday, cooked up rations, and slept off our fatigue
of the previous twenty-four hours.  I have never
exerted myself so much in my life and my voice was
completely gone; could scarcely speak above a
whisper.  I was as sore as a boil all over and had
to have Polk (his body servant) to rub me over with
liniment.  On Wednesday we erected breastworks,
and prepared for the advance of the enemy, and
felt very secure of holding the position of the command in front.  Were busily engaged day and night
up to about one o'clock Thursday the 22d, when
they attacked our skirmishers and drove them in; 
did not attack the line of battle.  About 3 o'clock
we perceived two columns moving up the side of
the mountain to our left, when the cavalry was
again <sic>fronted</sic>.  I then urged upon Ramseur, who
commanded our Division, to send a Brigade or 
two over to their assistance, knowing that the 
cavalry would run if attacked, but he declined to do so
until he could communicate with Gen. Early, and
then sent Cox's Brigade, but alas! it was too late.
During that hour I suffered more than I've ever
done in my life.  My anxiety for the fate of the
army was intolerable.  I deployed three of my 
regiments to protect my flank in case of an attack,
<pb id="grimes72" n="72"/>which about 4 o'clock came like an avalanche.  The
cavalry breaking, my skirmish line presented but a
feeble resistance.  The enemy attacked me on my
left flank, front and rear at the same time.  I
 remained, fought until Ramseur came up and told me
to.  save my Brigade if possible.  The colors of the
United States troops were then in less than a 
hundred yards of me.  I moved off by my right flank,
firing to the front and left as I marched.  Thinking
that we were going to fight in the trenches, had sent
my horse to a hollow for protection.  A while before
this time I had fallen in walking down the trenches
and sprained my ankle, and was unable to hobble
along but very slowly.  Through mistake my horse
had been carried from the place that I had ordered 
him, and I found myself afoot when I ordered the
troops to leave.  As we marched by the flank we
were firing to the right, left and rear.  Upon 
attempting to put my men in position in line, I found
it almost an impossibility, on account of the 
nearness of the enemy, and that I would be left behind
to fall into the hands of the Yankees.  Just then a
cannon ball cut down two horses in a caisson, and
the drivers were engaged in getting the others loose
from their harness.  Two were, loosened and the
drivers had mounted them before I could get up,
<pb id="grimes73" n="73"/>
and others were cutting out the other two.  To
procure one of these horses was a matter of life and
death with me, and while one of these artillerymen
was cutting away, I vaulted into the saddle and told
him to hurry up, that I must have that horse.  He 
didn't take time to parley with me, but ran off
leaving the horse still fastened by one trace to the
horse that had been killed, and I out with my knife
and began to cut away, when another driver who had
by this time disentangled his horse, loosened this
trace for me, and I put spurs to my horse, and the
Yankees then not over fifty yards from me, and I
had an open field of two hundred yards to run the
gauntlet through, and but few other objects in view
for them to shoot at.  My escape was almost 
miraculous.  On my way I found Col. Winston broken
down and took him behind me.  Overtook my
troops and formed into line, made several short
stands, but the troops on all sides were too much
demoralized to make a successful fight, and it was
fall back all the time, and I was carried along in the
current only by order when I found no support.
This state of thing continued up to nine o'clock
that night, when we finally checked the enemy, and
travelled all night long until we reached Mt.  
Jackson, where rested several hours forming line of 
battle,
<pb id="grimes74" n="74"/>
and then kept the enemy in check until dark,
when we continued our retreat to Rudes' Hill, near
New Market, and about 9 o'clock next morning the
enemy again began to press.  We remained until
12 o'clock, when we found that they were flanking
us in the same manner that they had done on the
two previous occasions, and Gen. Early then began
to withdraw us in line of battle, which was very
successfully done until about night, when we 
withdrew to Brown's Gap and Port Republic, the place
of one of Jackson's great victories.  Here we were
called upon next day to go out and drive off their
cavalry, which we did, inflicting considerable loss
upon them.</p>
          <p>Weir's Cave, September 28th.  -  Moved around a
good deal yesterday, but halted for the night near
where we started in the morning, except we were on
the north side of the Shenandoah.  Reported the
enemy are falling back to the Potomac.</p>
          <p>Waynesboro, September 29th.  -  Yesterday had a
most disagreeable march, not arriving in camp until
four o'clock this morning, travelling all night in the
rear of a wagon train to protect it from Yankee
cavalry, who were threatening on all sides.  Troops
beginning to recover from effects of last week's 
<pb id="grimes75" n="75"/> 
misfortunes; in tolerable  fighting trim, and anxious to
retrieve their lost reputation.</p>
          <p>Waynesboro, October 1st, 1864.  -  Yesterday was 
a day of rest very essential to our' comfort, for our
energies were about exhausted.  The enemy are 
reported to be falling back down the Valley, which I 
hope is so, unless we had an opportunity of 
thrashing him.</p>
          <p>Mount Sydney, October 2nd.  -  Nothing of interest.</p>
          <p>Mount Sydney, October 3rd.  -  The enemy slowly
retiring and we following him up, but Early will
profit by past experience and not risk too much.</p>
          <p>Mount Sydney, October 4th, 1864.  -  Another day
of rest and what was quite as much needed, a good
dinner.  The gentleman with whom we dined was
ransomed by his wife and daughters paying all their
jewelry and silver, and the house redeemed by payment of $40 in gold.  Enemy near Harrisburg few
miles from here.</p>
          <p>Mount Sydney, October 6th.  -  This is our fourth
day of rest, and have made use of it to recruit my
exhausted energies.  Have been drilling my men, for
I know the necessity of drilling and discipline to 
make good soldiers, as I am anxious that those
under my command should be.</p>
          <pb id="grimes76" n="76"/>
          <p>Harrisonburg, October 7th.  -  Again on the march 
following the enemy.</p>
          <p>Camp near New Market, October 9th.  -  It is
probable we will remain in our present position  -  for
some time.  Enemy been driven below Strasburg,  
and as they destroyed everything on their retreat,
we have not the wherewithal to subsist our army on.
Country a perfect desolation.  All stock and 
provisions destroyed.</p>
          <p>New Market, October 10th.  -  Ordered down the
turnpike to meet the enemy.  Having gone four
miles, were ordered to return to camp.</p>
          <p>New Market, October 11th.  -  Just received orders
to cook two days, rations and be ready to move at
sunrise in the morning.</p>
          <p>Near Woodstock, October 13th.  -  Are moving
towards Strasburg.  Enemy reported as lower down
the Valley.</p>
          <p>Near Strasburg, October 14th.  -  Yesterday afternoon 
attacked the enemy, gained quite a little
victory.</p>
          <p>Near Strasburg, Oct. 15th.  -  Stationary.  Nothing
of importance.</p>
          <p>Near Strasburg Oct. 6th.  -  Enemy quiet on other
side Cedar Creek.</p>
          <p>Near Strasburg, Oct. 17th.  -  Yesterday reported to
<pb id="grimes77" n="77"/>
Gen. Rosser (Cavalry General).  About dark mounted
my men behind his, took a by-path over the 
mountains, over the most rugged roads I ever travelled.
About 3 o'clock came up in rear of Yankee camp.
Dismounting my men, prepared to charge them.  We
had been informed a Cavalry Division were 
encamped at this place, but found only forty men,
every one of whom we captured with their horses.
Had a pleasant time.</p>
          <p>Near Strasburg, Oct. 18th.  -  Enemy remarkably
quiet.</p>
          <p>New Market, Oct. 20th.  -  Yesterday morning,
after marching all night, flanked the enemy in their
position, whipping them badly, and driving them
from their breastworks, capturing twenty-odd pieces
of artillery, driving them several miles.  Our left
wing shamefully gave way, which necessitated the
drawing in of our lines, which was done in considerable 
confusion.  At that time the Yankee Cavalry
charged and completely routed our men.  It was
impossible to check the flight, officers and men 
behaving shamefully.  Twice the Yankees got between
me and the route I had to travel, which rendered it
necessary for me to take the woods to avoid capture. 
About seven o'clock arrived at a place on Fisher's
Hill, where we halted to endeavor to gather up the
<pb id="grimes78" n="78"/>
stragglers and rearrange our troops.  After resting
a few hours, fell back to this place.  It was the 
hardest day's work I ever engaged in  -  trying to rally
the men.  Took our flags at different times, begging, 
commanding, entreating the men to rally  -  
would ride up and down the lines, beseeching them 
by all they held sacred and dear, to stop and fight
but without any success.  I don't mean my Brigade 
only, but <hi rend="italics">all</hi>. The demoralization was too great.
All my exertions were of no avail.  I was riding a
horse that I captured in our night attack upon the
cavalry which I mention in my letter of last Monday,
and had him killed by a shell early in the engagement, 
while on his back, the shell not missing my
leg two inches.  Afterwards found a horse on the
field, rode him the remainder of the day.  He also
was struck, but not much hurt.  Had a ball to strike
me on the leg, but so slightly that the blow was
scarcely perceptible, the ball having expended its
force.  General Ramseur was wounded mortally, and
fell into the hands of the enemy.  General Battle,
of Alabama, severely wounded.  The only salvation
for this army and the country will be to inflict severe
punishment on all who fail to discharge their duty.
There will be a general Court Martial this afternoon,
and all delinquents will be tried.</p>
          <pb id="grimes79" n="79"/>
          <p>Camp near New Market, Oct. 22d.  -  I am now in
command of Rodes' old Division  -  very busily 
engaged all my time in correcting abuses that have crept
into the department during the long and arduous
campaign  -  inspecting camp, attending drills, and
hope if we are allowed a few weeks to discipline these
troops, to have them as good and efficient as they
were in their best days.</p>
          <p>New Market, Oct. 23rd, 24th and 25th.  -  Still

CAPTAIN: </salute></opener>
          <p>In obedience to orders from Corps
Headquarters, I have the honor of submitting the
<pb id="grimes80" n="80"/>
following report as the part taken by Rodes' Division in the action on the 19th October, 1864:</p>
          <p>About dark on the evening of the 18th the 
Division moved from camps on Fisher's Hill and was
halted for an hour or more near the pike, in order
that Maj.-Gen. Gordon in command of the force,
who was to move to the enemy's rear, could communicate with Lieut.-Gen. Early.</p>
          <p>This halt was caused, as I unofficially learned, in
consequence of information received that the enemy
were fortifying that evening on their left flank.
About 8 P. M. the march was resumed and after
passing the stone bridge filed to the right and passed
by a circuitous route around the base of Fort Mountain, by a blind path, where the troops had to march
in single file.  The order of March was Gordon,
Rodes, Pegram.  Upon reaching the Shenandoah,
where crossed by the Manassas Gap Railroad, the
column was halted and massed for the rear to close
up.  So soon as this was done, about 1 A. M., we
again moved forward, following the track of the
railroad until near Bucktown Station, where we 
again halted for an hour and a half waiting the arrival 
of the cavalry, who crossed the river in advance
and drove in the enemy's pickets.</p>
          <p>About four and half A. M. the infantry 
<pb id="grimes81" n="81"/>
commenced crossing the Shenandoah near Col. 
Bowman's house in two columns.  The passage was
effected with great rapidity and in good order though
the rear necessarily had to doublequick for some distance to close up.  The order of march was as follows: 
Battle, Cook, Cox, Grimes.  On arriving within
a half a mile of the Valley Pike, Battle's Brigade
was formed parallel with the same, and moved 
forward in line of battle.  The other Brigades 
continued moving by the flank for about three hundred
yards, when they were faced to the left and ordered
forward changing direction to the right.  Battle soon 
struck the Eighth Corps of the enemy, and charging,
gallantly drove them in great confusion but was
himself seriously wounded whilst nobly leading his
Brigade, the command of which then devolved on
Lieut.-Col. Robeson, 5th Alabama.  Cook and Cox
continued to advance, swinging to the right, driving
the enemy in their front with but slight resistance
for upward of half a mile, when Gen. Cox reporting
that he was flanked on the left, a temporary halt
was made until reinforcements were sent forward,
when these two Brigades again advanced, Cook
capturing, several cannon, caissons, ammunition,
wagons, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>This movement left a wide interval between
<pb id="grimes82" n="82"/>
Cook's right and Battle's left, which was 
subsequently filled by Pegram's Division.  In the 
meantime Grimes' Brigade was recalled from the left and
moved by the right flank through the abandoned
camp of the Eighth Corps, which had been 
completely routed, faced to the front, and advanced to
the pike, connecting with Battle's right.  This
formation was perfected about sunrise. </p>
          <p>The enemy being then in position on a small
creek to the left of the Pike, with their artillery on
a high ridge in their rear, and firing into our line of
battle, but the smoke and fog obscured the troops
so that their fire was inaccurate.  Here Major-Gen.
Ramseur had skirmishers thrown to the front and
to the right driving the sharpshooters of the enemy
from Middletown.  The Division remained here 
perhaps half an hour, until a battery was brought into
position on the right of the Pike, when Gen. Ramseur 
again ordered an advance, which was made in
good order, and with a gallantry never exceeded.
In this advance Battle's Brigade charged a battery
in its front, capturing in addition to six guns many
prisoners and a flag.  The Sixth Corps was found
posted on a hill in rear of this battery, and made a
most stubborn resistance.  Grimes' Brigade was 
ordered forward and charged them most gallantly, but
<pb id="grimes83" n="83"/>
being greatly overlapped on both flanks was forced
to fall back and reform after advancing as far as the
cemetery.  At this time there was an interval of
three hundred yards between this and Battle's
Brigade.  Colonel Smith's Brigade of Wharton's
Division was now brought into action on Grimes 
right and charged the same wooded hill, but was
likewise repulsed, when Wofford's Brigade of 
Kershaw's Division, which had been ordered to report
to Major-Gen. Ramseur, arrived on the ground and
was posted behind a stone fence to the right of
Grimes, it not being thought advisable to move
against the strong position of the enemy.</p>
          <p>The artillery was at this time, about 8 A. M.,
massed on the hills near the Pike and the infantry
remained quiet until by a concentrated fire from the
artillery the Sixth Corps was dislodged from its 
position, where they had erected temporary 
breastworks of rails, stones, &amp;c.  Upon this hill the 
Division was reformed, cartridge boxes refilled and rested
upwards of an hour.  During this time skirmishers
were advanced and found that the enemy had again
made a stand at the edge of the woods, about three
fourths of a mile in advance.  We then moved 
forward and joined our left to Kershaw's right, halting
in the road leading from Middletown and at right
<pb id="grimes84" n="84"/>
angles to the Pike.  Here again we halted perhaps
for an hour, and then moved forward in echelon by
Brigade from the left, which was occupied by Cook
with Cox's Brigade in reserve, and took position 
behind a stone fence.  During this time the enemy
were firing from their artillery, engaging ours on the
hills in our rear.  Our skirmishers all the while were
engaged with those of the enemy and who had 
driven in our left, but they in turn were repulsed by
our line of battle.  In this position Grimes' Brigade
was about one hundred yards to the right and rear 
of Battle's with an interval of from two to three
hundred yards between his right and Pegram's left.
At half past three P. M, our skirmishers were driven
in and the enemy advanced their line of battle.
Grimes' Brigade was “doublequicked” upon the line
with Battle to meet this advance on the part of the 
enemy, and Cox moved up on a line with Cook and
to his left, which advance was repulsed most gallantly, the enemy fleeing in disorder and confusion,
throwing down their arms and battle flags in their
retreat.  The musketry on our left still continued
to increase and at the time our troops were cheering
for this repulse of the enemy, the line on our left
was seen to give back, and the troops to retreat 
without any organization.  Gen.- Ramseur then 
<pb id="grimes85" n="85"/>
ordered the different Brigades of this Division to fall
back and form on a stone fence about two hundred  
yards in rear, which was promptly done, and the 
advance of the enemy in our front prevented.  While  
holding this position, the gallant and chivalrous
Gen. Ramseur was mortally wounded and brought
from the field.  The troops on the left had by this 
time entirely given way, and were running to the
rear in great confusion.  The enemy were then in
front and to the left and rear of the left flank of
this Division, when they began to fall back in the
same disorderly manner as those on the left.</p>
          <p>Our organization up to this time was intact.
Upon the order being given to retire, did so, but the
stampede on left was caught up, and no threats or
entreaties could arrest their flight.  Great and 
repeated exertions were made by the officers of the
higher ranks to check the men, but all their 
exertions were unavailing.</p>
          <p>Upon reaching the south side of Cedar Creek, a
few, perhaps to the number of two hundred, from
Cook's and Grimes, Brigades, formed on the right
of the Pike near Hupp Hill, but when the stream of
stragglers came running over the hill, with the cry
that the cavalry were across the creek, and prepared
to charge, these few likewise scattered, and could
<pb id="grimes86" n="86"/>
not be kept together.  Up to the hour of 4 P. M.,
the troops of this Division, both officers and men,
with a few exceptions, behaved most admirably, and
were kept well in hand, but little plundering, and
only a few shirking their duty.  After that hour, all
was confusion and disorder.  The Brigade 
commanders conducted themselves, each and all, with
great coolness and judgment, and are deserving of
especial mention, using all possible efforts to check
their troops, but without success.</p>
          <p>The death of the brave and heroic soldier, General Ramseur, is not only a loss to this Division, but 
to his State and the country at large.  No truer or
nobler spirit has been sacrificed in this unjust and
unholy war.</p>
          <p>The conduct of the officers composing the staff
of this Division cannot be too highly lauded for
their gallantry and efficiency: Major Peyton for the 
coolness and promptness with which he conveyed
orders on the field; Major Hutchinson for his 
efficiency, who was captured, escaped from the enemy,
and again captured late in the :evening; Captain
Randolph displayed his usual daring; Major 
Whiting, Inspector, rendered signal services by preventing 
all straggling and plundering; and Lieut. Richmond,
<pb id="grimes87" n="87"/>
A. D. C., for his assistance and alacrity in
transmitting orders.</p>
          <p>For the conduct of others who deserve especial
mention, you are respectfully referred to reports of
Brigade commanders herewith transmitted.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>Near New Market, November 1st, 1864.  -  The
duties of camp are suspended to-day for the purpose
of commemorating our respect and attachment for
our two late commanders, Rodes and Ramseur.  I
could not participate in the meeting, owing to a 
summons from General Early to meet all Division 
Commanders, which detained me six hours.</p>
          <p>Camp near New Market, November 2d to 4th.  -  
I am still here.  It has rained incessantly for two
days.  Am busy re-organizing Rodes' Division, which
I still command.</p>
          <p>New Market, November 5th.  -  No news from the
enemy.  They are still near Strasburg.  Our movements
<pb id="grimes88" n="88"/> 
depend on theirs.  If they reinforce Grant,
we will demonstrate in order to draw them back.</p>
          <p>Headquarters Rodes' Division, November 6th.  -  
Yesterday moved camp to present position where
we have abundance of wood and water.  The mountains are covered with snow this morning  -  very hard
on barefooted and half naked men.</p>
          <p>November 7th.  -  Weather continues bad.</p>
          <p>November 8th and 9th.  -  Still at New Market. 
Yesterday at Early's Headquarters learned the enemy
had 36,000 effective men for the field.  More than
three times our number.  At recent fights they must
save had at least five to one.  If not for their 
cavalry, we could soon drive their infantry out of the
Valley.  When the history of the war is written, and
the disparity of the forces engaged is considered, we
will come out with honor; and if justice is done, it 
will be shown that we have done our duty.</p>
          <p>Learned that after election in the United States,
that their troops would be moved to some other
quarter.  They are still fortifying Winchester.</p>
          <p>Camp near New Market, November 10th.  -  We
leave here to-day to demonstrate against the enemy,
to cause to return with their troops to prevent 
reinforcement of Grant.  If we accomplish that, it will
be all that can be expected of us.</p>
          <pb id="grimes89" n="89"/>
          <p>November 12th.  -  Have again advanced, and are
between Middletown and Winchester.  Enemy falling 
back  -  don't seem disposed to fight.</p>
          <p>November 13th.  -  We found the enemy, and
General Early having accomplished his purpose, 
retired last night, and are on our way to our old camp.</p>
          <p>November 14th.  -  Have just reached our old camp
Too tired to write.  In five days have been eating
both meals at night  -  one before day in the morning,
the other after dark.</p>
          <p>November 15th to 19th.  -  Still at New Market.
Weather bitterly cold.</p>
          <p>November 20th to 22d.  -  Weather still continues
bad, but with a good chimney to my tent keep 
tolerably comfortable.  General Early does not speak
of going into winter quarters.</p>
          <p>Headquarters Rodes' Division, near New Market,
November 23d.  -  Yesterday morning just before day
Gen. Early sent me word that the enemy were 
advancing and to take my command out to meet them.
The ground was covered with snow but in half an
hour we were under arms and on the way to meet
them.  After going about seven miles down the
turnpike to Rudes' Hill found that our cavalry had
been driven through Mount Jackson and the enemy
had crossed the north fork of the Shenandoah and
<pb id="grimes90" n="90"/> 
were advancing rapidly.  I rode forward, reconnoitered, put my men in position and attacked them. 
There were about 4000 of them, all cavalry.  When
we struck them they made a bold stand and 
attempted to charge, but we pressed the shot into
them so steadily and rapidly that they could not
stand it and began to retreat in disorder, which I
pressed all the harder, and drove them five miles,
routing them every time they attempted to make a
stand.  My men were pretty well used up with
fatigue when I discontinued the pursuit and returned 
to camp cold, hungry, and broken down after
my men had marched and waded twenty-four miles.</p>
          <p>Headquarters Rodes, Division, November 24th
and 28th.  -  We are here with the thermometer down
to about 20 deg.  and the coldest nights imaginable.
Hope we will go into winter quarters soon.</p>
          <p>Headquarters Rodes, Division.  -  Yesterday had
a long ride and returned after dark, but feel that I
will here accomplish a good thing if the Yankee
cavalry venture another reconnoissance to find out
where we are.  Our object is to get in their rear and
cut off all   <del hand="bg"/>  and as there will be but
one ford to the river by which they can rejoin their
command, and all arrangements are made to get
possession of that ford by taking a circuitous route
<pb id="grimes91" n="91"/>
with our Division while the others demonstrate in
front.  But if they don't advance in ten days, we
will miss an opportunity to inflict a severe blow upon
their cavalry.  Provisions and forage are very scarce.
Some of our troops have had <sic>unground</sic> corn issued
to them.</p>
          <p>Headquarters Rodes' Division, November 30th.  -  
Everything quiet with only a rumor that Gen.
Rosser had whipped the enemy at Moorefield.
When he returns, it is thought we will go into winter quarters.</p>
          <p>Headquarters Rodes' Division, December 2d.  -  
Gen. Rosser's success was quite brilliant, destroying
two bridges, two hundred wagons, nine locomotive
engines, besides immense amount of quartermaster's
and commissary stores, and capturing nine pieces of
artillery, 500 prisoners, 1000 horses and mules, and
several hundred beef cattle.  This is the expedition
wrote you about in former letter.</p>
          <p>Headquarters Rodes' Division, near New Market,
December 2d.  -  I think it probable that we will reach
the point at which we are to winter about the 10th
of this month.</p>
          <p>December 4th.  -  Still at New Market.</p>
          <p>December 6th.  -  We are again disappointed in
receiving no orders to prepare for winter quarters.  
<pb id="grimes92" n="92"/>
All manner of conjectures are rife.  I think Gen.
Early is actuated simply and solely by what he 
considers the good of the service, and is awaiting 
definite information as to the intention of the enemy,
and contrary as it would be to my wishes, if we
could accomplish any commensurate good, would be
willing again to go down the Valley and attack
Sheridan, and if necessary stay there, although it
would interfere with my long cherished desire to
spend a quiet winter, but in my present position the
public interest is to be considered before private
preference, and the higher a man rises in the 
military service the fewer privileges can he enjoy, for
he cannot ask indulgence when he feels the good of
the country will be jeopardized, and as I am now
commanding a Division, will have to remain here 
until some one else comes to fill the place.</p>
          <p>Near New Market, December 8th.  -  Two of our
Divisions, Gordon's and Pegram's, left yesterday.  I
presume some important move is on hand.  The
enemy have sent one of their Corps from our front.</p>
          <p>Headquarters Rodes' Division, December 10th.  -  
This morning the whole surface of the earth is 
covered with snow two inches deep.</p>
          <p>Near New Market, December 13th.  -  Have 
<pb id="grimes93" n="93"/>
orders to proceed to Richmond to-morrow morning  -  
expect to reach there Friday or Saturday.</p>
          <p>Richmond, December 16th.  -  Arrived here early
this morning, and am awaiting orders from Gen.
Lee.</p>
          <p>Headquarters Rodes, Division, near Petersburg,
Dec. 18th.  -  We have arrived at our destination,
and are located about three miles from Petersburg,
and hope to-day to be able to make arrangements
for the winter.</p>

General Lee stating that a Brigade from your 
Division has been ordered, to relieve our right Brigade
(Tovey's) early in the morning, so as to enable it to

The General desires me to say to you that great
caution would have to be observed to prevent the
movement of the troops from being seen from “the
Tower”, that it will probably be best to delay 
relieving the picket until after dark to-morrow night.  
He advises that you send as large a Brigade as 
possible, as General Tovey's line at present covers a
great deal of ground.  He suggests also that the
officer who relieves this Brigade had better see 
Colonel Florivree, who is in command at this time, as
early, as possible in the morning, to make such 
arrangements as will most effectually secure the movements of the men from being observed by the enemy.</p>

          <p>February 15th.  -  Remained in-camp near 
Petersburg until about the middle of the month.  Request
from Gen. Gordon to have Grimes' Division report
to him in case of battle.  Received my commission
as Major-General 15th February, 1865.</p>
          <pb id="grimes99" n="99"/>
          <p>Sutherland Depot, February 24th, 12 miles from 
Petersburg.  -  Left camp and came here as there 
was a prospect of a fight, but the heavy rains have
delayed it.</p>
          <p>February 28th.  -  Still at Sutherland's Depot.  In
accepting the appointment of Major-General, I hope I
shall never bring discredit upon myself.  The
higher the position the more there is expected, and 
like all others who have done their duty in this war,
have made enemies, but care little for them, 
provided I can perform my duties satisfactorily to my
superior officers and for the good of the country.</p>
          <p>Sutherland's Depot, March 1st.  -  Have been
riding all day in order to learn the different roads in
the surrounding country, and laying off new ones to
enable me to move with rapidity to any point when
my services may be required.</p>
          <p>Sutherland's, March 2d.  -  Nothing of interest. 
Still stuck in the mud.</p>
          <p>March 3d and 5th.  -  Roads still in such bad 
condition that they are almost impassable.</p>
          <p>March 7th and 8th.  -  Still at Sutherland's.  Had
a serenade last night  -  the only thing to break the
monotony.  Weather still continues bad.</p>
          <p>March 8th.  -  Still quiet.</p>
          <p>March 10th.  -  This is the day set apart by the
<pb id="grimes100" n="100"/>
President for thanksgiving and prayer, but the
weather is so bad no service can be held out of
doors.</p>
          <p>March 12th.  -  Am worn out from fatigue and
want of sleep.  Received orders at 2 A. M. to leave
for Dunlap's before daylight.  At 4 A. M. began the
march and upon nearly reaching the pontoon, 
received another dispatch countermanding the order.  
There was a rumor that Sheridan's raiders were
moving on Richmond, and that caused the move.</p>
          <p>Petersburg, March, 14th, 1865.  -  Yesterday 
received orders to come to Petersburg and relieve
Bushrod Johnson's Division, which I did, completing
my march about 12 o'clock last night.  Suffered 
terribly from sick nervous headache, attributed to a
glass of wine I took at General Lee's, who noticed
that I looked pale and fatigued, and recommended
a glass of wine, and as this was something very 
unusual with him, concluded I would take it, and 
suffered in consequence.</p>
          <p>This morning was up early examining everything
on my line.  Went to each picket post, and at some
points so close you could almost see the whites of
the Yankees' eyes.  The Yankee lines are in full
view, and at night there is constant firing between
the pickets.</p>
          <pb id="grimes101" n="101"/>
          <p>March 16th, 17th, 22d, 25th, Petersburg.  -  
Telegraphed this morning of my welfare.   This morning
we charged the enemy's works and captured them,
taking twelve to fifteen pieces of artillery, and a
good many prisoners, but after taking their works
they concentrated a large number of cannon upon
us, besides several times our number of infantry and
we were obliged to succumb after fighting two and
a half hours, and retire to our breastworks.  My
loss was heavy, being 478 officers and men.  Lieut.
Barnes wounded.  As usual I captured a horse to
ride during the fight, as I could not get mine over
the breastworks.  It would have done your heart
good to hear the men cheer as I rode up and down 
the line urging them to do their duty, but would to
heaven this carnage was over and I permitted to 
retire from such scenes and live a quiet and domestic
life.</p>
          <p>Petersburg, March 27th.  -  Am well, trust you
did not hear the report of my being killed.  When
Gen. Gordon saw me, he seemed very much 
surprised.  Said he had just sent a flag of truce to 
recover my body, but I was pleased to know I had 
brought myself off safe.</p>
          <p>March 28th.  -  Still at Petersburg.</p>
          <p>March 29th, Petersburg.  -  Lieut. Barnes is doing
<pb id="grimes102" n="102"/>remarkably well.  Gen. Cook had his arm badly
broken and fears are entertained that it will have to
be amputated.</p>
          <p>March <del hand="bg"/>.  Our troops were to attack the enemy
this morning at Burgen's Mills, and I trust that they
may whip them.  For once I am out of it, and not
among the attacking party.</p>

<salute>MAJOR JNO. W. MOORE,</salute></opener>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Dear Sir:</hi> In compliance with your request, I
herewith transmit my recollections of the 
circumstances attending the last days of the existence of
the Army of Northern Virginia, embracing several
days previous to the final surrender at Appomattox
Court House.</p>
          <p>On the night of Saturday, April 1, 1865, my 
Division occupied a portion of the defences around
the city of Petersburg, my left resting on Otey's
Battery, near the memorable Crater, my right 
extending to the dam on a creek beyond Battery 45,
Ramseur's old Brigade of North Carolinians being
commanded by Col. W. R. Cox, 2nd North Carolina,
holding appointment as temporary Brigadier; on their
right Archer's Brigade of Virginia Junior Reserves,
Grimes' old Brigade of North Carolinians, 
commanded by Col. D. G. Cowand, of the 32d North 
Carolina, Battle's Brigade of Alabamians, commanded by
Col. Hobson of 5th Alabama, Cook's Brigade of
Georgians commanded by Col. Nash, extending to
the left in the order above named, numbering for
duty about 2,200 muskets, covering at least three and
a half miles of the trenches around Petersburg, with
one third of my men constantly on picket duty in
<pb id="grimes108" n="108"/> 
our front, one third kept awake at the breastworks
during the night, with one third only off duty at a
time, and they required always to sleep with their
accoutrements on and upon their arms, ready to repel an attack at a moment's warning.</p>
          <p>About 10 o'clock on the night of April 1, 1865,
the cannonading from the artillery and mortars in
my front became unusually severe, and at about 11 
o'clock the Federals charged, capturing my picket
line, which consisted of pits dug in the earth for
protection from sharp shooters, and occupied by my
soldiers varying in distance from 150 to 300 yards in
front of our main breastworks.  I took measures
immediately to re-establish this line, which was 
successfully accomplished, and our pits re-occupied. 
About daylight of the 2nd the enemy again drove
in our pickets and charged Rune's salient at the
point where Battle's Brigade was posted, carrying
the works for a few hundred yards on each side of
that point, doubling and throwing Cook's Brigade
back a short distance.  I hurried the commands of
Cols. Cowand and Archer to the point of attack as
rapidly as possible, charging the enemy who were  
in possession of and protected by our traverses and
bomb <sic>proops</sic> (which were erected to prevent our
line being enfiladed, arid also as a place of refuge 
<pb id="grimes109" n="109"/>
from their perpendicular mortar fire), and continued
gradually to regain traverse after traverse of our
captured works. </p>
          <p>I then secured four pieces of artillery which were
placed in our second line of works, whose services
were invaluable in checking the advance of the
enemy, thus confining them by grape and canister 
to this particular point at the salient, preventing
their advancing to attack our lines in flank or rear;
Cook and Battle holding them in check on the left, 
and Cowand and Archer on the right of the captured works, their only point of egress being exposed 
to the fire of the artillery.</p>
          <p>I regret my inability to recall the names and
thus give honorable mention to those gallant 
artillerists who rendered me such effective service.</p>
          <p>During the forenoon <del hand="bg"/> Brigade, under 
command of Col. <del hand="bg"/>, reported to me for duty and
were placed near the artillery in this second line
of earthworks (which had been constructed to
fall back upon in case of disaster) to our first line. 
My dispositions were soon made to attack the
enemy simultaneously at all points  -  Cowand
and Archer on the right, Cook and Battle on
the left, who were to drive them from the 
protection of their traverses.  Col. <del hand="bg"/> commanded
<pb id="grimes110" n="110"/>
in front with a heavy line of skirmishers connecting  
his left with Cook and his right with Cowand.  My
four pieces of artillery poured grape and canister
into the enemy, and I gave the signal for the 
infantry advance, when a general charge was made,
but through a direct violation of orders on the part
of Col. <del hand="bg"/>, this attack only partially succeeded,
capturing that portion of the line alone upon which
the skirmishers advanced, Col. <del hand="bg"/> having changed
the direction of attack, and charged the point 
assigned to the skirmishers on the right, thereby 
leaving a space of three hundred yards unassailed.
There is no doubt in my mind if Col. <del hand="bg"/> had 
attacked with vigor at that time, we could have driven
the enemy entirely from our works.  After the lapse
of an hour, during which time the enemy were
heavily reinforced, I ordered another attack from
the second line in which Col.<del hand="bg"/> participated, but 
by again diverting his Brigade in the direction of
Cowand's Brigade, instead of towards the salient,
the enemy were dislodged from only a small portion
of the lines.</p>
          <p>Subsequently sixty men of Johnston's North
Carolina Brigade, under command of Capt. Plato
Durham, recaptured Fort Mahone, which for an
hour had been so covered by our fire as to forbid
<pb id="grimes111" n="111"/>
their showing themselves.  In taking this fort a
large number of prisoners were captured; so many
in fact, that when I first saw them skulking behind 
the earthworks for protection against the fire of 
their own men, I feared it was a ruse on the part of
the enemy to surprise us, they having secreted
themselves for safety in this work, and we in our
charge had taken the only outlet.</p>
          <p>After this no general attack was made, though
we continued slowly but gradually to drive them
from traverse to traverse.</p>
          <p>About nightfall the enemy occupied some two
hundred yards of our breastworks  -  through no
 inefficiency or negligence on the part of the officers
and men were the works carried, but owing to the
weakness of the line, its extreme length, and the
want of sufficient force to defend it, for they acted
most heroically on this trying occasion.  Only one
unwounded man (an officer) did I see seeking the
rear, and he one whom I had the previous day 
ordered under arrest for trafficking with the enemy (ex
changing tobacco for coffee).  Him I hailed and 
inquired where he was going, when he recalled his 
arrest the previous day, from which I immediately
released him and sent him back to his command.</p>
          <p>I had a verbal conference with Gen. Lee and
<pb id="grimes112" n="112"/> 
afterwards officially reported my inability to hold
this point against any vigorous attack.  In 
consequence of this report, Lieut.-Col. Peyton, the Army 
Inspector was sent the day before to examine this
line, who coincided with my views and so reported,
to Gen. Lee.  On an average throughout the space
from man to man was at least eight feet in the line
of trenches.  I doubted not that with a reserve of
five hundred men I could have driven the enemy,  
from any point which they might capture, and 
repeatedly urged that such an arrangement be made,
knowing well that the enemy by concentrating a
large force on any given point could press their way
through the line, and my only salvation was in
having the means at hand of driving them back 
before large numbers could enter.  Our left was the
post of greatest danger, there should the reserve
have been placed; but Gen. Lee informed me that 
every available man was on duty, and I must do the
best I could.</p>
          <p>On Sunday night of the 2nd we had orders to
abandon the works, and without the knowledge of
the Federals we withdrew to the north side of the
Appomattox river, following the Hickory road to 
Goode's bridge, where we recrossed the Appomattox, 
proceeding towards Amelia C. H., which we reached 
<pb id="grimes113" n="113"/>
on the morning of the fifth.  Wednesday we 
remained stationary in line of battle, confronting the 
enemy until about dark, when we followed the
army, bringing up the rear, being very much 
impeded on the march by the wagon train and its most
miserable mismanagement, which, as I apprehended,
would cause us some disaster.  The enemy showed
themselves on Thursday about 8 o'clock A. M. in
our rear and on our left flank when near Amelia 
Springs, and in a short time began to press us
vigorously.</p>
          <p>I then formed Cox's and Cowand's Brigades in
line of battle, with a heavy skirmish line in front to
impede their progress and to cover our rear, sending
Battle's, Cook's and Archer's Brigades forward for
one half mile to form there, across the road, in line
of battle, in order to allow Cowand and Cox to 
retreat safely when the enemy had deployed and 
prepared to attack; our right flank being protected by
a North Carolina Brigade of cavalry under General
Roberts.  In this manner alternating the Brigades
throughout the day we continued to oppose the
enemy and retreat, endeavoring to protect the 
lagging wagon train, which was successfully done up to
about 4 o'clock P. M., when we approached Sailor's
Creek, and upon the ridge running parallel with that
<pb id="grimes114" n="114"/> 
stream we made the final stand of the day, the
wagons becoming blocked up at the bridge crossing
this stream.  At this point Gen. Lee ordered me if
possible to hold this line of hills until he could have
artillery put in position on the opposite hills over
the creek parallel with those I occupied.</p>
          <p>The enemy pushed on rapidly, attacking us with
very great pertinacity.  We here repeatedly repulsed
their assaults, but by turning both of our flanks they
succeeded in not only dislodging but driving us
across the creek in confusion.  About now the 
artillery from the heights, occupied by Gen. Lee,
opened upon the enemy, and the sun being down
they did not cross the creek.  After we broke,
personally I was so pressed that the space between
the two wings of the enemy was not over two 
hundred yards when I sought safety in retreat.  I 
galloped to the creek (the bridge being in their 
possession) where the banks were very precipitous, and
for protection from their murderous fire concluded
to jump my horse in, riding him through the water
and effect my escape by abandoning him on the
other side, the bullets of the enemy whistling around
me like hail all the while.  By great good fortune
the opposite banks proving not so precipitous and
my horse seeming to appreciate the situation, clambered
<pb id="grimes115" n="115"/>
 up the height, starting off in a run, thus securing 
my safety.  This same animal, Warren, I still
own and treasure for his past services.  That night 
we took the road for Farmville, crossing the 
Appomattox at High Bridge, posting guards at the 
south side, thus collecting all stragglers and returning
them to their commands.</p>
          <p>The next morning (Friday) we continued our
march down the railroad and formed line of battle
on the Lynchburg road, still endeavoring to preserve
that “impediment of Caesar's”  -  the wagon train  -  
marching by the left flank through the woods 
parallel to the road traveled by the wagon train, and
about one hundred or so yards distant from the
road.  Upon reaching the road and point that turns
towards Lynchburg from the Cumberland road,
three of my Brigades, Cook's, Cox's and Cowand's,
had crossed the Cumberland road and were in line
of battle, and at right angles with Battle's and
Archer's Brigades, who were still parallel with the
Cumberland road.  Heavy firing was going on at:
this point, when Gen. Mahone came rushing up
and reported that the enemy had charged, turning
his flank, and driving his men, from their guns and
the works which he had erected early in the day for
the protection of these cross roads.  I then ordered   
<pb id="grimes116" n="116"/> 
my three Brigades, Cook's, Cox's and Cowand's at a
doublequick on the line, with Battle and Archer,
charging the enemy and driving them well off from
Mahone's works, recapturing the artillery taken by
them and capturing a large number of prisoners and 
holding this position until sent for by Gen. Lee,
who complimented the troops of the Division upon
the charge made and the service rendered, ordering
me to leave a skirmish line in my front and that
Fields' Division would occupy my position, I to
hurry with all possible dispatch to the road which
intersected the Lynchburg road, as the enemy's cavalry 
were reported to be approaching by that road.</p>
          <p>We reached this road, halting and keeping the
enemy in check until the wagons had passed, and
then continued the march parallel with the road
travelled by the wagon train, continuing thus to
march until night, when we took the road following
to protect the trains.</p>
          <p>On Saturday the 8th no enemy appeared, and
we marched undisturbed all day.  Up to this time
since the evacuation of Petersburg we had marched
day and night, continually followed and <sic>harrassed</sic>
by the enemy.  The men were very much jaded and
suffering for necessary sustenance, our halts not
having been sufficiently long to prepare their food,
<pb id="grimes117" n="117"/>
besides all of our cooking utensils not captured or
abandoned were where we could not reach them.
This day Bushrod Johnson's Division was assigned
to and placed under my command by order of Gen.
Lee.  Upon passing a clear stream of water and
learning that the other Division of the Corps had
gone into camp some two or three miles ahead, I
concluded to halt and give my broken down men an
opportunity to close up and rejoin us, and sent a
message to Gen. Gordon, commanding the Corps,
making known my whereabouts, informing him I
would be at any point he might designate at any
hour desired.</p>
          <p>By dark my men were all quiet and asleep.  About
nine o'clock I heard the roar of artillery in our front
and in consequence of information received I had
my command aroused in time and passed through
the town of Appomattox C. H. before daylight,
where, upon the opposite side of the town, I found
the enemy in my front.  Throwing out my skirmishers 
and forming line of battle, I reconnoitered and
satisfied myself as to their position, and awaited the
arrival of Gen. Gordon for instructions, who awhile
before day, accompanied by Gen. Fitz.  Lee, came
to my position when we held a council of war.  
Gen. Gordon was of the opinion that the troops in
<pb id="grimes118" n="118"/>
our front were cavalry and Gen. Fitz Lee should 
attack.  Fitz Lee thought they were infantry and that 
Gordon should attack.  They discussed the matter
so long that I became impatient, and said it was
some one's duty to attack, and that immediately,
and I felt satisfied that they could be driven from
cross roads occupied by them, which was the route
it was desirable our wagon train should pursue, and
that I would undertake it; whereupon Gordon said,
“Well, drive them off.” I replied, “I cannot do it
with my Division alone, but require assistance.  He
then said, “You can take the other two Divisions of
the Corps.”  About this time it was becoming 
sufficiently light to make the surrounding localities 
visible.  I then rode down and invited Gen. Walker,
who commanded a Division on my left composed
principally of Virginians, to ride with me, showing
him the position of the enemy and explaining to
him my views and plan of attack.  He agreed with
me as to its advisability. I did this because I felt I
had assumed a very great responsibility when I
took upon myself the charge of making the attack.
I then made dispositions to dislodge the Federals
from their position, placing Bushrod Johnson's
Division upon my right, with instructions to attack
and take the enemy in flank, while my Division
<pb id="grimes119" n="119"/>
skirmishers charged in front where temporary 
earthworks had been thrown up bathe enemy their cavalry holding the crossings of the road with a 
battery.  I soon perceived a disposition on their part
to attack this Division in flank.  I rode back and
threw their right so as to take advantage of some
ditches and fences to obstruct the cavalry if they
should attempt to make a charge.  In the 
meantime the cavalry of Fitz Lee were proceeding by a
circuitous route to get in rear of them at these cross
roads.  The enemy observing me placing these
troops in position fired upon me with four pieces of
artillery.  I remember well the appearance of the
shell, and how directly they came towards me, 
exploding, and completely enveloping me in smoke.  I
then gave the signal to advance, at the same time
Fitz Lee charged those posted at the cross roads,
when my skirmishers attacked the breastworks
which were taken without much loss on my part,
also capturing several pieces of artillery and a large
number of prisoners, I at the same time moving the
Division up to the support of the skirmishers in
echelon by Brigades, driving the enemy in confusion
for three quarters of a mile beyond a range of hills
covered with oak undergrowth.  I then learned from
prisoners that my right flank was threatened.  Halting
<pb id="grimes120" n="120"/> 
my troops I placed the skirmishers, commanded
by Col. J. R. Winston, 45th N. C. Troops, in front
about one hundred yards distant, to give notice of
indication of attack.  Placed Cox's Brigade, which 
occupied the right of the Division at right angles to 
the other troops to watch that flank.  The other
Divisions of the Corps (Walker and Evans) were on
the left.  I then sent an officer to Gen. Gordon 
announcing our success and that the Lynchburg road
was open for the escape of the wagons, and that I
awaited orders.  Thereupon I received an order to
withdraw, which I declined to do, supposing that
Gen. Gordon did not understand the commanding
position which my troops occupied.  He continued
to send me order after order to the same effect
which I still disregarded, being under the impression 
that he did not comprehend our favorable 
location, until finally I received a message from him
with an additional one as coming from Gen. Lee to
fall back.   I felt the difficulty of withdrawal without  
disaster, and ordered Coil J. R. Winston, commanding 
the skirmish line which had been posted in my
front on reaching first these hills, to conform his 
movements to those of the Division, and to move by the
left flank so as to give, us notice of an attack from
that quarter.  I then ordered Cox to maintain his
<pb id="grimes121" n="121"/>
position in line of battle, and not to show himself
until our rear was 100 yards distant, and then to fall
back in line of battle, so as to protect our rear and
right flank from assault.  I then instructed Major
Peyton, of my staff, to start the left in motion, and
I continued with the rear.</p>
          <p>The enemy, upon seeing us move off, rushed out
from under cover with a cheer, when Cox's Brigade
lying concealed at the brow of a hill, rose and fired
a volley into them, which drove them back into the
woods, the Brigade then following their retreating
comrades in line of battle unmolested.  After 
proceeding about half the distance to the position 
occupied by us in the morning,  a dense mass of the
enemy in column (Infantry) appeared on our right,
and advanced without firing towards the earthworks
captured by us in the early morning, when a Battery 
of our artillery opened with grape and cannister, and
drove them under the shelter of the woods.</p>
          <p>As my troops approached their position of the
morning, I rode up to General Gordon and asked
where I should form line of battle.  He replied,
“Anywhere you choose.”  Struck by the strangeness 
of the reply, I asked an explanation, whereupon
he informed me that we would be surrendered.  I 
expressed very forcibly my dissent to being surrendered,
<pb id="grimes122" n="122"/>
and indignantly upbraided him for not giving me
notice of such intention, as I could have escaped
with my Division and joined Gen. Joe Johnston,
then in North Carolina.  Furthermore, that I should
then inform my men of the purpose to surrender,
and that whomsoever desired to escape that calamity
could go with me, and galloped off to carry this idea
into effect.  Before reaching my troops, however,
General Gordon overtook me, and placing his hand
on my shoulder, asked me if I were going to desert
the army, and tarnish my own honor as a soldier;
that it would be a reflection upon General Lee, and
an indelible disgrace to me, that I, an officer of rank,
should escape under a flag of truce, which was then
pending.  I was in a dilemma, and knew not what
to do, but finally concluded to say nothing on the
subject to my troops.</p>
          <p>Upon reaching them, one of the soldiers inquired
if General Lee had surrendered, and upon answering
I feared it was a fact that we had been surrendered,
he cast away his musket, and holding his hands aloft,
cried in an agonized voice, “Blow, Gabriel, blow!
My God, let him blow, I am ready to die!”  We
then went beyond the creek at Appomattox Court
House, stacked arms amid the bitter tears of bronzed
veterans regretting the necessity of capitulation.</p>
          <pb id="grimes123" n="123"/>
          <p>Among the incidents, ever fresh in my memory, of
this fatal day to the Confederacy, is the remark of a
private soldier.  When riding up to my old regiment
to shake by the hand each comrade who had
 followed me through four years of suffering, toil, and
privation often worse than death, to bid them a final
affectionate, and, in many instances, an eternal 
farewell, a cadaverous, ragged, barefooted man, grasped
me by the hand, and choking with sobs, said:
“Good-bye, General; God bless you, we will go
home; make three more crops, and try them again.” 
I mention this instance simply to show the spirit,
the pluck, and the faith of our men in the justice of
our cause, and that he surrendered more to grim
famine than to the prowess of our enemies.</p>
          <p>That day, and the next, the terms of surrender
were adjusted: the following day our paroles signed
and countersigned; and on Wednesday, April 12th,
1865, we stacked arms in an old field, and each man
sought his home as best he might.</p>
          <p>I have given in the above a simple, true; and unvarnished statement of facts, occurring during the
dying struggles of the Army of Northern Virginia, in
so far, only as I was an eye-witness and participant
in those events; with no view to laud my own
achievements, or seeming to seek an undeserved
<pb id="grimes124" n="124"/>
honor, or to take the least sprig of laurel from 
another's brow, but simply in the interest of the truth
of history.</p>
          <p>I assert that I was at Appomattox, and that I
commanded my own Division at Appomattox; and
General Gordon, the Corps commander, bears me
out in this assertion, and, moreover, states that I
volunteered my services, and did make the last
charge made by the Infantry at Appomattox.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>Accept my sincere thanks for your book, and
although as you say local in its character, have 
derived great pleasure from perusal.  The mention of
Gen. Colquitt's name recalled some associations with
it.  One was that upon reaching Yorktown, April
9th, (1862,) we relieved the sixth Georgia Regiment
and established ourselves in Col. Colquitt's “hole in
the ground” with a tent over it, and in a few days
found one of the attendants of close quarters, and
my person covered before we ever dreamed of such
pests.  Another reminiscence is having a Bible (in
my library now) picked up on the night of our 
retreat from Yorktown, I having been detailed to bring
off the pickets.  I enclose you autographs of
Generals Ramseur and Daniel, with his approval upon
application for leave of absence while near Orange
Court House; also a paper addressed to Col. Taylor,
I suppose upon which I made this application.  I
have fragments and skeletons of reports made of
different engagements  -  Gettysburg, last few days of
the war, from breaking of our lines at Petersburg to
the morning of surrender at Appomattox Court
House, and some others.  The last infantry charge
by the Army of Northern Virginia was made by my
<pb id="grimes126" n="126"/> 
Division, as General Gordon, our Corps commander,
will substantiate.  The form of parole for General
Johnston's troops was taken from my papers, 
borrowed by Col. Wherry, Gen. Schofield's Adjutant
General or Aid-de-Camp, to guide Schofield in 
adjusting this matter.  By-the-by, Generals Sherman,
Schofield, Terry, Bevis, <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">et id omne genus</hi></foreign>, had a 
champagne drinking In Raleigh just after Johnston's 
surrender, and sent this same Col. Wherry over, to 
invite me to join them, which I most indignantly 
declined.  That evening we heard of Lincoln's 
assassination.  Reminiscences of the past crowd upon me, 
and however pleasant, or rather unpleasant, may not
prove agreeable to you, and if I do not halt will 
exhaust my paper before I have given you information 
asked for.  You can procure all information relative
to General Ramseur from Capt. Richmond, (Aid-
de-Camp to Gen. R.,) Milton, N. C.  I wrote to Mr.
Richmond a few weeks ago, and received no reply.
If  you do not hear from him, then address Hon. D.
Schenck, Lincolnton, N. C., who married Gen. R.'s
sister.  Ramseur married his first cousin (Richmond's . 
sister.  Hon. E. Conigland, Halifax, N. C., will
cheerfully give you all information relative to his
brother-in-law, General Daniel.  William E.  Anderson, 
President Citizens National Bank, Raleigh, can
<pb id="grimes127" n="127"/>
tell you everything about his brother, Gen. G. B.
Anderson.  You ask nothing of my dear friends
and relatives, J. J. Pettigrew and L. O'B. Branch,
the first killed at Falling Waters upon the retreat
from Pennsylvania, the latter killed at Sharpsburg.
You perhaps regard Pettigrew as a South Carolinian.  
We claim him.  He is a native, and was
educated in the State, was Colonel of a North Carolina 
Regiment, and commanded a North Carolina
Brigade at time of his death.  Rev. W. S. 
Pettigrew, Henderson, N. C., will give you all particulars
relative to him, and Mrs. L. O'B. Branch, Raleigh,
or son W. A. B. Branch, Washington, N. C., will
take pleasure in communicating all facts relative to
Gen. Branch.  There is Gen. Pender whose widow 
and brother live in Tarboro, N. C.  Pender I knew
but slightly, only after the war commenced, the
others were life-long acquaintances and friends from 
childhood.  I think it probable I shall revisit New
York on the 4th or 5th of May and stop at the St.
Nicholas.  I can, if of service to you, send you a

          <p>MY DEAR GENERAL: Yours asking my recollection 
of the participation of your Division in the last
day's battle at Appomattox C. H. would have been
answered before I left my home in Georgia, but for
circumstances beyond my control.  It is a source of
pleasure to me not only to do this but also to 
express my sincere appreciation of your valuable 
services during that portion of the war when it was
my fortune to command the 2nd Corps Army Northern
Virginia, to which your Division was attached.
When I was first placed in command of the Corps
in the Fall of 1864 at or near Petersburg, you will
remember that you were detached from the other
Divisions and did not join them until a short time
before the attack upon Gen. Grant's lines in front
of Petersburg.  You participated in the battles then
and during the terrible days and nights which 
followed prior to and after the breaking of our lines
by Grant's army, as well as upon the retreat.  But
it is of the last fight of the army of Northern 
Virginia in which you bore so <hi rend="italics">conspicuous</hi> a part at 
Appomattox C. H. that you ask my recollections.  It
<pb id="grimes129" n="129"/>
would be difficult, my dear General, to forget your
anxiety to get your Division well up and compact
on the evening of the 8th of April, the day preceding 
that last battle and the final surrender of the
army, as well as your assurance to me that if 
allowed to rest and gather up your broken down men 
you would be on hand at any time during the night
of the 8th or morning of the 9th, to take part in any
movement which might be ordered.  My consent
you will remember was obtained that you should go
into camp and rest your men, but before day on the
morning of the 9th of April, you were at the front
ready to participate with your Division in the last
effort ever to be made by the army of Gen. Lee.</p>
          <p>The plan agreed upon at the counsel of war held
at Gen. Lee's Headquarters during the night of the
8th between Gen. Lee, Gen. Pendleton commanding
the artillery, Gen. Fitz Hugh Lee commanding the 
cavalry, Gen. Longstreet and myself who 
commanded the two wings of his army, was this: My
command, consisting of about one half of the army
with the cavalry, was to attack the enemy's cavalry 
in front of Appomattox C. H., and attempt to cut
a way out, and Longstreet and the artillery not engaged with my command and the wagon train, was
to follow.  It was supposed that nothing more than
<pb id="grimes130" n="130"/> 
the enemy's cavalry was in our front, and though
largely outnumbering the whole of my command
and the cavalry of Gen. Lee, yet it was supposed as
the result proved, that Sheridan's cavalry could be
beaten back.  It was during the preparation for this
final move in the early morning of the 9th, that you 
offered to make the attack in front.</p>
          <p>Your Division with the other troops were placed
in line while Gen. Fitz Hugh Lee's cavalry moved 
to our right.  The attack was made and proved 
eminently successful, resulting in the capture of the
enemy's works which he had temporarily thrown up
in our front, and the taking of six pieces (I think)
of his artillery.  You were not halted for a considerable time but pressed steadily forward to the front,
until I ordered you to rear, upon receiving intelligence 
from Gen. R. E. Lee that a flag of truce was
in existence between himself and Gen. Grant, and
upon the appearance and advance of heavy bodies
of infantry upon both our flanks.  Your 
indisposition to retreat then, and your anxiety to go on, was 
manifest; but I knew more of the situation than
you did, and in accordance with the understanding
at the counsel of war the night previous, the 
appearance of these large bodies of the enemy's infantry, and the impossibility of Gen. Longstreet's
<pb id="grimes131" n="131"/>
moving up, the constantly increasing distance 
between us, and the pressing of the enemy's force into
this space, it was necessary for me to notify Gen.
Lee of the situation then, and these circumstances
rendered resistance for any positive advantage 
useless, and loss of life by our brave men of no avail.</p>
          <p>On the receipt of the note from Gen. Lee I 
ordered you to the rear, and notified Gen. Sheridan of
the existence of a “Flag of Truce,” who insisted
upon the separate surrender of my command to him,
which I refused.  It was at this time you asked me
what the meaning was of my instructions to you to
put your men in any position you could select, and
suggested that I permit you to return to the front.
It was very painful to announce to you and to the
troops the surrender of the army, and when you
were made aware of it, you expressed your regret
that I had not informed you while you were in front,
that you might have made the effort to escape with
your command.</p>
          <p>I was touched, General, by your indisposition to
meet this dreaded ordeal, as I was by the grief, the
anguish of all our brave men, but it was all 
overall was done that could be done by they army, and
any escape of small bodies of troops would have
been charged as treachery on Gen. Lee's part toward
<pb id="grimes132" n="132"/> 
Gen. Grant, from whose overwhelming forces
it was impossible now to extricate the remnant of
the “Army of Northern Virginia.” This occasion
was the most trying one of all our lives; but, 
General, the ungenerous effort to humiliate us since the
war, by the strong arm of power, has made upon my
heart, and doubtless upon yours, a more ineffaceable
impression than all else connected with our past history.  We were entitled to honorable, magnanimous
legislation by the General Government; but the
purposes of the party in power have seemed to be 
only to irritate by proscriptive laws, and drive us to
desperation by the support of those forced in power
over us, who in the name of Law  have <hi rend="italics">robbed</hi> us, in
the name of Liberty have inaugurated the rule of
the Bayonet, arrested and imprisoned the innocent,
and gloated in the oppression of our citizens.</p>

          <p>On page 95 of Col. Walter H. Taylor's book 
entitled “Four Years with General Lee,” (which book
<pb id="grimes133" n="133"/>
is now in Gen. Grimes' library,) the first section is
marked thus + and reads as follows.</p>
          <p>“General Lee witnessed the flight of the 
Federals through Gettysburg and up the hills beyond.
He then directed me to go to General Ewell and to
say to him, that from the position which he 
occupied he could see the enemy retreating over those
hills without organization and in great confusion,
that it was only necessary to press “those people”
in order to secure possession of the heights, and
that, if possible, he wished him to do this.  In 
obedience to these instructions, I proceeded 
immediately to General Ewell and delivered the order of
General Lee; and after receiving from him some
message for the commanding general in regard to
the prisoners captured, returned to the latter and
reported that his order had been delivered.”</p>
          <p>All around the margin of this page appears the
following in pencil, and written in Gen. Grimes, own
handwriting:</p>
          <p>“I was in the lead and saw the first pieces of 
artillery, two in number, making for this hill.  The
enemy were routed and retreating in great confusion.
Gen. Ramseur, with my regiment in advance, were
rushing up, and following the enemy, and without
the slightest doubt in my mind, could have captured
<pb id="grimes134" n="134"/>
these guns and occupied the hill, but an officer
of rank rode up and advised that we await 
reinforcements, which was done, and are were drawn
back to the main street of Gettysburg, and there
remained, without firing a shot the whole evening  
several hours of daylight.”</p>
          <p>Gen. Ramseur says in his report of the battle of
Gettysburg, (see Southern Historical Papers.   -  C.):</p>
          <p>“The enemy was pushed through Gettysburg to
the heights beyond, when I received an order to halt
and form line of battle in a street in Gettysburg
running east and west.</p>
          <p>“To Colonel Parker, 30th North Carolina; 
Colonel Bennett, 19th North Carolina; Colonel Grimes,
4th North Carolina, and Major Hurt, 2nd North
Carolina, my thanks are due for skill and gallantry
displayed by them in this day's fight.”</p>
          <p>General Grimes received a copy of Moore's 
History of North Carolina only a few days before his 
death, and had but little opportunity to examine it,
and had only read disconnected parts of it.</p>
          <p>On page 170, Vol. II, in the two last lines of said 
page he makes the following corrections: Erases
“Twelfth, Colonel Daniel,” and writes, “Fourteenth, 
<pb id="grimes135" n="135"/>
Col. R. T. Bennett” and erases “Twentieth, Col. T. 
F. Toon” and writes “Thirty-seventh, Col. F. M. 
Parker.”</p>
          <p>On page 190, Vol. II, on the left margin of said
page, appears the following written also in pencil in
his own handwriting:</p>
          <p>“I commanded Anderson's Brigade at this 
battle, consisting of the 2nd, 4th, 14th and 30th 
Regiments of N. C. Troops.</p>
          <p>BRYAN GRIMES.”</p>
          <p>On page 259, Vol. II, Major Moore in describing
Gen. Lee leading the charge in person at the battle
of Spottsylvania, C. H., places the date of this charge
in person by Gen. Lee on the morning of the 10th
of May.</p>
          <p>On the right margin of said page is written in
pencil: “It was on the 5th May that Gen. Lee led
the charge in person.”</p>
          <p>On page 260, Vol. II, Major Moore says: 
“Conspicuous in this charge was the youthful and slender
form of Brigadier-General Stephen D. Ramseur, of
Lincoln county, North Carolina.” On the left 
margin of said page is written in pencil: “This charge
was led by Col. Bryan Grimes, commanding 
Ramseur's Brigade, Ramseur being disabled by a wound.”</p>

          <p>Ewell's Corps, composed of Rodes, Early and
Johnson's commands, surprised Gen. Milroy.  We
drove the enemy's cavalry from the summit, and
ousted them to intercept the retreat of the enemy

Berryville.  We moved down to Martinsburg and
drove the enemy into and through the town, taking
several pieces of artillery and 700 prisoners.  Then
moved up and crossed the Potomac river at 
Williamsport.  Occupied Chambersburg on 23rd of June,
