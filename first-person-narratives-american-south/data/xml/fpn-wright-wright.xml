        <argument>
          <p>THE COMET OF 1858 - JOURNEY BY STAGE COACH FROM
MARSHALL TO AUSTIN - A PRAIRIE FIRE - FORDING THE
BRAZOS RIVER.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>IN gathering the sad and happy memories of the
years of which I write, I am actuated by two
motives - one, that I am conscious that the
days are passing, and that if done at all, the
chronicle had best be written ere the eye that
has seen these things grows dim and the
memory faulty; and the other, that I would fain
live in the thoughts of the children who shall
come after me, and have their hearts, as they
read this record, beat in unison with mine. Thus
shall we be linked together in these memories.</p>
        <p>I remember, in the summer of 1858, sitting on the
broad piazza in front of our home in Marshall,
Texas, watching the great comet that hung in the
heavens. I can see now the crêpe myrtle bushes
with their rose-colored blossoms, flanking the
steps; feel again the warm, languorous air of the
summer night, heavy with the odor of white
jasmine, and honeysuckle; and hear again the
voices, long stilled, as we talked together
<pb id="wright4" n="4"/>
of the comet and its portent. As a child, I
felt the influence of the time: great events were
forming; the “irrepressible conflict,” which
culminated in the awful struggle of the sixties, was
just becoming, to the mind of thinkers, a fearful
probability; and when we looked at the blazing
comet in that fair summer sky, a feeling of awe
and mystery enveloped us. Night after night
we watched it, and singular to say, it is the only
distinct impression left on my mind of the summer
of '58.</p>
        <p>In the autumn my father was elected the
State Senate and we made preparations for our
journey to Austin. There were no railroads
across the State in those days, and the hundreds
of miles had to be traversed by private conveyance,
or by stage coach.</p>
        <p>We decided to make the expedition in our old-
fashioned family carriage, drawn by a pair of stout
horses and driven by our negro coachman, Henry.
My brother came with us on horseback. We made
the journey in easy stages - our luggage, of course,
being sent on by coach. We would drive about thirty
miles a day - never more; stopping in the middle of
the day for an hour or so, when the horses would be
thoroughly rested and fed, and we would have our
luncheon.</p>
        <p>At night, we always stopped at a convenient
farmhouse, the location of which had been
previously learned, and whose owners were
<pb id="wright5" n="5"/>
accustomed, in a country where there were no inns,
to receive occasional travelers.</p>
        <p>What a delightful journey it was! The beautiful,
level, prairie roads, hard, white and smooth, over
which we rolled, with little effort on the horses'
part - stretching behind and before us that wide
expanse of prairie, now, in November, covered
with tall, waving, yellow grass; but in June glorious
with the exquisite blue flowers of the buffalo
clover - stopping, from time to time, to water the
horses from the pure, limpid springs; the heavens
blue as a sapphire and the sun shining!</p>
        <p>I do not remember any rainy days in the ten during
which we were on the road. The midday meal, taken
by the banks of some clear, beautiful stream, was a
feast indeed - a daily picnic of the most enchanting
kind.</p>
        <p>I recall only two adventures by the way. One
was our setting the prairie on fire by thoughtlessly
throwing a lighted match in the dry grass, which
might have resulted very seriously had we not been
near a stream, and had not the wind been blowing
towards it, and in the opposite direction from that in
which we were going. As it happened, it was an
interesting and novel sight, viewed at a safe distance.
And it resulted in much merriment, as we recalled
our first frightened efforts to put out the prairie fire
by futile little journeyings to and from the stream
with cups of water.</p>
        <pb id="wright6" n="6"/>
        <p>Our other adventure was fording the Brazos River,
a broad, swift-running, shallow stream, so limpid
that the stones on the bottom were clearly visible.</p>
        <p>When we reached the ford, we knew nothing of
the treacherous character of the sandy bottom, and
when about fifty feet from the shore the horses
stopped to drink. Imagine our horror when we felt
the carriage beginning to sink and the horses to
plunge in a vain endeavor to extricate themselves.
Luckily for us, the quicksands were not very deep,
and having sunk as far as the hubs of the wheels,
there we stuck, hard and fast. My brother, who was
on horseback, was able to approach cautiously, and
took each of us out of the carriage window, when,
seated behind him and holding on to him with a grip
made intense by necessity and terror, we rode
rapidly across the river and were landed safely on
the other side. The carriage, now being lightened of
its weight, was raised, and the horses were enabled
to get on a firmer footing and soon were out of their
dangerous position. I must say that I think we all
behaved very well, as I have no recollection of any
excitement or cries of terror, which might have
been expected of us in such a new and trying
experience.</p>
        <p>I recall very vividly the evening when we came in
sight of the city of Austin: the brilliant autumn
sunset, the invigorating air, the lovely view of
<pb id="wright7" n="7"/>
the surrounding country, the sound of the horses'
feet ringing on the hard, smooth road, as we rolled
along, down the slope that brought us to our
journey's end - half way across the State of Texas,
in ten days.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
        <head>FROM VILLAGE TO CITY LIFE</head>
        <argument>
          <p>THE WRITER'S HOME IN MARSHALL - ANECDOTES OF FAITHFUL
NEGROES - REMOVAL TO WASHINGTON - MEETINGS
WITH SENATORS CLAY AND SLIDELL AND THEIR WIVES
AND OTHER NOTABLES.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>IT IS curious how the minor things in a life stand out
against the background of the past like silhouettes.
The great events are harder to remember than the
trifles.</p>
        <p>The village of Marshall was not different from
a thousand other little country towns throughout
the South. The houses set back from the sandy
street, with their front yards filled with roses and
honeysuckles; the back yards with the servants'
quarters and the wood piles; the well dug deep
to reach the cool water; and in it the tempting
bucket in which the luscious watermelon was
sent down to its mysterious depths, and from
which it emerged covered with a silver frost.
The happy little darkies played in the background
through the summer day, and gathered around
the kitchen fire when the nights grew chill, and
the white folks at “the house” sat by the roaring
hickory logs at the chimney side.</p>
        <pb id="wright12" n="12"/>
        <p>I never see a big wood fire but I remember my
father and the way he constructed his: The huge back
log, first; the light-wood knots in front, and on top
the wealth of smaller hickory; and then the blaze,
and the warmth, and the delight of replenishing!</p>
        <p>There is one little figure, that stands out in
positive and pathetic prominence, as I think of those
old days; little Emmeline, the small negro girl who
was my constant companion. She loved me with a
devotion that I have never seen excelled, and in her
brief life (for she died when eight years old) she
made an impression which has never left me, and
which I am glad to record here. When she died, after
a short illness, I grieved sincerely; and to this day
cannot think of her without a pang.</p>
        <p>Strange to say, of our many plays together only
two incidents can I recall. It was the fourth of July.
The arrival of the day had been announced at dawn by
the explosion of gunpowder placed in an anvil, this
being the primitive method in vogue among the
village patriots for ushering in the anniversary and
producing the desired amount of noise. There was,
of course, the usual popping of firecrackers, and the
usual parade of the militia.</p>
        <p>When little Emmeline heard the shouts and the
music, she left the enchantment of the approaching
<pb id="wright13" n="13"/>
pageant, even at the risk of losing the sight, to
summon me.</p>
        <p>“Oh! run, run,” she screamed at the top of her
voice, “run, and look; General Washington done
come.”</p>
        <p>We had a dear old doctor in the village, and he
had one invariable method of diagnosis, which used
to cause us all infinite amusement. Whatever the
disease, and wherever situated, he always, before
administering his remedies, would first proceed to
feel our spines. We thought it very funny, but he was
only a little in advance of his school. Nowadays, I
believe, the osteopaths pursue the same practice and
proclaim much the same doctrine, as to the general
seat of disease. Now Emmeline, like the rest of her
race, was imitative; she liked to play doctor. We
saw her one day, having cornered a little piccaninny,
named Hannah, proceed to poke and punch different
portions of her anatomy in true medical style,
accentuating her thrusts with the suggestive query
as to the location of the supposed pain, her voice
taking on an indescribable whine, supposed to be
professional.</p>
        <p>“Hannah, Hannah, docker Baylor say your
backbone hurt you, Hannah?”</p>
        <p>If she had lived in later days who knows in what
new school of medicine she might not have been a
burning and a shining light!</p>
        <p>Then there was the Court House in the middle
<pb id="wright14" n="14"/>
of the square, where the voice of the crier was heard
on Court days calling, “Oh yes, oh, yes, come into
Court,” and the long rack where the horses were
hitched in patient rows, switching off the flies with
their long tails. Fortunately for them “docking” was
an unknown art.</p>
        <p>Then there was the tavern, with the wide front
piazza, where appeared the benches and the split-
bottomed chairs, with their leisurely occupants; and
the inevitable accompaniment of elevated legs on
the railing, which some cavilling Britisher has
styled the attitude of the American Congressman.</p>
        <p>I can hear now the dinner bell, summoning the
guests at the hour of noon. The boys had a song to
fit the monotonous sound, suggestive of the quality
and quantity of the repast.</p>
        <lg type="lyrics" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <l part="N">“Pigtail done, Pigtail done,</l>
          <l part="N">If you don't come quick</l>
          <l part="N">You won't git none!”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Then there were the churches of different
denominations. The quaint Methodist buildings,
where the men sat on one side and the women on
the other; where, on Sunday evenings, however,
the rules were not so strict but that the girls made
themselves pretty and coquettish enough, in
their sweet summer dresses land won many a sly
glance of approbation from across the rigid
dividing line.</p>
        <pb id="wright15" n="15"/>
        <p>Then there were the hard-shell Baptists and the
Campbellite Baptists; and from their pulpits the
theologians of the different schools pronounced a
sufficient variety of dogmas to daunt the souls and
bewilder the minds of ordinary mortals.</p>
        <p>Many of the negroes were members of one or
other of these denominations. “Dick” professed
conversion and was taken into the fold by
immersion. When “Marcia” heard of it her comment
was congratulatory for two reasons, “One t'ing,
Dick got a good washin'.”</p>
        <p>It was against the rules for the negroes to be out
at night without a “pass,” and it was the custom to
come to young “Massa” or “Missus” to write them
for them. Many a one have I written. “Henry has
permission to pass and repass until ten o'clock” was
the usual form.</p>
        <p>There have been volumes written about the
negro, generally by persons who knew nothing,
by practical experience, of the subject of which
they wrote. They theorized, from a false basis,
on a condition of things which existed only in
their imaginations; and they built up a fabric,
which, in these later days, has tumbled down
about their ears, and bids fair, in its fall, to work
havoc, in more directions than one. It may be
that out of the dirt and débris, a new structure
will be erected in time; but that time is certainly
not yet. Now I do not propose to theorize on
the subject. I merely wish to relate two or three
<pb id="wright16" n="16"/>
facts, to the truth of which I can bear witness -
facts that exhibit the character of the negro, as
shown during the War, under the then existing
conditions of slavery.</p>
        <p>When my parents left home in the autumn of 1860
to go to Washington, they anticipated returning
in a few months. We had a faithful woman,
named Sarah, whose family had belonged to
ours for two generations. Before our departure
the silver was packed away and the key given
to Sarah. For nearly four years we were absent.
During that time the house was occupied, on
several occasions, as headquarters, by Generals
of our own army in command at Marshall,
permission of course being given. Sarah, for
the credit of the establishment, as she told us
afterwards, produced the silver and had it constantly
in use. When we returned, not a single piece was
missing; though, in the meantime the War had
ended, and she was free to come and go as she
chose, and could easily, in the lawlessness of the
time, have decamped with her prize, with no one
to gainsay her. When, on our return home after
weeks of waiting in fear and anxiety for my
father's safety, at last tidings were brought us
that he was in our neighborhood - it was to
Sarah that we confided the fact, and through her
connivance, under cover of night, he entered his
home. It was Sarah who watched with us and
stood on guard through the long weary hours
<pb id="wright17" n="17"/>
while we sat together and talked over the plans for
the future - and it was Sarah who saw in the early
dawn that the coast was clear for her master - her
master no longer - to make his escape from his
foes!</p>
        <p>Then again there was Henry, my brother's body
servant during the War. In looking back it seems
strange that officers in the army, at a time when they
were barely existing on a third of a pound of bacon
a day and a little corn meal, should have decreased
their slender store by sharing it with servants. But
those were the good old days and the good old
ways, and I, for one, would never have changed
them! Now one of my father's admirers in Texas
had sent to him at Richmond a very beautiful
Mexican saddle, heavily mounted in silver, and he,
caring little for such vanities and always delighting
to give to his children, promptly transferred the
valuable present to my brother. Henry's pride in
his young master's grandeur was unbounded, and
he polished the handsome silver mountings with
unwearied zeal, and I doubt if the suggestion ever
occurred to his simple mind as to how sensible it
would be to convert a portion of those jingling
chains and buckles into some good digestible
article to appease the ever-present hunger of
both master and man. After General Johnston's
surrender, and when my brother determined to make
his way across the river to join Kirby Smith, he
<pb id="wright18" n="18"/>
had to part from Henry. That Henry should leave
him voluntarily never occurred to either of them.
He left him at a point in Alabama and told him
to wait with the horse and famous saddle until
he should receive orders to come. And there he
remained for weeks, faithful and obedient. When
at last my brother wrote for him he sold the
horse and the saddle, according to his orders,
and with the proceeds made his way home,
where he appeared one day to give an account
of his adventures and expenditures. Can these
instances of faithful service be matched in any
negro to-day, after nearly forty years of freedom?</p>
        <p>The negro in slavery before and during the War,
was lazy and idle - he will always be that - but
he was simple, true and faithful. What he has
become since his emancipation from servitude is
a queer comment on the effect of the liberty
bestowed upon him. But that is going very far
afield and away from our subject.</p>
        <p>The great events in the county were the barbecues
and the commencements. The former were
generally the means of gathering the politicians
who made stump speeches, and instructed the
people as to the proper way to construe the
Constitution, and duly inculcated the doctrine of
States' rights. Here, over a great pit, spanned
by iron rods, were laid and roasted huge beeves
and hogs, the dispensing of which savory viands,
on immense tables spread under the shade of the
<pb id="wright19" n="19"/>
branching oaks, was good to see, and better to
smell, and best of all to taste.</p>
        <p>Then the Commencements were the events of the
year. The “sweet girl graduates” in their filmy white
robes and dainty ribbons, with compositions in hand,
astonishing the dear old country papas and mamas,
by “words of learned length and thundering sound”,
and blushing and simpering under the admiring gaze
of the youthful swains. I knew of one of these, after
an occasion of the sort, expressing his feelings of
admiration in rather an original way, by sending his
lady love a magnificent watermelon with its dear
little curly tail tied with a blue ribbon! This youthful
enthusiast bore the euphonious appellation of
Alonzo Womack, and some cruel, unfeeling one,
with a prophetic eye to the possible result of a
mutual consumption of the luscious gift, made the
following suggestive couplet:</p>
        <lg type="verse" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <l part="N">“Alonzo Womack</l>
          <l part="N">With a pain in his stomach.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>From Marshall, my thoughts naturally drift back
to Austin where we spent two winters before
my father's election to the United States Senate.</p>
        <p>I wonder if my descendants, should they ever
read these memoirs, will be shocked at the levity
of an ancestress who frankly acknowledges that
the most vivid recollection left on her mind is a
grey merino pélisse and black beaver hat and
<pb id="wright20" n="20"/>
plumes with which her small person was decked
during the winter of 1859. At the house where we
spent the winter I do remember several interesting
people.</p>
        <p>One of these was “Tom” Ochiltree, whose name has
since attained wide celebrity. He was then clerk of the
Texas Senate, young and full of spirit and mischief and
cleverness, of a kindly temper and fond of children.</p>
        <p>A little girl of six, staying in the house with him, became
deeply enamoured, and used to weep bitterly when her
elders, to tease her, would declare that his locks, which
were of an intensified Titian tint, would set the house afire.</p>
        <p>At this date occurred the event, which was to transport
me from the quiet life I had led into that vast theatre
whereon was acted the greatest tragedy of modern
times, and in which those nearest and dearest to me
played prominent parts. From their intimate connection
with the chief actors in those tragic days I have been
taken behind the scenes, and enabled from tale of lip
and pen to write this chronicle.</p>
        <p>I well remember the night we sat waiting together for
news from the Capitol, when suddenly the sound of
music was heard and the shouts of the crowd coming to
announce the election of my father to the United States
Senate. In a short time thereafter we went to Washington,
by way of Galveston, where we took the steamer for
<pb id="wright21" n="21"/>
New Orleans, and thence up the Mississippi River to
Memphis, from where the railroad carried us to our
destination.</p>
        <p>I remember my delight in that journey. New Orleans,
with its foreign air and beautiful shops; the old St. Charles
Hotel, where we stopped for a while, that our wardrobes
might receive a finishing touch at the hands of the modistes
and milliners, whose good taste was proverbial. Then the
week on that river palace, the old <hi rend="italics">John Simonds,</hi> one of
the famous boats of the day. Such luxury of living, even in
these times, could not be excelled. And the delicious leisure
of it, the lack of hurry and bustle. A week to go from New
Orleans to Memphis!</p>
        <p>When we reached Washington, we joined the colony at
Brown's Hotel, where the atmosphere was as distinctly
Southern in character as it was Northern at Willard's, the
rival house. Among the many interesting people at
“Brown's” were Senator Clement C. Clay and his brilliant
wife. Mrs. Clay was a woman of great vivacity, and rare
charm of manner; her cleverness and wit made her a
delightful companion, and her lively sallies at the great fancy
ball, in the winter of '58, where she personated “Mrs.
Partington,” with a young friend in attendance as “Ike,”
will long be remembered</p>
        <p>Here, I saw, for the first time what was then
called “dollar jewelry,” and this was when Mrs.
<pb id="wright22" n="22"/>
Clay came down to dinner one night, very elegantly
gowned, her ornaments being a beautiful set of
carbuncles, which sparkled and glowed in the
lamplight. After having called attention to her
new acquisitions and had them duly admired, she
laughingly confessed that she had purchased the
gems at the “dollar store” as a present for her maid.
This happy, buoyant temper enabled her to bear up
under the sorrows of the coming years, when her
husband, sent as a Commissioner from the
Confederacy to Canada, was, on his return,
imprisoned on a charge of complicity with the
assassination of Lincoln (fancy Clement Clay, the
noblest, kindest, most gentle of men, in the
character of an assassin!), and though released
after months of suffering and hardship, never
recovered his health or spirits. Photography was
in its infancy at this time, and the little <foreign lang="fr">“cartes de
visite,”</foreign> which then the fashion to present to one's
friends, show what a wide step has been taken
between those crude attempts and the finished
works of art of this day.</p>
        <p>Among the many prominent personalities who
crowd my memory for recognition are Senator
and Mrs. Slidell, of Louisiana, and their lovely
daughters, one of whom afterward married Baron
Erlanger, of Paris. Mr. Slidell will probably be
best remembered by his connection with the <hi rend="italics">Trent</hi>
affair. Mrs. Slidell and her daughters were on the
vessel when her husband was removed and
<figure id="ill1" entity="wright22">
<p>SENATOR SLIDELL<lb/>Of Louisiana<lb/>THE MISSES SLIDELL<lb/>MRS. SLIDELL</p>
</figure>
<pb id="wright23" n="23"/>
were taken with him on board the United States
ship. In making the removal, the story goes, and was
generally believed, though I cannot vouch for its
accuracy, a Federal officer laid a restraining hand
on Miss Slidell's shoulder, whereupon she very
promptly raised her own and administered an
emphatic rebuke for his temerity by a sound slap on
the cheek. A rhymster of the day celebrated the fact
in a song, of which the following couplet was the
refrain:</p>
        <lg type="verse" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <l part="N">“A bumper for the gallant girl,</l>
          <l part="N">Who slapped the dastard Tory oh!”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>The winter of '60 saw us again in Washington with
our quarters changed to “Wormley's.” This was
more than forty years ago and was in the dawn of
Wormley's fame as a caterer - indeed, I believe
ours was the first family to lodge with him in the
house, which was afterward a synonym for
delightful living and even in those days the acme of
comfort. I can recall now, in these degenerate times
of discomfort and bad servants, the admirable
service rendered, and the delicious dinners
furnished us, and with a sigh of regret confess to
myself that if we have progressed in some matters
we certainly have retrogressed in others.</p>
        <p>In our drawing room in “I” Street were often
gathered many of the distinguished men of the
day - and I, a child of fourteen, would sit
quietly by, listening to the talk and hearing
<pb id="wright24" n="24"/>
the great questions of the hour discussed. The war
clouds were growing black and threatening, and even
the children felt the impulse of the time. My great
delight was to go to the Capitol and hear my father
speak in the Senate, and he never had a more ardent
admirer of his fiery eloquence than the little
daughter in the gallery, who listened to the debates
with beating heart; but with the most supreme
confidence in his wisdom and power to vanquish all
adversaries.</p>

WRITER'S FATHER - A FAMOUS DUEL - LETTERS TO AND
FROM MRS. WIGFALL IN 1861 - THE EVACUATION OF FORT
SUMTER.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>IN thinking of the men who made the South
famous in the Senate at that day, the Vice-President,
John C. Breckenridge of Kentucky, naturally
comes first to mind. With what inimitable dignity
and grace he presided as President of the Senate
- even his worst enemies according him praise
for the justice and impartiality of his rulings. He
was a delightful man to know well, and I shall
never forget the charm of his conversation. His
keen sense of humor, fund of anecdote, and the
fascinating cordiality of his manner, made a
lighter setting to the sterner qualities of his character
which came out fully when, throwing in his
fortunes with the young Confederacy, he served
in the field as Major General, and in the Cabinet
as Secretary of War. Brilliant he was and debonair,
the highest type of a Kentucky gentleman,
statesman and soldier. I remember him in London
<pb id="wright28" n="28"/>
in 1867, broken in fortune and retired to private life
from the exalted position he had held; just the same noble
gentleman and delightful companion he had ever been, with
spirit undaunted, and sense of humor undiminished. He told
us a droll story, illustrating this latter trait. When he was in
London at the time of which I have spoken, he was much
sought after as a celebrity and among many other
invitations received one from the Countess of Blank to
luncheon. This lady at the same time had advertised for a
footman, stating, as is usual in such cases, the required
height, etc., a footman being considered more or less
desirable according to his dimensions. Now General
Breckenridge was a man of very magnificent proportions.
Mistaking the hour he reached the house before the
appointed time and by some accident was ushered into
Lady Blank's presence without being announced. The day
was in June; owing to the heat, the blinds were drawn,
letting in a subdued light; Lady Blank, glancing at the
advancing figure, to the astonishment of the visitor greeted
him thus:</p>
        <p>“Have you a reference from your last place?” The
General took in the situation instantly, and with a twinkle in
his eye unobserved by his hostess, answered respectfully,</p>
        <p>“Yes, my lady.”</p>
        <p>“What were your duties?” was the next query.</p>
        <p>“Well, my lady, in the last three places I held,
<figure id="ill3" entity="wright28">
<p>SENATOR LOUIS TREZEVANT WIGFALL, OF TEXAS<lb/>(1861)</p>
</figure>
<pb id="wright29" n="29"/>
I was Vice-President of the United States, Major General
in the Confederate Army, and Secretary of War of the
Confederate States of America!”</p>
        <p>“Oh! General Breckenridge,” stammered Lady Blank,
utterly overcome with confusion, and averting her face.
Laughing heartily, he advanced with his hands outstretched,
and assured her that his vanity was so tickled at the implied
compliment to his figure that he quite forgave her mistake.</p>
        <p>Jefferson Davis was afterward to be the most famous of
that remarkable group of men. He was a man of scholarly
attainments, polished manners, and of quiet and grave
demeanor. His integrity of purpose, pure patriotism and
high courage were never questioned by those who knew
him best. My father's intimacy with him was of the closest,
and he loved and esteemed him as a friend and admired
him as a man, until, in the last, unhappy years of the
Confederacy, an estrangement grew up between them,
owing to differing views as to the conduct of affairs, of
which I shall speak more particularly hereafter.</p>
        <p>As showing the softer side of Mr. Davis's character, I
recall my father's telling us one day, when he went to see
him in Washington on some grave matter of state, that he
found the future President of the Confederacy in his library,
lying flat on his back, with two or three of his little children
climbing over him.</p>
        <pb id="wright30" n="30"/>
        <p>As I write the names of others in that famous group, the
familiar faces rise before me. Benjamin, the silver tongued;
I can see him now in the attitude he always assumed when
speaking, leaning slightly forward, with one hand resting
on his desk, while his softly modulated voice and clear
enunciation, the purity of his English and the wonderful flow
of language delighted his auditors. However hot and furious
the debate, the soft tone of his voice was never raised in
anger, nor his placid manner the least ruffled or disturbed.</p>
        <p>Not so the fiery Georgian, Tombs, who would thunder
out his anathemas in a manner commensurate with his zeal
and earnestness in the defence of his principles.</p>
        <p>Senator R. M. T. Hunter, of Virginia, was a man of great
force. My father, in his characteristic way, said of him, “I
don't know what we Southern men would do without
Hunter; he is the only one among us who knows anything
about finance!”</p>
        <p>As the fateful winter of '61 wore on, the Southern Senators
began to drop off, one by one, with the secession of their
states, until, at last, my father was left almost alone in his
place. Texas not having seceded, he held his ground and
refused to give up his seat in the Senate, until his state had
passed the ordinance of secession.</p>
        <p>During this time he stood at bay, surrounded by
enemies, the champion of the South; vindicating
<figure id="ill4" entity="wright30">
<p>SENATOR R. M. T. HUNTER, OF VIRGINIA</p>
</figure>
<pb id="wright31" n="31"/>
the right of the Sovereign States to secede, under
the Constitution, appealing to the Northern
Senators for a peaceful solution of the
“irrepressible conflict,” and hurling back, in the
faces of their defamers, the calumnies against the
Southern States. It was then that he and Charles
Sumner, of Massachusetts, contended in a
memorable debate on the issues of the day. This
contest excited unusual interest, from the fact that
Preston Brooks, of South Carolina, whose attack on
Sumner is known to the world, had fought a duel
with my father in 1841, in which they were both
wounded. Preston Brooks was shot through the hip,
and my father through both thighs. The latter was
twenty-three years old and Preston Brooks twenty-
two at the time. My father's second was John
Laurens Manning, afterward Governor of South
Carolina, and the second of Preston Brooks was
Pierce M. Butler, afterward also Governor of the
State. My father had been in several affairs of honor
before this; but never fought another duel after his
marriage. He seldom mentioned the subject, but
when asked for his opinion would state with an
earnestness of conviction, as refreshing as it was
real, that he was a firm believer in the <hi rend="italics">
<foreign lang="fr">code duello</foreign>
</hi>
as a factor in the improvement of both the morals
and the manners of a community! He held that it
engendered courtesy of speech and demeanor - had
a most restraining tendency on the errant fancy, and as
<pb id="wright32" n="32"/>
a preservative of the domestic relations was without
an equal. His fame, as a marksman, was known
throughout the State. As a funny illustration of that,
General Hampton used to tell a story, that as he was
riding one day through his plantation, he met a negro
on the road who touched his forelock respectfully
and to whom he stopped and spoke. He was sure the
man was one of his own slaves, from the direction
from which he came, but from idle curiosity asked
the question, “Whom do you belong to, Sambo?”
Sambo straightened himself and with an air of great
importance replied, “Colonel Wigfall, sah, de best
shot in Souf Callina, sah!” This was such a barefaced
misappropriation of ownership, as Colonel Wigfall's
home was in another part of the state, that General
Hampton laughed heartily and saved the story as too
good to be lost. But this is a digression.</p>
        <p>Chandler, of Michigan, was another Republican
Senator who was especially violent in his
denunciations of the South. On one occasion he
made a very virulent attack, saying in the course
of his speech many bitter things of the seceded
states; finishing up with the statement that if
certain contingencies came about, he would “leave
this country and join some other nation - even the
Comanches he would prefer to this Government
in such a case.” My father rose in answer and
stated in a grave tone of remonstrance, “that he
trusted the Senator would think better of this

resolve, for the Comanches had already suffered
too much from contact with the whites!”</p>
        <p>At this time, March, 1861, the Provisional
Government of the Confederate States was already
established in Montgomery, Ala. The Southern
people were still hoping for a peaceful solution of
their difficulties by the evacuation of Fort Sumter.
In anticipation of leaving Washington and in view of
the uncertainty of their movements, my parents had
sent my sister and myself, children of eight and
fourteen years of age, to remain temporarily with
my maternal grandmother at Longwood, a suburb
of Boston. My father writes at this time in a letter
to my brother at school:</p>
        <div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">

The war has not yet begun, but I believe it will
before the <hi rend="italics">end of summer,</hi> though the general
impression here is that we will have peace.</p>
          <p>“When I get to Montgomery I'll write you fully
all the news, and my impressions as to the political
conditions present and to come. Ben McCulloch
was here yesterday. He came on to buy Colt's
pistols for a Mounted Regiment in Texas, which
he is authorized by the Confederate States to raise.
He has gone to Richmond where I'll meet him
to- morrow. Morse went on to <hi rend="italics">Hartford</hi> to buy
the pistols. (The indictment against Governor
Floyd has been dismissed by the Government.
There never was the slightest ground for indicting
him. Andy Johnson was reported in the
<pb id="wright34" n="34"/>
Republican papers here as using very offensive
language in reference to Governor Floyd. The
Governor addressed him a note to-day enquiring
as to the correctness of the report and Andy, of
course, disclaimed it. So the matter ended.)”</p>

me that the people here would never allow the removal of

fully determined that the order should not be executed. I

Battery stands fire admirably, and has dismounted two of
Sumter's barbette guns. Not a single accident up to this
time on our side. Thought that Sumter suffered this morning
from the effect of shells - as Anderson is keeping his men
at the casemates. He has thrown no shell, and probably has
none; or perhaps, no guns from which to throw them. He
has been throwing 32 solid shot at the iron battery

          <p>The following letter, written from Charleston to the New

surrender of
Fort Sumter and my father's connection with the affair. A
Southern newspaper says:</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="article" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <head>HON. LOUIS T. WIGFALL.</head>
          <p>“The gallantry, chivalry, and heroism of this distinguished
son of the South is even applauded by those from whom
we least expected a word of commendation. The following
is an extract of a letter written from Charleston to the New
York <hi rend="italics">Times,</hi> to which we invite the especial attention of
our readers, both on account of its fairness, as well as of
its correct representation of the interview which came off
between Senator Wigfall and Major Anderson:</p>
          <p>“ ‘Mr. Wigfall's exploit was as gallant and chivalrous
as any deed of modern times. - Stationed on Morris
Island, where he had been on foot or in the saddle
since the commencement of the attack, he no sooner
saw the second barracks in flames and the flag staff
shot away, than he resolved to make his way to the
Fort and persuade Major Anderson to desist from a
resistance manifestly so unavailing.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Despite the remonstrances of those around him,
he embarked in a skiff, and with three Negro
oarsmen and a coxswain, pulled over to the Fort.
He was scarce a hundred yards from shore when
they hailed to him to return, “The Stars
<pb id="wright42" n="42"/>
and Stripes were again flying.” - He literally
turned a deaf ear to this call, and pushed on,
brandishing his sword, to which he had tied his
white handkerchief as a flag of truce. From the
batteries of Fort Moultrie balls and shell were
aimed at the skiff. The white flag was invisible
at that distance, and the boat, only noticed when
nearing the Fort, if not carrying reinforcements,
had no business there. A thirty-two pound ball
struck the water within five yards of her, and was
followed by a shell which came near proving fatal.
The Africans strained every nerve to get under
the lee of the fort, and the officers at the batteries
observing that the boat never swerved from her
course, inferred <hi rend="italics">that Wigfall must have been in it,</hi>
thereby acknowledging his more than Palmetto
recklessness and daring.</p>
          <p>“ ‘On touching the wharf, the volunteer sprang
ashore, and finding the gate burst open by the
flames, made his way round to an open port hole
on the town side of the fort, through which with
the aid of a loose piece of timber which he placed
beneath it, he swung himself from a protruding
gun into the embrasure. He stumbled unchallenged
upon one of the garrison, who did not know where
Major Anderson was. The fire was still raging,
the heat intense, and the smoke insufferable.
Shells were still exploding above, and from
time to time within the fort, from the mortars on
Sullivan's Island. He worked his way up to a

group of officers and men standing near a casemate -
“Was Major Anderson there?” “No!” Before
the party had recovered their surprise at the
apparition, Major Anderson came up from the
quarter Wigfall had just left. He saw the sword
and white handkerchief -</p>
          <p>“ ‘ “Whom have I the honor of addressing?”</p>
          <p>“ ‘ “Col. Wigfall, of Gen. Beauregard's staff.”</p>
          <p>“ ‘ “May I inquire your business with me?”</p>
          <p>“ ‘ “I have come to say that you must strike your
colors. Your position is untenable. - You have
defended it gallantly. It's madness to persevere
in useless resistance. You cannot be reinforced.
You have no provisions. - Your ammunition is
nearly exhausted, and your fort is on fire.”</p>
          <p>“ ‘ “On what terms do you summon me to surrender?”</p>
          <p>“ ‘ “Unconditional. Gen. Beauregard is an officer
and a gentleman. He will, doubtless, grant you
all the honors of war, but <hi rend="italics">
<foreign lang="la">speciali gratia.</foreign>
</hi>”</p>
          <p>“ ‘ “Well, I have done all that was possible to
defend this fort.”</p>
          <p>“ ‘ “You have. Haul down your flag.”</p>
          <p>“ ‘ “But your people are still firing into me.”</p>
          <p>“ ‘ “Hoist a white one. If you won't, I will, on my
own responsibility.”</p>
          <p>“ ‘A shell burst in the ground within ten paces
of them as they were speaking. Major Anderson
invited the Ex-Senator into a casemate; a white
<pb id="wright44" n="44"/>
flag was hoisted, the firing ceased, and what is
called the “battle of Fort Sumter” was over.</p>
          <p>“ ‘All parties concur that Wigfall's performance was an
act of heroism and high humanity. There can be no doubt
that Major Anderson and the garrison were in that state of
morbid exaltation which is the forerunner of martyrdom.
They were ready to see their magazines explode and “die
in their tracks.”</p>
          <p>“ ‘You know all the details of the capitulation and have,
doubtless, done justice to the delicacy and generosity of
the rebel general in requiring no parole, besides according
all the honors of war to the gallant defenders of Sumter.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Newspaper correspondents have generally exaggerated
the jubilation in this city at the evacuation of Fort
Sumter. There were no bonfires, no illuminations, and
far less exuberances of conviviality than I have often
witnessed during a race week. On the contrary, there
were manifestations of thankfulness - of the relief
afforded by the removal of a great anxiety.’ ”</p>

two o'clock this afternoon, the flag having fallen
at Fort Sumter, and its fire having ceased, I left
Morris's Island, with the consent and approval of
General Simons to demand the surrender of the
work, and offer assistance to the garrison.</p>
          <p>“Before reaching the Fort the flag was again
raised. On entering the work I informed Major
Anderson of my name and position on the staff of
the Commanding General, and demanded the
surrender of the Fort to the Confederate States.</p>
          <p>“My attention having been called to the fact that
most of our batteries continued their fire, I
suggested to Major Anderson that the cambric
handkerchief, which I bore on my sword, had
probably not been seen, as I crossed the Bay, and
requested him to raise a white flag; which he did.
The firing then ceased from all our batteries -
when Major Anderson lowered his flag and

belief to Major Anderson that no terms would be
imposed, which would be incompatible with his
honor as a soldier, or his feelings as a gentleman -
and assured him of the high appreciation in which
his gallantry and desperate defence of a place, now
no longer tenable, were held by the Commanding
General.</p>
          <p>“Major Anderson exhibited great coolness, and
seemed relieved from much of the unpleasantness
of his situation by the fact that the proposal had
been made by us that he should surrender the work,
which he admitted to be no longer defensible.</p>

streets are so lively and every one looks so happy,
that you can scarcely realize the cause of the
excitement. No one doubts our success. . . .  I
suppose the chief fighting will be in Maryland
and Virginia. . . . This is a beautiful town and
much larger than I expected to see it. There are
a great many gardens, and as beautiful flowers
as I ever saw anywhere. Several bouquets of the
most superb flowers were presented to your

father the night he spoke here and, of course, I
had the benefit of them. The streets are very
wide, and five of them unite, and diverge on the
square opposite us. Something like Washington.”</p>
          <p>“29th: I have been this morning to witness the
opening of Congress, and hear the President's
message. It was an admirable one, worthy of his
reputation. It gives such a fair and lucid
statement of matters, as they now stand, that I
am sure it will do good abroad, if not at home.
. . . This afternoon I went with Mrs. Chesnut to
call on Mrs. Davis. I am going tomorrow to
her reception. . . . You allude to reports
given in the Northern papers of the Fort Sumter
affair. It is only what might have been expected
of them, that they would garble and misrepresent
the truth; but I must confess that Major Anderson's
silence, and the disingenuous bulletin he sent
to Cameron have surprised me. He takes care
not to tell the <hi rend="italics">whole truth,</hi>
and any one to read his
statement would suppose he had only come out on
those conditions, whereas, he surrendered
<hi rend="italics">unconditionally</hi> - the
<hi rend="italics">U. S. Flag was lowered without
salute while your father was in the fort. </hi>This
was seen, not only by your father, but by the
thousands who were on the watch, and it was
only owing to General Beauregard's generosity
(misplaced, it seems, now) that he was allowed
to raise it again, and to salute it on coming out
of the Fort, and take it with him. . . .  And

this conduct too, after the kind and generous
treatment he met with from the Carolinians.
Judge Ochiltree is here and tells me Tom is a
private in a company that Capt. Bass has
raised in Marshall. . . . The drums are beating
here all the time, and it really makes me
heartsick when I think about it all.</p>
          <p>“I don't think though that the military enthusiasm
can be very high at the North as I see they are
offering $20 additional pay to volunteers a
month. That fact speaks volumes. I suppose it is
to be accounted for in the anxiety to get rid of

          <p>A Northern woman who was a native of Rhode
Island, but who had lived all her married life in
the South, returned after her widowhood to
Providence to be among her people. The following
letter was written by her to my mother:</p>

          </opener>
          <p>“ . . . We are always delighted to hear from
you - and indeed your letters and Louis's are the
only comfort we have in this Yankee land
surrounded by people who have no sympathy with
us, and who only open their lips to revile the
South and utter blood-thirsty threats. This morning
an amiable lady wished she had Jeff Davis in
front of a big cannon.  This feminine wish was
<pb id="wright52" n="52"/>
uttered in the cars when L. and F. were going
in to Boston. We have now sufficient proof of
how much stronger hate is than love of country.
Where was the patriotism of Massachusetts when
the country was at war with the English in 1812?
I lived then at the South, and was ashamed of my
countrymen who refused to assist in the war.
Massachusetts, which was the leading state of New
England, refused to let her militia leave the state
and when the U. S. troops were withdrawn, to
fight in other places, applied to the Federal
Government to know whether the expenses of
their own militia, who were summoned to defend
their own State, would be reimbursed by the
Government. When our capitol at Washington
was burned with the President's House and
Treasury buildings, and other public buildings,
why did they not go to meet the British? On the
contrary, they rejoiced at the English victories,
and put every obstacle they could in the way
of the government. Now they are subscribing
millions, and urging every man to go and fight
their own countrymen. It is not patriotism; it is
hatred to the South and woe is me, that I must
live here among such people. God grant you
success. It is a righteous war and all the bloodshed
will be upon the souls of those who brought it on.</p>
          <p>“. . . I think, however, that you at the South
are wrong to undervalue the courage and
<pb id="wright53" n="53"/>
resources of the Northern States. They are no
doubt less accustomed to the use of firearms -
there are very few who know how to ride, and
they are less fiery in their impulses. They are
less disposed to fight, but they are not cowardly
where their interests are concerned; and will
<hi rend="italics">fight for their money.</hi> Where their property is at
stake they will not hesitate to risk their lives,
and at present there is no lack of money. The
women are all roused, and are urging their relatives
on; while some of the young ladies are exceedingly
anxious to imitate Florence Nightingale, and
distinguish themselves in the Army. The boys are
parading about with red shirts and guns; and their
wise mothers are admiring their military ardor.</p>
          <p>“I would not advise you of the South to trust
too much in the idea that the Northerners will not
fight; for I believe they will, and their numbers
are overwhelming. You know an army of ants
can kill a wounded horse. It is a mistake, too,
for you to suppose that it is only the lower orders,
who are enlisted. I have heard of a good many
of the most respectable young men, who have
enlisted for three years. I suppose there are a
good many counter jumpers and Irish among them;
but still there are many very decent persons who
have gone to the wars. I hear that with Gov.
Sprague no less persons than W. G. and M. J.
have gone. Are you not alarmed? Think of M.
<pb id="wright54" n="54"/>
Pray keep out of his way! I wonder what his Quaker
progenitors would say, could they look out of their graves?
He has not an ancestor, on either side, for as far back as
they can be traced, who was not a broad brimmed
Quaker. Little F. has had some skirmishes with the girls on
Politics; but there has been no bloodshed; and the last I
heard of it is, they said ‘anyhow’ she was ‘a smart little
thing and talks very well.’ L. does not walk out alone: she
always goes into Boston with F. or me. By the way - I
hear it said they have got enough cotton at the North to
supply their factories for a year? Can it be true? If so, I
think there has been a great mistake somewhere The only
thing that will bring these people to their senses is to stop
the importation. I was surprised to see the other day that a
cargo of rice from Savannah was stopped, and the vessel
was allowed to sail with a load of cotton!”</p>

The President and his family will move next week to the

City Council has bought and put it at the disposal of the
Government. They have also given Mrs. Davis the use of a
nice carriage and horses and seem disposed to do all they
can to show their joy at the exchange from Montgomery.

we are at war, actually.</p>

sad sight to me, to see them drill and go through with their

unless you engage a carriage in the morning, it is very hard

        <div2 type="chapter 4" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <p>To show how the humorous side of life runs parallel
with its serious side I will relate a little incident. Col.
and Mrs. Bradley Johnson, of Maryland, were in
Richmond at that time eagerly engaged in equipping
a regiment of Marylanders for the field. Mrs. Johnson
was having the clothing made for the men.</p>
          <p>One day at the President's table, where she was
dining, she told the assembled company of a
<foreign lang="fr">contre-temps,</foreign> which had occurred, a real tragedy -
in view of the difficulties surrounding her enterprise.
<pb id="wright57" n="57"/>
The undergarments of the men, by some unfortunate
accident, inexplicable, and most deplorable, had all
been cut out for the same leg! The lady was in real
grief over the mishap, and, in spite of the ludicrousness
of the situation, the company were so in sympathy with
her trouble, that even the most frivolously inclined
forbore to smile - except Mrs. Davis, who could not
repress her mirth; but laughed long and unrestrainedly,
much to the discomfiture of Mrs. Johnson, to whom it
was no joking matter.</p>
          <p>At this time my parents began to feel great
anxiety at their separation from my sister and
myself; who were still at Longwood. near Boston.
They had been in correspondence for some time
with the relatives with whom we were staying;
but it was difficult to arrange matters, and in the
meanwhile all communication was rapidly being
closed between the North and South.</p>
          <p>I give below some extracts from letters written
by myself, a child of fourteen - dated:</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">

          <p>“ . . . Isn't the news from Sumter delightful. When
I read the account in a paper, I felt like crying
for joy. No one sympathizes with me here,
except Grandmama, and I feel like a stranger
in a foreign land.</p>
          <p>“Everybody here is groaning, and deploring the
<pb id="wright58" n="58"/>
taking of Sumter. Uncle B. says that Boston
was the scene of great excitement to-day, all the
military were getting ready and everyone is on the
lookout for war in earnest. . . .</p>
          <p>“I went into Boston to-day and you never saw such
confusion; the State House steps and grounds
were crowded with men, some to see, and some to
volunteer.</p>
          <p>“Grandmama had a letter from Mama, written in the
midst of the firing of the guns at Sumter. One of Uncle B.'s
last puns (you know how fond he is of making them) was
the following. ‘What does the man who robs and catches
the Governor of South Carolina get? Poor Pickings.’
(Governor Pickens.) I have just returned from seeing a
company of Zouaves drill, their manœuvres were
miserable (!) and if this is a specimen of Northern chivalry,
I don't think we have much to fear. Everybody here knows
who we are, and whenever I go out the people stare and
gaze at us. This evening I found little Fanny surrounded by
girls, who were questioning and teasing her. She seemed to
be perfectly able to maintain her position, and she said,
‘she gave them as good as they sent;’ they all
seemed quite
amused at he answers, and said they liked to hear her; she
talked so ‘funny.’ One of the girls soon after
came up to
where I stood and said she thought the girls ‘hadn't
ought
to tease Fanny.’ This is one of their common expressions,
and another is that they
<figure id="ill14" entity="wright58">
<p>MISS FANNY WIGFALL, OF TEXAS<lb/>(Mrs. B. Jones Taylor, of Baltimore)</p>
</figure>
<pb id="wright59" n="59"/>
‘admire’ to take a walk, or play on the piano. Grandmama
and I went into Boston the other day and to my joy I saw
a photo of President Davis in one of the windows. I
immediately purchased it. The Babcocks are coming to
take tea with us this evening, and I anticipate a good deal
of pleasure in seeing Emma. She is lovely as ever and I
am sure you would like her. We are fast friends and I made
her promise she would read Mr. Davis's message, and as
a reward I shall give her a very small piece of the flag
staff you sent me. She is a very sensible girl and in all our
discussions we never get the least excited or vexed. ‘Abe
Lincoln!’ is her hero, and ‘Jeff Davis’ is mine; but there is
one thing she never can explain, namely, <hi rend="italics">‘Abe's' flight
through Baltimore!</hi> But we agree in almost everything
else. She thinks Napoleon the greatest man that ever
lived, and so do I, and that is a never failing source of
conversation.</p>
          <p>“Mrs. Lincoln is now in Boston, and I suppose
the Republicans are all flocking to see her, and
she is asking them ‘How they flourish?’ Boston
is in a whirl of excitement; troops drilling and
volunteering all the time - the stores and houses
all decked with flags. . . . Dear Papa, won't you
send us each a small flag of South Carolina, and
the Confederate States? I am very anxious to see
them. Yesterday evening Aunt F. got an invitation
to attend a meeting of ladies to make shirts,
<pb id="wright60" n="60"/>
and sew for the different regiments; she, of course,
is not going. A poor set of creatures they must
be if they can't furnish their own shirts! . . . 
Uncle B. has just bought the <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi> announcing the
secession of Virginia. I feel as if I can't contain
myself I am so glad. Poor Uncle B. looks as if he had
taken a blue pill - he takes everything so to heart; it
is deplorable to see him. Aunt F. is in hopes that all
the States will now follow and that will be the means
of securing peace.”</p>
          <p>My father in the meantime had been conferring by
letter with Mr. William T. Walters, of Baltimore, as
to the best means of getting us through the lines.
The following letter was written by me to my
brother at the Military School of the University of
Virginia just about two weeks before we finally
succeeded in making the arrangements for our
departure.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <opener>
            <dateline>“July 15th, Longwood, near Boston.</dateline>
          </opener>
          <p>“. . . I received your last letter several days ago,
and I had a letter from Mama about the same
time, telling Grandmama to send us on by the
first good opportunity, but the way Mr. Walters
said was the only way we could go would not have
been safe, and I am now anxiously awaiting news
from Mama as to whether we shall go to Fortress
Monroe, and let Papa send a flag of truce, and get
us or not. My trunks were all packed ready to
start at a minute's notice, when we received Mr.
<pb id="wright61" n="61"/>
Walter's letter, telling us that the only way of
reaching Richmond was by going through
Winchester, to which you know the troops are
making a general movement.</p>
          <p>“You may imagine how I felt. When Mr. Walters
wrote the last time, all was different, and I fully
expected to go home. I had already pictured our
meeting. I almost felt your kiss and I heard Papa
calling us ‘his darlings’ and Mama's dear voice, and
in one moment all was gone, and I glanced out of my
window and instead of Richmond, I saw miserable
old Boston. I felt as if my heart would break.</p>
          <p>“You ask me in your last if I am not ‘isolated’
- that is exactly the word. With the exception
of Emma Babcock, and her family, there is not a
soul here that cares whether I go or stay, or that
I could call a friend; but if nobody likes me, there
is some satisfaction in knowing there is no love
lost. If I did not follow your injunction, and
never believe what I see in Republican journals I
should have an awful time of it; for they make out
the most desperate case. All the C. S. soldiers are
poor, half starved, naked, miserable wretches that
will run if you stick your finger at them; who are
all waiting for a chance to desert, etc., and become
loyal citizens to King Abraham, the First, and
prime minister, General Scott. The Southerners
are defeated in every engagement; all the killed
and wounded are on their side, and none are
<pb id="wright62" n="62"/>
injured on the other. Such is about the summary of
their statements - <hi rend="italics">
<foreign lang="fr">mais je ne le crois pas,</foreign>
</hi>
and so they don't
disturb my mind much. I saw that Papa had gone disguised
as a <hi rend="italics">cattle drover</hi> to Washington, to
pick up information
for the President! That is about a specimen of their stories.
Mama writes me in her last that you have joined the
Military School at the University of Virginia, and would
enter the army in three months, if you wished to, at the end
of that time. I suppose you are very glad. I don't wonder
and wish I could go too. I sit down to the piano every day
and play ‘Dixie’ and think of you all away in ‘the land ob
cotton,’ etc.”</p>

          <p>Finally the arrangements being all made we started off
on our adventures - being placed by my Uncle in charge of
a responsible gentleman, who was to take us to Baltimore,
and deliver us into the care of Mr. Walters.</p>
          <p>We were cautioned to be very quiet, to express
nothing at what we heard or saw, and to be as
unobtrusive as possible in our demeanor. I shall
never forget my emotions the day we started. In
the crown of my hat I had concealed a package
<pb id="wright64" n="64"/>
of letters to be delivered in Richmond, and my
importance in my own estimation was not a little
enhanced by the possession of this delightful secret.
We made the journey to Baltimore without mishap
or adventures of any kind - and when we reached the
station, and alighted from the car, I noticed a
gentleman eagerly scanning the passengers, as they
passed him. As we approached he came forward,
asked a question in an undertone, which was
answered with equal caution, and we were hurried
into a carriage, and driven rapidly to Mr. Walters'
house on Mt. Vernon place, where we were received
by Mr. and Mrs. Walters with the greatest cordiality
and affection. On refreshing ourselves after our
journey, we were taken in to dinner, where my eyes
fairly danced with delight at beholding in a wine
glass at each cover, a dear little Confederate flag;
placed there in honor of the two little guests. After
a short period our kind host and hostess bid us
goodbye, and we were again on our travels; it not
being deemed safe for us to remain in Baltimore.</p>
          <p>Mr. Walters' brother now took charge of us, and
we were rapidly driven six or seven miles in the
country, to a hotel called “Paradise,” near
Catonsville and a veritable “Paradise” it proved to
the two tired little children who were received with
open arms by the kind ladies at the hotel. There we
spent the night, and in the morning were again on
our travels.
<pb id="wright65" n="65"/>
On taking the train near the Relay House we
found on board a number of the members of the
Maryland Legislature, on their way to Frederick,
at which place the Governor had convened the
Legislature; Annapolis, the capital of the State,
being under the control of Federal troops. When
we reached the Point of Rocks, we left the train,
and had dinner at the country tavern, where we
sat at table with a number of Federal soldiers, our
appearance under such circumstances, exciting
no little interest and curiosity. Mr. Walters had
with him an “open sesame,” in the shape of a
pass from General Simon Cameron, Secretary of
War; and we were given every facility to proceed
on our journey. At a signal, which had of course
been pre-arranged, a boat put off from the Virginia
side, bearing a white flag of truce, and our
sensations may be imagined as we saw the little craft
approaching, which was to bear us over the swift,
beautiful river into the dear land of “Dixie.”
Our luggage being put on board we soon followed,
and were rowed across the river without mishap.
On reaching the shore we found a large comfortable
carriage and a pair of horses waiting for us,
and we were soon driving through a deep woods,
where the sweet air and refreshing shade were very
grateful after the glare, dust and heat of our journey.
It seemed like a story in fairyland, where the
magic of the good fairy, at every turn, provides
the thing most needed. Being furnished with
<pb id="wright66" n="66"/>
fresh horses, we travelled almost all night, stopping to rest
but a few hours; and then taking the train at Gordonsville,
arrived in Richmond in the afternoon. We drove at once to
the Spotswood Hotel to join my mother. Not knowing the
hour we would arrive, she had gone out to the Camp of the
1st Texas Regiment, which my father was commanding,
to witness the presentation by the President of a
beautiful Texas State Flag, which she had made for the
Regiment. Nothing must do but we must follow, as
soon as possible. When we reached the camp the
ceremony was over, and my father was reviewing his
Regiment.</p>
          <p>As the carriage stopped, word was carried forward
of our arrival - and we were immediately
surrounded by numbers of friends, eager to greet
the little travellers; and my father, hurriedly
dismounting from his horse, and leaving the regiment
in charge of another officer, rushed forward to
meet us! He returned with us to Richmond, and
there, as we reached the Spotswood, coming down
the stairs, we saw my mother; her beautiful face
lit up with joy, and her fair arms held out to welcome
us. She was clad, I remember, in a lilac-colored
gown, of some soft material, made in the fashion
of the day, with the long angel sleeves falling
away at the shoulder, while a filmy lace cape
covered her neck, leaving the throat bare. As I
remember her that day, I love best to think of her.
Then we were fêted and caressed to our
<pb id="wright67" n="67"/>
heart's content; took tea with the President and his
party that night, where our heads were completely
turned by the attentions shown us, and where
we gave, to an appreciative audience, a full
account of all our adventures “coming through
the lines” - and the one query from all our eager
auditors was, “What <hi rend="italics">do</hi> they think of the battle of
Manassas?”</p>

          <p>“I believe we are about to be attacked by the
enemy, who has been increasing his forces rapidly
in the last few days. He no doubt has at present
on this side of the Potomac at least 30,000 men -
and probably as many in or about Washington;
and I am informed on good authority, that he is
crossing over reinforcements in large numbers
<hi rend="italics">every night;</hi> so that very shortly we probably will
be attacked by about 40,000 men! What do you
suppose is my effective force to resist this attack?
About 15,000 effective men! How can it be
expected that I should be able to maintain my
ground, unless reinforced, and that immediately?
<pb id="wright72" n="72"/>
I am determined to give the enemy battle no matter
at what odds against us - but is it right and proper
to sacrifice so many valuable lives (and perhaps
our cause) without the least prospect of success?</p>
          <p>“I think not; but I hope that it will delay the
forward movement of the enemy, and give our
friends time to come to the rescue!</p>
          <p>“I have applied <hi rend="italics">two</hi> or <hi rend="italics">three</hi> times for the most
essential things required here. To obtain anything
with despatch, I have to send a special messenger
to Richmond. Is that the way to direct and control
the operations of an army in the field? Cannot
that evil be remedied? I am sure it could, if properly
represented to the President.</p>

          <p>“No news except that Gen. Johnston has joined

part are with him. The President went down
to-day, but I don't know exactly in what capacity,
whether he will command or not. . . . The troops
are pouring in, and a general battle at Manassas
is expected very soon. We brought up by one
train, upwards of 50 prisoners brought from
Winchester, and crowds gathered on the way,
at every roadside station, to see ‘the Yankees.’
I was almost sorry for them.”</p>
          <p>“9 o'clock. You will have heard that we have
gained a second victory, and a ‘glorious though

Manassas. Only some of the deaths are known
as yet; Lieut. Colonel Johnson of the Hampton

Wade Hampton slightly wounded. All Beauregard's
staff are safe. Poor Mrs. Bartow is here, but does
not yet know the sad tidings. The enemy they say

          <p>About August 10th, my father's command was
ordered to Manassas, and from there to Dumfries,
he having received in October his commission as
Brig. General - commanding the Texas Brigade.</p>
          <p>We joined him at Dumfries, a quaint little village
on the Occoquan river, and were there several
months.</p>
          <p>My father's headquarters were at the little
village tavern, where we spent some happy weeks,
going out every afternoon to see the dress parade
of the Regiments and wandering by the lovely
<figure id="ill15" entity="wright74">

</figure>
<pb id="wright75" n="75"/>
Occoquan river, where the big cannon guarded
the shores from the enemy's approach. Soon we
returned to Richmond.</p>
          <p>Congress was in session, and my father resigned
his command, shortly after this, to take his seat in
the Confederate Senate. I remember little of that
journey to Richmond, except the sweetness of the
woods through which we drove to the railroad, and
our calling a halt under a persimmon tree, which
hung heavy with luscious fruit, made delicious by
the severe frosts which had fallen. We gathered an
abundant supply, and drove on in the crisp air, which
we would have enjoyed more, had it not heralded the
approach of winter, and the rains and snows, which
we knew would bring hardships to our brave soldiers
in camp.</p>
          <p>The early enthusiasm of the first few months of
the war was now deepening into grim determination
at all hazards, and into a realization that war, with all
its accompanying horrors, was upon us. Provisions
increase in price, and the difficulty of obtaining
supplies of proper clothing, was already felt.</p>
          <p>The Army soon went into Winter Quarters, and
the letters from camp rejoiced the hearts of anxious
mothers with the accounts of the snug contrivances
for comfort. The luxury of sleeping on a board
floor was descanted on, and the possession of a
stove promised warmth and comfort in the long
winter days and nights of rain and snow, Richmond
<pb id="wright76" n="76"/>
was enlivened, from time to time, by the
furloughs granted to officers and men, and opened
her hospitable doors to cheer and brighten the hours
of their brief holiday.</p>
          <p>The President was inaugurated on February 22nd
and many of the officers had leave for a few days to
witness the ceremony, which made it a gay week in
Richmond.</p>
          <p>Many of the private houses received boarders, as
the reduction in the purchasing power of their
incomes, through the depreciation of the currency,
was already severely felt by the people. Yet this was
not done for the sake of profit alone. The enormous
influx of strangers from other states had to be
accommodated. These were brought here by the
presence of the Government, and the proximity of
the Army of Northern Virginia, which drew to
Richmond hosts of anxious relatives, who waited
through the weary weeks and months for occasional
tidings, and possible glimpses of their loved ones.</p>
          <p>Social pleasures, however, were not neglected
and music and song and the dance made merry the
hearts of the gallant soldier boys, who came from
the wet, and mud, and discomfort of the camp.</p>
          <p>Among the many lovely women in Richmond at
this time were the two Misses Cary, of Baltimore,
and their cousin, Miss Constance Cary, of Virginia.
The former two had come across the lines after
experiencing many thrilling adventures on the
<figure id="ill16" entity="wright76">
<p>MISS MARY HAXALL, OF VIRGINIA<lb/>(Mrs. Alexander Cameron, of Richmond)<lb/>(This and the following are portraits of schoolmates of the author)</p>

<pb id="wright77" n="77"/>
way. In a letter written at the time I find the
following: “The young ladies who seem to be the
greatest belles are the Miss Carys, of Baltimore
. . . They are very beautiful and are commonly
known by the name of the ‘Cary Invincibles.’ ”</p>
          <p>Constance Cary was also a very lovely girl, and
even in those days was noted for a facile pen, which
from time to time delighted her many friends with
charming little productions. Miss Cary, as is well
known, married Mr. Burton Harrison, President
Davis's private secretary, and has since attained
widespread note from the clever fictions of which
she is the author.</p>
          <p>In the meantime, my sister and myself had been
entered at Miss Pegram's on Franklin, Street,
which was then the fashionable school in
Richmond. With all the distractions of the time
it was hard work to keep the girls at their books.
It was difficult to fasten one's attention on ancient
history and <foreign lang="fr">
<hi rend="italics">“belles lettres,”</hi>
</foreign> when such very modern
history was being made in our midst, and such
<foreign lang="fr">
<hi rend="italics">“beaux soldats”</hi>
</foreign> were marching, with drums beating,
and banners flying, by our very doors. Richmond
has always been famed for its lovely women, but
I venture to assert that there has never been a larger
assembly of beauties than that collected at Miss
Pegram's School during the war.</p>
          <p>Early in the spring, rumors were rife in Richmond
of the approach of McClellan's army and in May
the great battle of Seven Pines was fought,
<pb id="wright78" n="78"/>
when General Joseph E. Johnston was wounded,
and after which General Lee was placed in command
of the Army of Northern Virginia.</p>
          <p>There were four brilliant young soldiers in that
great army who especially held the love and
admiration of the people - Turner Ashby,
commanding General Stonewall Jackson's Cavalry;
William Pegram, the “Boy Artillerist”; John
Pelham, commanding Stuart's Horse Artillery, the
“Gallant Pelham,” as General Lee called him; and
William Latané. Each in turn was to immortalize
his name and glorify the good cause for which he
fought, and each in turn, amid the din of battle and
the shouts of victory, was to give his life for his
country.</p>
          <p>William Latané lost his life, June 13, 1862,
“leading his squadron in a brilliant and successful
charge, the enemy routed and flying before him”
- so writes General J. E. B. Stuart in his order,
and adds “his regiment will want no better battle
cry, than ‘Avenge Latané.’ ”
General Robert E.
Lee announces the victory with “the loss of but
one man, the lamented Captain Latané.” The
following account of the burial and the peculiar
circumstances surrounding it, were given to me
by a member of the family and is repeated here
almost <hi rend="italics">verbatim</hi>.
“John Latané, a Lieutenant in
his brother's company, took charge of the body
and with a cart and driver tried to return to Richmond.
Finding this impossible, as the enemy were
<figure id="ill17" entity="wright78">
<p>MISS MARY TRIPLETT, OF VIRGINIA<lb/>(Mrs. Philip Haxall, of Richmond)</p>
</figure>
<pb id="wright79" n="79"/>
in the possession of the country all around - he
went to ‘Westwood,’ the home of Dr. Brokenbrough,
who was then a surgeon in the Army. The enemy
approached and he, to avoid capture, was obliged
to leave his brother's remains and escape on foot.”</p>
          <p>Then followed the scene “portrayed by Washington's
brush and Thompson's pen” - and also described in
a private letter, which, after the war, was published
in<hi rend="italics"> Blackwood's Magazine</hi> and is now given here.</p>
          <p>“Mrs. Brokenbrough sent for an Episcopal
clergyman to perform the funeral ceremonies, but
the enemy would not permit him to pass. Then with
a few other ladies, a fair haired little girl, her apron
filled with white flowers, and a few faithful slaves
who stood reverently near, a pious Virginia matron
read the solemn and beautiful burial service over the
cold, still form of one of the noblest gentlemen and
most intrepid officers in the Confederate Army. She
watched the clods heaped upon the coffin lid; then
sinking on her knees, in sight and hearing of the foe,
she committed his soul's welfare and the stricken
hearts he had left behind him to the mercy of the
All-Father.”</p>
          <p>John R. Thompson writes in the closing stanza of
his poem:</p>
          <lg type="verse" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
            <l part="N">“And when Virginia, leaning on her spear,</l>

stopped at Genl. Johnston's to see how he was,
and Mrs. Johnston came out and sat in the carriage
with me. He is recovering rapidly, but will not be
in the fight, which has in fact, begun. There has
been very heavy firing all the afternoon, and there
will be a regular attack made at daybreak to-morrow,
if the present plan is followed out. I presume it will
be, as Genl. Jackson is to move into position to-night,
and of course, has to be supported. This was agreed
upon last night. What has caused the fight this
afternoon we do not know - but I trust it is all right.
Jackson and his forces are to make the attack on the
rear, and I trust it has all been so planned that

        <p>THE autumn opened with dispiriting news from
the West. Beauregard had been superseded and
rumors were rife that a demand had been made
on the administration for the removal of General
Bragg. While we did not know certainly that
this was a fact, there was no question but that
dissatisfaction was felt in many quarters with
President Davis's policy and conduct of affairs,
my father's intimacy with him began to decrease,
and strained relations to take the place of their
former friendship. Notes asking for consultations
to discuss pressing matters which formerly
began “Dear Wigfall” - as the time ran on into
the autumn were commenced “My dear Sir.”</p>

          <p>“It has been suggested to me that you thought
Holmes had failed in his duty at Malvern Hill, by
being too slow in getting into position, and in
that connection I wish to say to you that he was
ordered up from his position on the South side of
James River to aid in the attack upon McClellan's
Army and if possible to prevent it from reaching
the James River. It being then supposed that the
enemy would endeavor to reach a landing some
distance above Curl's Neck. He moved down the
River Road, taking Gen. Wise and his brigade with
him, to the position indicated, where I found him
on Monday morning, most advantageously posted.
He had made a thorough <sic>reconnoissance</sic> and fully
explained to me his position and plan of operations.
He was then about a mile to the right of the place
where I found you with Gen. Longstreet's staff and
where I met Genl. Lee. Genl. Lee had ascertained
that the enemy was taking a different route by
what was known as the Quaker Road and he
ordered Genl. Holmes to advance and take position
on that road to intercept the enemy's retreat. He did
so promptly, and waited at the place indicated with
his infantry for the approach of the enemy. They
did not come, but halted and offered battle before
reaching Poindexter's farm. Genl. Holmes
<pb id="wright89" n="89"/>
thus fulfilled all his orders and proved as well his
gallantry, as his candor, by subsequently expressing
his regret that no one knew enough of the ground
to have indicated to him what afterward was found
to have been feasible, to wit, an attack upon the
enemy's left and rear. It may be that such remarks
have led you to suppose that he was directed to do
something which he failed to perform. If so, I am
sure that your fairness needs only to have the
facts distinctly pointed out to you. Genl. Lee
reconnoitred the ground as far as he was able and I
did the same thing in person - whilst Genl. Holmes
was in position and under a heavy fire from the
enemy's gunboats. Genl. Lee certainly attributed no
shortcoming to Genl. Holmes and it never occurred
to me that any blame was fairly to be attached to
him. I write this in justice to the individual but am
urged much more by the consciousness of his
peculiar fitness for the command to which he has
been assigned.</p>

          <p>October found us delightfully situated in a comfortable
house on Grace Street. General and Mrs. Joseph E.
Johnston, ourselves, and Major Banks, composed our
“Mess.” The house stood back from the street with a
large garden in front, now, in the fall, fragrant with the
aromatic scent of that sweetest of all flowers, the white
chrysanthemum, which grew in great profusion in the
old-fashioned borders. General Johnston was still
suffering from his wound and too unwell to report for
duty for some weeks. One great trouble in Richmond
during the winter of '62 was the want of fuel, and
prices began to mount up fabulously, and the suffering
among the poor was great. Our men in the field, too,
began to feel the difficulty of getting warm overcoats
and proper clothing.</p>
          <p>The snow began as early as November 9th. I say in

There have been several distinguished
<pb id="wright92" n="92"/>
visitors at our house last week - viz., Prince
Polignac; an M. P.; and our Bishop General Polk.
Yesterday Major Daniel (Examiner) and Col.
Myers dined here. Mrs. Elzey and the General
were here evening before last: he is to have
another operation performed on his jaw, poor
fellow, and he looks miserably.”</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <p>It was now a frequent occurrence for foreigners
of distinction to come to the Confederacy and in
many instances to enter the army and fight valiantly
for the cause. Prince Polignac was a typical
Frenchman in appearance; a fiery little man; erect
in figure with a keen black eye, white teeth that
showed brilliantly when he smiled, and a dark
waxed mustache which lent a fierceness to his
expression that I remember impressed me very
much. He offered his services to the Government,
and was given the command of a brigade of
Texans in the Western Army. And just here
comes an anecdote which I cannot forbear
telling, as an illustration of American humor
in general, and Texas wit in particular.</p>
          <p>It needs little reflection to see how the peculiar
name of <hi rend="italics">Polignac</hi> would strike the ear of the
irreverent Texan, with the evident possibility, not to
say necessity, of ludicrous transposition. And it is
equally evident that the name, at once suggesting
itself as appropriate, was that of the little animal
which bears such a malodorous reputation.</p>
          <pb id="wright93" n="93"/>
          <p>Probably, most of these Texan soldiers had never
seen a Frenchman before; they had never tested
Prince Polignac's prowess. He was certainly, both in
appearance and manners, unlike any of the Rangers,
whom it had been their happy fate to follow in other
battles, and as they glanced at the dapper little
Frenchman, they shook their heads ominously, and
with derisive laughter dubbed him “Polecat!” It was
impossible that such a <foreign lang="fr">soubriquet</foreign> should have been
given and uttered frequently, secure in the Prince's
ignorance of the vocabulary, without his curiosity
being aroused, and questions following which finally
discovered to him the play upon his name, and the
meaning of the word. He maintained a discreet
silence, and never revealed his knowledge, nor his
indignation, until one day - when the brigade being
ordered into battle he had his revenge. As the order
was given to charge, he raised himself in his stirrups
and brandishing his sword aloft he led his men in
person, shouting at the top of his voice, “Follow
me! Follow me! You call me ‘Polecat,’ I will show
you whether I am ‘Polecat ’ or ‘Polignac!’” And he
did. With an answering shout they followed him, and
that battle over, never had a word of ridicule more
for the gallant little Frenchman, who led them on to
victory.</p>
          <p>I cannot refrain here from paying a tribute to
the Texas troops by giving a letter written to my
father by General Robert E. Lee in praise of them.</p>

twelve last night, having been delayed by three

railroad accidents. A telegram from the Ad. Genl. urges
me, in the name of the President, to reinforce Pemberton,
who ‘has fallen back from his positions by advance of very
superior force of the enemy’ with ‘a sufficient force of
Genl. Bragg's command.’ ‘Genl. Holmes has been
peremptorily ordered to reinforce him - but his troops may
be too late,’ I am told. Genl. Pemberton in falling back,
moves towards Vicksburg, where Holmes must cross the
river - every step he makes, therefore, brings him nearer to
his reinforcements. But as this march is in a direction
exactly away from Bragg, and the enemy's army is
between, every day's march makes a junction of the latter
with Pemberton more difficult. I proposed the order to
Holmes more than two weeks ago. Had it been given then,
his troops would now be near Vicksburg, and we should
be secure of our possession of the Mississippi. As matters
now are, the enemy being between our armies, and
probably superior to any one of them, their junction must
be difficult - impossible, if his troops are well directed. I
have not had time yet to learn if the movement of Bragg's
troops is practicable, and if so, what time will be necessary
for it, nor what Pemberton's force is, nor that of the
enemy - nor where he is - nor in what direction he
proposes to move. Under such circumstances a much wiser
man, than any I know, might fail to plan wisely. The thing to
be done is to urge

Holmes to expedition. Do tell the Secretary of War
to do so.</p>

obstacle the Tennessee is. Nor that Vicksburg at
least, will secure Holmes's junction.</p>

unfavorable circumstances. If Rosecranz had
disposed our troops himself, their disposition could

          <p>“I have just received a letter from Genl. Johnston
which causes gloomy forebodings as to our future in
the West. Pemberton, he says, has fallen back before
a superior force and he, Johnston, is ordered to
reinforce him with troops from Bragg's command.
Consider the position of their different armies. As
Pemberton falls back he will be each day one march
further from Bragg. Grant is between them, with, I
suppose, a superior force to either. If he falls upon
either before their junction, may he not destroy him
and then turn upon the other? When Bragg crosses
the Tennessee river Grant may turn upon him at any
moment. How long will it take to cross the
Tennessee without Birago trestles or pontoon boats?
Before his raid into Kentucky, Bragg was some two
or three weeks in effecting a crossing. Holmes,
Johnston writes me, has been ordered to reinforce
Pemberton, but he does not say with what force. In
that movement, it seems to me, lies our only hope of
safety. Let me beg you will urge upon Holmes the
utmost energy and promptness in his movements. I
trust that his whole force has been ordered across.
Vicksburg should be the objective point in this
campaign. That being safe, as I think it would be,
upon the junction of Pemberton and Holmes, the
destruction of Grant's Army should be our next
<pb id="wright102" n="102"/>
object. Political considerations should weigh
nothing in the movement of troops. A distinguished
writer upon the art of war, says, that political
objective points, if adopted during a campaign, must
be in accordance with the principles of strategy, and
that when that is not possible, then they should be
adjourned till after a decisive victory. When Oldham
and Bob. Johnston were badgering me for not
joining them in insisting that all the troops from the
other side of the river should be returned, I told
them that if I had control of the army every soldier
from Arkansas and Texas should be brought at once
to this side so that Bragg might at once crush Buel.
The debate was published and I have to see the first
man from Texas who does not approve my course. I
mention this to show, that those who oppose the
concentration of our troops, be it on one side, or
the other, of the river, on political grounds, are
mistaken as to public opinion. Our people are full of
good sense and patriotism, and they will not refuse
the means necessary to secure success. Let us save
Vicksburg and then crush Rosecranz and then I am

side of the river the enemy appears, he should
be met with our whole force, and crushed. If he
appears on both sides, concentrate on one, and crush
him there, and then cross and crush him again. I trust
that the last battle has been fought by us with
inferior numbers. Whenever the enemy divides,
concentrate and crush; and then ‘follow up the hand,’
as at ten pins when you make a ten strike. I am
induced to write you more fully on this subject from
a conversation I had with Boteler during my last visit
to Richmond in which he was urging the propriety of
giving Jackson a separate command. The entire army
of Virginia should continue under Lee. I write you

          <p>“On my return from Murfreesboro' a day or two
ago I had the pleasure to find your letter, and the
President. The latter is on a military tour, and has
taken immediate command in this country. Unless
he is greatly mistaken Mr. Seddon has not carried
our point and reinforced Pemberton with Holmes's
troops. On the contrary he says that H. has not had
<hi rend="italics">orders</hi> on the subject - requests or suggestions
instead - which he thinks himself unable to comply
with and therefore will not comply with. Pemberton
must be reinforced.
<pb id="wright105" n="105"/>
I have no other resource than the troops on this
front, and must draw upon them. This has blown
away some tall castles in the air. I have been
dreaming of crushing Grant with Holmes's and
Pemberton's troops, sending the former into
Missouri, and with the latter, Bragg and Kirby
Smith, marching to the Ohio. Our troops beyond the
Mississippi seem to be living in great tranquility.</p>
          <p>“Bragg's troops are in fine condition. Healthy
looking and well clothed. In fine spirits too. I see
no evidence of the want of confidence and
dissatisfaction of which we heard so much in
Richmond.</p>
          <p>“A great mistake has been made in the
arrangement of my command. Mississippi and
Arkansas should have been united to form it. Not
this state and Mississippi, which are divided by (to
us) an impassable river and impracticable country.
The troops in Middle Tennessee could reach
Fredericksburg much sooner than Mississippi. Then
Genl. Holmes's communications depend upon our
possession of the Mississippi. It is certainly his
business to at least assist in the maintenance of his
communications. The troops in Arkansas, as having
a common object, could be naturally united.</p>
          <p>“You perhaps see no special object on my part in
troubling you with this, and in truth I have no other

has a head to comprehend grand war, and a heart to

About 9,000 men are ordered from Bragg's - and  I
hope to bring back a great many stragglers who are

opinion I expressed to the President here that this
command of mine is a nominal one, imposing upon
me responsibilities which I cannot possibly meet. It
is not a unit; the armies of Bragg and Pendleton have
different objects. They can't be united without
abandoning one of them. I can have no command
when they are not united except by taking the place
of Bragg or Pemberton, which could not have been
intended. As it would work great injustice to the
officer thus superseded, without probabilities of
benefit. I cannot, from an intermediate point, direct
the operations of the two armies. No man could do
it well; these departments are too completely
separated to form one proper command - they ought
to be separated. Tell Mr. Seddon so. Had I been in
Tennessee I could have done nothing except by
depriving Bragg of his command. Here in the recent
<pb id="wright108" n="108"/>

Pemberton. I have asked the President to take me
out of a position so little to my taste. It is very like

          <p>LIGHT-HEARTED BOYISH LETTERS FROM CAMP - SCHOOLGIRL
FROLICS - A SOUTHERN BARBARA FRIETCHIE - CHATTANOOGA
- ANECDOTE OF “STONEWALL” JACKSON - FAMILY LETTERS
TO AND FROM RICHMOND.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>IN reading over the letters written at this period (the Winter
of '62-'63), the thing that strikes me is the tone of
cheerfulness and hope that runs through all of them. It had
not dawned yet on the minds of anyone that success was not
assured. Jackson was the idol of the people and everything
was anticipated of him when the spring campaign should
open. The confidence in Lee was absolute; and no one
doubted that he would carry all before him. The fact that
provisions were scarce; that prices were phenomenally high;
that the purchasing power of our currency was depreciating
daily; seemed to make no impression on the temper or spirits
of the people. At this time it was frequent for individuals to
run the blockade, or come through the lines, and their advent
was hailed with delight by their friends to whom they
brought welcome presents in the shape of <hi rend="italics">shoes,</hi> and other
necessities, which it was difficult to procure in Richmond.</p>
        <pb id="wright112" n="112"/>
        <p>The Virginia housekeeper, famed for her hospitality and
good living, had hard work to produce a tempting menu for
her guests. It would have been droll (had the cause not
been so tragic) to note the stress laid upon a fair supper, on
the rare occasions when it was forthcoming. For they still
had “parties,” as they were called, and if, by good fortune,
ice cream and cake and “real” coffee appeared, the
delightful fact is duly recorded.</p>
        <p>The letters from camp were cheering - no complaining
at hardships. Men reared in luxury who had worn
“purple and fine linen” all their lives, were the best
soldiers in the field and the most cheerful bearers of the
burden of camp life, and of the terrible marches through the
scorching suns of summer, and through the winter's wind
and rain. And the poor boys, many of them little more than
children, who had come from the far south, sickened and
died of homesickness and disease, in camp and
hospital - yet we find no record of complaint or of desire
expressed to give up the fight. Some of the letters from
camp at this time give the spirit of the men in the war. My
brother, a boy of eighteen, writes the following boyish
nonsense from</p>

          <p>“. . . My home is in a wild pine grove and
sweetest melancholy, poesy's child, keeps watch and
ward over my innocent spirit. I sit on my bench and muse
on the time when the Yank-Yanks shall meet me in battle
array and when, ‘Virginia leaning on her spear,’ I shall retire
on my laurels with one arm and no legs to some secluded
dell to sigh away my few remaining years in blissful
ignorance. But a truce to such deep Philosophy. We are all
jogging along as usual. All the day I long for night, and all
the night I long for its continuance. In fact it is very
disagreeable to get up to attend Reveillé roll-call, as I do
every fourth morning, and it is vastly more pleasant to
remain in my comfortable (?) bed and have no other care
upon my mind than that of keeping warm with the least
exertion possible. But then comes that inevitable too-diddle-
tooty, too-diddle-tooty, &amp;c., &amp;c., &amp;c., and up I have to
jump and go out in the cold to hear that Von Spreckelson
and Bullwinkle are absent and look at the exciting process
of dealing out corn
<pb id="wright115" n="115"/>
in a tin cup. . . . The snowing began before daylight
yesterday morning and kept it up with scarcely an interval
until late last night. It fell to a depth of about nine inches.
This morning, the 1st, 4th, and 5th Texas Regiments came
by our camp, marching in irregular line of battle, with their
colors gotten up for the occasion, and with skirmishers
thrown out in advance, and passing us, attacked the camp
of the 3rd Arkansas, which is immediately on our right. A
fierce contest ensued, snow balls being the weapons. The
Texans steadily advanced, passing up the right of the camp;
the Arkansians stubbornly disputing their progress, and
their shouts and cheers as they would make a charge, or as
the fight would become unusually desperate, made the
welkin ring. A truce was finally declared and all four
regiments marched over the creek to attack Anderson's
brigade. After crossing they formed in line, deployed their
skirmishers, and at it they went. The Georgians got rather
the best of the fight and drove them back to the creek,
where they made a stand and fought for some time. They
then united and started back across the Massoponax for
Genl. Law's brigade. Just before arriving opposite our
camp they saw another brigade coming over the top of the
hill behind their camp (i. e., Anderson's) and back they
went to meet them. How that fight terminated I don't know.
. . . I suppose this rain and snow will retard the movements
<pb id="wright116" n="116"/>
of the enemy too much for them to attempt to cross
for some time to come. . . . Yesterday and to-day have
been lovely days and I trust that the weather will clear up
and continue so. I expect Burnside feels very grateful for
the interposition of the elements to give him an excuse
for deferring a little longer the evil day on which he is
forced to attack us or be decapitated. . . . I saw in my
ride the other day a body of Yankees, apparently a
Regiment, drawn up in line, firing. They were using blank
cartridges I suppose. This looks as though they had some
very fresh troops. If that is the case they had better keep
them out of the fight, as they will do precious little good in
it. . . . </p>
          <p>“Christmas eve we went to see the Hood's Minstrels
perform. One of the best performances was ‘We are a
band of brothers’ sung by three make-believe darkies,
dressed entirely in black, with tall black hats and crêpe
hatbands, looking more like a deputation from a corps of
undertakers than anything else - and was intended, I
suppose, as a burlesque upon Puritanism. At all events it
was supremely ridiculous. . . . I understand that several of
the tailors in Charleston have committed suicide lately,
driven to it by the ruinously low rates at which their wares
(no pun intended) are now selling. They can only obtain
two hundred and fifty dollars for a second lieutenant's
uniform coat and pantaloons. Poor wretches!
<pb id="wright117" n="117"/>
They should bear their burdens with more patience,
however, and remember that (according to the
newspaper) the hardships of this war fall on all
alike and must be endured by high and low, rich
and poor, equally. I saw Col. Jenifer who told
me he had met Papa and Mama at a party at
Col. Ives's in the city of Richmond. Isn't that
dissipation for you? Do they have cake ‘and sich’
at parties now, or is it merely ‘a feast of reason
and a flow of soul?’ And in conclusion tell me of
my <hi rend="italics">overcoat.</hi> Have you seen it? If not, has anybody
else seen it? If not, how long will it be, in all
human probability, and speaking well within
the mark, before somebody else will see it?. . . 
My old one has carried me through two winters
and is now finishing the third in a sadly dilapidated
condition. There is a sort of ‘golden halo, hovering
round decay,’ about it, which may perhaps be
very poetical, but is far from being practical as
regards its weather resisting qualities. . . . ”</p>

          <p>In this spirit of lightheartedness wrote the soldier boys
from their camps in the mud and rain and discomfort of
every kind. In Richmond too the young people managed
to make merry, as young people will, under adverse
circumstances. The girls made the best show possible
with their meagre wardrobes - and fortunate were the
extravagant ones of other days who had a multiplicity
of garments, from which to levy supplies,
<pb id="wright118" n="118"/>
to cut and make over to suit the fashion of the day.
On Franklin Street, on any fine afternoon during
the winter, it was a lovely sight to watch the
promenaders going up and down. The officers,
on leave for a few days, made the best of their
holiday, and the pretty girls were decked out in
the best finery they could muster. The sun shone
and hearts were light and the shadow of Appomattox
was still so far away that not even the cloud as
big as a man's hand had showed itself. The school
girls too, in spite of the troublous times, found
many ways to amuse themselves. One day,
when the snow lay thick on the ground, we
were all at luncheon, when we heard a great
shouting in the street, and with one accord rushed
to the windows to see the cause. We found a
regiment marching by, on their way through
town, to the railway station. They were footsore
and weary, ill clad and worse shod; but the
flag was flying and they held their heads up and
stepped out bravely, as the bevy of girls appeared
on the doorsteps and greeted us with a great shout.
We rushed in again and came out speedily, with
our hands and aprons full of bread, and everything
portable from the table. There was a halt, and we
ran out in the street and passed on our refreshments
from man to man. They laughed in great glee
and cheered and shouted - and then such a
frolic ensued, for one of the mischievous girls
threw a snowball in their midst! This was “a
<figure id="ill23" entity="wright119">
<p>MISS HETTY CARY, OF BALTIMORE</p>
</figure>
<pb id="wright119" n="119"/>
dare” and they took it! All discipline was at an end
and the snowballs flew thick and fast - as they filed
past us on their journey, alas! to battlefields from
which many, indeed, most of them, would return no
more. We went hungry till supper time; but were so
glad to have cheered them on their weary way. One
of the interesting incidents that occurred at this
time was the arrival of Miss Hetty Cary from
Baltimore. She had just been released from Fort
McHenry, where she had been imprisoned for
wearing a white apron with red ribbons, the
Confederate colors! I remember seeing her at a
dance at Mrs. Pegram's which is thus described in a
school girl's letter.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <p>“We had a glorious time - plenty of ice cream,
cake and officers; the latter predominating. When
the evening was a little advanced we were honored
by the presence of the beautiful Miss Hetty Cary
and we danced until nearly 3 o'clock.” Of all the
women I have ever met I think she was the most
beautiful - and combined with great loveliness of
person, a brilliancy of wit, which made her
remarkable. At this time, having just come through
the lines, she was dressed in the last mode, and
shone resplendent in an exquisite violet moiré with
pink roses in her hair. This last was Titian tinted and
rippled back from her fair low forehead. Her
complexion was lilies and roses; and her figure
magnificent. She was indeed a beauty. It is told of
Miss Hetty
<pb id="wright120" n="120"/>
Cary that, on one occasion, when Federal troops
were passing through Baltimore, she stood at an
open window of her home and waved a Confederate
flag. One of the officers of a regiment passing
below noticed the demonstration and calling it to the
attention of the Colonel asked: “Shall I have her
arrested?” The Colonel, glancing up and catching a
glimpse of the vision of defiant loveliness, answered
emphatically: “No: she is beautiful enough to do as
she - pleases.”</p>

          <p>“I have asked the government by telegraph if any
additional troops, new or old, can be furnished for
Bragg's Army, but have had no reply. Will you
suggest to Mr. Seddon that we are in a very critical
condition in Tennessee? The enemy has fully
supplied his losses, I am officially informed, while
our army has received stragglers and exchanged
prisoners amounting to about a third of our killed
and wounded. Such being the case, if there is any
truth in arithmetic, another battle must drive us still
farther back. If driven across the Cumberland
Mountains we can not hold East Tennessee and once
in possession of that country Rosecranz may choose
his point on our South Eastern or Eastern frontier
from Richmond to Mobile. It is of the utmost
importance therefore to reinforce Bragg. The
conscription is operating very slowly. Can no mode
of expediting its enforcement be adopted? I cannot
draw upon Pemberton, for his force is far too small
now. I proposed the bringing to him 18,000 or
20,000 troops from Arkansas, none of whom ever
came. The enemy is again at Vicksburg, too, in
heavier force, and doubtless with a different
plan - probably to attempt to attack from below
instead of from the Yazoo.</p>
          <p>“Bragg has done wonders, I think - no body of
troops has done more in proportion to numbers
<pb id="wright122" n="122"/>
in the same time. At Murfreesboro' he killed,
wounded and took 17,000 and within the three weeks
preceding 7,500. His own loss in all that time about
9,000. My own official position does not improve on
acquaintance. It is little, if any, better than being laid
on the shelf. I have endeavored to explain this to the
President, but he thinks it essential to have one here
who can transfer troops from this department to
Pemberton's and vice-versa. That would be extremely
well if either department could possibly spare
troops, even for a short time, but that is not the case,
each having too few for immediate purposes and the
distance and character of the intermediate country
such as completely prevents them from aiding each
other, except an occasional cavalry movement. It is
an attempt to join things which cannot be united. It
would require at least a month to send 10,00 men from
one of the two armies to the other. Each department
having its own commander and requiring - indeed
having room but for one. You perceive how little
occupation I can find. I can not unite the two
armies - because they are too far apart, and each
is required where it is. Nor can I take command of
one because each has its proper commander, and yet
the country may hold me responsible for any failure
between North Carolina and Georgia and the
Mississippi, for I am supposed to be commanding in
all that country. After commanding
<pb id="wright123" n="123"/>
our most important, and I may add, best army for a
year, it is hard to lose that command for wounds in
battle and to receive a nominal one. I must confess I
cannot help repining at this position. The President,
however, evidently intends that I shall hold a high
position and important one; but I think he mistakes
the relation between Tennessee and Mississippi.</p>

          <p>“I have several times taken the liberty of asking
you by telegraph to try to get R. A. Howard made
Brig. Genl., Schleicher made a Capt. of Engineers
and the McLean, of Bull Run, in whom you and
Mr. Clay were so much interested, put into the
<pb id="wright124" n="124"/>
Qr. Mrs. dept. As these things were all for the
benefit of the military service, in which you take
as much interest as any soldier or citizen of the
Confederacy, it is unnecessary for me to apologize.
Let me now ask you to consider the services of the
Army of Tennessee. Our principal officers and the
most intelligent of our friends in Nashville estimate
the loss of the enemy in the battle of Murfreesboro'
at not less than 20,000 - the force which inflicted
that loss could not have been much more than 30,000.
More effective fighting is not to be found in the
history of modern battles. The enemy fell back to a
very strong position, where he received
reinforcements, on account of which our army
abandoned the ground; the general being urged to do
so by those under him of high rank. This Army of
Tennessee has had a hard time of it and a thankless
one. My object now is to persuade that in the
neighborhood of Murfreesboro' it was well
commanded and fought most gallantly, inflicting
upon the enemy more harm in proportion to its
members, if my memory is not at fault, than any
army of modern times. So if you thank any troops
for fighting well, these, it seems to me, should be
included. I desired Gen. Harris, of Missouri, to say
so to you. I am especially interested in this matter
because the thanks of Congress would have a good
effect upon the troops who feel that others have
received the compliment for far less marching and
fighting. Bragg has
<pb id="wright125" n="125"/>
commanded admirably in Tennessee and made the
best use of his troops of all arms.</p>
          <p>“I have been very busy for some time looking for
something to do - to little purpose, but with much
travelling. Each of the three departments assigned to
me has its general and as there is no room for two,
and I can't remove him appointed by the Prest. for
the precise place, nothing but the post of Inspector
General is left to me. I wrote to the President on the
subject - trying to explain that I am virtually laid
upon the shelf with the responsibility of command,
but he has not replied, perhaps because he has no
better place for me. I should much prefer the
<hi rend="italics">command</hi> of fifty men.</p>

          <p>As I sit and think of the many memories that mark
the passage of those wonderful four years some
seem to stand out in bold relief and arrest the mind.
Far down the street one day in the early spring we
heard the tramp, tramp, of many feet and the
unearthly, mournful sound of the dead march. We
knew what it was. They were bearing to his last
resting place the “gallant Pelham,” the young
Alabama hero, who had commanded Stuart's Horse
Artillery and laid down his life at Kellysville on
March 17th, in the first great Cavalry battle of the
war. We watched the sad procession file past the
door and the music
<pb id="wright126" n="126"/>
floated to our ears like the wail of a human voice. We
wept in sympathy - for one so brave, so young, so
fair. Such scenes were now frequent and we were
soon called upon to bear the heaviest grief yet laid
upon the people, who were to be whelmed in sorrow
before the end should come.</p>

hearing the death of our hero Jackson! In addition to
our own irreparable loss, it will put new life and
courage into our cruel foe. It will cause mourning
all over our land and each person seems to feel as if
he had lost a relative. I feel more disheartened about
the war now than I have ever felt before. It seems to
me, it is to be interminable, and what a wretched life
of anxiety it is to look forward to! I suppose the
death of Jackson has affected us all and I can't help
thinking it will put new life into the enemy and give him
courage to make another attempt very soon. You see
by the papers they claim having taken almost as
many prisoners as we have and I am sure the loss of
Jackson has turned the last fight into a calamity, if
not a curse. I expect you will think I am really
blue - but you know Jackson has been my hero and
favorite for a long time. We must, though, hope on,

          <p>“Our Battalion was in winter quarters and
stationed at Genl. Jackson's Headquarters a few
months before the battle of Chancellorsville -
a short time before his death. It was Genl. Jackson's
custom every afternoon to have a meeting for
prayer, in a large tent. He sent over an invitation to
the members of our Battalion to be present, saying
he would like very much to have us come. One
afternoon I went over to the prayer meeting tent and
as I approached nearer I heard some one praying
aloud - in earnest supplication - and the words of
the petition, in their beautiful simplicity were like
those of a little child. I did not know at first who it
was. When the prayer was ended I perceived it was
Genl.
<pb id="wright128" n="128"/>
Jackson. After the prayer there was a pause and Dr. Lacy,
his Chaplain, told him that the young men present would
like to hear a few words from him. But his modesty was
such that he could not be induced to speak a word. I was
deeply impressed by the simple childlike faith of this great
soldier - to save whom any man among us would have
died.”</p>

          <p>At this time thousands of Federal prisoners were taken
through Richmond. An extract from a letter says, “They
formed a perfect army and as they marched in the middle
of the street one could scarcely realize they were actually
prisoners, if it had not been that their arms had been taken
from them, and that they were guarded on each side by our
men, who you may be sure looked proud enough as they
escorted them.”</p>

board in private houses with poor fare was $240 a month, so
all persons not obliged to be on the spot were leaving for

        <p>IT IS curious to note how youth will extract gayety

recorded in letters at this time, in spite of the
gnawing anxieties which were weighing down the
hearts of all serious people, that sundry delightful
parties were organized to partake of strawberries
and ice cream at “Pizzini's,” the famous
confectioners of the day in Richmond. Expeditions
were planned to Drewry's Bluff with a band of music
in attendance, and, of course, with the usual
accompaniment of the delightful officer, who,
equally, of course, was either halt, lame or blind, as
all whole men were at their posts in the field in
June, 1863. Serenades, too, were in order, and I find
that on our return from one of the aforesaid
strawberry feasts, about twelve o'clock on the same
night Ella - had a charming serenade of a <hi rend="italics">full brass
band </hi>from one of her

admirers. This combination of serenade, with strawberries
and ice cream, seemed to fill the cup of joy to the brim.</p>
        <p>June 5th found my father and mother at Orange Court
House in comfortable quarters, luxuriating in the country air
and fruit. The fare too was rather more abundant and of
better character. There we joined them a few weeks later.
The house was filled to overflowing with women and
children - families of officers in command in the army near
by. General J. E. B. Stuart, the gallant Cavalry leader, was
at Culpeper Court House and there on the night of June 4th
a ball was given, to which flocked all the Virginia belles of
the country side, as one can fancy - for this was the flower
of the chivalry of the Army of Northern Virginia. One can
imagine the scene - the jingling of spurs and clanking of
sabres, to the merry tunes of the fiddle and the banjo, and
the old story repeating itself in the telling, as is, and ever will
be, the case, “when youth and pleasure meet to chase
the glowing hours with flying feet.”</p>
        <p>On the morrow a great review was held of the Cavalry
at Brandy Station in the broad open country surrounding
that place, and General Lee was present in person. An
immense concourse of people gathered to see the sights,
and a beautiful spectacle it was, with the sun shining from
the summer sky on that brave array - though the gold lace
was somewhat tarnished and the gay uniforms
<pb id="wright137" n="137"/>
showing signs of wear. Yet the gallant forms that wore
them, dashing hither and thither in the manœuvres,
embodied in the eyes of the watchers all the graces and
daring of the dauntless cavalier. Upon them they rested
their hope - and the thought that failure should come to
J. E. B. Stuart and his gallant corps never darkened the sky
of that glorious June day.</p>
        <p>That night the Federal Cavalry attacked the
encampment and the battle of Brandy Station passed into
history - the Federals being repulsed and driven across the
Rappahannock.</p>

Write, my child, whenever opportunity offers. You cannot

We have all been watching with painful interest the course
of our Army since it crossed the border, and although late

Troubles seen to thicken upon us all at once. The fall of
Vicksburg and the attack on Charleston when so many of

very bad condition as to horses and is out of

have consequently been in the rear ever since the

All the guns are now in the same condition, but
<pb id="wright145" n="145"/>
the Ordnance officer of the Division, Capt. John Esten
Cooke, perhaps better known as Tristran Joyeuse, Gent.,
has sent to Staunton for ammunition and as Lt. Johnston
has gone to Richmond I shall be done for the present with
‘Company Q.’ I think that when we reached Westminster
Md. on Genl. Stuart's expedition round the Yanks, I was a
little the richest specimen of a Confederate officer that you,
at all events, ever saw. My boots were utterly worn out.
My pantaloons were all one big hole as the Irishman would
say: my coat was like a beggar's - and my hat was actually
falling to pieces, in addition to lacking its crown, which loss,
allowed my hair, not cut, since sometime before leaving
Culpeper, to protrude, and gave me a highly picturesque
finish to my appearance. I fortunately there got a pair of
boots, a pair of pantaloons and a hat which rendered my
condition comparatively better. We left Union in Loudon
Co., Va., on that expedition on the morning of the 24th of
June - and reached the lines of our army at Gettysburg,
Adams Co., Penn. late in the afternoon of the 2nd of July.
During that time the harness was off the horses only <hi rend="italics">twice.</hi>

turning out with water and milk and bread and butter and
‘apple butter’ for the ‘ragged rebels.’</p>
          <p>“I was quite surprised at the tone of feeling in
that part of the State. In two or three instances I
<pb id="wright146" n="146"/>
found people who seemed really glad to see us and at
scores of houses they had refreshments at the door for the
soldiers. The people generally seemed not to know exactly
whet to expect and I don't think would have been at all
astonished if every building had been set on fire by us as
we reached it, nor would a great many have been
surprised if we had concluded the business by massacring
the women and children!</p>
          <p>“I stopped at a house in Petersburg, Adams Co., Penn.
and almost the first question addressed me by the daughter
of the house, a girl of eighteen or twenty and a perfect
Yankee, was whether our men would molest the women!
I told her not, and she seemed to feel considerably
reassured. It was this same girl who told me in all
seriousness that she had heard and believed it, that <hi rend="italics">the

course, by this time you have seen from the papers who
has been killed, wounded and captured and have very little
doubt that you know more about these points than I do,
myself, for beyond hearing the report that Genl. Lee's
Headquarters are at Bunker Hill and that the Infantry are
beyond Martinsburg and some little inkling of the position
of portions of the Cavalry Division I am in the same

cross the Potomac again or to fall back behind the

          <p>Soon after their arrival in the West, on September
20th, the battle of Chickamauga was fought and
General Hood, then barely recovered from his
wound in the arm, was struck in the thigh by a minié
ball which fractured five inches of the bone. His
thigh was taken off - four and a half inches below
the body and yet he recovered and on October 8th,
about three weeks after, I find it recorded: “We
believe Genl. Hood will recover. He believes it, and
is already asking when he will be able to take the
field.”</p>
          <p>Many officers and soldiers were in Charlottesville
in the fall of 1863, recovering from their wounds,
and their presence in all the stages of convalescence
infused a spirit of gaiety to the little town. Picnics
<pb id="wright150" n="150"/>
were organized in the bright autumn days to historic
Monticello. It was difficult to secure any mode of
conveyance; but old “Uncle Guy's” hack, the only
available coach, was often called into requisition,
while the remainder of the party would be mounted
on sorry looking nags, and though the riding habits
were the worse for wear, rather nondescript
costumes the rule, and the attendant cavaliers in a
more or less disabled condition, yet we enjoyed
ourselves. That the gallant colonel had lost his eye
in his country's service made the unsightly black
patch a badge of honor - and the old ragged, faded
jacket with the hole in it, showing where the minié
ball had just missed the brave heart beneath it,
invested the boy captain with added charm. One day
we had a Tournament in the grounds at Monticello.
Some of the Knights - with only one arm to
use - holding the reins in the teeth and dashing
valiantly at the rings with wooden sticks, improvised
as spears for the occasion. I remember on that
day - among the company, there was a young officer
connected with the Commissary Department, and
stationed in Charlottesville. He had on a beautiful
new uniform and was mounted on a fine black horse;
where or how he had procured either we could not
divine; and he formed a great contrast in his finery to
the rest of the party. The girls eyed his elegance
askance, and one and all felt the contempt for him
that all Southern women had for a man in
<pb id="wright151" n="151"/>
those days who had never “smelt powder.” The men
looked on in amusement at the caracollings of the
fiery steed which made evolutions and pranced and
danced for the benefit of the ladies. Finally on our
way home in his efforts to display his horsemanship
the noble steed became unmanageable, and his
rider's “vaulting ambition” having “o'er leaped itself,”
he literally “fell on t'other side” - in a huge mud
puddle in the road. How we all laughed, as he arose
crestfallen; the beautiful uniform a ghastly wreck
and his humiliation complete. I suppose we ought to
have been sorry for him - but in those days the “stay
at homes” had no sympathizers. For the men in the
field, and for the men in the hospitals, the Southern
woman's heart overflowed with love and gratitude
and her hand was ready ever to minister to their
wants. </p>
          <p>There is a droll story told of one of these
ministering angels in the hospital when she
approached the bedside of an ill soldier. He looked
wan and weary and infinite pity filled her heart. “Can
I not do something for you?” she asked. “Would you
like me to bathe your face?” He raised his eyes and
looked at her, replying in dead earnest, with real
gratitude for her good intentions, and not the
slightest appreciation of the humor of the
situation:</p>
          <p>“I have had it washed seventeen times to-day,
Miss, but you can do it again if you want to!”</p>
          <pb id="wright152" n="152"/>
          <p>In a letter from my mother, dated Charlottesville,
October 25th, she writes: “I hope you will be able to pay
us a visit at Xmas in Richmond. We are looking forward
with much pleasure to the winter, in spite of the prospect of
having nothing to eat nor wear! We hear to-day that Genl.
Hood is doing exceedingly well and would be in Richmond
this winter. He is going first to pay Gen. Hampton a visit in
Columbia. Mr. B. has been with him since his wound and

dangerously however. I shall get Lt. Shanks, who

Auburn which lies about half way between Catlett's
and Warrenton. At Auburn we left the Warrenton
road and took that leading to Buckland which is four
miles from Gainesville to the West. Meanwhile
Stuart with Hampton's Division had been retiring
before the Yankees along the turnpike before
Warrenton. Then when the Yankees thought
everything was getting along finely, the whole of
Fitz Lee's Division came in on their flank and before
night we had them back on their Infantry supports

        <p>AT this time the deepest anxiety was felt for the
success of our cause in the West - and my father's
advocacy of General J. E. Johnston's being given
the control of affairs in that department was
earnest and persistent. But it was disregarded
by the President; and led to a severance of their
friendly relations. While he never varied in his
estimate of the President's sincerity, integrity and
patriotism, nor ceased to admire the pure and
noble character of the man - he never could
justify his absolute refusal to waive his private
judgment in the crisis of his country's trial and
hearken to the appeals of men whose patriotism
and judgment he should have regarded as
certainly the equals of his own. That he erred, erred
fatally, no one cognizant of the state of affairs at
the time can doubt; but it is equally sure that the
penalty of his mistakes was borne with a dignity
and serene courage which excited the admiration

of the world. In modern times there has been no such
spectacle as that frail old man, the chief magistrate of eight
millions of people, lying manacled in a dungeon, bearing
vicariously the sufferings and penalties of his people! He
may have erred - but when the fetters were placed upon
him the Southern people forgot everything but that he was
their first and only President.</p>

“Davis is still in the West and is not expected back for a

and Pemberton, cost what it may to the Country. John A.
Wharton of Texas has been lately made a Major General
of Cavalry. He told me when here that the dissatisfaction
with Bragg was universal in the Western Army and a
general desire to be commanded by Johnston. I got a letter
from Seddon a few days ago saying that the President was
determined to keep Bragg in command, not that he thought
him a great General, but that he was better than any with
whom he could replace him. That is, than Johnston or
Longstreet.”</p>

begin with the order of November 24th just referred to. At

          <p>“I have passed many anxious months lately, in this siege
of Charleston. My only child and son was at Fort Sumter, a
First Lieutenant in the 1st Regular Artillery Regiment. He
passed through the first attack in April safely - though
occupying a post of danger, but, on the 17th of August, in
the attack upon Sumter from the enemy's land batteries, on
Morris Island, my poor boy was wounded by a fragment of
a 200-pound parrots shell: he was slightly cut in the back of
the head and wounded in two places in the shoulder; and
picked up insensible. I went to him as soon as the news
reached us of his being wounded, but was but two days in
Charleston, when we were roused from our slumbers, at
two hours past midnight, by the enemy shelling the town
filled with sleeping, helpless women and children. The next
day I left with my wounded boy to return to my quiet home
in Georgia. He was with me but ten days, when he returned
to Charleston, though he had not then recovered the use of
his right hand and arm, which had been, from the severe
contusions on the shoulder, entirely paralyzed. He had been
in command of his company, at Sumter, since the first of the
attack, his captain being absent on sick leave, so that he
was anxious to return to duty and has been ever since, for
the last three months, at a battery on James Island, near
Fort Johnson, where I am again anxious
<pb id="wright164" n="164"/>
about him. He is a devoted son, and the trial to me of
having the boy so constantly exposed to danger is
almost more than I can bear. . . . I had hoped you
were spared the anxiety of having an only son in the
service, so young as he is, I can truly feel for you,
but then he is not your <hi rend="italics">only child.</hi> You have
daughters at home to cheer and comfort you. I never
wished until this cruel war that my son had been a
daughter, but we must believe it is ordered for the
best. I was made very happy last week by my son's
return to us on a short leave - he makes everything
bright and joyous for me and I miss him sadly when
away. If we had only had a navy to fight for us, as the
army has done, this war would have ended in a few
months, I imagine; and now, who can see the end of
it? With the coming spring instead of peace and joy,
when the earth is all beautiful and smiling, we are
told to prepare for another fierce attack of our cruel
foe and more carnage and blood and slaughter await
us. My heart sickens at the thought. I heard from
Aunt N. from New York, December 6th. She seems
very miserable about us all, and wishes I were in
New York to share some of the many comforts they
enjoy. Much as I <hi rend="italics">once</hi> liked New York, I never desire
to see it again and would rather starve and die
here than live and grow fat under Lincoln! They
have no idea, even our Southern friends there, of
the feelings aroused in our hearts by this war. I am
<pb id="wright165" n="165"/>
busy getting John ready to return to his post on
James Island. As it breaks my heart to think of the
poor boy being on picket all night in the rain and
having only dry hominy and cold water for breakfast,
I am scouring the country to buy syrup and eggs and
a few comforts to keep him from starving.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="chapter 9" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <p>Poor little mother heart, how it beat and
throbbed with pain and anxiety, and with it all,
no talk of wanting to give up the fight. Such
women as these were the rule, not the exception;
such women as these were the mothers, who
made the soldiers in the armies of the Confederacy.</p>
          <p>The winter of '63-'64 saw us back in Richmond.
The Army of Northern Virginia was inactive
during the latter part of the winter but made a
campaign of heroic endurance without parallel,
for suffering and privation. With no proper
shelter, half clothed, many without shoes, and
barely enough food to keep away starvation, they
bore the rigors of the season, the cold rains and
snows, the dreary days and long nights of discomfort
with no blankets to cover them, without a murmur.
The currency was now so depreciated that the
pay of the highest officers was inadequate for
their wants. With cornmeal at $50 a bushel;
beans at $60; bacon at $8 and sugar at $20 a
pound it was almost impossible to procure the
necessaries of life in Richmond - and yet I do not
<pb id="wright166" n="166"/>
remember during that winter of suffering and
anxiety, ever to have heard the eventual success
of our cause questioned. The spirits of the people
generally were bright  and buoyant. The question
of clothes became a burning one, and many were
the devices resorted to in order to meet the needs
of the occasion. Early in March Dahlgren's raid
around Richmond took place and struck terror
into the hearts of the women and children when
the character of the orders captured on his person
were known. It was stated and believed at the
time that he and his command had <hi rend="italics">volunteered</hi> for
this expedition. He was repulsed and lost his
life in the attempt, which resulted in absolute
failure. The orders found on his person were
explicit, and most extraordinary, when viewed
in the light of the usual rules governing civilized
warfare. He was ordered to burn the city of
Richmond, and the oakum and turpentine to
carry out this purpose were found with him. He
was ordered to sack and loot the city, then filled
with helpless women and children - and to the
mercy of God we owe it that he was prevented
from carrying out his purpose, and that an awful
crime against civilization and humanity was not
committed. My father said at the time, and I have
lived to see his prophecy come true, that in future
years no one would believe that such orders
had been given or such an expedition organized,
but these are facts nevertheless. All during
<pb id="wright167" n="167"/>
that early spring the alarms in Richmond of an attack on the
city were frequent; and at any hour of the day or night
would be heard the sound of the alarm bells ringing and all
the remaining men in the town, the clerks and civil officers,
would gather up their arms and rally to the defence of their
homes and the protection of their families. It was a
wretched time of anxiety almost unbearable.</p>
          <p>I recall one night particularly when I had been beguiled
into reading until a late hour the charmed pages of
Dickens's “Tale of Two Cities.” It was about one o'clock
and all the household were fast asleep; when far down
Main Street I heard the clattering of many hoofs, and the
shouts of soldiery. I rushed to my father's door, and called
him. He dressed with all haste, and buckled on his sword
and pistol, which lay always ready to hand. Then he calmed
and quieted the terrified women and children who had been
aroused by the noise. A moment we waited, as the sounds
came nearer and nearer. We were sure the Yankees were
upon us - and I must confess that for the first and only time
during the war I felt  terrified. As the troops came in sight
they slackened their pace and to our joy, we found it was a
company of Fitz Lee's Cavalry clattering through the town
and for pure mischief rousing the sleeping inhabitants. How
we cheered them when we saw the “red heart” gleaming on
their grey coats, and knew that we
<pb id="wright168" n="168"/>
could go to our beds in peace and sleep safe and
sound with Fitz Lee's men on guard!</p>
          <p>The following letter from General Johnston

          <p>“It is necessary to recruit this army promptly to
enable it to hold its ground against Grant's forces.
Remember that it was unable to move forward even
before it had been weakened by the defeat of
Missionary Ridge, and Longstreet's march into East
Tennessee, and the enemy strengthened by his
victory and 25,000 men brought from Mississippi
by Sherman.</p>
          <p>“I propose to substitute slaves for all soldiers
employed out of the ranks - on detached service,
extra duty, as cooks, engineers, laborers, pioneers,
or any kind of work. Such details for this little
army amount to more than 10,000 men. Negroes
would serve for such purposes, better than soldiers.
The impressment of negroes has been practiced ever
since the War commenced - but we have never been
able to keep the impressed negroes with an army near
the enemy. They desert. If you can devise and pass a
law to enable us to hold slaves or other negroes with
armies, this one can, in a few weeks, be increased by
the number given above - of soldiers - not
conscripts. Is not this worth trying? We require
promptness here
<pb id="wright169" n="169"/>
and this is the only prompt way of sending us
soldiers. The proposed modifications of the conscript
law are good, but then operations cannot help us in the
present emergency. The plan is simple and quick. It
puts soldiers and negroes each in his appropriate
place; the one to fight, the other to work. I need not
go into particulars in this matter. You understand it
as well as I. Now do apply your energy and zeal to it.
There is no other mode by which this army can be
recruited before spring - and there is no other so
good as this. Speak to General Sparrow and Mr.
Miles for me on this subject. I would write to them
both but am so pressed for time as to be unable to
do so.</p>

        <div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <p>“. . . I have just returned from a ride with some of
‘the staff’ looking at the country. I think Gen. Hood
is quite anxious for a fight and I have no doubt will
distinguish himself whenever it does come. He
brought a carriage up from Atlanta when he came,
but has sent it back, and rides everywhere on
horseback. He is out nearly every day and rides from
twelve to fifteen and twenty miles without
dismounting. </p>

Pendleton, who I wrote in my last to Papa is out here

service, and it had a very familiar

          <p>April 9. . . . The sham battle of General Hardee's
Corps took place on Thursday, and was witnessed by
a large number of ladies from all parts of the State.
There was a party of them at Gen. Hood's for several
days and the evening after the <hi rend="italics">battle</hi> we had a dance
at Hd. Qurs. to which was gathered ‘the beauty and

Monday evening, to which the General and his staff
are invited. I expect there will be a good deal of
gaiety in Dalton, (that is, for the army) until the war
begins, which from all appearance is as far off as
ever. Tell Papa that the army is very much ‘down on’
Congress for the ration bill and ask him to be sure
and have it remedied as soon as the session begins. I
have heard several plans proposed by officers for
inviting one or two members of Congress now with
the army to a ‘one ration a day dinner.’ Something of
this sort, for instance: The entertainer would be very
generous and have the whole day's ration served for
dinner. He would divide the pound and a quarter of
meal, the quarter of a pound of hominy and the
<pb id="wright175" n="175"/>
third of a pound of bacon into three parts and give his
guest one, take one himself and set one aside for his

          <p>“April 29. . . . There was a review to-day of all the
infantry and artillery of the army. The reviewing
officer was Gen. Johnston, who rode down the line,
halting opposite each brigade to receive its salute.
He then took his position and the troops marched in
review past him. Mrs. Johnston was there and a good
many other ladies and I expect enjoyed the spectacle
though the wind was high and the dust insufferable.
Mrs. Johnston spoke to-day of your and Fanny's

have a very pleasant time indeed, and if the Army is
inactive I shall doubtless be able to run down to see
you. . . . </p>

          <p>As the summer advanced the journey to Texas,
which necessitated crossing the Mississippi river,
and which had been abandoned by my father and
mother the previous summer on account of the
perils to be incurred, became imperative. It was
determined to undertake it at all hazards, though it
involved a separation of months from their children,
uncertainty of the fate of an only son, who was daily
exposed to danger in the army, and the encountering
of difficulties which were enough to have deterred
even the bold spirit of my father, to say nothing of
my mother, whom the anticipation must have filled
with dread. With the quiet heroism of the women of
that day, she never faltered where duty led, and I find
no record of any hesitation or question as to her
sharing my father's dangers on that journey to the
home from which he had now been absent nearly
four years. As it was, of course, impossible that we
should accompany them, my sister and I (then girls
of twelve and seventeen years of age, respectively,)
<pb id="wright178" n="178"/>
were left in the charge of Mrs. Joseph E. Johnston
at Atlanta; General Johnston being then in command
of the Army of Tennessee.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Johnston was temporarily settled in a little
house, furnished with cots, tables and chairs
borrowed from the hospitals, and some few articles
lent by kind friends in an effort to make the wife of
the commanding General a little more comfortable.
We had also the General's mess chest with its
supply of table cutlery, spoons, etc., “six of
everything,” and the other members of the party
brought in to the general aid of the establishment all
we could “muster” in the way of additions to the
store. Here we were quiet for a few weeks, when the
position of affairs at Atlanta became so uncertain
that General Johnston thought it best for us to be
sent to Macon. In a letter written to my mother on
her journey (which reached her at Meridian,
Mississippi,) I say:</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <opener>
            <dateline>“MACON, July 11th, 1864.</dateline>
          </opener>
          <p>“. . . You see by the heading of my letter that
already we have been forced to leave Atlanta -
not that it has fallen, but Mrs. Johnston
received a letter from the General in which he
advised her to send us off at once - to remain until
the fate of the city was decided either one way
or the other. Col. Brewster and Brother (who
came from camp near Atlanta for a conference)
agreed with her in thinking it best for us to go -
<pb id="wright179" n="179"/>
as the machinery, government stores and wounded
from the hospitals were being removed, and there
was no telling how soon it might be exceedingly
difficult if not impossible to get away. Mrs.
Johnston will remain till the last moment practicable,
and then, in case of a rush to the cars, she
has her carriage in which she can come. The plan
is now, if Atlanta falls, for her to come immediately
to Macon, and try to get a house. Col. Ewell (of
Gen. Johnston's staff) is obliged to have an office
in the rear of the Army, and this will be as convenient
a place as he can procure. If she fails in getting
the house or rooms here, she will try to be
accommodated at some little village on the way
between here and Atlanta; and I rather think she
would prefer this arrangement as it would bring her
nearer the army. If <hi rend="italics">
<foreign lang="fr">au contraire</foreign>
</hi> Atlanta should <hi rend="italics">not</hi>
fall, we will return to her as soon as that fact is
decided; and the same will be done as soon as she
gets settled in her new quarters, (wherever they
may be) if obliged to move. In the meantime we
are with Mrs. Clay.”</p>

        <div2 type="chapter 10" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <p>I shall never forget the horrors of that journey
from Atlanta to Macon. We left in a hospital
train, filled with wounded, sick and dying soldiers,
in all imaginable stages of disease and suffering.
My little sister and myself and one other lady
were the only other passengers on the train,
<pb id="wright180" n="180"/>
except the officer put in charge of us to see us safe
to our journey's end. I never imagined what a
hideous, cruel thing War was until I was brought into
direct, contact with these poor victims of “Man's
inhumanity to man.” For this was no modern hospital
train with scientific arrangements for hygiene and
the relief of suffering. There was scant supply of the
common comforts, and even decencies of life - no
cushions nor air pillows for weary heads; no ice to
cool the fevered thirst; no diet kitchen for broths
and delicate food for these half starved sufferers; no
wine or brandy to revive the failing pulse and
stimulate the weakened vitality; not even medicine
enough to check the ravages of disease; nor
anæsthetics nor anodynes to ease their agonies - for
the supply of medicines and anodynes was daily
diminishing, and they could not be replaced, as our
foes had declared them “contraband of war!” There
was not even a place in that crowded car where the
sick could lie down; but, packed in as close as
possible on the hard uncomfortable seats, they made
that journey, as best they might, in uncomplaining
martyrdom. I reached Macon sick at heart over the
suffering I had witnessed and was so powerless to
avert.</p>
          <p>We heard from our travellers from various points
on their route before they reached the Mississippi
river; the last tidings being dated “Jackson, July 29.”
They were then on the eve
<figure id="ill25" entity="wright180">
<p>CAPT. JOHN RANDOLPH HAMILTON<lb/>Commander of the Floating Battery, C. S. N.<lb/>MRS. JOHN RANDOLPH HAMILTON</p>
</figure>
<pb id="wright181" n="181"/>
of starting, having been detained there three days, making
arrangements for the adventure.</p>
          <p>An ambulance, drawn by mules, had been secured, and
in this, as small a portion of luggage had been stowed as it
was possible to manage with, and the journey to the river
began. It was four months before we heard from them
again. In the meantime, events had been occurring
rapidly - and on July 17th, General Johnston was
removed from the command of the Army, and General
Hood put in his place. I find in a letter from my brother,
who was on General Hood's staff, the following account:</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <opener>
            <dateline>“ATLANTA, July 31st, 1864.</dateline>
          </opener>
          <p>“ . . . You doubtless have heard before this reaches you
of the removal of General Johnston, and the placing of
Gen. Hood in command of the Army. The dispatch was
received the night of the seventeenth, and Genl. Johnston's
farewell address bore that date. The three corps
commanders next day telegraphed to Richmond requesting
that the order should be revoked, but it was refused. This
is what I understood and I think it is true. Genl. Hood
accordingly assumed command that day, the 18th. Gen.
Johnston went into Atlanta that morning and left for Macon
next day. I rode into town in the evening to say good-bye
and saw Mrs. Johnston and himself. No one could ever
have told from his countenance or manner that anything
unusual had occurred.
<pb id="wright182" n="182"/>
Indeed he seemed in rather better spirits than usual
though it must have been at the cost of much exertion.
An universal gloom seemed cast over the army, for
they were entirely devoted to him. Gen. Hood, however,
has all the qualities to attach men to him, and it was
not a comparison between the two, but love for, and
confidence in, Gen. Johnston which caused the
feeling I have before alluded to. Gen. Hood, as you
will see, assumed command under circumstances of
no ordinary difficulty. He has applied himself,
however, heart and soul to the task and I sincerely
trust will bring us out of the campaign with benefit to
the country and honor to himself. The Administration,
of course, is compelled to support him both with
moral and material aid, and that assistance which was
asked for by General Johnston unsuccessfully will no
doubt be afforded now. A portion if not all of Gen.
Roddy's command is now on the way, if it did not
reach here to-night. If Gen. Forrest is thrown on the
road in their rear everything will be as we want it.
Time will tell us all. On the 20th, Stewart and Hardee
advanced on the enemy in their front and drove them a
short distance before them capturing some prisoners
and one or two stands of colors. On the 22nd, Gen.
Hardee's corps which had been moved the night
before to a position on their flank, attacked and
drove the enemy from their vidette line, their skirmish
line and two main lines of works, and held them,
<pb id="wright183" n="183"/>
capturing some twelve hundred prisoners, eight
guns, and thirteen stands of colors. Gen. Wheeler
with his cavalry drove a brigade of infantry from
their works and through Decatur which is seven
miles from town on the Augusta R. R., capturing
some two or three hundred prisoners and one gun.
A portion of Cheatham's corps, (Gen. Hood's old
corps) drove the enemy from the first main line of
works in their front, but were forced to retire,
bringing off however three or four hundred
prisoners, five stands of colors and six pieces of
Artillery.</p>
          <p>“The fruits of the victory were fifteen guns,
eighteen colors and between eighteen and nineteen
hundred prisoners. There was another fight on the
28th in which three Divisions were engaged. They
drove the enemy into slight works which they had
erected, but did not take the works. The attack was
made to prevent the enemy's gaining possession of a
road. Major Preston, son of Gen. John S. Preston,
was killed in the fight of the 20th by a cannon shot.
He was universally regretted. Gen. Stevens of South
Carolina was mortally wounded in the same fight and
has since died. On the 22nd, Gen. W. H. T. Walker
was killed and Gen. Gist and Gen. Smith, commanding
Granbury's Texas brigade, wounded. On the 28th
Gen. Stewart, Gen. Loring, and Gen. Johnson, who
received his appointment as Brig. Gen. on the
march to the fight, were wounded. Gen. Ector
<pb id="wright184" n="184"/>
was wounded during an artillery duel - and has lost his
leg. Col. Young, whom you remember to have seen at
Charlottesville, is now commanding the brigade. Gen.
Mackall, Gen. Johnston's Chief of Staff, has been relieved
at his own request, and Genl. Shoep, formerly Chief of
Artillery of the Army, is now Gen. Hood's Chief of Staff.
Col. Beckham is Chief of Artillery of the Army and will I
suppose be made Brigadier. I am messing at present with
Gen. Hood, am living in a house, and have a room all to
myself. I write very frequently to L., generally every two or
three days. The last letter I received was dated the 24th.
Mrs. Johnston had obtained a large house in a very
pleasant part of the town and would move into it in a few
days. L. and F. will be with her there and L. says she
thinks she will spend a very pleasant summer comparatively
‘when these awful battles are over.’</p>
          <p>“Genl. Stephen D. Lee has taken command of Gen.
Hood's old corps. He told me he had heard you were on
your way across the river and I suppose by this time you
are safely in Louisiana. The Yankee cavalry has been very
actively at work on the railroads in Georgia and Alabama
for the last week or two. A force which had cut the road
between here and Macon, only tearing up a mile and a half,
were pursued by our Cavalry and when they reached the
West Point R. R. came upon some of Roddy's forces on
the cars, were
<pb id="wright185" n="185"/>
held in check until some of the pursuers came up, and
from all accounts it seems that the only ones of them
who will get back to their lines will be the fugitives
who can make their way through the woods. Remember
me to all the servants.”</p>

        <div2 type="chapter 10" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <p>As recorded in the preceding letter, General Johnston,
immediately on his removal, left for Macon with Mrs.
Johnston and his staff. The feeling of indignation at his
removal was generally expressed and the people did all in
their power to show their sympathy and respect. He bore
his trouble with an outward stoicism which was pathetic,
since we, who knew and loved him, were so fully aware of
the agony of mind and heart he suffered. But no word
escaped his lips, whatever his thoughts may have been. I
shall never forget a scene which occurred at the church
door on General Johnston's first appearance at service
after his removal. Mrs. Clement Clay, wife of the former
United States Senator from Alabama, had, with her
husband, the warmest admiration and affectionate
friendship for General Johnston. She was as impulsive and
demonstrative, as he was shy and reserved. Her feelings of
indignation at his removal were at a white heat. She not
only felt incensed, but she wanted everyone to know that
fact and the depth of her sympathy. They had not met since
his arrival in Macon, and, catching sight of the old hero, as
with reverent
<pb id="wright186" n="186"/>
mien and modest air he moved with the crowd
through the church door, she rushed up to him with
hands outstretched, and rising on tip toe imprinted
on his bronzed cheek a warm kiss of love and
sympathy, in the face of the whole congregation.
The effect was magical. A low murmur went around
among the people, tears sprung into many eyes, as
they saw the blush mount to his brow at this
spontaneous tribute to the love which we bore him.
Mrs. Clay had only expressed our feelings, and,
surrounded by a half laughing, half tearful crowd,
the old General made his way down the church steps
and hurried homewards.</p>
          <p>We were delightfully fixed in a large roomy
house, of the architecture and style so often seen
in the extreme South - three stories high, with tall
pillars reaching from the roof to the piazza, thus
affording shade to the whole structure without
preventing the passage of air. The house was
on the outskirts of Macon and faced a beautiful
valley - beyond which rose a range of hills. From
this broad piazza I saw the only battle I witnessed
during the War. Stoneman, with three brigades,
attempted to take Macon, but he was met by
the Militia, which was composed mostly of men
unfit for active service, and of the convalescent
soldiers, and was kept away from the town.
When he attempted to retreat he was met by
our cavalry, and surrendered himself with five
hundred of his command. Our people pursued
<pb id="wright187" n="187"/>
the remainder, capturing many more and all the
artillery. From “our coign of vantage” on the piazza,
we could see the smoke issuing from the guns and
then after an interval hear the report, though we
were too far off to see much of the fight.</p>
          <p>At this time we received information that my
father and mother had crossed the river in safety;
but the details of that perilous trip were not told till
their return in December.</p>
          <p>All during that anxious summer we hoped and
feared, as the news would be brought us now of
victory, and now of defeat, while our gallant
General, chafing in his enforced inactivity, spoke
never a word of approval or disapproval of the
conduct of the campaign.</p>
          <p>I find in a letter, written by myself to my mother,
the following:</p>
        </div2>

          <p>“ . . . I have no news to give you and must confess
that things just at present look rather blue. The
intelligence that comes from the front is all
confused. We know that Hardee attacked the
enemy and with his one corps held his position
till night, when he was flanked and driven back
four miles. . . . Hood, with the rest of the army,
is in Atlanta; the army thus being cut right in
two. Reports cam yesterday and to-day that
Atlanta has been evacuated. I have heard nothing
from Brother, but suppose from that fact that
<pb id="wright188" n="188"/>
he is all well. Every face looks anxiously expectant
and we can only hope for the best. Before this
reaches you it will be decided, I suppose.</p>
          <p>“Genl. Johnston received a very flattering letter
from the citizens of Macon not long ago, offering
him the house, in which we now are, for as long a

          <p>“When my last was written Sherman had not
developed his intentions, and we were all in the
dark as to what he would do next. After drawing
back his line from our right and centre, he pushed
these troops round in rear of his original right and
crossing the West Point and Atlanta R. R. struck
for the Macon road. On the night of the 30th Aug.,
Hardee's Corps started from the neighborhood
of East Point, six miles below Atlanta, for
Jonesboro', sixteen miles further in the direction
of Macon - opposite which was McPherson's
Army. You know Sherman's Army is composed of
McPherson's old Army, commanded since his
death by Howard; Thomas's Army and Schofield's
<pb id="wright189" n="189"/>
Army. Lee's Corps followed Hardee and next day
they attacked this fraction of the Yankee force, but
failed to make any impression. There was therefore
nothing left but to evacuate the place, which was
done that next night. Lee's Corps was drawn away
from Hardee after the fight and covered the flank
of the troops marching from Atlanta to effect a
junction with Hardee. . . . Gen. Hood is making
every exertion to get ready for the fall campaign
and preserves his equanimity perfectly.</p>
          <p>“A few days after the army was reunited, Sherman
retired his forces to the neighborhood of Atlanta
and the campaign came to an end. He is doubtless
preparing for another advance before the stoppage
of operations by bad weather. He stripped the
citizens of the country that he has abandoned to us,
and yesterday there was application made at
Jonesboro' for rations for one thousand destitute
people in that vicinity. He has signalized his
retirement to Atlanta by an order exiling every white
man, woman and child from the place, regardless of
political opinion. The reason given is that it is to the
interest of the United States.</p>
          <p>“I feel confident that the first of December will
see Sherman North of the Etowah River. His
line of communication is too long, his means of
transportation consisting as it does of a railroad.

        <argument>
          <p>THE MISSES WIGFALL IN CHARGE OF MRS. JOSEPH E.
 JOHNSTON - A CHEERFUL HOUSEHOLD - MRS. TOBY'S “PARTY”-
THE APPROACH OF GENERAL SHERMAN CAUSES A RUSH
FROM MACON - A LOUISIANA SWAMP - CROSSING
THE MISSISSIPPI IN DUGOUTS.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>WHEN October came General Johnston gave up the
house which had sheltered us during the past anxious
months, as it was not deemed prudent, in the present state
of uncertainty, to attempt any settled plans. There was no
telling how soon, now, we might be obliged to evacuate
Macon. Genl. Johnston's opinion was, that after the
conclusion of the sort of armistice then existing, that active
operations would begin again immediately. Sherman, taking
advantage of the short respite, had already laid in immense
supplies in Atlanta and said openly that he could march to
Augusta, Mobile or Macon. We therefore, in view of these
uncertainties, broke up our household and went to Vineville,
a suburb of Macon, where we joined forces with the family
of General Mackall, General Johnston's Chief of Staff, and
messed together in a snug little house at the end of the village
<pb id="wright194" n="194"/>
street. Here we formed a cheerful household
with the young people of the family, and the young
officers on the staff. Little did we care that the
mid-day meal consisted of one course of corn
bread and sorghum molasses. We kept brave
faces and spoke brave words to cheer each other,
though there was gnawing anxiety tugging at our
heart strings day and night for our noble armies
in the field, and deadly fears for the loved ones
exposed to hourly danger. In spite of all this, or, it
may be, because of all this trouble and sorrow, on
the principle of whistling to keep one's courage up,
there were many homes, in other days famed for
their generous hospitality, which still in this fair
Georgian town opened their doors and called the
young people aside to make merry, if possible, for
even a few hours - and many a pleasant evening we
spent with music and song and dancing. The young
officers passing to and fro on sick leave, or during
periods of cessation of hostilities, having a two or
three days' furlough, would find delight in these
little glimpses of a brighter side of life. There was
in Macon, at this time, a Mrs. Toby, a charming
matron, who was noted for her love of young
people, and her delight was to have informal
gatherings upon every available occasion. There was
also in our household a young officer of the staff
who was of a serious turn of mind, cared little for
the society of the more frivolous sex and who
consequently was a continual target for
<pb id="wright195" n="195"/>
the mischievous pranks of the young ladies, who
teased him unmercifully. Practical jokes were
played upon him, which he bore with an equanimity
and amiability unexampled, and hard to comprehend,
until the sequel showed that he was only biding his
time for a goodly revenge.</p>
        <p>This came, after a consultation with Mrs.
Johnston, who was full of life and vivacity and ever
ready to further the gaiety of young people, and who
suggested, that in the well known hospitality of Mrs.
Toby, he might find the long sought opportunity for
vengeance.</p>
        <p>The plot, as concocted, was that the young ladies
of the house were to be invited to a “party” at Mrs.
Toby's, that lady's name being used for an
entertainment which had existence only in the
imagination of the conspirators, and which, of
course, was never to take place. The following
letters were composed and written by Mrs. Johnston
and the young officer and delivered at intervals - as
required by the situation. In reading over these
foolish little letters, which caused such merriment
at the time, I have thought what a pathetic picture
was presented - of that brave old General, with heart
bowed down with sorrow for his country's peril, and
bitterness at his own enforced inability to help her
in her hour of need, forgetting for the moment the
tragedy of the times, to indulge in the innocent
mirth produced by a practical joke. The first letter
was as follows:</p>
        <pb id="wright196" n="196"/>

          <p>The reception of this invitation, which was
delivered in all seriousness and without our having
a suspicion of the wicked intention veiled in its
smooth phrases, created a flutter of excitement
among the girls in the household. Acceptance of
the offered delight was a foregone conclusion, but
the burning question of apparel loomed up in the
foreground. What could we wear? We retired
to the upper regions and called Mrs. Johnston to
our council. We rummaged among our meagre
resources, and spread out for critical inspection
<pb id="wright197" n="197"/>
the results of our search. I selected an old crimson silk
which had done faithful service in the past on many a
festive occasion, and a faded lavender gown, with an
ancient cut, and skimped proportions, was the choice
of the other eager young aspirant for pleasure. An old
sycamore tree grew in the yard and its boughs were heavy
with lovely green balls, which suggested themselves to my
excited fancy as a beautiful decoration for the hair. This
latter, by the way, had to be crimped and curled - so we
remained up stairs all day, close prisoners, ripping and
remaking the old dresses; and refused even to come
down to the corn bread and sorghum repast, owing to
the crimped and frizzed condition of our tresses. Mrs.
Johnston would appear at intervals with suggestions and
advice and on returning to the lower regions, if our ears
had been attuned to suspicion, we might have wondered
at the sounds of laughter and merriment that invariably
greeted her return. As night approached and we began to
make our toilettes - the conspirators relented. We heard
afterwards that the dear old General remonstrated and said
“it was a shame” to impose further on our innocence
and credulity. So Mrs. Johnston appeared up stairs with
the second note - and still we never suspected.</p>

          <p>It is needless to add that Mrs. Toby was guiltless
of any and all of these effusions but Mrs. Johnston
and Captain Mackall could not claim equal ignorance
of their composition.</p>
          <p>This little laughing interlude was of short duration,
for graver matters soon absorbed our attention.
Sherman was threatening Macon and we were
making ready to leave on his nearer approach.
The small-pox was becoming also a serious menace
and knowing the crowded condition of the little
town and the insurmountable difficulties surrounding
its sanitary conditions, we were very uneasy.
Vaccination was universal and we wore little bags
of asafetida next the skin to ward off the infection.
I don't remember whether this was Mrs. Johnston's
own idea of an efficient preventive, or not, but I
know all the young people in our household were
similarly decorated.</p>
          <p>At last the dreaded day came when we were
forced to fly for safety. The rush for the cars was
tremendous. Through the kindness of Mr. Cuyler,
<pb id="wright201" n="201"/>
the President of the road, a car was reserved for a
number of his friends and acquaintances, and we
were lucky enough to secure two seats and one for
Captain Miller, who was sent in charge of us. Mrs.
Johnston remained behind, to leave next day with
the General. I shall never forget that journey. I was
ill with fever and headache from my arm, which
had “taken” violently from vaccination. I was
separated from father and mother; my only
brother exposed to hourly danger, news of his
safety from day to day being impossible to
obtain; with the care and responsibility of a young
sister upon me and flying before a ruthless foe to
take refuge among strangers. And I not eighteen
years old at the time! As our poorly equipped
train lumbered slowly along, cumbered with its
heavy load, we had time enough for reflection
on the terrible situation of affairs. Our objective
point was Columbia, that fair little Carolina town,
which had not yet fallen into the enemy's hands,
and was still a haven for the distressed refugees
flying before Sherman's advancing army. At
night-fall we reached a way station, and there
came to a halt. A raid was threatened and trains
were unable to pass beyond that point. The
terrified women and children were flocking into
the little village, and the only inn, a small frame
building, could not even give cover to the crowds
that swarmed in from every quarter. We alighted
from the train and made an investigation of the
<pb id="wright202" n="202"/>
prospects for a night's lodging. We could not even find a
seat in the small sitting room filled to overflowing with
women, children and babies; and the stifling atmosphere
caused us to beat a swift retreat. What to do we did not
know, or where to find shelter. Captain Miller was at his
wits' ends - when the question was promptly settled by our
determining to spend the night on the platform. A chair was
found, and seated on the bare boards, with my head on my
muff, with the chair for a support and with my little sister
lying on my lap, we spent the night. I was so exhausted
from illness and fatigue that I was soon lost to a sense
of all the trouble and terror, and slept the hours away
in utter unconsciousness.</p>
          <p>In the early morning we were aroused and, hurrying
on board the train, proceeded on our way to
Columbia, and thence to Greenville, where kind
friends received us. Here we remained in quiet for
some weeks, when one happy day, to our utter
delight, my father made his appearance, having
successfully accomplished the journey to Texas
and recrossed the Mississippi river. He had
now come for us to join him and my mother
on their way back to Richmond. In life, there
are always hours that stand out in bold relief

as vivid as the pain and sorrow of the separation.
And now we heard the story of the journey. How
they had traveled through the Louisiana swamps,
with the mosquitoes as big as “woodchucks”
almost, (“gallinippers” they were styled), swarming
around them, the mules struggling bravely with the
heavily laden ambulance over the corduroy roads,
my father on the alert day and night, fearing the
approach of the enemy.</p>
          <p>I give the following notes to show the surrounding

          <p>“I start on this morning to discover whether the enemy
are still on the river or near to Shields, obstructing the
upper road. I advise you to return to Miller's and will
despatch you there the condition of affairs.</p>
          <p>“The road over which I am passing can not be passed
by any wheel conveyance. I deem it my duty to inform you
of this fact. Were there a chance for you I should say
come, but as it is I must say the route is impracticable.
Should the upper route be free of the enemy's presence, it
remains for you to determine whether you will run the risk
attendant on it. I believe from all that I have heard, after the
most diligent inquiries, that should the enemy have gone,
you can pass in safety to the river - of course, there may
<pb id="wright204" n="204"/>
be enemies there at any time, but such risks fade into utter
insignificance compared with this road. You have to pass
down the river eight miles, but under cover of night I
scarcely think there can be much danger. Should I find the
enemy still on the river I will advise you immediately of it. I
would suggest that as the only practicable means of solving
the difficult problem of reaching the East bank of the
Mississippi, that you recross the Black River and proceed
to Trinity, getting from Col. Purvis, who commands a
regiment now stationed there, an escort who know the
roads and country, being residents of that part of the state,
and proceed to Columbia, crossing the Ouachita River
at that point and proceeding via Bayou Macon and St.
Joseph road to St. Joseph or Boninsburg. It is with sincere
regret that I should find such a course the only one possible
for you, but the difficulties on this route, naturally much
greater than I had supposed, have been greatly augmented
by the recent rains.</p>
          <p>“The nearest route for you to St. Joseph or Boninsburg
would be to cross the Ouachita at Harrisonburg, but as
the Bayou Louis, three miles from Harrisonburg, may
not be crossable, I give you the other route. Col. Purvis
can inform you whether you can cross Bayou Louis, and
if you can would take that road.</p>
          <p>“I do not know whether I can cross the river at
the point near to which I shall debauch from
<pb id="wright205" n="205"/>
this road or not. If you think it necessary for me to
go with you to Boninsburg I will go, although I do
not know the road and it will delay me very much.
I deem it my duty, however, to assist you to the last
extremity.</p>

          <p>When, after many vicissitudes and tribulations, the
bank of the river was reached without encountering
the enemy the most difficult part of the journey was
still to be made. When the width of the river is
remembered, that the enemy's gun boats were lying
in plain sight, ready to send a shot in any direction
that suited their errant fancy, the situation may be
imagined, and when to this is added a description of
the mode of conveyance proposed and successfully
put in use, the account seems almost incredible.
Two long “dugouts” - i. e., trunks of trees hollowed
out in the centre, were procured. The ambulance
was then driven into the water and the “dugouts”
placed beneath the wheels, and the mules swimming
bore the ambulance across the river. In the night the
passage was made; and lying clearly defined up and
down the broad waters were the Yankee gunboats,
their grim shapes looming like the awful monsters
they were, with power to hurl
<pb id="wright207" n="207"/>
death and destruction in an instant, should even a suspicion
arise of the daring travelers on their way over the Father of
Waters in that frail craft. And when I remember who was
seated there, so calm and composed - in all that danger
and terrible risk - my gentle mother, the most feminine of
women, I am lost in admiration of her amazing courage.
In telling of it all her comment was: “And the mules would
snort; and made such a dreadful noise that we expected
every moment the gunboats would hear and send a shot
across our bows!” But they reached the shore in safety
and we were now on our way to Richmond for the fateful
winter of 1864.</p>

DECEMBER 5, 1864 - THE FIGHT AT FRANKLIN - MARCHING TO

        </argument>
        <p>THE following letter written from near Nashville by
my brother, is given here:</p>
        <div2 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <opener>
            <dateline>“AT MRS. OVERTON'S,<lb/>
“Six Miles from Nashville,<lb/>
“On Columbia Turnpike,<lb/>
“Dec. 5th, 1864.</dateline>
          </opener>
          <p>“I wrote you a short note from the other side of
Franklin the morning after the battle. I have not
written oftener because I have been unwilling to
trust letters to the mail, as I suppose communication
has been interrupted between Macon and Augusta.
We left Florence, Alabama, on the 21st of
November; we reached Columbia and after
remaining in front of the place two or three days
it was evacuated by the enemy who then took
position on the north bank of Duck River,
immediately opposite the town. There was some
<pb id="wright212" n="212"/>
artillery firing and sharp shooting across the river
and it was in this on the 28th that Col. Beckham
was wounded. I have not heard from him since the
morning of the 1st. when he was doing well, but
the wound is so severe (the skull fractured) that I
fear he will not recover. In fact the surgeon said
there was a bare possibility of his surviving. His loss
will be very severely felt. It is hard enough to be
killed at all, but to be killed in such an insignificant
affair makes it doubly bad.</p>
          <p>“The fight at Franklin was very severe - while it
lasted, and though our loss was heavy, everybody
is in the finest humor - and ready for the fight again
whenever Gen. ‘John B.’ gives the word. Col.
Cofer, Provost Marshall Gen. of the Army, told
me the other day that he had taken particular pains
to find out by enquiring the feelings of the men and
that the <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of the army was very much improved
by the fight, and that the men would go into the next
with double vim and impetuosity.</p>
          <p>“Our men fought with the utmost determination
and if we had had three hours more of daylight
I feel as confident as possible that we should have
been to-day in Nashville. The Yankees are now
in their works around the city and our main line
is at one point only twelve hundred yards from
theirs. We have captured three engines and
about twenty cars and I hope before long to hear
the shriek of the locomotive once more. The
<pb id="wright213" n="213"/>
country we have marched through for the past fifty
miles is one of the gardens of the world. The lands
are very fertile, the plantations well improved and
the people before the war were in the possession
of every comfort and luxury. The destruction, too,
caused by the Yankees, is not to be compared to
that in other sections occupied by them. There
has been no part of the Confederacy that I have
seen which has been in their possession and has
suffered so little.</p>
          <p>“Our Army, in leaving Tennessee, on both
occasions previously, passed to the East of this
portion of the state, so that an Army has never
before marched over it. The Yankees too have
held it a long time and I imagine considered it
permanently in their possession. We reached this
place on the night of the 2nd. There are several
young ladies from Nashville here who are very
pretty and agreeable and the most intense
Southerners. The enemy was forced from his
position north of Duck River by a flank movement
which placed the whole army except, two
Divisions, near his communications. He fell back
to Franklin that night and the next day, the 30th
November, was the battle of Franklin.</p>
          <p>“Dec. 8th. I have heard this morning of poor
Beckham's death. What a cruel, hard thing is war!
The individual suffering, however, is the public
gain. Over the road, on which moved Cheatham's
Corps, was hung, just at the Tennessee
<pb id="wright214" n="214"/>
State line, an inscription in these words: ‘Tennessee,
A grave, or a free home.’ A good many
graves have been already filled - but better we
should all meet that fate than fail to gain the
prize we struggle for. As he passed over the line,
Gen. Hood received a formal welcome into the
state from Governor Harris, who has been with
us since we took up the line of march for Tennessee.
If we can gain Nashville, what a glorious
termination it will be for the campaign. Even
if we fail in this, for I fear the fortifications are
too strong, and hold the enemy in his lines round
the city, it will be one of the grandest achievements
an army has ever performed. Think of it! Starting
from Lovejoy's thirty miles beyond Atlanta on
the 18th Sept., here we are on the 8th Dec. in
front of Nashville with the enemy cooped up in
his works and the fruits of two years hard
marching and fighting lost to him. . . . </p>
          <p>“Dec. 11. There was communion service held at
the house this morning. Dr. Quintard officiated
and prayer was offered up for the Confederate
Congress for the first time publicly in this country,
I suppose, since our army retreated from the state.
It is bitterly cold. Fortunately the troops are
lying quiet and can have their fires to keep warm
by. I feel, I assure you, for the poor fellows in
the skirmish line in such weather.</p>
          <p>“In each brigade a detail has been set at work
making shoes for the barefooted men from leather
<pb id="wright215" n="215"/>
obtained in the country. They are making some
twenty pairs a day in each brigade, and in addition,
there is a large supply coming from the rear, so
you see we are getting on finely.</p>
          <p>“The Quartermasters and Commissaries too are
hard at work getting other supplies and the R. R.
is in operation from Pulaski to Franklin. We
have gotten into a real land of plenty and I
sincerely trust we shall never leave the State except
it be to enter Kentucky. I don't believe myself
that the Yankees will allow us to enter Winter
Quarters, even should we desire it, without a fight.
Of course, in order to make a fight they must
leave their entrenchments, and if they attack us
in ours or allow us to attack them without works,
I feel not the slightest fear of the result. . . . ”</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="chapter 12" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <p>We made the journey to Richmond with all
possible speed, my father being eager to be at
his post in the Senate; and on our arrival we took
up our quarters at “The Spotswood.” We found
the spirit of the people unchanged. Our reverses
in the field were acknowledged; our diminishing
resources were apparent to all; shot and shell and
disease had decimated our gallant armies; the land
ran red with blood and the wail of the widow and
the orphan was heard above the roar and din of
battle; yet no voice was raised to cry, “Hold, it
is enough. Ultimate defeat was not contemplated,
<pb id="wright216" n="216"/>
nor discussed as a possibility. And the women, of
all the women in the world the most gentle and
feminine, and upon whom the suffering and sorrow
of the time pressed most heavily, the women of the
South, were, if possible, more indomitable in their
courage than the men! It was the “tender fierceness
of the dove,” while into their own gentle breasts
they received each wound by which a hero fell.
Of them, as of the Blessed Sorrowing Mother,
may be truly said, “Yea and a sword shall pierce
through thine own soul also.”</p>
          <p>I have in my mind, as I write, a picture that comes
before me whenever I hear of the suffering of
the women of the South. I was on a train, after
Appomattox, and seated across the aisle were
two figures, a mother and her son. She had
journeyed from her far-away home in Alabama
to the hospital in Richmond to find her boy and
bring him back with her. She found him, sitting
there waiting for her, blind and helpless, a minié-ball
having passed through his head just back of the
eyes, absolutely destroying the optic nerve. How
she had made that journey, in weariness and
painfulness with the hope deferred and the sickening
terror of what awaited her at the end, we can
never know. She was of the class called “poor
white,” her faded calico gown was worn and
patched; her cheek was pale and the eyes deep-set
and pitiful beyond words. At her side sat a patient
figure; the hands folded in pathetic idleness;
<pb id="wright217" n="217"/>
the sightless eyes closed. His life work done; his
young manhood yet in its dawning!</p>
          <p>The war is over: and he, blind and helpless as an
infant, is journeying to his desolate, ruined home,
one among the thousands of the wrecks from the
armies of the South! But in the heart of the poor
old mother there was still room for a great joy -
he was blind and helpless - but - he was alive!
She had him safe, and the spirit of her mother love
seemed hovering over him and enfolding him with
the wings of peace.</p>

        </argument>
        <p>No INSTANCE of the absolute faith of our people,
even at this late day, in the success of our Cause,
is more convincing than their investment of money in
Confederate bonds, during these last months of the
war.</p>
        <p>Many circumstances could be related in evidence
of this fact; but one will suffice. My grandmother,
in Providence, Rhode Island, had succeeded by
some means in sending to us through the lines
$1,000 in gold. Without a moment's hesitation
this precious metal was transmuted into Confederate
bank notes, a large package of which, consisting
of 500- and 100- dollar bills I have with me
now, a constant reminder of the implicit faith in
the success of the good Cause that was lost. I am
sure my father would have felt he was recreant to
his country if he had admitted to himself that
Confederate money was not as good as gold. It
<pb id="wright222" n="222"/>
may not have been of the wisdom of this world,
but it was beautiful, and I am glad he did it and
I keep my bank notes and shall leave them to
those that come after me, as an infallible proof
that the civilization of the old South produced a
race of men, who maintained what they believed
to be their constitutional rights, sacrificed every
material gain, and, giving freely of their own
lives and the lives of their sons, would not
withhold the baser treasures of silver and gold.</p>

restore public confidence, but would strengthen the

under the gallant Hood, so far from fulfilling the
bright hopes of its leader, returned from a disastrous

march to the sea, was devastating the fair country
through which he passed.</p>
          <p>The following letter, written to me by Mrs. Joseph

          <p>“ . . . I take advantage of this sweet, quiet Sunday
afternoon for a little chat with you. It is so quiet in
my little nook and the bright sunshine outside looks
so cheerful and calm that 'tis hard to realize the
terrible storm of war that is raging within a few
miles of us, or the scene of excitement and fatigue I
have gone through myself. At last Sherman has
planted himself upon Carolina soil, and the pretty
little town of Columbia, we learn to-day, has been
partially destroyed; and alas the poor women and
children, who were forced to remain there, of their
fate we know nothing; but oh horrors, have
everything to fear from the nature of the savages
who are desolating their homes. What a sight it was
to see the poor people flying almost terror stricken
to know what they could do - many leaving with
only little bundles of clothes - and many compelled to
<pb id="wright229" n="229"/>
remain, for they had nothing but God to look to for
shelter. . . . I left at the last moment on the car that
brought the powder out. We only saved our clothes.
How fortunate we were to do that, for many saved
nothing. We left with the roar of the cannon in our
ears!</p>
          <p>“ . . . I arrived here, after spending two days and
nights on the road - three hundred poor women on
the car ahead of us - none of us able to get rooms.
A gentleman came down to the cars at twelve at
night and brought me to this home and gave me this
delicious little room, and here I am quite sick, with
a Doctor visiting me. I am waiting to hear from the
General to know what to do. Oh these terrible times
of shipwreck - everything looks hopeless to me
now, and then if we are to go down - we are so far
apart that we can see nothing of each other, but the
glimpse of a pale face as it sinks out of sight! What
a glorious struggle our brave people have made
for their liberties! The sight of this town to-day is
lamentable: women hunting in every direction for
shelter - and the people themselves beginning to
move off for a safer place.”</p>

        <div2 type="chapter 13" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
          <p>A braver man, a purer patriot, a more gallant
soldier never breathed than General Hood.
Aggressive, bold and eager, the “Fabian” Policy of
General Johnston was opposed to all the natural
impulses of his nature. He revelled in “a fight,”
and firmly believed he could lead his troops to a
victorious conclusion in the active operations he
inaugurated on taking command of the Army of
Tennessee. Though, as stated, he remonstrated on
General Johnston's being removed from command,
yet I have no doubt his soldier heart beat with eager
hope, as he was called to take his place, and he saw
in fancy his brave army marching to victory. He was
a man of singular simplicity of character and charm
of manner--boyish in his enthusiasm - superbly
handsome, with beautiful blue eyes, golden hair and
flowing beard - broad shouldered, tall and erect - a
noble man of undaunted courage and blameless life.
We made the journey with him homeward when the
war was over. I can see him now - we were in a
baggage car, seated on boxes and trunks in all the
misery and discomfort of the time. He sat opposite,
and with calm, sad eyes looked out on the passing
scenes, apparently noting nothing. The cause he
loved was lost - he was overwhelmed
<figure id="ill27" entity="wright230">
<p>LIEUTENANT-GENERAL JOHN B. HOOD, C. S. A.</p>
</figure>
<pb id="wright231" n="231"/>
with humiliation at the utter failure of his leadership -
his pride was wounded to the quick by his
removal from command and Johnston's
reinstatement in his place; he was maimed by the
loss of a leg in battle. In the face of his misery,
which was greater than our own, we sat silent - 
there seemed no comfort anywhere. And the ending
of his life, years after, was even more sombre -
dying by the side of his wife with yellow fever and
leaving a family of little children to mourn a father,
who, though unsuccessful in the glorious ambition
of his young manhood, left to them the precious
heritage of a stainless name, linked ever with
the highest courage and purest patriotism.</p>

<hi rend="italics">“Sir:</hi> The undersigned beg leave earnestly but
respectfully to recommend the assignment of Genl.
Joseph E. Johnston to the command of the troops
lately composing the Army of Tennessee. We are
induced to make this suggestion by information
derived from such sources as to leave us no
<pb id="wright236" n="236"/>
room to doubt its correctness, that the Army
referred to is seriously disorganized, and that the
surest, if not the only means of effecting its speedy
reorganization, and of restoring its discipline and
efficiency in time for the approaching campaign,
will be the immediate return of its former
commander, whose assignment to that position is
universally desired by the Officers and Soldiers of
that Army. We are further persuaded that among
the people of those important and principal States
of the Confederacy which have looked to the
Army of Tennessee as furnishing their chief defence
against the forces with which the enemy is seeking
to overcome them, the desire is not only general,
but intense, that the principal Army designed for
their protection should be placed under the command
of Genl. Johnston. And we are convinced that the
gratification of their wishes on this point would
materially assist in dissipating the feeling of
despondency which undoubtedly prevails to a
considerable extent in those States, and do
much towards restoring public confidence and
reanimating the hopes and courage of the people.</p>
            <p>“In making this suggestion to you, we assume
that under the recent Act, by virtue of which, you
have been appointed General in Chief of the Armies
of the Confederate States, the right and duty of
assigning the General Officers to command our
<figure id="ill28" entity="wright236">
<p>MISS MARY MABEN, OF VIRGINIA<lb/>(Mrs. Frank Peyton Clark, of Baltimore)</p>

<pb id="wright237" n="237"/>
different Armies, are devolved upon you. Such we
believe was the intention of Congress in passing
the Act, and such we trust will be its practical
construction.</p>
            <p>“In conclusion we beg leave to assure you that in
recommending the assignment of Genl. Johnston to
the command in question, we have been influenced
by an imperative sense of duty, and by a firm
conviction that what we have advised, would be
promotive of the public good, if indeed it be not
essential to the public safety.</p>

of the 4th inst., recommending the assignment of
Genl. Jos. E. Johnston to the command of the
Army of Tennessee. The three corps of that Army
have been ordered to So. Ca., and are now under
the command of Gent. Beauregard, two of them
having already arrived in that Deptmt. I entertain
a high opinion of Gen. Johnston's capacity, but
think a continued change of commanders is very
injurious to any troops, and tends greatly to their
disorganization. At this time as far as I understand
the condition of affairs, an engagement with the
enemy may be expected any day, and a change
now would be particularly hazardous. Genl.
Beauregard is well known to the citizens of So.
Ca., as well as to the troops of the Army of
Tennessee, and I would recommend that it be certainly

it should. I can only employ such troops and

          <p>It seems almost incredible and yet it is a fact that
several entertainments were given in Richmond
in January and February, 1865. The most
notable of these was at the beautiful home of the
Welfords which was filled with guests who
danced at what, I believe, was the last ball of the
Confederacy. Grandmothers' satins and brocades
figured on the occasion; and I warrant no lovelier
group of women, nor company of more gallant
gentlemen, were ever gathered. How the fiddles
scraped and the music swelled for “the dancers
dancing in tune;” while they shut their ears and
would not hear the minor key that wailed the ruin
of our hopes. And the grim shade of Appomattox,
looming dark already on the horizon, stalked ever
nearer and nearer.</p>

Everybody seems to think it is the prelude to the
abandonment of Richmond. How sad it seems

effort to conceal his identity, and endeavor to

          <p>The next step was to secure a large covered
wagon, in which could be stowed away the few
belongings we had with us, and four strong mules
to draw the load. Then an escort of paroled Texas
soldiers was found, among whom my father took
his place. Some kind friend provided a saddle
horse for me; and clad in a homespun dress, and
with my head covered by a poke sun-bonnet I
rode alongside of the wagon. We were apparently
a family of country people moving from one State
to another; and that a number of soldiers tramped
along in company with us excited no

surprise, as the country side was full of these poor
tired, heart broken travelers, making their way back
to their ruined homes. It is recorded of one of these
pitiful wayfarers, that he wandered at eventide to the
door of a farmhouse, and accosted the woman
standing there, with “Stranger, whar's the
spring - have you got any milk? I am so <sic>hongry,</sic> I
don't know where I am going to sleep to-night.” But
to return to our journey. Our plan was to travel direct
through the State of Alabama to Montgomery. And
this we did, riding one hundred miles through the
State. Of course we had no money; that is, what the
outside world called by that name. We had thousands
of our dear old Confederate Currency, in $100 and
$500 bills, (with Stonewall Jackson's head engraved
in one corner, and the Confederate banner draped
over General Washington, on the Great Seal, with
<foreign lang="la">“Deo Vindice”</foreign> underneath it, on the other) but some
kind friend had given us a large box of tobacco,
which was as good as specie any time for <hi rend="italics">a trade -</hi>
so we went on our way - not rejoicing - alas! far
from it; but with heavy hearts - while my father
tramped the weary miles on foot among the Texas
boys, who were proud enough to have the company
of their former General and Senator in such unceremonious
guise. And you may be sure they never told who he
was. All things come to an end; and nearing Montgomery
we stopped over night at Governor Fitzpatrick's
<pb id="wright245" n="245"/>
plantation, and had a rousing welcome and the
best accommodations for tired travelers. My
father and the Governor had much to talk over.
When last he had seen him he was United States
Senator from Alabama, and possible candidate
for the Vice-Presidency on the Breckinridge ticket.
And now! Well, the next morning we continued
on our way, and nearing Montgomery we caught
sight of the first Federal pickets. I can feel now
over again that suffocating sensation that sent the
blood surging through the veins at sight of them.
It was all over indeed!</p>
          <p>Here we parted from my father, who was to
make his way with the soldiers, home to Texas,
as it was not safe to go with us, through towns and
in the ordinary mode of traveling by railway and
boat. We were received into the hospitable home
of Mrs. Knox on the outskirts of Montgomery.
Here, even the stress and straits of war had not
been able to make an impression on the delightful
luxury of her well appointed home. Oh! the bliss
of those delicious beds and the sweet linen sheets
and the comfortable meals. It seemed like a haven
of rest after that terrible journey. In a few days
Governor Watts, true friend and noble patriot,
with heart and hand open to share his all with his
countrymen, came for us and took us to his home,
where plans were made for our reaching our
ultimate destination. Here we waited for some
weeks, hoping for tidings from my brother, who
<pb id="wright246" n="246"/>
we had heard was making his way in our direction.
One evening, about dark, I was standing at the
gate, watching down the road, with hardly a
thought or hope of his appearing, when, far up
the dusty highway, I saw him coming. He walked
slowly, unlike the brisk step I knew of old; absolute
dejection was in his mien, and he had no joyous
greeting to give me. His uniform was worn and
soiled, and he had taken from his collar the gold
stars of his rank. Somehow I had no word to say. We
stood and looked at each other. Finally, we found
speech, and to my query, “What are you going to
do?” he answered, “I am on my way across the river
to join Kirby Smith.” I laid my hand upon his
shoulder, and paused a moment, “Have you not
heard,” I said, “ Kirby Smith has surrendered.”</p>
