        <p>It is my opinion that few persons who possess a liberal
education, but what, if they make the effort, could write
some sort of a book; but to write a book and make it
interesting, at the same time have it contain truth and
common sense, is no easy task; but to write one and let it
contain nothing except plain facts, without any of the
coloring which we would give to fiction, and which adds so
much charm to the book and interest for the reader, is a
greater and much more laborious task.</p>
        <p>In writing this little book, I have endeavored to keep it
clear of all fiction and romance, and to place only facts
before the reader. I have not drawn upon my imagination
for any incident contained
<pb id="jcop6" n="6"/>
in the following pages. Perhaps some of the
incidents may appear unreasonable to those who
have grown up within the last decade, and know but
little, practically, of the war between the States, and
nothing whatever of the life of a prisoner of war;
nevertheless, they are all stubborn facts.</p>
        <p>I have not been solicited by any one to write these
reminiscences, but do so through a desire to give
my boys, some idea of a few of the painful scenes
and terrible consequences of that fearful war of
1861-1865.</p>
        <p>I shall in this brief little history of prison-life
passed in the military prison at Camp Douglas,
Illinois, give the unwritten incidents which occurred
within the inclosure of the prison walls, at least, the
part in which myself, with a few others participated,
and to describe minutely, as near as possible, all the
inanimate objects and some of the animate, together
with full particulars of all the occurrences which
happened within my observation. I desire, as it were,
to have the reader accompany me within the
inclosure of the prison walls and paint the whole as
<pb id="jcop7" n="7"/>
nearly as possible as it transpired—let him view
it with the mind's eye in its reality, without
exaggeration or coloring.</p>
        <p>It is my intention to give the reader a faithful and
true account of all that passed before me while I
was a prisoner of war, with which I was personally
connected; also those of which I was an eye-witness,
at the time and place of which I am writing.
Not our meals only shall be fully and particularly
described, but our table-ware, from the oyster-can to
the tin plate.</p>
        <p>I am not a gentleman of wealth or leisure; hence,
I have been unable to devote a year or two in
preparing the manuscript for the publisher, but have
been compelled to scratch it off at odd times when I
could do so, without encroaching upon my business.</p>
        <p>My attempt has been to use the simplest
language, to make my meaning clear, and the
construction accurate. Whenever I have seen proper
to quote anything from others, I have indicated the
same by quotation points.</p>

              <l>Sometimes present her naked to men's eyes.”</l>

          <p>“But what is history? An echo of the past in the
future; a reflex from the future on the past. History
is night. In history there is no second tier. That
which is no longer on the stage immediately fades
into obscurity. The scene is shifted, and all is at
once forgotten. The past has a synonym, the
unknown.”</p>
          <p>In 1861, when the war broke out between the
<pb id="jcop14" n="14"/>
Northern and Southern States, I was then a boy and
had just entered my fifteenth year; and being caught
in the wave of enthusiasm which swept over the land
joined a company of Volunteers, was mustered into
the service of what was then called the Confederate
States Government, in Company B, Forty-ninth
Regiment of Tennessee Infantry. This regiment
when first organized was commanded by Colonel
James E. Bailey and Lieutenant Colonel Alford 
Robb, both of Clarksville, Tennessee, and numbered
near one thousand strong. There were but few men in
this regiment over thirty years of age. Company B
was organized at Charlotte, Dickson county,
Tennessee, and numbered near one hundred men,
rank and file, and was commanded by Captain
Thomas K. Grigsby. This company had more boys,
whose ages ranged from fourteen to twenty years
old, than any other in the regiment when first
mustered into service.</p>
          <p>My first service as a soldier was rendered at Fort
Donelson, on Cumberland river, eighty miles below
the city of Nashville, Tennessee. When Fort
Donelson fell into the hands of the
<pb id="jcop15" n="15"/>
Federal troops, I was lying in the hospital at 
Nashville, sick from a severe attack of pneumonia. It
was a large and commodious brick building, two
stories high, situate near and fronting Cumberland
river, and had but recently been converted into what
was known as the Ensly Hospital.</p>
          <p>My cot on which I was lying was near a window,
which commanded a fine view of the river, as the
transports crowded with troops came up the river,
within sight of the city. As the transports
approached the city, the troops wearing the blue
uniform, with their banners flying, the Stars and
Stripes proudly floating in the breeze from the
mast-heads of all the vessels, the bands playing Yankee
Doodle, and various national airs, presented quite an
imposing appearance. As the steamers rounded in
for the landing, all the bands on board struck up
Dixie, and filled the air with music for several
minutes.</p>
          <p>As soon as the troops disembarked they took
immediate possession of the city, with, of course,
the hospitals and sick included. Everybody fled
from the hospitals who were able to do so,
<pb id="jcop16" n="16"/>
before the Federal troops entered the city. Our army
surgeons, prescriptionists, hospital stewards,
nurses, and the attendants of all classes, fled at the
approach of the Federal transports, and left us
entirely alone to whatever fate might befall us. We
were all too sick to make even an effort to escape,
but contented ourselves the best we could under the
circumstances, and remained.</p>
          <p>Sentinels were immediately placed inside and
around the hospital, one at the entrance of the
stairway, at the foot of the stairs on the ground,
another at the top of the stairway on the inside, near
the entrance to my ward. These sentinels were
relieved from guard duty every two hours. We were
not left long without attention, for the ladies of
Nashville came into the hospital at once, took full
charge of the sick, and soon made us feel very
comfortable and as though our own mothers had
suddenly appeared in our midst; they soon materially
improved our condition in many respects, and made
strenuous efforts to have us removed to their private
residences, but the Federal authorities would not
allow it, and we had to remain in the hospital. That
grand
<pb id="jcop17" n="17"/>
old city of Nashville could always boast of its noble
southern women. The ladies of that city have
always been particularly noted for their generosity,
Christianity, culture and refinement; on no
occasion, before the war or since, has this
reputation been found to be only a noiseless fame.
The author of the following lines must have been
indebted to women of this character, when he
expressed the beautiful sentiment that, “Woman is
the sweetest present that God has given to man.
Woman has a smile for every joy, a tear for every
sorrow, a consolation for every grief, an excuse for
every fault, a prayer for every misfortune, and an
encouragement for every hope.”</p>
          <p>I remained in the hospital at Nashville for several
days after its capture, more dead than alive, and
during all this time these noble women remained
near us, doing everything in their power to alleviate
our suffering. A Mrs. Cartwright and a young lady
whom I understood to be a relative of hers, waited
upon me continually, one or the other of them was
in my ward day and night, and attended to all of my
little
<pb id="jcop18" n="18"/>
peevish whims and wants; they bestowed upon me that
motherly kindness which only a woman knows how to
do.</p>
          <p>The Federal army surgeons, after taking charge of the
hospital, were very kind to the sick in the ward which I
occupied. I never met with better treatment, or had more
kindness shown me by our own army surgeons, than these
disciples of Esculapius did during my stay there under their
charge and care. One very nice little fellow closely attended
upon me, and manifested considerable interest in my
recovery. He was a gentleman, and I am sorry that I never
learned his name. I admired him for his kindness and
gentlemanly conduct.</p>
          <p>One morning, as I lay on my cot unable to sit up, busy
with all manner of sad and gloomy reflections concerning
my present, as well as future condition, I was surprised by
the appearance in my ward of a young man, tall, slender,
and rather good looking, who looked to be about twenty-five
years of age, dressed in a blue uniform, and inquired of
the two ladies in attendance “If there was any one in that
ward who belonged to the
<pb id="jcop19" n="19"/>
Forty-ninth Regiment of Tennessee Infantry?” Mrs.
Cartwright, one of the ladies present, conducted him to the
cot I occupied, and with the first flash of his eyes he
recognized me, and exclaimed at once, “Is that you, John?”
I answered, “yes,” as that was my name, but failed to
recognize him, due, perhaps, to the fact that I was very sick
at the time and able to pay but little attention to anything.
After a brief conversation which soon refreshed my
memory, I remembered him as having been an old
acquaintance and friend of my earliest boyhood days,
although he was several years my senior. He informed me
that he would have me sent home. The reader can better
imagine my delight than I can describe it.</p>
          <p>He requested Mrs. Cartwright to obtain a citizen's suit
of men's clothing and to have me dressed in them by
9 o'clock a. m. on the following morning; he enjoined perfect
secrecy upon each of us, and then took his departure. Mrs.
Cartwright brought me a full suit of black, including a hat,
and at the time appointed she, with the assistance of
another lady, had succeeded
<pb id="jcop20" n="20"/>
in making the disguise complete. I was now ready
to leave, and lay covered up on my cot patiently
waiting for the return of my friend. My military cap
I left in the hospital, as a souvenir to the guard, but I
specially avoided calling his attention to it. I do not
know that he ever found it, as I failed to return and
ask him.</p>
          <p>Soon after nine o'clock a. m. the young man
appeared at the head of the stairs, spoke a few words
to the sentinel, then came to where I was lying on
my cot, carefully examined to see if my disguise
would stand the test; after satisfying himself that
nothing more was necessary, and that all was in good
shape, he picked me up in his arms, as though I were
nothing more than a small boy, then started for the
door. As we passed the sentinels at the top and
bottom of the stairs, he spoke something to each in
a low tone; they stood aside and let him pass with
me. We soon reached the side-walk in front of the
hospital. Cumberland river was very high, in fact,
higher than it had been for several years; the water
covered the street in our front, reaching within two
feet of the side-walk. The Federal
<pb id="jcop21" n="21"/>
gunboats and transports were anchored in the river a
short distance from the street, and there appeared to
be nothing facing the hospital but a sea of muddy
water and these fierce looking war vessels with their
port-holes, ready to send forth death and destruction
over the city. Near the hospital and a little south of
it, a large brick building or block had but recently
burned down; all the rubbish still remained. West of
this burnt district, an alley ran east and west; this
alley crossed a public street on the west, which ran
north and south, continuing until it intersected an
alley still farther west, which ran north and south.
This part of Nashville, at this day and time, presents
quite a different appearance, as compared with it
then; any one to see it now would not recognize it as
the Nashville of 1862. After landing on the side-walk,
the hard rub presented itself in evading the
patrol or police guards, who were patrolling the
city. To enter the first alley without discovery, this
burnt district had to be crossed, and if we could get
into the rubbish without discovery, then we would
be in no danger of coming in contact
<pb id="jcop22" n="22"/>
with any of the police guards until we reached the
public street some distance from where it was intersected
by the alley running north and south. He succeeded in
safely landing us over the debris, and we entered the alley
from the west side of the street.</p>
          <p>We now traversed several back ways and alleys for
some distance, carefully avoiding all public thoroughfares,
when at length we came out into a public street in the main
part of the city, and the first face that greeted us was a
police guard, who belonged to the Federal army; he
promptly ordered us to halt; fortunately, this guard was an
intimate friend and acquaintance of the gentleman with me.
He asked my friend where he was carrying that sick young
man(?); his reply was, that I had been acting as clerk for a
business firm in the city, and that I had been unable to be
removed until now, that he was carrying me over to my
home, which was only a few blocks off. This satisfied the
guard, or at least appeared to; he stepped aside and
permitted us to pass.</p>
          <p>We made quite a circuit around and through
<pb id="jcop23" n="23"/>
the city, and avoided all public streets and places, when
finally we came to a number of teams and wagons; the
wagons were being loaded with farmers' supplies. My
friend seemed to be very familiar with the owners of the
teams and wagons, but I knew none of them. He, with the
assistance of another gentleman, placed me in one of the
wagon beds, covered me up closely and carefully with
straw, blankets and sacks, until I was securely hid from
view; all signs of daylight were completely obliterated,
except just enough air for ventilation. After this was all
finished, my friend shook my hand and whispered, “that I
was now all right, to say nothing and I would be safe.” He
then left me, and I saw no more of him. Within an hour or
so, this small caravan of teams and wagons started out of
the city.</p>
          <p>I said nothing and could hear but little, as I was so
completely covered up from the outer world. At the
Federal picket lines, on the outskirts of Nashville, the
teams were all stopped in the road and the wagons
searched, but not very closely, and the picket guards failed
to discover
<pb id="jcop24" n="24"/>
me; hence, my anxiety was considerably relieved, and I felt
that my escape was an assured success. I now fully
realized the fact that there are situations in life when the
slightest agreeable sensation alleviates all our suffering and
ills. We traveled until late that evening, and sometime after
dark stopped at a road-side inn, or country tavern, as this
class of stopping places on the public highways were
generally called by the people of Middle Tennessee at that
day and time.</p>
          <p>Several travelers had already stopped at this place for
the night, and a few of them worried me no little with their
solicitude concerning my illness, and exposing myself to the
bad weather, all of which I considered none of their
business. I was well cared for here during the night, and
was made to feel quite at home; being only a smooth-faced
youth, of course, I was never questioned in regard to the
army. I appreciated this part of the programme highly, for
on this subject I adopted the better policy, which was to
keep silent when anything concerning the war was
mentioned. After an early breakfast the
<pb id="jcop25" n="25"/>
next morning, our wagons moved on again, and the same
precaution was observed in keeping me closely covered up
from view as in Nashville, when we started on the previous
day. In the afternoon, the wagon I occupied stopped in
front of a neat and cozy farmhouse on the roadside. The
appearance of everything about the house and farm was
indicative of neatness, comfort and refinement, and all
seemed to be very inviting to a stranger, who was both
sick and tired.</p>
          <p>I now learned that this place was the home of the friend,
in whose wagon I had been riding all the way from
Nashville, and who had been so active and generous in
facilitating my escape, had given me the benefit of his
services during the entire trip from Nashville, and that his
name was Gillum. A very genial looking matronly lady,
whom I learned was Mr. Gillum's wife, came out to the
wagon, and assisted me in getting into the house, and to a
nice and comfortable feather bed. She immediately gave
me her special attention, and could hardly do enough for
me. Mr. Gillum informed her who I was, and how I had
been taken out of the hospital at Nashville. This
<pb id="jcop26" n="26"/>
seemed to enlist her sympathetic motherly feelings, and as
long as I remained with them, they acted towards and
treated me as though I were their own son. They never, at
any time during my visit, failed to bestow upon me an act
of kindness, when it was necessary. I will say that these
people were some of the kindest and best I ever met in my
life.</p>
          <p>I was near twenty miles from Nashville, and felt tolerably
safe and secure, and had but little to fear from the hands of
the Federal troops. My friend in Nashville, who carried me
out of the hospital, wrote to my parents and informed them
of my escape, also, as to my whereabouts. After remaining
with this excellent family about fifteen days, my father came
for me and carried me home, although, by this time, I had
only recovered sufficiently to sit up a little each day and
walk across my room. Mrs. Gillum had done all within her
power to improve and better my health. I would be
delighted to meet these good people now, and have an
opportunity again of expressing to them my sincerest thanks
and gratitude for the kindness they so voluntarily
<pb id="jcop27" n="27"/>
bestowed upon me while I was a boy-soldier, away from
home, acquaintances and friends, sick, helpless and worst
of all, absolutely penniless.</p>
          <p>My regiment was captured at the fall of Fort Donelson,
and sent off to a Northern prison, and I remained at home
until it was exchanged and sent back South to Port
Hudson, Louisiana, at which place I rejoined it soon after
its arrival. I was never absent from duty again, but served
with it in all the battles and skirmishes in which it was
engaged, including that celebrated Georgia campaign,
where we were under fire from the enemy's guns for four
months continually day and night. Hood's advance into
Tennessee to Franklin, terminated my <sic corr="fighting">fighing</sic> career with
that battle on the 30th day of November, 1864, when, then
and there:  -</p>

          <p>It is not my purpose to attempt to give a graphic
description of, or to enter into the minute details of this
battle, for the following reasons: First, my incompetency to
undertake such an arduous task, as I have no access to
war records, or to any plans of that battle for a guide; and
second, the years intervening between that time and the
present, have caused the bloody scene somewhat to fade
from memory's view. It was one of those quick and
sanguinary conflicts, into which armies are sometimes
hurriedly precipitated, and which are of short duration<corr>.</corr>
<pb id="jcop29" n="29"/>
They are fought and terminated without any studied, or
carefully matured plans. I shall only attempt to sketch that
portion of it in which the command to which I belonged
participated, as well as I can from memory, after the lapse
of more than a quarter of a century.</p>
          <p>When General J. B. Hood, at the head of the
Confederate army, entered the State of Tennessee, with a
view of taking the city of Nashville, the Federal troops
under the command of General Schofield, were occupying
the town of Columbia, where they attempted to check the
further advance of Hood and his army, but after some
sharp fighting and considerable skirmishing, they were
driven out of the town and across Duck river, and forced
to evacuate the place, falling back in the direction of the
town of Franklin. Our corps (Stewart's) arrived in front of
Columbia some time after dark on the 28th of November,
1864, and went into camp in a field. The company to
which I belonged occupied that portion on which had been
grown a crop of Irish potatoes, they still being in the
ground.</p>
          <p>After drawing our rations, which consisted
<pb id="jcop30" n="30"/>
of small pieces of pork, which had never been salted, we
soon had a large camp-kettle full of potatoes and pork on a
blazing fire we had made out of fence rails, and by the time
the wee small hours were drawing near, we were enjoying
a delightful supper consisting of Irish potatoes and fat pork,
independent of salt. The ground on which we were camping
furnished the potatoes, after hard work grabbling them in
the dark. The rations of pork, which were intended to last
us three days, were the most of any kind we had drawn for
several days, for during our long and toilsome march from
Lovejoy station in Georgia, we had but little to eat at any
time, save and except the juice we could obtain by chewing
sorghum stalks, whenever a crop of that could be found.
Sometimes, we were able to secure a little corn; this we
would parch during the night, after going into camp. Many
of our soldiers were barefooted, and their clothing very
ragged; added to this, what little money we possessed was
worthless; yet, the soldiers were buoyant and hopeful.</p>
          <p>When the sun rose on the following morning,
<pb id="jcop31" n="31"/>
throwing his gentle rays beneath a cloudless sky causing the
cold and misty frost to vanish, our troops were ready for
action, and in high spirits at the prospect of having a brush
with Schofield's army, but in this, we were disappointed.
The Federals, instead of giving us battle, simply tried to
hold our advance in check until their wagons and ordnance
stores could be removed to a safe distance from capture,
while their columns of infantry kept falling back. The rear
guard, who covered their retreat, was closely pressed by a
corps of Hood's infantry, while another portion of his
infantry and Forrest's cavalry crossed the river to the right
of Columbia, and by a forced march on their flank,
endeavored to intercept their advance guard, in order to
cut off their retreat and capture Schofield and his army.</p>
          <p>Our corps was also thrown across the river and hurried
forward on a run, over hills and through the woods, to
effect a junction with the troops who had been sent
forward ahead of us. We moved forward over rocks, hills,
down steep hollows, over stone and rail fences, through
thick
<pb id="jcop32" n="32"/>
underbrush, as fast as possible; frequently the field officers
had to dismount and lead their horses by the bridle through
narrow defiles and over steep declivities. Orders were
continually being given along our line to close up and
double-quick; wherever the ground would permit, we went
on a run. Very often news would be sent down the line,
that the cavalry and infantry ahead of us had succeeded in
establishing a line of battle across the road in front of the
Federal army, and then orders were given again to close
up, close up, and double-quick.</p>
          <p>Having no roads over which to march, only now and
then, and the rough, rugged and broken country, most of
the time made it very difficult for our columns of infantry to
travel with anything like speed, and our progress would
often be greatly retarded. Some time in the early afternoon,
the sound of cannon and discharge of musketry informed
us that our troops were near, if not quite in their front, and
officers came down our line hurrying us forward, at the
same time informing us that General Hood had succeeded
in throwing Forrest's cavalry and a line of
<pb id="jcop33" n="33"/>
infantry across the pike in their front near Spring Hill, which
was some twelve or eighteen miles from Columbia, and
had checked their advance guard.</p>
          <p>We arrived on the scene just after dark,—that is,
General Walthall's Division of Stewart's Corps; this division
was on the extreme right of the corps, and was the first
infantry to arrive at Spring Hill that evening. We were
halted in a cornfield, ordered to lie down under arms, be
ready for action at a moment's notice, and not to speak
above breath. We were informed that this was the field on
which our troops, during the afternoon, had a short
engagement with the Federal advance guard, that our
columns were within about two hundred yards of the
Federal army, which was near twenty thousand strong, and
that they were lying on the turnpike in line of battle; that a
line of battle of infantry and one of our cavalry were across
the road in their front, and joined to our right wing.
Schofield pushed his wagon trains out of Columbia in
advance of his army, and had kept them all ahead of his
infantry during his retreat.
<pb id="jcop34" n="34"/>
The wagon trains were supported by the advance guard of
the Federal army.</p>
          <p>We felt confident that on the following day the whole
army would be captured, but during the night, from some
cause which I am unable to explain, our lines of battle
were withdrawn from their front, leaving the road clear for
their entire army and ordnance to pass. As soon as they
discovered no opposition from their front, they at once
resumed their retreat, while we lay under arms all night.</p>
          <p>When the dawn of the following morning appeared, and
long before the sun had begun to shed his welcome rays
o'er friend and foe alike, not a Federal soldier could be
seen, except their rear guard, and that far beyond the
range of our guns. When we discovered their successful
escape on the morning of the 30th, our chagrin and
disappointment can be better imagined than described.
General Forrest was so enraged that his face turned almost
to a chalky whiteness, and his lips quivered. He cursed out
some of the commanding officers, and censured them for
allowing the Federal army to escape. I looked
<pb id="jcop35" n="35"/>
at him, as he sat in his saddle pouring forth his volumes of
wrath, and was almost thunderstruck to listen to him, and
to see no one dare resent it.<ref id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1" targOrder="U">*</ref> Preparations for pursuit
were rapidly made, and our corps of infantry was ordered
forward on double-quick time, soon overtaking the
Federal rear guard, who were covering the retreat of
Schofield's army.</p>
          <p>We were quickly engaged in a running skirmish fight,
which continued until reaching a favorable eminence, they
formed a line of battle supported by several pieces of
cannon that glittered in the rays of the morning sun, all of
which presented quite a formidable front. A few pieces of
our light artillery were placed in position, and the infantry
moved forward to charge them off the ridge, but when our
line of battle began to advance, they fell back on a swift
retreat, still keeping up a running skirmish fight, until closely
pressed, they halted and formed another

duty, and with two other guards and a sergeant, heard the above.
—C.</note>
<pb id="jcop36" n="36"/>
line of battle to check us. These tactics were kept up
until they reached the town of Franklin, some twelve miles
from Spring Hill.</p>
          <p>We pressed the rear of Schofield's army in hot pursuit;
in fact, so hot and close was the pursuit that every now
and then the road would be almost blockaded with horses
and mules, which had been sabred, wagons cut down,
caissons destroyed, and piles of camp equipage set on fire.
They made good their escape by reaching Franklin and
taking shelter behind their breastworks. Our corps passed
to the right of the town, and on the north side of the
Columbia and Franklin pike, halting in a cornfield, within
plain view of their works.</p>
          <p>The town of Franklin, rendered historic by the battle
which was fought on the 30th day of November, 1864, is
the county seat of Williamson county, Tennessee, and
situate on the south side of Big Harpeth river. Prior to the
war it was a beautiful little county town. The residences
were constructed with that degree of taste and neatness
which indicates a refined and cultured people. The surface
of the surrounding
<pb id="jcop37" n="37"/>
country is dotted with high knolls, which present to view
the finest of landscape scenery. The adjacent hills overlook
the town, <sic corr="and">und</sic> from the crest of almost any of them a fine
view can be obtained of the surrounding country. The
valleys are rich, and most of them kept in a high state of
cultivation and improvement, the fields generally being
enclosed with good, substantial stone fences, although
some few were hedged with <foreign lang="fr">bois d'arc</foreign>. The river runs in a
northwesterly direction along the north side of the town
and affords delightful sport to those who are fond of
fishing. A line of railroad and turnpike connected the city of
Nashville with the towns of Franklin and Columbia,
Franklin being about eighteen miles from Nashville, ten to
twelve miles from Spring Hill, and some twenty-eight miles
from Columbia.</p>
          <p>After the fall of Nashville into the hands of the Federal
troops, Franklin was continually occupied by soldiers,
belonging to first one side and then the other. When
Schofield's army arrived at Franklin from Columbia, the
town was well fortified by the Federal troops who were
<pb id="jcop38" n="38"/>
already there, and by those sent from Nashville by General
Thomas to reinforce the place.</p>
          <p>The fortification consisted mainly of two lines of
breastworks a short distance from the town, and from
three to four hundred yards apart. Northeast of the town,
on the north side of the river, on the summit of two
elevated points, were two forts, one on each point. These
forts were well mounted with several pieces of heavy
cannon which could play on a line of men at long range, full
half a mile off.</p>
          <p>The main line of works extended from the river below
and southeast, connecting with the river above and
northwest of the town. It was constructed by cutting a
broad and deep ditch, throwing the dirt within, forming a
strong line of defense, which would force an attacking
column to cross it before scaling the works, subjecting it to
a murderous fire of musketry from the infantry behind the
works, even after reaching the ditch; after gaining the ditch
it would be almost impossible to climb over the works
without short scaling ladders. The works were high enough
to protect the whole body of a man
<pb id="jcop39" n="39"/>
standing erect, except the head and neck. Headlogs were
placed on top of this line of fortifications to protect their
heads from our minie balls. The logs were large and raised
off the works, leaving a space of some three or four inches
between them and the crest of the works to see well how
and where to shoot. This line of breastworks, from its
intersection with the river northeast of the town to the left
of the Columbia and Franklin pike, was well mounted with
several pieces of cannon bristling from their parapets, all of
which were amply supplied with munition.</p>
          <p>Situate on the south side of the river, northeast of the
town and on the line of works, a battery of thirty-six
pieces of cannon was planted, and so arranged that each
gun could enfilade the whole space between the two lines
of breastworks and completely clear it by a raking fire of
grapeshot and canister from end to end of an advancing
column of infantry or cavalry on the same side of the river.
Some distance, perhaps two hundred yards further down
the line, a battery of six cannon was planted, which
showed
<pb id="jcop40" n="40"/>
their ugly mouths through the embrasures of the parapets;
these guns were also arranged so as to enfilade the lines of
a storming column which might succeed in reaching the
edge of the ditch on the outside and before entering it.</p>
          <p>A short distance south of the Columbia and Franklin
pike, on the line, and to our left, another battery of twelve
guns was planted and so arranged as to enfilade the space
between both lines of works from that direction, thus
exposing a line of men to raking fires of grape and canister
from both directions. The grape and canister thrown from
all these guns could rake the ground near the edge of the
ditch within twenty feet of their mouths, the whole distance
occupied by an attacking column, while their own men
were perfectly secure on the inside and behind the line of
works. The whole space in front of the main line of works
to the second was exposed to a galling fire of all the
batteries from each way, to say nothing of the exposure to
the fire of musketry from the infantry behind the
breastworks, which was as destructive, if not more so,
than that from the grape and canister.</p>
          <pb id="jcop41" n="41"/>
          <p>North of this line in our front a large cotton gin stood,
some twenty or thirty feet from the works—it may have
been a little farther or nearer; some ten feet northeast of
the gin two oak trees were standing, the larger a few feet
nearly due north of the smaller; west of the gin and on the
south side of the Columbia and Franklin pike, a large
two-story brick residence was standing, which was owned and
occupied by a Mr. Carter and his family; south of this and
near the line of works, a small one-story brick house with
a frame building attached was standing. These buildings, at
the commencement of the engagement, were occupied by
Federal sharpshooters.</p>
          <p>Behind this line of works the Federal troops were
massed, and the ground seemed to be covered for a
distance of fifty yards from the works with soldiers
wearing the blue uniform, their guns and bayonets shining
with a dazzling brightness in the sun. They appeared all the
time to be in motion, forming lines of battle, one behind the
other, as indicated by the positions of their blue banners
and battle-flags; all their lines of
<pb id="jcop42" n="42"/>
men could not be seen from our position, while
concentrating their forces. Their torn and perforated
regimental colors, as they floated on the breeze, bespoke
the story plainer than language can paint it, of the many
fierce encounters they had met with during that long and
bloody campaign through which they had just passed, and
which was destined shortly to come to a final close.
Courier after courier on their horses could be seen
galloping to and fro, as if carrying orders from one part of
the position to another; their sappers and miners, or fatigue
parties, seemed to be hard at work completing the
fortifications; their spades and picks could be seen swiftly
going up and down, and the dirt thrown from their spades
flying to the top of the parapets; they were as active and
industrious as gopher rats and prairie dogs when they are
trying to burrow into the earth. Their main forces of infantry
and artillery were well arranged in lines of battle behind this
line of works a short time before the engagement began.</p>
          <p>A short distance in front of the works, a line
<pb id="jcop43" n="43"/>
of <foreign lang="fr">cheval-de-frise</foreign> was placed, extending from near and
opposite the battery of thirty-six cannon west, reaching very
near, if not quite to the pike. This <foreign lang="fr">cheval-de-frise</foreign> is a piece
of timber, a long log, or several long logs, for instance, with
one end of each placed together, the logs being traversed
with wooden spikes, sometimes pointed with iron, five or
six feet long, used to defend a passage, stop a breach, or
make a retrenchment to check the advance of cavalry, but
during the late war, was used against the advance of
infantry as well. A few feet in front of this <foreign lang="fr">cheval-de-frise</foreign>, a
<foreign lang="fr">bois d'arc</foreign> hedge had been cut down, the tops fronting us,
they were trimmed and sharpened; this brush was very
thick, and the points of the limbs being sharpened made it
very difficult to pass over; this hedge formed an abatis—
that is, a row of trees and their branches, and laid with the
points outward, in front of a fortification or any other
position, to obstruct the approach of assailants. The larger
ends of the branches are secured to the ground by forked
pickets. All of these obstructions would check an
advancing column of
<pb id="jcop44" n="44"/>
infantry or cavalry, thus affording the enemy a good
opportunity to destroy it. On the left of the pike a locust
thicket had been cut down, their tops being trimmed and
sharpened, and this, in connection with the <foreign lang="fr">cheval-de-frise,</foreign>
made a very effective and formidable obstruction in front
of that position.</p>
          <p>Their second, or front line of works, was from three
hundred to four hundred yards in advance of the former
which I have just described. It was simply a line of
intrenchments hastily thrown up, or at least had that
appearance, the ditch dug within and the dirt thrown
outward, forming a temporary line, and had no head-logs
to protect their heads; this line would only afford protection
to the lower part of the body without lying down behind it.
It had no cannon bristling from their embrasures. A line of
battle, and also a skirmish line, had been thrown behind
it,—their guns and bayonets, in a threatening attitude,
pointed at our lines over the works. These two lines of
earth works passed through an old field, which had been
turned out and used as a commons. A dense beech grove
<pb id="jcop45" n="45"/>
had recently been standing at the edge of this commons on
the right of the pike fronting this position and in our front,
but had been cut down, making a thicket of brushwood
which was almost impenetrable; considerable work had to
be done in clearing a passage through it before a line of
battle could pass through, or over it, in anything like order.</p>
          <p>The cornfield, which we occupied, was directly behind
this beech grove. The field had been cultivated that year, on
which had been grown a crop of corn and little white soup
beans. The corn had been gathered, but the beans were left
hanging on the vines. We considered ourselves fortunate in
being halted in this field on account of the crop of beans,
and the majority of us were anxious to obtain a mess of
them. We badly needed them to cook with the fresh,
unsalted pork which we had drawn at Columbia. Many of
us were filling our haversacks with these beans when Billy
Mumford, one of General Quarles' aides, came riding down
our line, and seeing us busily engaged in gathering the
beans, as a smile went over his genial face, remarked,
<pb id="jcop46" n="46"/>
“Boys, you need not be gathering those beans, we have to
storm those breast-works over there (he pointing in the
direction of them) this afternoon.” We had no further
interest in gathering beans, the charm of soup-making
vanished as swiftly as did the beans we had gathered—
were dashed to the ground. We remained under arms from
the time we arrived within this field, which was ten or
eleven o'clock in the forenoon, until near four in the
afternoon, at which time hunger reminded us that we had
tasted nothing since before daylight that morning, at Spring
Hill, and we were not permitted to break ranks, in order to
prepare our rations.</p>
          <p>Our troops had maintained their excellent spirits up to
this time, notwithstanding our sore disappointment in not
being allowed to make the attempt to capture Schofield
and his army at Spring Hill; but the cloud of
disappointment which had so suddenly enveloped us at
Spring Hill, now reappeared more ominous than ever,
causing our patriotic enthusiasm and most sanguine hopes
to wane, and ere the dawn of another
<pb id="jcop47" n="47"/>
day had given place to feelings of bitter despair.</p>
          <p>Our division, General Walthall's, was placed on the
extreme right of the Columbia and Franklin pike, and
formed the right wing and constituted the front line of battle
of that position; this was to be the assailing column of the
Federal works in our front. After this front line was
definitely located, the remainder of our infantry began to
form in lines of battle one behind the other. While this was
going on the Federal army, who lay behind their main line
of works, mounted on top of it, and stood for several
minutes viewing our lines. We had a good view of them
standing on top of their breast-works, their fine blue
uniforms shining in the soft and hazy rays of a beautiful
November's afternoon. Our right wing was nearly in front
of the battery of thirty-six cannon on the main line of the
Federal works, and a little to the right of the battery of six
pieces of cannon on same works. We thoroughly
understood that this portion of the line of battle had to
storm the works near the battery of thirty-six guns, and if
possible, take it.</p>
          <pb id="jcop48" n="48"/>
          <p>As soon as the lines of battle were formed, a number of
our field officers rode out a little in front of the lines,—they
were Walthall, Loring, Cheatham, Quarles, Cleburne,
Granberry, and perhaps others; these officers appeared to
hold a brief consultation, during which we could see them
cast doubting glances in the direction of the formidable foe
in our front; and judging from the appearance of their grave
and serious looks, we all knew that our commanders in
some degree realized the depth of that yawning gulf of
destruction which awaited them and us, and which only too
soon would engulf us all. These officers separated, each
taking his respective place with his command. A profound
silence pervaded the entire army; it was simply awful,
reminding one of those sickening lulls which precede a
tremendous thunderstorm. This was but momentary.
Orders now rang down our line, shrill and clear, to forward
march!</p>
          <p>The guns from the redoubts northeast of the town
opened on us at long range, but they were scarcely noticed
by us. The artillerymen who were manning these guns had
a fine opportunity
<pb id="jcop48a" n="48a"/>
<figure id="ill1" n="1" entity="copley48a"><p>IN FRONT OF THE FEDERAL WORKS AT FRANKLIN. </p></figure>
<pb id="jcop49" n="49"/>
of testing their skill at long range. Our progress at first was
rather slow, on account of the obstructions just in our front,
which consisted of the beech grove with the tops of the
trees fronting us; but we surmounted this brush and fallen
timber, and began to move a little faster. A light skirmish
line from our lines of battle was thrown forward, which
was soon met by a similar line from the Federals behind
their advance line of intrenchments. These two lines quickly
engaged in a lively skirmish fight, but as our lines of battle
advanced, their line retired behind the line of works which
they had recently left. Our line halted, lay down, and fired upon
them in this position, until our lines of battle moved up
close enough for them to join us, and become part of the
front line.</p>
          <p>We were now ordered to fix bayonets, fire, and charge
the first line of works. They received us with a volley of
musketry, but all opposition was inadequate to check our
columns in the slightest degree, and with one prolonged and
loud cheer we carried the first line of works at the very
points of the Federal bayonets. They
<pb id="jcop50" n="50"/>
stood their ground until we mounted the top 
of their works, but as we went over, part of
their line of battle broke and fled, while the remainder lay
down flat on their faces in the ditch to save themselves,
and were either killed or captured; but few of those who
fled succeeded in reaching their main line. Our lines of
infantry swept over their works, annihilating nearly
everything before us. This partial victory was quickly won.
It appeared as if our troops had received an electric
shock, which aroused their enthusiasm to its highest pitch,
and the air resounded with loud shouts from our whole
army, <sic corr="which almost">whichalmost</sic> made the earth over which we were
going quake and tremble.</p>
          <p>After taking this line of works, we made a momentary
halt in order to reform our front line, but this was only for
an instant; we now pressed closely at the heels of their
retiring line, to storm the second. Their batteries
immediately opened upon us with a perfect hailstorm of
grape and canister, and when within a short distance of
their main line, we encountered the abatis, or <foreign lang="fr">bois d'arc</foreign>
hedge, and also the line of
<pb id="jcop51" n="51"/>
<foreign lang="fr">cheval-de-frise</foreign>; here the battery of thirty-six guns a little to
our right, and that of twelve guns on our left, all double
charged with grape and canister, pointing down our lines
from both directions, thus enfilading them both ways from
end to end, sent a tremendous deluge of shot and shell
through our ranks, and these seconded by a murderous
sheet of fire and lead from the infantry behind the works,
and also another battery of six guns directly in our front,
made the scene of carnage and destruction fearful to
behold.</p>
          <p>This hurricane of combustibles now burst forth in its
height of fury, leaving ruin and desolation in its pathway,
and nothing could be heard above the din of musketry and
the roar of cannon, which was incessant. They fired on
friend and foe, for we so closely pressed the retreating line
in our front that had they waited for their own men to enter
the works we would have gone over with them, and
carried all before us. Whenever the dense smoke, in some
degree, was cleared away by the flash and blaze from the
guns, great masses of our infantry could be
<pb id="jcop52" n="52"/>
seen struggling to get over those ingeniously wrought
obstructions, who were being slain by hundreds and piled
in almost countless numbers. In the confusion which here
ensued, numbers of our forces were thrown farther to the
left and near the pike, forming a confused body of soldiers
who were totally oblivious to all sense of order, thus giving
the battery of thirty-six cannon on our right, the one of six
pieces in our front, and that of twelve to our left, full play
upon them. The firing of these guns was so rapid that it was
impossible to discover any interval between their
discharges.</p>
          <p>The slaughtering of human life could be seen down the
line as far as the Columbia and Franklin pike, and where
the works crossed the pike the destruction was
indescribable. Along that portion of the works in front of
the batteries on the right, our troops were killed by whole
platoons; our front line of battle seemed to have been cut
down by the first discharge, for in many places they were
lying on their faces in almost as good order as if they had
lain down on purpose; but no such order prevailed
amongst the
<pb id="jcop53" n="53"/>
dead who fell in making the attempt to surmount the 
<foreign lang="fr">cheval-de-frise</foreign>, for hanging on the long spikes of this obstruction
could be seen the mangled and torn remains of many of our
soldiers who had been pierced by hundreds of minie balls
and grape shot, showing that they, beyond a possible
doubt, had been killed simultaneously with the panic and
consternation which happened upon their reaching this
obstruction. The remnant of our lines succeeded in reaching
the ditch on the outside of the works, and now became
engaged in a hand to hand conflict across the top of the
head-logs at the point of the bayonet. The smoke of battle
belched forth from the hideous open mouth of this typical
volcanic eruption cast a deep shade of gloom over that
bright and lovely November eve, darkening the ether from
earth to heaven, until a gentle breeze would lift and fan it
away. The force and wind of the grape and canister, when
fired from the fifty-four pieces of cannon on the Federal
works, aided by that of the minie balls from their infantry
behind the works, would lift us clear off the ground at
every discharge. As
<pb id="jcop54" n="54"/>
the great clouds of smoke had to some extent vanished and
I could look around me, I saw to my surprise I was left
alone in the ditch, within a few feet and to the left of the
battery of six guns on the Federal works, which was still
pouring forth its messengers of death, and not a living man
could be seen standing on my right; neither could one be
seen for some distance on my left. They had all been swept
away by that mighty tempest of grape and canister and
rolling waves of fire and lead. A Federal, who was running
in my front just before we entered the ditch, and a little
beyond the reach of my bayonet, was shot dead from the
works in front, and fell forward into the ditch; in his belt
were two large army pistols, which were loaded and
capped. I quickly removed them from his belt, and 
with one in each hand emptied them under the 
head-logs at the mass of men across the works in 
my front. The more our numbers became reduced
the fiercer the conflict for life, simply too dreadful for pen
to describe, and few who entered that portion of the ditch
escaped death. When the pistols were emptied, having
<pb id="jcop54a" n="54a"/>
<figure id="ill2" n="2" entity="copley54a"><p>THE BATTLE OF FRANKLIN. </p></figure>
<pb id="jcop55" n="55"/>
nothing with which to reload them, I reloaded my gun, and
turned towards the embrasure of the cannon, which was a
few feet on my right, and tried my best to shoot the
artillerymen who were so skillfully and effectively manning
that destructive battery, and whose gun swabs would whirl
in the air after every discharge, but each time I obtained a
glimpse of any of them, and before I could shoot, a cannon
would run out and fire, forcing me to take refuge away
from it. After getting my face blistered and eyebrows
burned off, I abandoned that dangerous place by getting
back away from the blaze of these guns.</p>
          <p>Streams of blood ran here and there over the entire
battle ground, in little branches, and one could have
walked upon dead and wounded men from one end of the
column to the other; the ditch was full of dead men and we
had to stand and sit upon them,—the bottom of it, from
side to side, was covered with blood to the depth of the
shoe soles.</p>
          <p>At the ditch we had to encounter an enfilading fire of
musketry from both directions, as well as that in our front
across the works under the
<pb id="jcop56" n="56"/>
head-logs. The enemy directly in our front attempted to
shoot us by turning their backs to the breast works, taking
their guns by the breach and raising them above their heads
over the head-logs, so as to point the muzzles downward,
firing them at us this way, and having nothing exposed
except their arms and hands. We had to watch this and
knock their guns aside with our bayonets, which was done
several times; many of their men had both hands shot off
while making these attempts to kill us. While this fearful
battle was raging, a Federal officer on his horse, at the head
of a line of infantry, came dashing up to the works in our
front, and one of our soldiers in the ditch about ten feet on
my left, raised his gun and fired, shooting him off his horse.
Among the first whom I saw in the ditch, upon their feet and
unhurt, were General Geo. W. Gordon, Lieutenant Colonel
Atkins, commander of our regiment, and Captain Williams,
of an Alabama regiment; they were only a few feet on my
left. These men appeared to be undaunted, and a look of
stoic
<pb id="jcop57" n="57"/>
determination had settled upon their weather-beaten 
faces.</p>
          <p>South of the Columbia and Franklin pike our troops
were in some degree successful in capturing part of the line
of works; the Federals who survived this onslaught took
refuge behind the works on the north side of the pike, in
our front. Our numbers were too weak on that portion of
the line to charge the position in our front with any hope of
success; however, they succeeded in reaching the brick
houses I have described. At the residence and in the yard
of Mr. Carter his son was killed dead. He had not been at
home for two or three years, and as he passed through the
yard and stopped at the door his sister ran and caught him
by the hand and attempted to throw her arms around his
neck, when a Federal soldier, who had taken refuge in the
house, ran up and shot him through the body, killing him
dead in the arms of his sister.</p>
          <p>General Quarles and Adjutant General Cowley, of our
brigade, fell near the main line of the Federal works, the
former wounded and the latter killed. General Pat Cleburne
and his horse
<pb id="jcop58" n="58"/>
were killed while attempting to cross the works, the horse
falling on top of the breast works and General Cleburne on
the outside of the ditch; both rider and horse seemed to
have received a missile of death at one and the same
instant.</p>
          <p>The color-bearer and color-guard of our regiment were
all killed near the edge of the ditch; the last man of the
color-guard was shot while waving the regimental colors at
the breast-works, and fell forward, the flag reaching over
within the Federal works, the staff resting across the
head-logs. Some brave soldier of our little remnant quickly
seized the staff, recovered the flag and carried it off the
field. I regret never having learned his name. This deadly
strife was destined to be of short duration; as our attacking
columns were destroyed and repulsed, the firing became
less frequent, except from our batteries in the rear, which
were kept active by the fearless and solitary few who
survived this bloody encounter.</p>
          <p>The carnage and destruction was so dreadful that the
sun, as if loath to longer gaze on this
<pb id="jcop59" n="59"/>
terrific scene, slowly sunk behind the western horizon and
hid from view his smiling face; but the stars, more pitying,
came forth to keep vigil o'er the silent and sleeping dead.</p>
          <p>As the firing from the enemy in our front began
somewhat to abate, sixteen of our soldiers, who were in
the ditch some twenty or thirty feet on my left, sprang up
and ran out of the ditch, attempting to escape; a whole
volley of musketry was fired at them, killing the last one to
a man. When they started I raised in a stooping posture,
thinking I would run also; but they being killed so quickly
caused me to abandon the idea of escape. The few of us
who were alive at the ditch were in considerable danger
from our own batteries and stray minie balls. We tried to
lie down in the ditch; it afforded scant protection, being
almost full of dead men.</p>
          <p>We now fully realized our critical situation, and saw that
we had but one choice, if any, left, and that to surrender.
Lieutenant Colonel Atkins was requested to surrender the
little crowd, but declined, stating that he would rather die in
<pb id="jcop60" n="60"/>
the ditch than to surrender us. Some few of our soldiers, a
little further on our left, raised their caps on ramrods, but
they were fired upon and riddled with bullets, the Federals
refusing to recognize this. Captain Williams then requested
some one to hand him a white handkerchief, but not one
could be found. One of our soldiers who was fortunate
enough to have on a white shirt, tore off a large piece and
handed it to him. The captain tied this on the end of a
ramrod, and hoisted it over our heads so it could be seen
by the Federals. A Federal officer ordered the troops in
our front to cease firing, which they did. He came up to the
works, looked over and said: “Throw down your arms,
boys, and come over.” I threw my gun and the two pistols
as far back toward our lines as I could send them, and as I
passed over the works glanced around at my fallen
comrades who lay on the ground wrapped in the winding
sheet of death, and drew a sigh of regret as I gave them a
last sad look, knowing they never again would be aroused
by the sound of the reveille from their deep untroubled
<pb id="jcop61" n="61"/>
sleep, but would remain in death's cold embrace until
the last great trump shall sound and call forth the dead
from the armies of both friend and foe.</p>

          <p>As this eventful day was slowly fading into twilight, and
the booming of cannon and rattle of small arms ceased to
silence the living, six hundred of us marched over the
Federal breast-works, under a white flag waving over our
heads, and were immediately surrounded by an escort of
Federal troops, armed with Springfield rifles, upon the end
of which was a long sharp-pointed bayonet. The ground
on the inside of the works was strewn with dead and
wounded Federals, most of whom had been shot in the
neck and head. Near the oak tree which was standing
close to the cotton gin, D. S. Majors, a member of our
regiment, was wounded by a stray minie ball coming from
the direction of our own men. He fell against the tree, and
as he fell, called me
<pb id="jcop63" n="63"/>
to come to him. I turned and started, but a Federal soldier
presented his cocked gun at my head, at the same time
ordering me to march onward with the other prisoners.</p>
          <p>Not an exulting shout went up from the Federal army
after the battle terminated. On all former occasions, after
an engagement, a victorious shout from the winning side
would rend the air. We were marched back into the town,
out of range of the cannon shot and shell which were still
being fired at the Federal lines by the vanquished remnant
of Gen. Hood's army. A double chain-guard of infantry
was now thrown around us with orders to shoot any one
who attempted an escape. I now, for the first time,
discovered that my left arm, from the shoulder to the hand,
was covered with the blood and brains of some one; my
haversack and canteen had been shot away; my clothing
well perforated with minie balls, but my body untouched.</p>
          <p>Night now spread its sombre mantle over both friend
and foe, and found fifty officers, with five hundred and fifty
privates of our army, in the hands of and at the mercy of
the Federal army.
<pb id="jcop64" n="64"/>
Many of us were very hungry and thirsty, as we had not
eaten anything since early that morning at Spring Hill. But
several of the Federals divided their rations with us. A
friendly disposed old soldier gave me part of his rations,
which consisted of pickled pork and crackers, and also a
drink of water from his canteen, for which I kindly thanked
him. Soon a conversation arose between the officers of
both sides, relative to the length of time the engagement
lasted. Some one of the Federal officers, who stated that
he had timed it, informed us that from the time our front line
of battle began to advance until the firing ceased, was one
hour and forty minutes, but the destructive part of it—that
is, from the time our infantry carried their advance line of
intrenchments, lasted only forty minutes. This handful of
prisoners presented a ghastly and powder-burnt
appearance; the clothing was badly stained with blood, the
faces blackened and blistered by the streams of fire from
the enemy's guns during the engagement; the hair on many
of their heads was somewhat singed and the eye-brows
burned off. On this eve of sadness, this
<pb id="jcop65" n="65"/>
night of gloom, I found myself contemplating the utter folly
of all those four long years of hardships and privations,
which truly tried men's souls, and which to my mind, on this
particular night, seemed as fruitless as if we had been
scaling mountains of melting mist and traversing fields with
weird apparitions. The classic hand of the poet never
painted a sadder vision to human eye than passed before
me at this particular time. There was, however, one thought
more heart-rending than all these scenes combined, which
filled our souls with greater misgivings than everything else
we had been compelled to endure in the past. It framed
itself in these words—What shall our <sic corr="future">fature</sic> be? In losing
this battle we felt that our beautiful Sunny South, which was
already dear to our boyish heart by the ties of home and
kindred, and which had grown doubly dear during all these
long years in which we had done our very best to serve
her, had received a blow from which it never could
recover; our armies had been cut down and destroyed,
until they were overwhelmingly outnumbered, and we knew
that the torn and shattered
<pb id="jcop66" n="66"/>
remnant would soon succumb to the inevitable. While we
were pondering over our recent misfortune, our captors
reminded us that we were prisoners of war, under their
commands, and at the disposal of President Lincoln and
the War Department; that we had no time for that
refreshing rest and sleep which our tired and worn-out
bodies so much needed.</p>
          <p>We were now informed that we must take up our line of
march to Nashville, Tennessee, it being the nearest place
from which transportation could be obtained to any point
in the North; hence, some time during the latter part of the
night of the 30th, we started on quick time for the city of
Nashville, surrounded by a guard, consisting of Schofield's
army. On the road between Franklin and Nashville, while
Gen. Schofield's army and the prisoners were splashing the
mud and water in crossing a creek, I tried to effect my
escape, but in this I made an utter failure, and with this
attempt I was satisfied.</p>
          <p>General Hood's cannon frequently hurried us on the
road from quick time to a swift run; in fact, we were
almost constantly under the necessity
<pb id="jcop67" n="67"/>
of running very fast to keep beyond their range. We
knew the calibre of Hood's guns, for we had been
supporting them, on active duty in the field, for nearly three
years prior to this. Our escort manifested greater interest in
keeping out of the reach of those big guns than we did;
they had often been forced to feel the effects of them upon
several battle-fields, and were anxious to place themselves
at a safe distance out of the range of these guns.</p>
          <p>We believed that Hood's remnant of our army would
make an effort to recapture us before we could reach
Nashville, but alas, we were doomed to bitter
disappointment. We arrived at Nashville before noon on
the first day of December, both hungry and tired. Many of
the prisoners were barefooted and could have been easily
tracked by the marks of blood behind them. We were
ragged, dirty and blood-bespattered. The appearance of
this little squad of prisoners told the sad tale of the terrible
conflict from which they had just emerged, and to the
casual observer it was an easy matter to distinguish the
victors from the vanquished as we were paraded
<pb id="jcop68" n="68"/>
on the capitol grounds. We were kept on public exhibition
for five or six hours, and near five thousand people came
out to view us. Amongst the number of whom I should
make mention, was the noted Andrew Johnson, afterwards
President of the United States, who greeted this little
handful of half-starved, unarmed and <sic corr="defenseless">defenceless</sic> men with
a volume of abuse and vituperation; of course, he could
afford to do this and be in no danger while we were
enclosed by a wall of fifty thousand bayonets. This was our
birth-place and around which clustered the fondest
recollections of our earliest boyhood days. A majority of
the citizens who came to look at us were ladies,
whose sympathetic countenances, so saddened by grief,
sent a deeper thrill of  sorrow through our hearts than all we
had witnessed besides. They were not allowed to approach
nearer than the bayonet's point of the double chain-guard of
Federal troops who were between us and them, nor
permitted to exchange any words with us. But we saw their
looks of tenderness and affection as the wife sought a
glimpse of her long absent husband, the mother her
cherished brave
<pb id="jcop68a" n="68a"/>
 <figure id="ill3" n="3" entity="copley68a"><p>THE PRISONERS IN THE CAPITOL SQUARE AT NASHVILLE. </p></figure>
<pb id="jcop69" n="69"/>
boy, the sister her ideal soldier-brother, the daughter her
scarred and weather-beaten fond father,—which were
returned with despairing looks and quivering lips upon
faces coursed with tears and countenances pale with grief.
We were now ordered away from this sorrowful and grief-stricken
crowd, to take up our temporary abode within the
inclosure of the outer dismal walls of the State penitentiary.</p>
          <p>The Federal authorities now issued rations of pickled
pork and crackers to us, the first we had drawn since the
night before we left Columbia. While we were preparing
our meals, the Federal army surgeons came in to examine
those who had been slightly wounded in the battle at
Franklin. One of our soldiers, a mere boy, had been shot in
the right foot; the ball hitting him on the instep, passed
through the foot and came out at the point of the heel. We
were impressed with the heroic fortitude this young man
displayed in hopping on this wounded foot all the way from
Franklin to Nashville, a distance of eighteen miles, as we
never heard one impatient murmur
<pb id="jcop70" n="70"/>
or complaint escape his lips. An army surgeon, while
examining his foot, good-naturedly asked him, “if he had
been shot while his back was fronting the enemy?” The
soldier replied, “that during the entire campaign he had
never turned his back to the - Yankees.” The surgeon,
who appeared to be a gentleman, looked at him and
remarked, “That is right; you are a brave boy and an
American. Never disgrace the cause you espouse.” Several
others had been slightly wounded in the conflict at Franklin
and their wounds were promptly attended to.</p>
          <p>Hood, with the surviving remnant of his army, pushed on
for Nashville, and the occasional firing of his heavy artillery
kept the Federal troops who were occupying the city
continually moving, and the citizens in a strain of fear and
doubt. Every discharge of Hood's cannon was greeted by
us with loud shouts, which rent the air and made the earth
tremble. Sleep was not to be thought of upon this eventful
night. The great excitement through which we had just
passed, our anxiety to learn who of our <sic corr="friends">freinds</sic> were
<pb id="jcop71" n="71"/>
numbered with the dead and wounded, coupled with the
cherished hope that our army might be successful in an
attempt to take the city and recapture us, made the desire
for sleep impossible. This state of feeling lasted until near
the hour of three on the following morning, when we were
ordered to march out to the Nashville and Louisville
depot. The last frail hope which we had entertained of
being recaptured, now vanished as completely as the dew
before the rays of the morning sun.</p>
          <p>We were ordered to board a train of box cars, at the
same time being informed that the city of Louisville,
Kentucky, was our next place of interest, at which place
we arrived in due time, and marched into quarters which
were regular soldiers' barracks. The officers were
separated from the privates. It appeared that they were
destined for a different place from that in store for us, and
we were informed they were soon started for Johnson's
Island. The soldiers who were our guards from Nashville,
now turned us over to a very hilarious set of troops, who
seemed
<pb id="jcop72" n="72"/>
to know very little by experience of the realities of the
front, and from their levity we all knew they had smelt no
gunpowder as our former guards had.</p>

          <p>In dress, manner and conversation, these guards
presented a different appearance from any soldiers we had
met during the war. They made the impression upon us that
they had just popped out of a band-box, instead of having
been on active duty facing gun-powder and lead at the
front, bedecked as they were in their fine uniforms, white
shirts and standing paper collars. This jocular set of
dandies, as we called them then, but now would call them
dudes, informed us in a sarcastic manner, that they held in
their pockets a very pressing invitation from President
Lincoln and the War Department for us to visit some place
of special interest in the North for our health and
recreation. That for a time, we would not be permitted to
return to our different homes, as we so much desired to
do. That we belonged to that particular

          <p>That President Lincoln and the War Department had
selected one of the most beautiful, romantic and delightful
cities in the United States for our special benefit, at which
place we were to spend a few weeks and perhaps months.
That this city was located and built near one of the prettiest
fresh-water lakes in this country, and named Chicago,
which is of Indian origin, signifying “wild onion.” That this
was the city of cities, to enjoy ourselves with sight-seeing,
and at that time could boast of containing the grandest and
most sublime objects and views to be met with in the
whole United States, situated on the shores of Lake
Michigan, where every day we could cast our eyes over
the beautiful blue waters of the lake, and view its thousand

in a forest. They also assured us that good, secure, and
sufficient quarters, as well as ample provision of various
kinds and descriptions, had already been prepared for our
reception.</p>
          <p>Their intended sarcasm was promptly answered with
very expressive sarcastic language, highly seasoned with a
few pointed oaths, which readily gave them to understand
that plenty of fight was left in us yet.</p>
          <p>After spending one night in the city of Louisville, we
were marched to the proper depot and ordered on board
a train of box cars, and were packed in them like beef
cattle for shipment, after which, two large engines pulled us
out of the city. We were soon carried far beyond the reach
of Hood, or the sound of his cannon, steaming away for
the place of our destination, where about daylight on the
morning of the 5th of December, 1864, we found
ourselves landed on the shores of Lake Michigan, and near
a place called “Camp Douglas.” “As we came on the
borders of the lake, its waves lay dark and voiceless; only
at intervals the surf fretting along the pebbles,
<pb id="jcop76" n="76"/>
made a low and dreary sound.” “Then all became</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“An atmosphere without a breath,</l>
            <l>A silent sleeping there.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The beach and grounds were covered with snow and ice
nearly twenty inches deep. The beautiful white snow, the
pure azure-colored waters of the lake, and the appearance
and feelings of this little handful of ragged, half-starved,
wornout prisoners, presented a sorrowful and pitiable
contrast. We were now placed in charge of a different set
of guards, who were United States regulars, many of whom
were of foreign extraction<sic corr=".">,</sic> Our jocular
dandies now bid us
a final <foreign lang="fr">adieu</foreign>. The guards now
ordered us to march out of
the box cars upon the deep snow and ice, form in open
ranks, take off our outside clothing, including our shoes and
boots—in other words, undress. But few of this little
crowd wore shoes or boots, the majority of them being
barefooted, and had been for some time previous, and not
many of us wore anything except outside clothing. In the
warm climate of the South,
<pb id="jcop76a" n="76a"/>
<figure id="ill4" n="4" entity="copley76a"><p>PRISONERS STRIPPED AND SEARCHED IN THE SNOW AT CAMP DOUGLAS. </p></figure>
<pb id="jcop77" n="77"/>
some two years prior to this, the army of Tennessee
had dispensed with such unnecessary luxuries, for
the reason that the Confederate States Government
was financially unable to furnish that class of clothing to
its soldiers. We were required to stand upon this
deep snow and ice, facing an icy breeze of mist,
which was flying from the lake propelled by a strong
gale of wind, for several hours, without fire or
anything to eat, for the purpose of undergoing an
examination, a close and rigorous search for all
arms of offense or defense, which might be found
on our persons or in our possession.</p>
          <p>I shall use the term “arms” in this connection, as it
was practically used at Chicago, which is altogether
different from that applied to it at the present day.
This word arms, among these guards, meant all
articles of value, such as gold and silver watches,
lockets, rings, pocket knives; in fact, all trinkets of
any value whatever, but of course, our little gold and
silver pocket change was not overlooked. The most
of our wealth consisted in what little Confederate
money we
<pb id="jcop78" n="78"/>
possessed, but this they returned to us. They failed
to return anything of value. We subsequently
learned that many of the guards could be easily
bribed with these articles to turn a prisoner out, and
several prisoners by this means had succeeded in
making their escape. Guards were on the market for
sale cheap.</p>
          <p>When the search was finished, we donned our
clothing, were ordered to form in two ranks and
face to the front. We can see a plank wall in which
there is a large gate, on the inside of which, we
understand, our quarters are located. The gate is
called “a prison-gate,” over which our imaginations
can see plainly written in bold type, these words:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Through me you pass into the City of Woe;</l>
            <l>Through me you pass into eternal pain.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>This gate is closely guarded by a soldier wearing
the uniform of a private of the Federal army. He
stands on the outside near the gate, armed with a
Springfield rifle loaded with a cartridge containing
powder and a fifty-four calibre minie ball, upon the
end of his gun is a long sharp spear or bayonet, from
his looks and
<pb id="jcop79" n="79"/>
appearance one would judge him to be an old
regular who had seen considerable active <sic corr="service">sevice</sic> at
the front, and would shoot any one attempting to
pass through this gate-way from either side without
the proper authority; that the orders and instructions
he has will be executed to the strictest letter in
every particular. He also knows what military law is,
in regard to his duties and obligations as a soldier,
and he will take no risk of being court-martialed by
his superiors, as he knows that a court-martial
means nothing more nor less than punishment to the
one brought before it.</p>
          <p>We are now ordered forward in two ranks toward
this big gate, and as we approach, a military officer
steps forward and shows the guard an instrument of
writing, which we suppose to be an order from the
commander of the post to admit us within the
inclosure of the prison walls. The gate is now
thrown open, swinging back on its creaking hinges,
and we march through to the inside, and,</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“When we had passed the threshold of the gate,</l>
            <l>We heard its closing sound.”</l>
          </lg>
          <pb id="jcop80" n="80"/>
          <p>We now bid a sad <foreign lang="fr">adieu</foreign> to the outside world, for we
fully realized the fact that we had landed within the frightful
inclosure of the prison walls of Camp Douglas. We were
informed that this place derived its name from a man, and
was first used as a camp of instruction for troops, but later
was converted into a military prison, in which to keep
prisoners of war confined. We were divided into squads,
each containing a certain number of men and were
assigned to different barracks. The squad to which I
belonged was sent to barrack No. 53, where I drew the
first rations since leaving the city of Nashville, Tennessee.</p>

          <p>After taking in all the surroundings of this prison,
and judging from the appearance of everything, the
methods of security adopted to make the prison
secure, and our safe-keeping a certainty, this
compulsory visit of state bid fair to last
indefinitely; hence, we settled ourselves down as
contentedly as the nature of things would permit,
with a determination to make the best of life we
could under the surrounding circumstances. I fully
realized the scope of this visit. In my imagination,
could plainly see the realities connected with it. I
well remembered the
<pb id="jcop82" n="82"/>
dismal sound of that ponderous prison gate, as it
grated on my ears, when it opened back on its
creaking hinges for us to pass inside. I felt that it
revealed a story which was unmistakable, and with
which we would soon become familiar.</p>
          <p>We will now take a bird's-eye view of all within
this inclosure, and see if we can find anything to
admire, or strike the fancy, and note that which is
most novel and interesting. Well, if our admiration
of everything is to be judged by our silence and
sullen looks, we admire everything. First, let's see
of what this institution consists, or rather, what
constitutes the prison. Here are near twenty acres of
ground inclosed by a plank wall sixteen feet high,
upon the top of which a walk or parapet has been
constructed four feet wide for the chain-guard, or
sentinels, to walk.</p>
          <p>Near the ground, within ten feet of the plank wall,
a strip of plank one inch thick by three inches wide,
has been tacked upon the top of little posts about
one foot high, the entire circumference of the
prison grounds; this line is named and called the
“Dead Line;” it means and signifies
<pb id="jcop83" n="83"/>
death to every living prisoner who attempts to
cross it. </p>
          <p>There is only one place of egress or ingress to
this inclosure, and that through the aperture of the
big gate, through which we have just entered. This
gateway is large enough to admit easily a line of
soldiers four ranks deep—that is, four abreast. Two
guards are kept at this gate, one on the inside of the
inclosure, the other outside.</p>
          <p>The ground is nearly level, perhaps it sloped
towards the lake just enough to discover it with the
natural eye and to make it drain very well. Our
quarters consist of barracks, one story high and four
feet off the ground upon posts. They were originally
flat on the ground. While they were flat on the
ground, every few days, one or more of the
prisoners would escape from the prison, and after an
examination it was discovered that the prisoners
tunneled out under the barracks; this caused the
Federal authorities to raise them off the ground, so
that no one could tunnel out without being caught in
the act, and before any success had been obtained.
They
<pb id="jcop84" n="84"/>
were built of boxing plank, one inch thick by twelve
inches wide, and twelve feet long. The barracks were
not ceiled overhead; the cracks were stripped with
pieces of plank one inch thick by three broad. There
are fifteen rows of barracks with four to each row,
and number from one to sixty. Two hundred men are
assigned to each barrack. The reader can see at once,
that although there were so few barracks, they could
afford quarters for quite a little army. Each barrack
had a kitchen attached to one end, generally the
north end, in which our beef and other meats were
cooked. The main door or place of entrance to the
barrack was near the center in one side, and so
arranged that any one could enter or leave at any
time during the day or night, and never be heard, and
after night without being seen. The barracks had but
one place of entrance to each, except that from the
kitchens, which were not passable for the men. This
entrance to the barracks had no shutter, and
remained open; there were no windows in the
barracks through which light could enter; sometimes
the prisoners whittled out small
<pb id="jcop85" n="85"/>
light-holes between the planks of the walls large
enough to admit some light, which enabled them to
read such literature and books as could be obtained.
These little apertures, or light-holes, sometimes
were dangerous places to sit by, as when discovered
by the Federal guards on the parapets, they possessed
an attraction for minie balls. A frame structure was
erected on the inside, from the floor to the roof, in
tiers or rows above each other the entire
circumference of the barrack, divided by narrow
strips of plank; on these structures we slept; they
were called “bunks.” Each bunk would contain two
men comfortably; upon these we spread our
bedclothing, and also kept many little trinkets of
small value hid under our blankets. Everything here
was not in season, but we dreamed at large and woke
in prison. The barracks were supplied with heating
stoves, two to each barrack, one placed at each end;
that is, one stove to every hundred men.</p>
          <p>The kitchen was separated from the sleeping
apartment of the barrack by a partition wall, which
extended from one side of the barrack to
<pb id="jcop86" n="86"/>
the other. The main entrance to the kitchen was at
the rear or north end, which had a door with a
shutter. The entrance into the barrack was through a
square hole made in the partition wall, which cut off
the kitchen from the barrack. This opening was about
the size of the cashier's window in the National
banks of the present day, perhaps it may have been a
trifle larger, and was named and called the “Crumb
Hole,” from this fact, nothing except our rations
ever passed through it, which were handed by the
cooks through this for distribution, and we could
obtain them through no other.</p>
          <p>This crumb hole was closed by a slide door.
When it slid back and left the aperture open, there
would be a general rush to it by all the men in the
barrack. After our rations were handed through from
the kitchen to the inside of the barrack, this door
would be closed and remain closed until the next
meal. Stepping up to the cashier's window in a
National bank to cash a check very forcibly reminds
one of going up to these crumb holes at Camp
Douglas, to receive our kitchen hash or slop; the
cashier when
<pb id="jcop87" n="87"/>
he counts out the cash and pushes it through from
the inside, reminds one of the head cook when he
shoved our rations through the crumb hole to the
sergeant of the barrack.</p>
          <p>I have a perfect horror for these openings or
windows, and I dislike the very thought of stepping
up in front of these seeming crumb holes in
National banks, they so forcibly recall the
recollections of the crumb holes in our barracks at
Camp Douglas, and to see them in the banks makes
me feel like I am back within that prison barrack
every time I enter a bank. I have a suspicion that the
pattern and model for making these particular
windows in the National banks at this day had their
origin at Camp Douglas, were patterned after, and
modeled from the crumb holes in our barracks at
that place, they bear such a close resemblance to,
and have such a similarity in workmanship. If I am
correct in my surmises, the ingenious Yankee who
invented those at Camp Douglas could make a
fortune, if living, by prosecuting the National banks
for an infringement of his patent. The kitchens were
supplied with large pots or kettles for cooking
<pb id="jcop88" n="88"/>
purposes. They held from forty to sixty gallons of
water each.</p>
          <p>There were streets, between the rows of
barracks, which were near twenty feet wide, and
thrown up in the middle from each side to make
them drain.</p>
          <p>At the north end of the streets, the waterclosets,
more familiarly known to soldiers by the name of
sinks, were located. The water was conveyed within
the prison square by pipes leading from the lake to
the reservoir, and from that to the prison. A sewer
conveyed the filth from the sinks to the outside of
the prison walls, the water being conveyed by
hydrants into the sewers to wash off the filth from
the prison. Wash-houses were conveniently located
on different parts of the prison grounds. They
were box houses, the cracks being stripped same as
the barracks, and one story high. These were
supplied with hydrants, which conveyed the water to
the inside, and also with tubs, buckets and soap, but
minus towels.</p>
          <p>Coal sheds had been erected on the inside of the
inclosure of the prison walls, and under these
<pb id="jcop89" n="89"/>
the coal we used for fuel was deposited. It was
hauled from the outside by the Federals; sometimes
a detail of prisoners would be sent out under guard
to assist in hauling it. Near, and a little east of the
entrance gate to the prison, a small barrack or office
was located. This was comfortably arranged on the
inside, and used by the officers of the guard, and
occupied by them day and night. It was the
headquarters of Lieutenant Fife, commandant of the
police guard on the inside of the prison square. Not
far from the officers' quarters a store-house had
been erected, which was called a “Sutler's store,”
from the fact that the man who conducted and
carried on the business there was a sutler. A sutler
is one who follows an army, but keeps himself far in
the rear whenever there is a prospect for a battle. He
never shows himself near the front unless the
enemy is known to be two or three hundred miles
off. He sells provisions and various flashy and
trashy articles of merchandise, which will generally
catch all the small change soldiers carry in their
pockets. Whenever he can do so on the sly, he will
slip a soldier a little
<pb id="jcop90" n="90"/>
bust-head whisky, and at the same time swear it is a
genuine article of old rye or bourbon, and charge
one dollar for about two teaspoonfuls. Here he was
far in the rear, and had no fears of the enemy on the
front. He sold us some provisions and various
articles of clothing, but no whisky or intoxicating
drinks of any kind; at least, I never knew of him
doing it.</p>
          <p>A short distance from the sutler's store, a post
about four feet high was firmly set in the ground, on
which were written little notices, advertisements
and such general news as were allowed to come
within the prison square. This post was called the
bulletin board, and the news posted on it, grape-vine
dispatches or grape-vine telegrams. News in our
favor, or which they thought we would appreciate,
never appeared on this bulletin board. Within a short
distance of the entrance gate, across the street and
west of the officers' quarters, there was still another
institution, which was one of the horrors of the
prison, and more interesting than all the other
institutions within the inclosure of the prison walls.
It was an underground room or
<pb id="jcop91" n="91"/>
place about ten feet deep, covered with plank and
dirt, the top just above the surface of the ground.
This institution was named and known as the
dungeon, which meant and signified midnight
darkness. It had the right name. We dreaded this
underground abode equally as bad as some so-called
Christians do a cyclone. Nothing within this gloomy
cell could ever feel the gentle rays of the sun. It was
all darkness,—black-darkness to both soul and body
of the poor victim who was so unfortunate as to be
doomed to it. There was but one door or place of
entrance, and it rather small. The furniture of this
institution was very scarce, consisting mostly of a
chain and two cannon balls chained together. The
inhabitant of this room had to wear the chain and
balls to his ankles while an inmate thereof. We
often called this the doghouse.</p>
          <p>Before completing the description of all of the
inanimate objects of interest on the inside of the
prison grounds, I met with another, entirely
different from anything within the inclosure of the
prison walls. This was a perfect
<pb id="jcop92" n="92"/>
monstrosity, and called by the name of a familiarly known
animal. Wherever I may have occasion to refer to it I shall
designate it as one. History furnishes no record of this
peculiarly constructed animal, although there has always
existed from the very earliest times to the present, an
animal bearing the same name, and with which we are all
very familiar. The nobility of ancient kings used them as
beasts of burden, in preference to all other animals. This
particular animal at Camp Douglas had become one of the
most remarkable in use at this place, and of all, the most
dreaded by the prisoners. Not that it was at all ferocious,
or possessed teeth with which to bite, or claws with which
to scratch; but there was associated with it a nameless
horror, which caused those who had ever come in contact
with it, to do their very best to shun it, and made us all
anxious to give it as wide a berth as possible.</p>
          <p>In this little world of ours this wonderful animal had
gained so much notoriety among the prisoners, and was of
so much importance to, and held in such high esteem by
the officers and
<pb id="jcop93" n="93"/>
prison guards, that we believed it ought to go down in the
long channel and stream of history like the mastodon, and
be placed among the most noted of the animals in the
national museums of different nations, to remain a perpetual
monument to the ingenuity of the past ages. It was perfectly
blind and deaf. Either end could be used for its head, so it
mattered not which you faced while riding. The sweat of
this animal was inclined to be sticky, possessing many
medicinal properties, and had a suspicious smell of
turpentine and rosin. During a very warm day it would
perspire freely, and the quantity of its perspiration was
equal to the sweat of blood of the great Behemoth of the
Bible. It was destitute of hair, and its skin was the color of
that often seen on the inside of a large pine tree. I was
never able to obtain the exact dimensions of this animal, as
the penalty for being near it was a two hours ride on its
razor back.</p>
          <p>This so-called animal was composed of backbone, ribs
and legs, all constructed from pure pine lumber. The
backbone was a piece about four inches thick by eight
inches wide, and near
<pb id="jcop94" n="94"/>
thirty feet long; the top of this was planed off to a
sharp edge the whole length; upon this the prisoners
sat man-fashion, and rode without saddles or
blankets. The ribs were numerous and so arranged as
to be used the same way and for the same purpose,
as the backbone—that is, to be rode upon. It had
from six to twelve legs, all securely nailed and
fastened to the backbone and ribs; they were
sixteen feet long, so this animal was thirty feet long
and sixteen feet high. It remained stationary and
stood a little east of the entrance gate and on the
inside of the prison square, not far from Lieutenant
Fife's office. It was peculiar only to John Morgan,
from whom it derived the name, “Morgan's Mule.” I
believe this completes the description of all the
inanimate objects within the inclosure of the prison
walls.</p>

          <p>Brevet Brigadier General B. J. Sweet commanded
the troops at Camp Douglas while I was there. There
were two regiments, the 8th and 15th United States
regulars, under his command. It was on very rare
occasions that he favored the prisoners with a visit.
With the limited acquaintance the prisoners had
with him, he impressed them as being an affable and
courteous officer. I will not attempt to give a
minute description of him. In stature he was a little
over the average, and possessed rather a
commanding appearance. His headquarters were on
the outside of the prison square.</p>
          <p>The second officer who was interested in the safe-keeping
of the prisoners, was Lieut. Fife. He had
charge of the prison guards on the inside of the
prison square. Fife appeared to be very distant and
reserved, and avoided all familiarity
<pb id="jcop96" n="96"/>
with the prisoners. We kept aloof from his
quarters. I saw him but very few times during my
entire stay in prison, and then only at a considerable
distance. Judging from what I was able to see of
him, he appeared to be rather good looking and
pleasant. Morgan's Mule was in such close
proximity to his quarters that there was but little
incentive for us to frequent that place; hence, we
kept as far away as possible.</p>
          <p>There was a third officer, who formed the
keystone to the arch of this trio, one so-called
Captain Webb Sponable, Inspector of Prisons, but
more particularly Inspector of Rations, especially
when he became a little short of cash. His name
really should not be associated with the former
officers whom I have described, but it cannot well
be avoided. He was of medium stature: figure
grotesque and ugly in the extreme; features coarse;
face resembling a well-grown artichoke, covered
over as it was with large bumps; hair stood straight
up, when not kept saturated with grease or oil;
forehead very low, with the eye-brows joined
together above the bridge of the nose; eyes set far
back in the head;
<pb id="jcop97" n="97"/>
nose very large and always carried upon it a
strawberry hue; ears of ordinary size, very thin and
lay close to the head; jaws and chin very large and
unsightly; neck short and bullish; teeth stood out
prominently and never presented a neat or clean
appearance and seemed to be coated with a yellow
substance of some kind; his expression and
countenance appeared to be dark and cloudy most of
the time; the legs were so frightened at each other
that no amount of persuasion could induce them to
come close together; suspended at the extremities
of the legs were a pair of large feet, like those of a
negro. The swift and irregular step, the unmeasured
and harsh cadence of his accentuation, the
wandering and far away look which took about ten
times as long as another's to arrive at its object; all
this was in admirable keeping with his unsightly
person, big nose, ugly chin and knotty skin, which
betrayed not the slightest symptoms that any
principles inclined to be humane and generous
circulated or passed through or beneath its cellular
texture; these gave him quite a ludicrous
appearance, whenever he perambulated the
<pb id="jcop98" n="98"/>
prison square, trying to favorably impress every one
with his peacock looks. This Captain Webb
Sponable will be long remembered by all the
inmates of Camp Douglas.</p>
          <p>The troops stationed at Camp Douglas were used
for provost-guards of the city, and also as prison
guards, more particularly for the prison. A portion
of them were kept outside of the enclosure of the
prison walls, and used mostly for sentinels on the
parapet on top of the plank wall which inclosed the
prison; they were scarcely ever used as police
guards within the prison square. Those upon the
parapet were stationed at intervals from fifty to one
hundred feet apart the entire circumference of the
prison wall, forming what is well known to soldiers,
a chain-guard, around the prison. The distance on the
parapet the sentinels had to walk, from one to the
other, was called their “beat.” This is a familiar term
to soldiers. The sentinels were armed with
Springfield rifles loaded, and upon the end of each
gun was a long sharp spear or bayonet. Each sentinel
also wore in his belt a large army pistol.</p>
          <pb id="jcop99" n="99"/>
          <p>They were relieved from guard duty every two
hours by another relief, consisting of the same
number of men—that is, one guard for each post or
beat. In extreme cold weather, such as it was the
latter part of 1864 and beginning of 1865, they
were relieved every half hour and frequently oftener.
While on guard duty on the parapet they were
compelled to walk their beats from end to end
continually, not being allowed to sit down or stand
still and rest on their arms; they were required,
during all hours of the night, to halloo loud enough
to be heard by the officers of the guard, “All is well,”
or “All is right.” This would be repeated by each
guard around the line on the parapet. The object of
this was to inform the officers that each sentinel was
at his post and wide awake, and that nothing had gone
wrong on the line. We could distinctly hear them
repeat this at all hours of the night, which often
caused sad and gloomy thoughts to pass through our
brains.</p>
          <p>Guard-mounting—that is, relieving the old guard,
who had been on duty eight hours out of twenty-four,
with another detailed guard,
<pb id="jcop100" n="100"/>
occurred every morning at 8 o'clock. Then we had music,
but it was all on the outside of our prison wall. The
bands on the parade ground made the air ring with
music, reminding us of the melodious sounds of our
bands in our far away Sunny South. One set of
guards, composing the entire chain-guard upon the
parapet, were kept on guard duty eight hours out of
twenty-four. Their orders and instructions were to
shoot every prisoner who attempted an escape from
the prison, or crossed the dead line; to shoot out all
lights which might be seen in the barracks at night;
to fire upon all squads of three or four prisoners
who might congregate on the streets in a group
during the day. At least, the parapet guards claimed
to have such instructions, and the manner in which
they acted, indicated it. They rarely, if ever, entered
the prison square on guard duty, as their duties were
confined more particularly to the parapet and on the
outside of the prison walls. The police guards within
the inclosure of the prison were armed with large
army pistols, loaded. The authority of each was
absolute, and from it
<pb id="jcop101" n="101"/>
there was no appeal, at least, an appeal made by any
of us would not have been heard by higher authority.
Their duties were to patrol the prison grounds and
barracks at all hours during the day and night; to see
that all the rules and regulations of the prison were
strictly carried out; that no plots or conspiracies
were planned or organized among the prisoners to
escape, and that the sanitary rules and regulations
were rigidly executed. Quite a number of them were
within the inclosure of the prison walls day and
night. The sergeants of the guard called the roll
every morning at 7 o'clock. Sometimes there would
be one to each barrack, but generally one to each
row<sic corr=".">,</sic> As a rule they were very gentlemanly men.</p>
          <p>The next person of importance was the bugler.
This personage is generally designated and called
“the little bugler,” but I shall simply call him “the
bugler.” He made his appearance inside the prison
square, at the headquarters of the prison guard,
twice each day, at 6:30 a. m. and at 6 p. m., for the
purpose of giving the signals for roll call and to
retire to bunk. At 6:30
<pb id="jcop102" n="102"/>
a. m., when he sounded that bugle, we had to fall
into line, fronting our barrack, and remain in line
until the roll was called; and at 6 p. m. when we
heard its shrill blast, every living prisoner within the
prison square had to immediately retire to bunk. I
only knew the bugler from the sound of his
instrument—that is, I knew there was one on hand,
as we rarely ever saw him, for his bugle would ring
out before we thought of his presence at
headquarters, then we had no time to look at him,
our bunks being of much more importance. This
was the only duty we knew of his having to perform
on the inside of the prison square.</p>
          <p>Some few of the prison guards made themselves
very conspicuous and vigilant all the time while
within the prison square, whether on duty or off.
There were four of whom I desire particularly to
note, as they are special exceptions. During my
school-boy days, when I studied at English grammar,
the exceptions to the general rules gave me more
trouble than all the remainder of the book, and since
then I have been very particular to note the
exceptions to everything.
<pb id="jcop103" n="103"/>
With these four guards we came in direct contact
nearly every day and night, or with one or more of
them anyhow. The first of them was nicknamed “Old
Red.” His proper name was O'Hara. From his name
and dialect he would be pronounced a native of and
an inhabitant of the Emerald Isle. He derived the
name “Old Red” from being red-headed, the hair
being a fiery red. In stature he was larger than the
average man, and possessed an enormous
parallelogram-shaped head, which presented a low
forehead, and which indicated the opposite of all
culture and refinement. This oblong head was
surmounted with a forest of coarse, red and bushy
hair; a nose fashioned more for use than ornament,
and the centre of attraction between two prominent
cheek bones; across this and below the nose nature
had placed a tremendous horizontal aperture, which
his two large ears prevented from making the entire
tour of the head, and contained a score or more of
ugly, ill-shaped teeth, which must have been very
useful in devouring large quantities of pickled beef
and hard-tack. His body, arms, legs and feet were
<pb id="jcop104" n="104"/>
large, though his general make-up and form were by
no means symmetrical. His complexion was red,
face ornamented with large red pimples or bumps to
such an extent that it constantly reminded one of the
chicken-pox or big red measles; in fact, his entire
oily skin appeared to be infected with vermin. His
rough, brawny <sic corr="hands">hand</sic> were better fitted for the 
plow-handles than for anything else, and certainly an artist
would never have selected his long bony fingers for
models of beauty. The large, ill-shaped nose, the
two dull gray eyes placed in the midst of a pair of
unsightly cheeks, gave to his countenance a most
hideous and semi-comic appearance and expression.
Two ponderous ears stood out in bold relief, one on
each side of his head, somewhat resembling the side
lamps of a carriage. In addition to all this came the
comical arrangement of his hair, which stood out in
bold defiance of all efforts of discipline of the hand
or comb; every hair stood out straight, separate and
alone, and seemed to be afraid each of the other. I
am confident that this head of hair never succumbed
to the arts of civilization. He wore a
<pb id="jcop105" n="105"/>
number twelve shoe or boot, and sometimes wore
socks; whenever he wore shoes, which was most of
the time, he could often be seen without socks on
those monstrous feet. The legs of his pants were
large and always too short, lacking about an inch of
reaching to and making close connection with the
top of his socks—that is, whenever he wore socks.
It appeared to the boys in prison that when his
measure was taken for clothing, he certainly stood
in the water ankle deep at least. The skin of his
ankles very much, in color, resembled the rind of a
pumpkin at ripening time. The pale blue pants and
his skin, as shown on his ankles, presented quite a
contrast. His address was repulsive in the extreme.
When in his presence, one would know it without
seeing him, for the cold chills would at once run up
and down the back. One would feel that he was in the
presence of or near some monstrous, hideous and
slimy serpent. Such were the feelings the
atmosphere would inspire one with when he was
near at hand. His sense was that of the meanest type,
and his composition contained nothing save that of
the blackest and
<pb id="jcop106" n="106"/>
worst character. In appearance, he resembled one of
those terrible and frightful beings whom Pollock
describes that he saw writhing in the Lake of Fire,
while he stood near the brink of the abyss of
eternity sketching its inmates.</p>
          <p>The second specimen of these was called “Little
Red.” I had his full name but cannot at present recall
it, although time can never erase his personal
description from memory's tablet. He differed
materially in his personal physique from the former
I have described. In stature he was smaller, head a
little above medium size, very irregular in shape and
covered with sandy-colored hair, and many of the
prisoners called him red-headed; hence, the origin
of the name, “Little Red.” His eyes were of a
steel-gray color, giving to his countenance a cold and hard
expression; the nose, of medium size and a little
inclined to be sharp at the point, was almost hid
from view by two round and bloated cheeks; the
mouth large and filled with a set of unsightly and
disgusting teeth; it was a perfect harbinger of filth,
the stench emitted therefrom when it opened, would
permeate the atmosphere
<pb id="jcop107" n="107"/>
for a distance of several feet. The most striking
attribute of his chin was length. He was stoutly built
and possessed large feet, which were minus an
instep, the heels of which were straight like those
of a negro. His countenance and expression sadly
lacked all which indicates anything amiable or
intelligent. He somewhat resembled the “Fool's
Pope,” described by Victor Hugo. He appeared to
occupy about the same relation to the others which
a general roustabout on a steamboat does to the
officers who command it.</p>
          <p>A third prominent personage and important factor
was in the shape and person of Billy McDermott.
He was better and more familiarly known to the
prisoners, as “Old Billy Hell.” Old Billy was rather
small in stature, as well as in every thing else. An
oval-shaped, rough, hard and knotty cornfield
cymling would make a fine photograph and an
excellent representation of his head, which was
covered with thick, dark hair; shaggy eyebrows hung
over two small, squint eyes, which resembled those
of a hog; the nose was small and long, the end
always pointing
<pb id="jcop108" n="108"/>
to the left; his mouth large, but kept somewhat
in the background by a pair of large, thick lips; a
short neck, which appeared to be swallowed up by
the shoulders; the knees were perfect strangers to
each other, and no sort of enticement could bring
them together; the feet were large and flat; his
expression was anything to look upon but pleasant.</p>
          <p>The finishing touch and crowning capstone of this
quartette, presented itself in the person of “Prairie
Bull.” He was indebted to the Texas troops for this
beautiful sobriquet. His head was straight from the
back of the neck to the crown, and covered with
very thick, dark hair, which he parted in the middle
at the back of the head, and in front, like a woman
parts hers; the ears were large and thin, but not the
kind which indicate generosity; his eyes were small
and of a cold lead color, and shaded with heavy
eye-brows, which embraced each other above the
bridge of the nose; the nose was large, and the
nostrils always expanded; his big mouth contained a
set of long teeth very much resembling the incisors;
the lips were thick, and continually
<pb id="jcop109" n="109"/>
kept in such a strain of fear and terror of each other
that they could never be induced to touch; his jaws
were those of a monster in size; the neck short and
thick; his arms, legs and feet were patterned after
those of a gorilla more than from any other animal;
the skin was the color of that often seen when
yellow jaundice makes its first appearance—that is,
when in its first stage; he was tall, and a little
hump-shouldered, and possessed the frame of a giant, and
generally went in a stooping posture, and very fast,
so much so that the tail of his blue blouse was
constantly trying to play leap-frog with the back of
his neck. Nature, it seems, had stamped the atrocity
of his character on his countenance. His hideous
features, coupled with a demoniacal expression,
revolted every living thing near him. He carried the
expression of a demon wherever he went, and the
photographed impressions made upon one's brain
will forever stand out on memory's wall in bold
relief. This gives the finishing touch to the most
important of the guards within the inclosure of the
prison walls. There were many others, but none so
interesting
<pb id="jcop110" n="110"/>
and conspicuous as the special “big four,” as we called
these whom I have just described. The majority of the
others, if not all, were much better men in every respect
than these favorites. We never had to avoid and shun the
presence of the others, like we did these; in fact, when
these four were on the inside of the prison square, we felt
like we were in the midst of and at the mercy of a lot of
wild animals which had just made their escape from some
menagerie.</p>

          </epigraph>
          <p>We now began to realize the full extent and meaning of
the term “prisoner of war,” and are being thoroughly
initiated into prison life. There are near twelve thousand of
us within the inclosure of the prison walls, and one would
suppose that owing to there being so many men confined
within so small a space, there would exist the greatest
amount of sociability. In a general way, we were very
sociable with each other, but we had our rings and cliques
like other people in the great world outside. Those who
had been associated together in arms as soldiers, of
course, were more intimately acquainted with and
entertained a more friendly feeling for each other than with
others of a different command; consequently, this caused
them to form little associations of their own, and as near
together as possible.
<pb id="jcop112" n="112"/>
For instance, members of the Forty-ninth
Tennessee infantry felt more attachment for each
other than for others belonging to a different
regiment, hence the reason for our rings and
cliques.</p>
          <p>I was fortunate enough to be assigned to the same
barrack with three old comrades, <foreign lang="la">viz.</foreign>, Archie
Sainsing, Buck Forsythe and Polk Goodrich. A brief
sketch of each of these three, perhaps, will not be
out of place here. In stature, Archie was taller than
either of us, and red-headed. His nose, in length and
size, was considerably over the average; in fact, he
was not as handsome as some few persons I have
met, but was one of those quiet, good natured young
men who, I do not suppose, ever made use of an
ugly word in his life; at least, during my intimacy
with him for nearly four years, I never heard such
fall from his lips.</p>
          <p>Buck Forsythe was small in stature, but could use
the biggest language of any one in prison. The king's
English suffered whenever Buck strung out in the
use of it. My friend Polk Goodrich was one of the
strangest and most
<pb id="jcop113" n="113"/>
singular personages and specimens of humanity that
could have been found. There has never been but one
Polk Goodrich of his exact makeup and
composition. He was perhaps older than either of
us, and of medium height. He had black hair, eyes
and whiskers; features finer than are usually seen on
a person with jet black hair and fair skin; mouth was
very small, and hid from view by his mustache and
whiskers; the eyes were as small as buck-shot, and
performed vidette guard duty on each side of a nasal
appendage which was noted for its length, the end of
which looked closely after the extremity of the
chin. When we were down South with the army and
the bomb-shells were flying in the air, the boys
frequently advised him to place this ornament in his
pocket. He was a splendid soldier, and always on
hand for duty, no matter how dangerous the
performance of duty might be. While at Camp
Douglas, he reminded us of one of those unlucky
men who appeared to have been born on Friday, or
on some other unlucky day, for he was almost
continually having some trouble with our nocturnal
visitors.
<pb id="jcop114" n="114"/>
His first experience with them occurred with Old
Billy, within three or four days after our
admittance inside the prison, and in the shape of a
two hours ride on Morgan's Mule during a real cold
night. Polk had an idea that he could get up and
warm by the stove, but Old Billy came in the
barracks at once, and marched him off to the Mule.
He never could be induced after night to make
another attempt to warm.</p>
          <p>While occupying this barrack we had but little to
occupy our time and attention, except to look at and
study the people who came in from the city in great
crowds to take a view of the last arrival of
Confederate prisoners. These crowds were
generally composed of women, who were
sometimes escorted by plug hats and swallow-tail
coats. Some few of the women greeted us with such
epithets  as “vile rebels,” “who should have been
hung instead of being brought there, and they were
sorry we were not all killed at Franklin.” They
generally spent an hour or two promenading the
prison square. After entering the inclosure, an
officer would sometimes accompany them over the
prison grounds.
<pb id="jcop115" n="115"/>
These inquisitive and silly visitors would look at us
with as much amazement as the average country
people do at a first class menagerie when it enters a
town. A few of the women would take up handfuls
of snow, and ask the prisoners “if they had ever
seen anything like that down South.” We were not
subject to such close scrutiny every day, as the
better class sometimes visited the prison, and from
them we never had to reply to any such unkind or
disrespectful expressions.</p>
          <p>One morning just after breakfast, the police
guards came up the street and shouted in loud, clear,
shrill tones which pealed over the entire prison, “All
who desire to go South to be exchanged fall into
line in front of your barracks, with all your
baggage.” The Franklin prisoners were all “fresh
fish,” as the others, who had been there for <sic corr="some">sone</sic>
time, called us. Had a ton of dynamite suddenly
been thrown into our midst, the excitement, bustle
and stir would not have been greater. Many of our
associates, who had been in prison for a long time,
understood the programme, and tried to remain on
their bunks
<pb id="jcop116" n="116"/>
engaged in a game at cards. We thought strange of
them appearing so cool and not caring to go with us,
preferring to remain in prison. Several of them good
humoredly remarked to us “that our trip would soon
be over, as we had but a very short distance to go.”
Our guards failed to excuse them, but came into the
barracks and marched every one of them out in line
with the balance of us. We then had the laugh on
them. With all the “fresh fish” it was a general rush
and push to see who could be the first to get in line.
Each seemed to feel that if he was not the first to
get in line, he would be left. Soon we were all in line
fronting our barracks, many of us having everything
with us which we possessed—that is, all little
valuables. We were at once surrounded by the police
guards, who began rigidly to search us. This time we
were not required to undress. They searched us
closely, and spared nothing of value which could be
found on our person or about our clothing. The
Confederate money failed to escape this search, at
least, all which could be found. Many of the
prisoners dropped little trinkets and articles
<pb id="jcop117" n="117"/>
of small value on the ground, covered them up
in the sand with their feet, and stood upon them. My
soldier friend, Polk Goodrich, saved a great many
little trinkets by placing them under his nose. After
completing the search, we were ordered to break
ranks, return to our quarters and wait for further
instructions and orders.</p>
          <p>We learned that the cause of this search was on
account of some of the prisoners, who had bribed
one of the guards on the parapet, and he had allowed
two or three of them to escape. Their object now
was to deprive us of all means which would effect
an escape; in other words, prevent us from buying
our way out of the prison. This bribing business was
often attempted by the prisoners, and sometimes
attended with success; but the prisoner after
reaching the outside world rarely ever made his
final escape a success. A great many of the
prisoners kept their money and watches, in spite of
all the rigid searching and efforts made by the
guards to capture everything of value. I went back
into my barracks some wiser than when I started
<pb id="jcop118" n="118"/>
on exchange that morning. I called up three others
and borrowed an old greasy pack of cards, and we
four were soon engaged in a lively game of euchre.
We spent the remainder of the day at this, and
thought no more of going South on exchange; at
least, if we thought of such we never expressed it.
Our first visitor was Old Billy, who came into our
barrack and gave us all a general cursing for not
giving up all we possessed. He ransacked our bunks,
but found nothing; that made him madder than ever,
and we expected trouble with the old thief, but after
exhausting the English language in the way of abuse,
he left. The boys made many sarcastic remarks at
him on account of his ugly feet, but he returned this
with only volumes of abuse. His thievish and greedy
soul seemed to crave nothing but valuables.</p>

          <p>The most important feature of a man's life is the
manner in which he lives in regard to his bill of
fare; what we eat, the manner and style in which it is
prepared and cooked, enter as important factors into
our every day life. We are as much interested in
this, if not more, than any other. We were not as
superstitious and particular concerning our bill of
fare at Camp Douglas, as Madame Victoire was in
regard to her's on a certain occasion. I do not think
it out of place here to state it, as given by a noted
French authoress: Madame Victoire was a French
Princess and daughter of Louis XV. of France. On
one occasion she became exceedingly tormented
and troubled about a certain
<pb id="jcop120" n="120"/>
water fowl, which was often served up to her during
Lent. On one occasion the question to be
irrevocably settled and determined was whether it
was fish or flesh. She consulted a worthy bishop
who happened to be one of the party; the good
prelate immediately assumed a decided tone of
voice, and the grave attitude of a judge in the highest
tribunal of last resort, and answered the princess that
it had been resolved that in a similar case of doubt,
after dressing the bird it should be pricked over a
very cold silver dish; that if the gravy of the animal
congealed within a quarter of an hour, the creature
was to be accounted flesh, but if the gravy remained
in an oily state, it might be eaten at all times without
scruple. Madame Victoire immediately made the
experiment; the gravy did not congeal, and this was a
source of great joy to the princess, who was very
partial to that sort of game.</p>
          <p>Ours materially differed from that of Madame
Victoire, besides we had no silver dishes, either
cold or hot, over which to prick our meats, but we
had quite a different kind of vessel, which
<pb id="jcop121" n="121"/>
answered all practical purposes fully as well as the
finest quality of silver ware. I shall endeavor to
show the kind of cook-vessels we had, the rations
we had to cook, how they were cooked and who
cooked them—that is, all which was cooked on the
inside of the inclosure of the prison walls. The
cooks within the inclosure of the prison walls were
prisoners, and selected from the barracks. Each
kitchen had a sergeant, who was called the kitchen
commissary sergeant. He was also one of the
cooks. The kitchen sergeant drew all the rations
from the Federal commissary sergeants for the men
in his barrack. Three or four men to each kitchen
constituted the cooking force. Our cooks only had
meat to cook, and sometimes a few beans or
potatoes, which were all boiled together in the large
pots or kettles. Our bread was cooked on the
outside of the prison. It was flour, baked in loaves,
and called soft bread. It reminded us of the material
in quality of which hornets make their cone shaped
houses, and the bread possessed about as much
substance. Rations were drawn in bulk according to
the number of men in a barrack,
<pb id="jcop122" n="122"/>
that is to say, ours contained two hundred men, and
the sergeant drew two hundred rations, which was one
meal for each man. The loaves of bread were presumed to
weigh about one pound each before they were cooked;
after being cooked, of course they were not so heavy. One
loaf of bread was issued to every three men for one meal. It
was divided into three equal parts, and each part was called
one-third of a loaf. Each man at each meal received one-third
of a loaf, and two-thirds of a loaf per day. Only on
very rare occasions we drew any crackers, which was
called hard bread. Corn-meal was never issued to us. Our
meat was green beef, except once a week, on Sunday
morning, we drew a little bacon. The beef weighed about
eight ounces raw, and the bacon about five. When our meat
was cooked and passed through the crumb hole the beef
would weigh from four to four and a half ounces, and the
bacon from two to two and a half ounces—that is, per
ration. I weighed my rations of meat upon the scales at the
sutler's store, on several different occasions, and they never
exceeded the amount stated. Soup was
<pb id="jcop123" n="123"/>
made from the beef or bacon water, and once in a great
while this water or soup would be spiked with a few beans
or a potato, just enough to let us know or believe that a
bean or potato had made its appearance somewhere near
the kitchen, and perhaps had entered it. This soup
contained one eye of grease to every quart of water, in
other words, to every oyster can full. Sunday was the long
looked-for day of all days; with it came our little ration of
bacon. We considered this day as the Feast of the
Passover, for we had passed over a long week of hunger
and starvation.</p>
          <p>Our table-ware consisted of tin plates, cups and
saucers, tin pans, all made from what few old rusty cans
and pieces of tin we could obtain within the prison
square; sometimes we could find an old rusty fruit can,
which had been thrown away down at the sutler's store.
Knives and forks, table and teaspoons we made from pine
plank. Some few had carried their tin cups with them into
the prison, and they were very useful. With us “necessity
was the mother of invention,” and our ingenuity in a
measure,
<pb id="jcop124" n="124"/>
supplied our dire necessities in the way of dishes, and other
table-ware.</p>
          <p>We were divided into messes numbering from eight to
fourteen in a mess. Each mess had its head man, who
attended to the drawing of the rations at the crumb hole for
his mess. He divided the rations into as many little bulks as
there were men in the mess; then some one of the mess
would turn his back to the rations, and the head man would
take a pointer and touch each bulk and say, “Who has
this?” The one with his back turned would say, “Mr. A.
takes that.” This would continue until all the rations had
been taken. Most of us when we were boys learned this
method of division in dividing fish we caught in the creeks
on Saturdays.</p>
          <p>The soup or beef water was handed through the crumb
hole in tubs and buckets promiscuously, and each received
his share in his oyster can. We dined twice each day.
Breakfast was served about 8 o'clock a. m., and consisted
of our one-third of a loaf and a little pittance of meat,
which had been boiled to shreds until it contained no more
substance than an old dish-rag would
<pb id="jcop125" n="125"/>
after it had been thoroughly washed. This completed the
morning meal. Dinner came on about 1 o'clock p. m. It
consisted of the remaining third of a loaf and the beef
water or soup.</p>
          <p>We prepared this meal by pouring our beef water into
our oyster can, then added more cold water and thickened
this with our last third of a loaf. When the boys would
empty their last third of bread into the can, the remark
would often be heard, “There goes my last third.” We
would boil this on the heating stoves, and when thoroughly
boiled, we had a first-rate meal of thickened hot water.
This finished all the meals for the day, as we were not
allowed but two each day.</p>
          <p>Ever since I made this national visit of state, while being
a national guest and having to live on two meals per day, I
have been disgusted with that custom. When I know of
people adopting it, I certainly feel sorry for them, because I
know they will die indebted to their stomachs; and of all
deaths which I most desire to avoid, is that of dying
indebted to my stomach. We drew perhaps as much
soap as was necessary for our
<pb id="jcop126" n="126"/>
practical purpose; and also a little salt, but no extra
amount. Candles were not allowed at all under any
circumstances.</p>
          <p>As to the amount of rations allowed to prisoners of war
by the Federal government, I will in this connection give the
official statement of the Honorable L. A. Grant, Assistant
Secretary of War, relative to the ration in kind, which was

          <p>The rules and regulations of the prison, which had
been adopted by the military authorities, were strict,
and rigidly enforced. No excuse would be received
or heard in extenuation, unless an extreme case of
sickness interfered. The slightest infringement of
any rule or regulation would insure the violator the
severest punishment. Many of the rules and
regulations of the prison were such as army
regulations require to be enforced when soldiers are
lying up in camp, and even in the field on active
duty, and which almost any government would adopt
to control and keep its prisoners of war. We
expected nothing better than the enforcement of
strict rules in regard to our safe-keeping and all
sanitary
<pb id="jcop130" n="130"/>
measures and regulations. The strict enforcement
of these appeared to be all that was required by the
commanders of the post; but some few of the police
guards adopted, or at least enforced some of the
most silly and frivolous rules which could have been
thought of, and made the prisoners pay the penalties
for their violation by the most villainous and
inhuman methods of punishment.</p>
          <p>After the signal given at 6 p. m. for the prisoners
to retire, we had to do so without delay, and were not
allowed to speak or whisper to each other under any
circumstances, but had to go to sleep, and then be
very careful as to how loud we slept. When any of
the prisoners were heard by the guard to whisper or
talk, he would call for the one who did the
whispering or talking, and if the right one could not
be definitely located, all the prisoners occupying the
barrack would be marched out to Morgan's Mule,
forced to mount and ride from two hours to half a
night, barefooted, and with no covering on them save
their thin and ragged clothing. Many of the
prisoners were so thinly clad they could
<pb id="jcop131" n="131"/>
scarcely hide their nakedness. The latter part of the
winter of 1864 and first part of 1865, were
extremely cold, and the Federals complained of its
severity, and stated that the weather was the coldest
which had been known for several years.</p>
          <p>Often the guards would tie, or cause to be tied, a
heavy weight of some kind to each ankle of the
prisoners. The weights would weigh from twenty to
one hundred pounds, and generally consisted of bags
of sand, but if these were not convenient some other
heavy substance would be substituted. The cords
which held these weights often cut through the skin
of the ankle. After being mounted on the Mule, the
“big four” would turn the prisoners over to the
sentinel on the parapet, at the same time instructing
him for what length of time to keep them, and when
the time expired to allow the prisoners to return to
their barrack, but to shoot any one who attempted to
dismount before the time was out. Several of the
prisoners were badly frostbitten, and were nearly
frozen to death while on this frame. The sentinels on
the parapet were
<pb id="jcop132" n="132"/>
often relieved every ten minutes, and rarely had to
stand longer than half an hour during the extreme
cold weather, and even then we were informed that
some few of them froze to death and fell off the
parapet. Very often the whispering would simply be
one prisoner asking another for a chew of tobacco. I
have seen half a dozen men of my barrack taken out
and made to ride the Mule simply for talking about
trading rations for tobacco, after they had retired.</p>
          <p>If either of the “big four” were standing inside the
barrack and heard some one spit on the floor, that
insured a ride for an hour anyhow. The first thing we
looked for after the bugle blowed for roll call, as we
were not allowed to stir from our bunks until then,
was to see how many were on Morgan's Mule. I do
not remember one solitary morning during my stay
within the inclosure of the prison walls, that
Morgan's Mule was not covered with men, and some
one was on it at all hours during the day.</p>
          <p>We were not allowed to huddle together around
our heating stoves, and if caught by the guard we
were sure not to escape punishment of
<pb id="jcop133" n="133"/>
some sort. Whenever any one would announce the
approach of a guard, the stoves could be seen
standing alone and solitary, and the prisoners either
on their bunks or a considerable distance from the
stoves. It would often be laughable to see what
effect the approach of one of these fellows with a
blue coat or blouse on his back would have on the
prisoners.</p>
          <p>Another favorite method of punishment was this:
Every man in a barrack would be marched out on the
snow in front of the barrack, formed in a line of one
rank, and then told by the guards “that under the
snow and ice could be found plenty of corn for
them to parch and eat, that they must reach for it,”
which was done in the following manner: The guards
would point their pistols, cocked, at the heads of the
prisoners, make them bend their bodies over in a
stooping posture, until the tips of their fingers
would touch the ground under the snow and ice, the
knees having to remain perfectly stiff and straight
and not bend in any manner. They would be
compelled to stand in this position from half an
hour to four hours, and never for a
<pb id="jcop134" n="134"/>
shorter time than half an hour, the snow and ice being very
deep all winter, often twenty inches. This was called, by
the guards, “reaching for corn,” or “reaching for grub.”
Frequently many of those who were being punished in this
way would become so exhausted and fatigued they would
fall over in the snow in an almost insensible condition; these
were apt to receive a flogging with a pistol belt,
administered by the guard, or receive several severe kicks
and blows. Often these men would stand in that position
until the blood would run from the nose and mouth; the
guard would stand by and laugh at it.</p>
          <p>Another mode was to make the prisoners sit down on
the snow and remain sitting for two hours, without rising or
changing positions. On one occasion, for some little, trivial
and frivolous offense, all the prisoners occupying barrack
No. 1 were marched out in front of their barrack, formed in
a line of one rank, and made to sit down on the snow and
ice for two hours. I visited that barrack soon after the men
had been released, and the indentures made by them in the
<pb id="jcop135" n="135"/>
snow told what they had been doing all that time, as their
shapes were plainly impressed in the snow. P. E. Lively
and Dick Litsey, of Texas, were two of the crowd who
had to sit on the snow.</p>
          <p>There was still another method of punishment, bordering
on and a little akin to the former I have named. The guards
would make all the men in a barrack march out and stand
erect on the snow from two to four hours, and not allow
them to stir or move their feet to keep warm. The guards
would leave them in that position and go off to other parts
of the prison, but in a short time return, and examine the
snow to see if it had been displaced by the movement of
any of their feet. If there were any, it would be fortunate for
the prisoner if he escaped with only a flogging with a pistol
belt on the naked back, which would amount to all the way
from forty to one hundred lashes. Sometimes the prisoner
would be beaten over the head with the butt end of a large
army pistol, or a piece of plank.</p>
          <p>Another favorite method was to tie prisoners
<pb id="jcop136" n="136"/>
up by the thumbs. This was accomplished by tying a
strong cord around each thumb, then throwing one
end over a scantling or beam above the head,
drawing the cord until the arms and body were
stretched until the toes would just touch the ground
or floor. Prisoners tied up in this manner frequently
had to remain suspended until life was almost
extinct, before the guards would cut them down. I
have seen the blood run from the nose and mouth of
some who were thus punished. This punishment
often compelled those upon whom it was inflicted
to lie in bed for several days, unable to walk.</p>
          <p>There was still another favorite mode of
gratifying their insatiate thirst for punishment. They
would procure half of a barrel or large box, have a
hole made in it large enough for the prisoner's head
to slip through, and so as to let the barrel or box rest
on the shoulders; when this ornament was placed
over the prisoner's head he was forced to walk from
one end of the street to the other, from half a day to
a whole week every day continually. This was very
severe punishment. The barrel or box was very
<pb id="jcop137" n="137"/>
heavy, and all the time pressed on the shoulders
with nothing to protect them, which made the
carrying of either very painful and annoying.</p>
          <p>Still there was another mode, differing from all
the others, but fully as harsh and severe, if not
worse. The guards would procure a ladder long
enough to reach from the ground to the top of the
plank wall which inclosed the prison grounds, the
upper end of the ladder resting against the side of the
parapet and the lower end on the ground just over the
dead line. The prisoner would be compelled to climb
up and down the ladder from morning till night,
every day for a whole week, and sometimes longer;
he was not allowed to stop and rest at all. One
prisoner had to climb and descend this ladder for
nearly a whole month. The only time that any rest
could be obtained would be during meal time and at
night. He was in charge of the sentinel on the
parapet, and if he stopped to rest would have been
shot. This tried men's souls, as well as their
constitutions.</p>
          <p>Often if only one man was taken out to be
punished, he would be stripped naked to the
<pb id="jcop138" n="138"/>
waist and given from fifty to one hundred lashes with
a broad pistol belt on the naked back, so severe that
the blood would trickle down the back to the heels.
If a barrel was convenient, the prisoner would be
stretched across it; if not convenient, then he would
be stretched across the foot of a bottom bunk and
whipped.</p>
          <p>These different punishments would be
administered for the most frivolous and
insignificant offenses which could be imagined, and
the prisoners would hardly ever know, or have any
idea what offense had been committed. Most of
these different punishments would be inflicted after
night, in the barracks, and sometimes during the
day. Old Red, Prairie Bull, Little Red and Old Bill
McDermott were the prime executioners.</p>
          <p>Who were these men? Probably night could tell
more about them than day. They were the unsightly,
hideous, midnight ghouls in human shape, who
prowled over the prison square after night for no
other purpose save to find some frivolous excuse to
exercise their assumed authority. They were the
ghastly and hungry hyenas digging into the prison
barracks for little,
<pb id="jcop139" n="139"/>
trivial violations of some foolish and
insignificant rule of their own manufacture, and of
which the prisoners knew nothing until marched out
for punishment; then these guards would hardly ever
let them know what rule or regulation had been
violated, or the offense which had been committed.</p>
          <p>The water-closets were several feet from the
barracks, and the rules and regulations in regard to
going to and returning from them were very strict
and severe. No excuse for failing to go to them
when a prisoner was sick, would be accepted, but
men with a scorching fever were compelled to go
out of the barrack in cold, freezing wind and
blinding snow at any and all times, either day or
night. When necessity forced any one to visit the
water-closets, he had to go directly there and return
without stopping between them and his barrack, no
matter how sick and weak he might be; if he stopped
on the way and any of the police guards of the “big
four” saw him, he was sure to receive a severe
flogging with a leather belt. Their belts all had a
large
<pb id="jcop140" n="140"/>
brass buckle on them, and frequently the buckle would be
used in administering a flogging.</p>
          <p>Just outside the kitchens, slop barrels were always kept
for the purpose of depositing beef bones, and such other
scraps and refuse as came from the kitchens; these would
often remain until late in the afternoon without being
removed and emptied. The hungry prisoners often resorted
to these barrels in search of a beef bone from which to
make soup, or bake by the heating stoves in order to
obtain the grease. Whenever either or all of the “big four”
caught any of the prisoners near the barrels, or would see
any prisoner with a bone, they would make him take it in
his mouth, get down on his hands and feet, go up and
down the street from one end to the other, and bark like a
dog, or imitate it as near as possible, the guard all the time
laughing at the prisoner and keeping a pistol cocked at his
head ready to fire. The “big four” called this the dog
performance, or barking like a dog. Sometimes the “big
four” would allow the prisoner to stand up and walk erect
from one end of the street to the other, carrying the bone in
<pb id="jcop141" n="141"/>
his mouth; at the same time they would take their stand at
some convenient place within range of the prisoner, in
the event that an army pistol became necessary to be used
as a persuasive means to enforce this method of
punishment.</p>
          <p>They were as avaricious to punish prisoners as the
hyenas of Mexico were for human flesh during the war of
the United States with that country, for on the morning
after a battle these unsightly animals could be seen
scratching up the dead soldiers who had been killed and
buried on the previous day. I think that these men were four
whom Dante saw the spirits of in hell, and from whom he
sketched some of the inmates of that place, and the
representatives, anyhow, of these men must have been there
when his guide conducted him through the inner chambers
of that dreadful abode. I am confident that had Dante been
living, and visited Camp Douglas at this time, he could have
had living subjects from whom to paint his descriptions and
illustrations of the inmates of the infernal regions. He could
have drawn his pictures
<pb id="jcop142" n="142"/>
from original material, and not had to strain his
imagination for imaginary and mythical subjects from
whom to describe the companions of the devil in hell.
When these four beasts in human shape would enter the
prison square, the sulphurous flames and the forked
lightning  encircled by the dark, blue and red prismatic
colors of the rainbow of hell would hover over the
prison, and had Dante stood on the parapet of the wall
which inclosed the prison and looked over into this
pen, he could have seen the full and complete
illustration of the whole, from the first circle to the
eighth of his poem. I feel confident that these were the
four beasts with “seven heads and ten horns” whom John
saw in his vision on the Isle of Patmos.</p>
          <p>There were many of the guards and
non-commissioned officers who were disposed to
treat us as strictly prisoners of war, and as humane
as their instructions and orders from their superiors
would permit. I cannot call to mind an instance
wherein we were personally ill-treated either by an
officer or guard, except by those whom I have
particularly named and designated.</p>
          <pb id="jcop143" n="143"/>
          <p>It was death to cross the dead line. This dead line
was placed around the walls of the prison, for the
purpose of keeping any one from approaching the
walls. A prisoner after reaching the plank wall could
easily tunnel out and escape, and while tunneling
could not be seen by the guard on the parapet, hence
the object of the dead line. If a prisoner approached
near the dead line, or stepped over it, either by
accident or on purpose, he would be fired upon sure,
and quickly reminded that he was on forbidden
ground by the sharp crack of a Springfield rifle and
the dull thud of a minie ball piercing his body
through. If the sentinel on the parapet failed to fire
at him, some one or more of the “big four” would do
so, and they rarely missed their aim.</p>
          <p>It was death for three or more of the prisoners to
congregate on the streets and engage in
conversation. The sentinels on the parapet would
shoot at them, and they never failed to kill or
mortally wound some one of the crowd. We had to
be very cautious in every act, for the simplest and
most innocent mistake would cost
<pb id="jcop144" n="144"/>
a man his life, or a severe wound. During extreme
cold weather the guards would detail two prisoners
every night to each stove, in order to keep fires
burning all night. One man to each stove would sit
up and keep fires until midnight, and the other until
daylight. This kept the barracks very comfortable
and warm. We were not allowed to get up and sit by
them after night, or to stop and warm on returning
from the hydrants.</p>
          <p>Cooking on the stoves was prohibited, and cans
were not allowed on them under any circumstances;
if one was caught on a stove, the owner of it, if he
could be found, was sure to be punished, his can
with the contents destroyed, even if it contained the
owner's entire rations. Many times the owner would
disclaim all knowledge of ownership of the can, and
of course the others would not give him away; but
the can and contents would not escape destruction.
Oyster cans and tin plates were as valuable to us as
money, for the purposes we used them, and when
destroyed the loss was felt. One day two of the
guards stole into our barrack before we knew it,
<pb id="jcop145" n="145"/>
and caught two of the prisoners cooking on the
stoves and using two large cans which they had but
recently obtained. The guards destroyed the cans
with their contents, then marched the owners out of
the barrack on the street and made them pat and
dance alternately in the snow for half an hour.
Generally, when we wanted to cook, we would post a
vidette at the door to watch for these gentlemen
wearing the blue, and whenever any of them made
their appearance our vidette gave us his peculiar
signal, and then all signs of cooking would be
obliterated. Often they came inside the barracks and
carefully examined the stove anyhow, and while
doing so would look at us very suspiciously, but if
no vessels were found about the stove they would
leave the barrack, when our cooking would be
resumed as usual. Once in a great while a prisoner
would accidentally and unintentionally get into the
dungeon. Whenever a prisoner took up his abode
inside of that doleful place, he would be held in
there by a cannon ball and chain fastened around
each ankle. Sometimes in addition to this, his hands
would be tied behind his back. The bill
<pb id="jcop146" n="146"/>
of fare at this boarding place consisted of bread and water—a very stale article of each. The prisoners were by no
means fond of this place, and during my stay in prison I
think that only one had to board there.</p>

          </epigraph>
          <p>Within a few weeks after being domiciled, and were
becoming accustomed to our new mode of living, we were
notified that this barrack must be vacated, and that we
must be transferred to other barracks, to make room for
those who had somewhat grown in favor with the Federal
authorities, and were known to the rest of us as two
classes,—one class was known as gentlemen of the “White
Apron,” more familiarly, as Free Masons; the other as
“Loyal Men;” that is, those who petitioned for the oath of
allegiance and to join the Federal army, to fight against
their own blood kin and their already desolated homes.
These favored loyal gentlemen were removed to and
located in the barracks which the authorities had us to
vacate. All the Free Masons were stored away in barracks
to themselves. They
<pb id="jcop148" n="148"/>
were as good Confederates as any of us, but were more
highly favored on account of the order to which they
belonged, and we were informed that they received much
better treatment at the hands of the officials, in every
particular, than the remainder of us. I did not belong to that
order then; hence, I had to take the storm as it came, let it
be heavy or light.</p>
          <p>When I heard this term “loyal men” used, I took a
retrospect of my history knowledge, gained from reading
during my school-boy days, and this was the conclusion at
which I arrived, <foreign lang="la">viz.</foreign>: A good loyal man among the
Confederate prisoners would have made a genuine Tory
during the <sic corr="first">flrst</sic> war between the Colonies and Great Britain.
A Tory at that time was an American by birth or
citizenship, but who was in sympathy with and aided His
Grace, King George III., in attempting to conquer his own
countrymen. These Tories, whom we had with us, desired
to take the oath of allegiance to the United States
government and join the Federal army, after having fought
them for nearly three years. At this particular time news
from the front, which
<pb id="jcop149" n="149"/>
we would receive through the newspapers, concerning the
success of the cause for which we had been fighting, was
by no means flattering to us, but there was an element in
this prison who were composed of material to remain, and
were determined to rot in prison before they would leave it
in a dishonorable way or by disgracing the cause which
they had espoused, let it be right or wrong. The majority of
the prisoners were of the right metal. They determined
never to give up the ship until the last spar of the vessel
went to the bottom to rise no more, and firmly resolved to
see it all go down before abandoning the rigging.</p>
          <p>So the two hundred men occupying barrack No. 53
were scattered and in small squads assigned to different
parts of the prison. The little squad to which I belonged
was sent to barrack No. 8, near the upper side of the
prison square.</p>
          <p>An application to take the oath of allegiance and to join
the Federal army had to be made in writing and at the
office of Lieutenant Fife. Whenever we saw a prisoner
enter that office we
<pb id="jcop150" n="150"/>
easily divined his purpose and the object of his visit.
The applicant tried to keep a visit of that character a
secret from the remainder of the prisoners, until he
was ready to leave his barrack and take up his abode
at the loyal row of barracks. Three barracks in same
row were set apart for this class of Tories, and the
Federals gave it the name of “Tory barracks,” or
“loyal row.” Of course, we looked down on that row
as much or more so than the Federals did.</p>
          <p>The Federals informed us that this element of
“loyal men” must be separated and removed from
our barracks and be placed in a row of barracks to
themselves, where they could be carefully looked
after and closely watched, as President Lincoln, the
War Department, and all real true and honorable
Federal soldiers looked upon and regarded this
class of men with rather a suspicious eye, and who
could not be trusted very far in anything. That these
men were considered and looked upon by the
Federal soldiers as black sheep, which had strayed
and crept into the genuine and blooded flock of
whites, and that we must not be contaminated with their
influence,
<pb id="jcop151" n="151"/>
that is, in case any of them possessed any
influence.</p>
          <p>This element of “loyal men” embraced those
who, after they entered the prison, had recanted, and
now desired to change sides, don the blue uniform
and be mustered into the service of the United
States government, to serve in cavalry or infantry
for the remainder of the war.</p>
          <p>Before President Lincoln and the War
Department would allow them to make the change,
they were required to undergo a state of probation
similar to that required by the Methodist Episcopal
church of a new convert, when he presents himself
to that church for membership. You see, they took
him on trial. I feel confident that President Lincoln
and the war department borrowed this idea from that
church. In addition to his probationary period, there
was a penance attached, somewhat similar to that
required by the Roman Catholic church of its
members when they get a little off, although the
penance was differently imposed and executed.
There was some difference in receiving the
applicant on probation and in receiving his penance
and
<pb id="jcop152" n="152"/>
confessions; instead of the applicant being received
on probation by a preacher, and having his hands
squeezed out of shape by the good sisters, his
confessions received by a worthy prelate, and all
received verbally, President Lincoln and the war
department constituted <sic corr="themselves">themseves</sic>, for that
particular purpose, into a committee of preachers
and priests, assumed the office and duties of all
these worthy personages, required all applications
for pardon and all confessions to be reduced to
writing, signed and sworn to by the applicant. There
was this difference—these self-constituted divines
required no quarterage, penance money or Peter's
pence to be paid them; they did all this free of
charge. What a difference 'twixt now and then.
Colonel Sweet and Lieutenant Fife were rather
sub-preachers and priests for this particular purpose.</p>
          <p>The applicant for the oath would slip off secretly
and alone, appear in person at the door of Lieut.
Fife's office, and after taking off his hat, was
allowed to enter the office in an humble attitude.
The application would be filled out and read over to
him. It also contained the iron-clad
<pb id="jcop153" n="153"/>
oath. He would signify his willingness to take it and
join the Federal army, by signing his name and
swearing to it. After this was accomplished,
the applicant would generally call on two of
the police guards to accompany him to his barrack
to obtain his blankets and clothing—that is, if he
was ready to vacate the barrack and enter a “loyal”
barrack. Generally, the first notice which we would
have of anything of this kind, would be when he
entered the barrack with one or two blue-coated
gentlemen, who accompanied him for protection. It was 
well for such men to have an escort of that character, as 
the remainder of us did not stand on very nice scruples
in regard to our conduct toward this class of men,
and we cared but little as to what kind of treatment
they received at our hands. These fellows looked
like they had stolen something and been caught with
it; the ground had a special attraction for their eyes.</p>
          <p>When removed to the “loyal row” they were kept
out among the other scrubs and black sheep
of that class. We rarely ever saw anything more of
them, as it was much healthier and the
<pb id="jcop154" n="154"/>
atmosphere more agreeable for them at the “loyal
row,” than elsewhere on the inside of this prison.
We would not tolerate any Tories amongst us, if
we knew it. On a certain occasion a member of our
barrack (No. 8) slipped into Lieut. Fife's office to
make an application to join the Federal army, and
some one came at once and notified us. When the
applicant came into the barrack we caught him and
pitched him out into the street with all his baggage
we could find, at the same time ordering him not to
return. He did return, and not alone, but with two
police guards. They all came into the barrack; the
guards cocked their pistols on us, cursed out the
business, while the fellow gathered up his luggage.
As they were leaving the barrack the boys
discovered that part of his things had been left. We
ran to the door and threw them after him, and
instead of them hitting the ground, one of the guards
caught the full force on the back of his head; he
immediately turned and fired his pistol at the crowd,
and the top of my cap passed off with the force of
the ball. I did not give him a chance for a second
shot, but
<pb id="jcop155" n="155"/>
quickly found myself on my bunk, as did the others.
The guard returned and ordered all the prisoners to
“Morgan's Mule.” I gave them the slip at the door
and went off down to barrack No. 15. About the
time three others and myself were becoming deeply
interested in a game of euchre, the guard came in
and ordered them out in line to “reach for <sic corr="corn">eorn</sic>” for
some frivolous offense they had committed. Here I
got caught again, but knowing the sergeant of the
guard, who happened to be on hand, I spoke to him,
telling him that I did not belong to that barrack, but
was a member of barrack No. 8. He ordered me out
of the line and to go to my barrack. I went, but not
to my barrack, as all the members of it, except
myself were on the “Mule,” I kept entirely aloof
from it. I quickly left the line that was “reaching for
corn.” I went to another barrack and soon engaged in
another game of euchre, this time being more
successful than before, and was not interrupted.</p>
          <p>The application for the oath and to join the
Federal army had to go to Washington City, be
placed before the President and his cabinet
<pb id="jcop156" n="156"/>
for their careful examination and consideration, to see
whether or not the applicant could be trusted and relied
upon as meaning what he had sworn and subscribed. He
had to swear that he would submit to all the terms and
conditions of the iron-clad oath, be baptized over again for
the remission of his former sins, then publicly declare his
belief in the saving power of President Lincoln and the War
Department by a long confession of faith, and last but not
least, to commune with their soldiers by eating pickled beef
and hard tack. After all this had been carefully done, if the
application was found to be correct in every particular, if
he had minutely complied with all the minutiæ called “red
tape,” had been on probation as long as they thought
necessary, and done penance enough for all past offenses,
after a time the application was returned, the applicant was
released from prison and marched out of his prison
quarters, a pure, white-washed Yankee. He was then
entirely beyond our reach, as securely and completely as
though he possessed an evil spirit or had a case of leprosy
like the
<pb id="jcop157" n="157"/>
Jews frequently had under the leadership of the great
law-giver Moses, in the wilderness.</p>
          <p>As to where they were sent after taking the oath and
being mustered into the service, I cannot say. However, I
can say that I do not know of ever meeting one of them
since; if any of them were sent back South to fight, I am
confident that a Confederate bullet would be sure to hunt
for these men and be most likely to find them. On either
side, a bullet would go farther to kill one of this class of
men than any other. These men were in fully and equally
as bad a shape as the Israelites were in the Wilderness of
Sin, for I do not think that any of this class of white-washed
Yankees at Camp Douglas ever again saw or entered the
promised land. I never heard of or knew anything of them
again, except one, and he committed suicide soon after
taking the iron-clad oath of allegiance.</p>

          <p>The sanitary regulations were very strict, and the
authorities had them rigidly enforced. They required us to
keep the streets clear of all trash of every description. We
were prohibited from emptying any vessel containing dirty
water on the streets. They made it our duty to scour the
floors of the barracks once a week, or twice each month,
anyhow, and to sweep them clean once each day. The
barrack sergeant (who was a prisoner) made an
alphabetical list of the names of all the members of his
barrack, and as their names came on the list, were detailed
accordingly, until all had scoured the barrack. Spitting on
the floors or inside the barracks was strictly prohibited. If
the police guard discovered any filth or spittle on the floor,
it would insure all the members of a barrack a two hours
ride on Morgan's Mule. The most important regulation was
<pb id="jcop159" n="159"/>
in regard to cleanliness of the person and clothing of the
prisoners. The great majority of us were only <sic corr="too">two</sic> glad to
avail ourselves of the means placed at our command for
preserving cleanliness of our person and clothing; but there
were those with us who were very careless and indifferent
concerning their person and clothing, and sometimes such
persons paid very dearly for their neglect.</p>
          <p>Friday of each week was the regular wash day, in order
that our clothing would be in good shape for inspection at
roll call on the following Sunday morning; but we were at
liberty to do any extra washing on any other day we might
see proper. There were a few of the prisoners who
followed washing for others as a regular business, and for
which they charged a small compensation—that is, from
two and a half cents to five cents per garment. Those who
were financially able to hire their washing, did so, but the
great majority of us were unable to hire anything done;
hence, we had to wash our own clothing, and wear it
without starch or ironing. But very few of the prisoners had
an extra
<pb id="jcop160" n="160"/>
change of clothing, and when wash day came we
washed our shirts during the forenoon, and in case
our pants required washing, we did that in the
afternoon. We allowed no filthy person to remain in
his filth, and when we discovered one, he would be
immediately taken charge of by the others and
forced to wash himself and clothing up in good
shape. If any one failed to wash his clothes, or have
it done, we at once organized a court, composed of a
judge, clerk, lawyers, sheriff and jury, then tried the
prisoner for uncleanliness and uncleanly habits. He
was sure to meet with a conviction, but never an
acquittal. The penalty was generally very severe,
especially if he was a stout and healthy man. The
sentence of the court, after the jury found him guilty
as charged, would be that he be taken by the sheriff to
the wash house, there stripped, and two men
thoroughly scrub him with soap and rags, until the
skin was red. One dose of this was sufficient; it
never had to be repeated upon the same person. He
was then compelled to wash his clothing. Scarcity of
clothing shielded no one from the pains and
penalties of the wash
<pb id="jcop161" n="161"/>
house. The accused had to pay the court costs, all of
which could be settled up and paid with “thirds of
bread” or “chews of tobacco.” If the party was too
poor to pay the costs, the court would remit all
except the penalty. All the property a man owned
was on record in his own name, and not hid behind
his wife; hence, we all knew the exact amount of
property owned by each man in a barrack.</p>

          <p>While lying up in our prison barracks we had
nothing to occupy our time except to talk over
incidents and campaigns through which we had
passed during the previous three years, and our little
simple games of amusement, all of which soon
grew very monotonous to me; hence, I found that I
had ample time to reflect, and also to have some
concern for the future as regarded my prospects and
success in life hereafter. I began somewhat to
realize my great loss in being deprived of the
privilege of attending school, and having but little
idea as to how long this cruel war would last, and
being assured that my term of imprisonment bid fair
to last for an indefinite period; and feeling too that
the war would
<pb id="jcop163" n="163"/>
eventually terminate, and that I would then stand in
great need of something learned from books; and
also knowing that all I had learned as a soldier would
avail but little and not carry me through life, and be
of service during a time of peace, I now resolved to
devote the most of my time over such books as I
might be able to obtain, if any at all could be
procured without having to pay money for them, as I
had none just at this time. Of course books were
very scarce, and but few of any kind could be found
among the prisoners, and more especially the kind
which I most needed. I succeeded in obtaining an
arithmetic, algebra and a few others. I was not
capable of mastering these mathematical works
alone, and the next important step was to find an
instructor who would give a little voluntary
assistance. I soon found him in the person of Pat
O'Larry, a messmate of mine. Pat was educated at
Edinburg, in Scotland, and was an accomplished
mathematician. Some time before the war, he came
to the United States and located at Vicksburg,
Mississippi. When the war broke out, he joined the
Fortieth Mississippi
<pb id="jcop164" n="164"/>
regiment of volunteer infantry. He was large,
raw-boned and stood full six feet clear of everything,
weighed nearly two hundred pounds, hair, eyes and
skin dark, whiskers thin, walked and stood perfectly
erect, form and general make up symmetrical. He
was a high-toned Scotch gentleman. I am indebted to
Pat for the thorough mastering of the principles of
mathematics, and my success in learning the entire
contents of these two mathematical books while in
prison. I soon became a great favorite with Pat, and
he never failed to aid me in the prosecution of my
studies. He was very good natured, his temper
seldom being ruffled except over a game of euchre.
We sometimes engaged in a social game of euchre.
Our clique was composed of Pat O'Larry, Brit
Nichols, Jake Pool and myself. Jake and I were
always partners against the former. We played to
see who should carry the water from the hydrant for
the whole mess. I will not say who were the best
players, but Jake and I never had any of the water to
carry. We were mere novices at playing, as
compared with them, but experts at counting
<pb id="jcop165" n="165"/>
points, especially when not entitled to them.
Frequently I would turn up two or three points, and
when noticed by either of the others a squabble at
once would be raised, and Pat would become so
angry that down went his cards on the floor, and then
he would offer to fight both of us at once; but we
were too sharp to come in contact with an angry two
hundred pound Scotchman, and would compromise
on one or two points, laugh him into a good humor,
and resume our game. Our qualifications for
counting euchre points saved us from carrying the
water. This was the only species of gambling in
which we ever engaged during our imprisonment. A
great many of the prisoners played cards for their
rations and tobacco. These articles were as current
in this little secluded world as gold and silver were
in the other world outside. It was amusing and
laughable to see the little chews of tobacco, about
the size of buck-shot, and thirds of bread, all stacked
up in a game of draw-poker.</p>
          <p>The prisoners would be as deeply interested in
this employment as though chews of tobacco
<pb id="jcop166" n="166"/>
and thirds of bread were as many gold dollars. Many of
them would go without a meal or two, in order to play
cards for what little rations they had. This species of
gambling, with many of the prisoners, was generally the
order of the day, and carried on continually. Numbers of
men were mere skeletons and living shadows, walking
spectres, and complained all the time of extreme hunger;
some appeared to be starved almost to death; in fact, our
rations were enough to keep us tolerably hungry all the
time. The majority of the prisoners used the most rigid and
strict economy in taking care of their rations, but with that
were continually hungry. As for myself, I valued my grub
too highly to fool it away on a game of cards. I ate it all,
and from my feelings after eating it, I had some doubt as to
whether I had received the full benefit of it.</p>
          <p>Men appeared to crave tobacco fully as bad as
something to eat. It would be amusing in the extreme to
see those who had tobacco slip off to one side, or cover
up head and ears in a bunk, to take a chew. Most every
means was adopted to
<pb id="jcop167" n="167"/>
prevent the exposure of a piece of that favorite weed.
Camp Douglas was one place where no living prisoner was
ever caught by any other prisoner taking a chew of
tobacco. Had any one shown a plug, or even a small piece,
a thousand men would at once have surrounded him, and
he could not have kept it for a moment. Those whose
homes were in the extreme Southern States had but little
communication with kindred and friends, consequently they
had no chance to obtain money, and many of them suffered
considerably for lack of many little necessaries which
others could obtain. However, several of us shared our
tobacco with them whenever we could do so without
cutting our own supply too short.</p>
          <p>Many of the prisoners whose homes were on the inside
of the Federal main lines, could obtain money and various
articles from home and friends. Money was directed to the
prisoner, but stopped at headquarters. The one to whom it
was directed would receive a notice of its arrival. The
notice would state that so much money had been received
at headquarters for him, and had been placed to his credit.
Accompanying
<pb id="jcop168" n="168"/>
this notice would be a coupon or ticket
showing the amount. With this coupon we could buy
anything which was kept on sale at the sutler's store,
such as meal, flour, tobacco, sugar, coffee, canned
fruits, and various articles of clothing. A barrel of
flour weighed about one hundred and ninety-six
pounds, and sold for sixteen dollars; one of meal
two hundred pounds, and sold for twelve dollars. All
other things were equally as high in proportion to
quantity. We clubbed together and bought a barrel of
flour or meal, and then divided it according to the
amount each paid. Whatever amount was spent with
the sutler would be credited by him on the coupon,
and a smaller one detached which showed the same
credit; this latter one the sutler would carry to
headquarters and draw the amount in money. This
was done until the entire amount which the coupon
called for would be exhausted. I received the full
benefit of my coupon, which called for ten dollars,
and I used it all before I left the prison. We baked
our bread on the heating stoves, whenever this could
be done on the sly and without letting the guards
know
<pb id="jcop169" n="169"/>
it. This meal and flour often wonderfully assisted
our last “third of bread” in keeping us alive to dine
another day.</p>
          <p>We were allowed to write letters to our parents
and friends at home once every ten days or two
weeks. Our letters had to be very brief, as each had
to be examined at headquarters before they were
sent off in the mails. We could only mail them as
our turn came, and then only one letter. We had to
stand in line of one rank—that is, one behind the
other, Indian fashion. Every day the line contained
from fifty to five hundred men. I had to stand in line
two whole days to get half a dozen lines and an
envelope mailed. The prisoners would nearly freeze
while waiting for their turn to mail a letter. I mailed
two while there, and this experience satisfied me
with freezing. When letters for prisoners arrived,
they would generally be brought in by the
sergeant at roll call, or the prisoners would obtain
them at the sutler's store. And</p>

          <p>Necessity is said to be the mother of invention,
and this coupled with idleness and restlessness
which could not be avoided, certainly would
exercise the ingenious faculties of man in seeking
such employment as his surroundings would
indicate. There were near twelve thousand prisoners
of war in Camp Douglas, with nothing to keep them
employed except that which they engaged in from
necessity or choice.</p>
          <p>We had men with us of all sorts of trades and
professions, but a greater number of manufacturers
and mechanics than any others. There were lawyers,
doctors, preachers, and school-teachers, but these
particular classes indefinitely suspended the
practice of their professions. There were 
watch-tinkers, shoe-cobblers, finger-ring and breast-pin
makers by the hundreds. There were few real 
shoe-makers, but plenty of
<pb id="jcop171" n="171"/>
cobblers; they patched and mended the old shoes for
the prisoners. Enough leather could not be obtained
to make a full pair of shoes, as the market for that
commodity had closed against us. Consignors
withheld all consignments of leather and closed the
port of entry here with our sort of folk. Gold and
silver were in great demand, but the mines and mints
stopped all shipments of the precious metals to our
ports.</p>
          <p>Gutta-percha was more plentiful than anything
else; from this rings and various kinds of breast-pins
were made. They most always found a ready market.
Rings and brooches were ornamented with beautiful
sets and all sorts of fancy designs of a number of
varieties; the manner in which they were finished
showed superior artistic skill and workmanship. The
prisoners often sold fancy rings and brooches to the
Federal officers and soldiers for quite a little sum,
but this had to be done very secretly, as money
would be taken from them if the guards could
possibly capture it.</p>
          <p>Musical instruments with us were very scarce,
but good musicians were numerous, and they
<pb id="jcop172" n="172"/>
soon manufactured their own, such as violins, guitars and
banjoes, and which answered our purposes quite as well
as if they had been imported at fabulous prices. Strings for
these sometimes could be obtained at the sutler's store,
and when they could not be purchased at this store, a
friendly guard would often bring a bunch from the city to
the prisoners. Throughout the prison square, at all hours of
the day, beautiful strains of music were wafted on the
breeze. This enchanting music was executed by the
manufacturer of, and on, his own instrument. Occasionally,
we indulged in a dance, if such a performance as we
indulged in could be called a “dance,” being deprived as
we were of lady partners. We only engaged in them for a
change of sport and to while away the time. We all danced
promiscuously and without distinction—that is, all who felt
inclined to do so. We entertained no scruples as to the
propriety of it, and we had no fears of a committee of strict
church members waiting upon and threatening to “church”
us for dancing.</p>
          <p>Those who furnished the music for us were
<pb id="jcop173" n="173"/>
compensated by a “chew of tobacco” or “thirds of bread,”
all of which were voluntary donations. These were the only
occasions on which we were called upon to make a free-will
offering—as we had no churches to build and keep in
repair, no Sunday-schools to furnish with literature, no
preachers to pay and their families to look after, and best of
all, no missionary money to raise to equip and send off to
heathen lands some over-zealous and misguided crank of a
man, who imagines and believes that with plenty of money
he can take the whole population of China and Japan and
send them to paradise by whole platoons<sic>.</sic> and who leaves
the poor and ignorant of his own kind and country to work
out their own salvation as best they can, or die and be lost.</p>
          <p>We played the old-fashioned game of ball—with a ball
and bats, but no base-ball, that game not being popular
with us on account of our disinclination to don the scant
garb of circus clowns and monkeys. In knocking our ball it
would sometimes fall over the dead line, which was
forbidden ground to us under all circumstances;
<pb id="jcop174" n="174"/>
in that event we had to call in the assistance
of some friendly disposed guard to recover it.</p>
          <p>The oyster-can was an important factor and
figured quite conspicuously as an article of
merchandise with us. Its current price was a “third
of bread,” which was all the time its standard value
when to be paid for with that commodity; when not
sold for that, chews of tobacco were the next best
consideration—three chews would fetch one of
these cans. Thirds of bread and chews of tobacco
were the standard units of currency within this little
secluded world. There was no chance for
counterfeiting. The professional counterfeiter had
no show whatever to debase our currency; hence, we
were never troubled with anything of that character.
These articles always passed current at their par
value, and we had nothing to fear or dread in regard
to the rise or fall of the market value of our
commercial currency. We had no gigantic moneyed
corporations to contract the currency and keep the
market fluctuating.</p>
          <p>We had provision vendors who trafficked in all
<pb id="jcop175" n="175"/>
kinds of provisions which could be obtained within
the inclosure of the prison wall. Vendors of rats,
cats and dogs were very scarce. They notified us
that orders from the prisoners who preceded us had
exhausted the market.</p>
          <p>Perhaps it will not be out of place here to relate an
incident which occurred previous to my introduction
into the prison. I give it on the authority of the other
prisoners, some of whom were the instigators and
participants of the occurrence. Lieutenant Fife
owned and kept a beautiful black terrier dog with him
on the inside of the prison. This dog was a great
favorite and pet with the prisoners, but one day the
cooks in one of the barracks enticed the dog into
their kitchen, killed and dressed it nicely, and
cooked it; then invited quite a number of the other
prisoners to dine with them, as they had a rare dish
for dinner—they ate the dog and drank the soup.
Soon after this Fife wanted to find his dog, but could
learn nothing of it whatever. He posted a notice on
the bulletin board, offering ten dollars for the return
of his dog.
<pb id="jcop176" n="176"/>
The prisoners read this notice, and some one wrote
under Fife's notice the following lines:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“For lack of bread the dog is dead,</l>
            <l>For want of meat the dog was eat.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>This led to the discovery of the barrack in which
the dog was killed and cooked. Of course, this
somewhat aroused a little anger at headquarters, and
the rations for that barrack were suspended for two
or three days. An order was issued and circulated
over the prison square like the Pope's bull, when it
thundered forth from the Vatican of Rome against
Henry VIII., of England, “that if any one on the inside
of the prison was known to furnish rations to any of
the members of this barrack, he should have a ball
chained to his ankle and be sent to the dungeon,
there to reflect over the mistakes and follies of life
for a period of ten days, and during that time be
allowed only bread and water to eat.<corr>”</corr> The prisoners
who engaged in this dog-eating affair scattered over
the prison and were fed by others as long as this
military bull was in force. After the bull expired,
nothing more was ever said or done concerning the
eating of the dog.</p>
          <pb id="jcop177" n="177"/>
          <p>This military prison camp was one place we had
no hypocrisy to deal with; perhaps that principle was
not altogether wanting, but we had no motive for
practicing it. We had been cut off from the moral
and religious influences of home, churches and
religious societies, and had lived the rough life of a
soldier for three long years; yet, notwithstanding,
the morals were good, and we had not forgotten our
early training. When the Sabbath appeared, in our
imaginations we would picture some lone and
solitary church house, which, as if by a miracle, had
escaped the fire-brands and destruction of an
invading army, and in that picture see gathered
together the dear old ladies, whose true piety, in
those soul-stirring times, enabled them to bear with
such wonderful fortitude the great calamity which
enveloped all that was near and dear to them, with
the remnant of men and their little children, the former
of whom were too much enfeebled, by age
and disease, to aid in fighting the battles of their
country; all imploring Divine help and protection in
this, their hour of need. These pleasant thoughts with
us somewhat
<pb id="jcop178" n="178"/>
atoned for the lack of the presence of these
good people, and the practice of religion with them.</p>
          <p>Some few of the prisoners, who were fortunate
enough to possess the means with which to purchase
the necessary ingredients and who had a fancy for
the culinary art, baked and sold cakes and pies to the
rest of us; whether from the materials of which they
were composed, or the surroundings under which
they were cooked, I have never been able to decide,
but anyhow I have been unable to wholly overcome
my aversion for cakes and pies ever since. These
cake and pie bakers had to be very careful to prevent
any of the guards from knowing anything of their
cooking on the stoves, for had they been caught their
cook-vessels and contents would have been confiscated
and the owners made to pay the penalty for
it on Morgan's Mule. There could be found in
almost every barrack one or more humorists and
comic songsters, who would keep the members of
his barrack in a state of mirth and laughter nearly all
the time, and could spin their
<pb id="jcop179" n="179"/>
yarns, occasionally, equal to the Great Magician
spinning his ribbons.</p>
          <p>We could also boast of one ventriloquist, who
could perform many tricks which at the time were
considered marvelous, but now very common. The
only name by which he was ever known among the
boys was that of “Pig.” We suppose that he obtained
this name on account of being so diminutive in
stature. This little “Pig” belonged to the Forty-second
regiment of Tennessee infantry. We had been
familiar with him and his tricks from the beginning of
the war, and had never grown tired of him, as he was
such a jolly little fellow. He was captured with us at
Franklin, Tennessee. For some time his
ventriloquism was a great annoyance to some few of
the guard at Camp Douglas. “Pig” would watch for
them on the street, and the first thing they knew or
heard would be a lot of chickens squalling in their
pockets, or some unusual noise under their caps.
They would grab their pockets or snatch off their
caps in utter amazement and confusion, and finding
nothing, together with the uproarious laughter of the
prisoners,

caused them to become more confused then ever, but
generally they would laugh it off. When they
definitely learned the originator of these jokes, he
was compelled to desist. He was often called upon
by the guards to perform tricks for their amusement.
His favored performance, and the one he seemed
proudest of, was to place a small piece of silver
money between his feet, then double himself
backwards and with his mouth pick it up. The pieces
of money were five cents pieces and dimes, which
the guard furnished and allowed him to keep after
the performance of his trick. He disappeared from
the prison some time before any of us were
released, and we were informed that the authorities
released him on parole.</p>

          <p>One morning the police guards notified us that 
during the afternoon General Joseph Hooker would
enter the prison square for the purpose of inspecting
the prison, and to review the prisoners. That we must
be dressed in our best clothes and present the most
favorable appearance possible. That we would be
formed in lines of eight ranks—that is, eight deep,
on the streets nearest the entrance gate to the
prison. We knew “fighting Joe,” as he was familiarly
called, by reputation. But few of us, if any, had ever
seen him to know him. On that Georgia campaign we
had frequently encountered Hooker's corps in battle;
consequently, we were very anxious to see him at
close range, and obtain a good view of the
commander, whose corps we had so often faced in
conflict. Early
<pb id="jcop182" n="182"/>
in the afternoon our guards returned and ordered us
all into line. We formed in lines of eight ranks deep
—that is, eight abreast, on the streets nearest the
prison gate. After we had formed, a shrill blast of
the bugle announced the approach of General
Hooker on the inside of the Federal square. The
prison gate was now thrown open and the military
chief, accompanied by an escort of officers, entered
the prison square, all well mounted upon fine
horses. He entered first, about ten spaces in advance
of his escort. The uniforms of these officers were
fine and all trimmed with gold lace, and their
shoulders mounted with epaulettes. General Hooker
presented quite an imposing appearance. His
military dress showed off his figure to quite an
advantage. They all carried the appearance of hard
service on the front.</p>
          <p>They all dashed around the prison square, then
around the lines of prisoners and out, making their
visit very brief. We rather expected a speech from
General Hooker, as we had been informed by the
guard he would do so, but it seemed that this was
not his day for speech-making.
<pb id="jcop183" n="183"/>
He was not as social as some others who
visited us. We summed it all up in this, that he
much preferred fighting us to making speeches.</p>
          <p>Governors Morton and Oglesby, the former of
Indiana, and the latter of Illinois, made us one visit,
and each made a speech. They entered the prison
grounds in a fine carriage drawn by a span of black
horses. As soon as the object of their visit was made
known to us, we gathered around the <sic corr="carriage">carrige</sic> and sat
on the ground—squat. Governor Morton's speech
was one of sense, and worthy of being delivered
before an audience composed of ladies, as well as
men. He addressed the crowd of prisoners, as
gentlemen. His first expressions quickly informed
us that we were in the presence of and listening to a
gentleman, or at least, a man who knew how to act
one. He made us believe that our release, which he
stated was soon to be, was entirely and solely due to
his efforts made in our behalf, and the interest he
had taken in trying to secure it for us. That he had
used his influence with the President and War
Department,
<pb id="jcop184" n="184"/>
to have us released in the near future, and restored to
our former citizenship. That after he succeeded in
obtaining our release, he would have us all sent back
to our different homes, clothed with all the rights and
privileges of free American citizens. Whether all or
anything he stated was true or not, we failed to know
the difference then, but it served its purpose anyhow,
in so far as we were concerned; and his speech gained
the good will and esteem of most, if not all the
prisoners, and we believed him to be one of the best
men in the government. Had we been free, and he a
candidate for President, every one of us would have
cast his vote in favor of Governor Morton for
President of the United States. Governor Morton will
be long and kindly remembered by the survivors of
Camp Douglas prison, for the manner in which he
acted on this occasion. I have never met one of the
survivors yet, who heard that speech, but spoke in
terms of the highest commendation of him. Governor
Morton had always borne the reputation of being an
extremist in his bitter feelings for the South, and had
on
<pb id="jcop185" n="185"/>
former occasions publicly expressed himself in that
manner; hence, our hearts and faces were steeled in
the expectancy of abuse, but we were very agreeably
disappointed, as he avoided everything of that
character. We did not at the time, believe that he
entertained any kinder feelings for us than others of
his politics, who had visited us; but it was evident
that when his keen eye and scrutinizing gaze
penetrated this body of scarred and bronze-faced
prisoners, he was shrewd enough to know that he
was not facing a cowardly mob of ignorant hireling
soldiers; but on the contrary, he seemed to fully
realize the fact that we were all regular veterans,
inured to hard service on the front, honorably
captured in battle, and composed of men from some
of the best families that any nation could boast of,
and serving a government without the least prospect
of remuneration in dollars and cents, as it was
wholly inadequate to meet such demands.</p>
          <p>Among the number of noted personages who
visited us, were twelve Indian chiefs, representing
as many tribes somewhere in the far West.
<pb id="jcop186" n="186"/>
All of them were tall and portly, and dressed out and
out in full Indian costume. We appeared to be about
as great a curiosity to them, as they were to us. They
were on their way to Washington City, to see and
have an interview with the Great Father. Their stay in
Camp Douglas was very brief, and after an hour or
so we politely bowed them out.</p>
          <p>One preacher, of the Baptist persuasion,
occasionally visited us from the city. He was as fine
a specimen of ugliness and ignorance as one could
wish to see. If an artist had desired a model from
which to sculpture a statue representing the two
characteristics above named, he could not have found
a better one; for the first named characteristic we did
not blame him, but for the latter we did, knowing as
we did, that their greater concern for us consisted in
the complete and safe-keeping of our persons within
the prison walls, and not in the safety of our souls.
Our safety consisted in our inability to get outside of
the inclosure of the prison walls; farther than this,
we had but little security of our persons, as nearly
every night some sentinel
<pb id="jcop187" n="187"/>
on the parapet would fire into a barrack—the keen
crack of a Springfield rifle, the sharp whistle and
crash of a fifty-four calibre minie ball passing
through the wall of our barrack, and often through
some one of the prisoners, which it seldom failed in
doing, would forcibly remind us that the sentinel on
the parapet from which it came, was not asleep; and
nearly every time this occurred, some one of the
prisoners had to be carried out, if not dead, badly
wounded. This was almost a nightly occurrence, kept
up as long as we remained within the inclosure of
the prison walls. One night the sentinel on the
parapet opposite our barrack (No. 8) fired into it,
the ball passing <sic corr="through">hrough</sic> the wall of the barrack and
the railing of the bunk on which I was sleeping,
struck my arm, leaving a big red spot, and fell spent
on the blankets; fortunately it did no other harm. In
fact, when one retired at night, he had no assurance,
and but little idea of being alive at the dawn of the
following morning. A prisoner in our barrack was
sick and hardly able to walk, but started to the
hydrant for water; on the steps of the barrack
<pb id="jcop188" n="188"/>
he met old Prairie Bull, who, without a word,
drew his pistol and shot the prisoner down, breaking
his thigh near the groin. The wounded man had to
remain where he fell, from the early part of the
night until the following morning, when he was
taken out and died during the day. This inhuman
wretch, this fiendish slimy serpent who would have
made any one sick to have touched him, refused all
aid and assistance to the wounded man; but promptly
informed us that if we touched the wounded
prisoner, he would shoot us all down like dogs. A
local came out in some of the newspapers of the
city that a prisoner made an attack upon one of the
police guards, and he had him to kill; after this there
was nothing more done or said about it. Such deeds
as this were of frequent occurrence, and nearly
every week some one was maliciously and wantonly
shot by some villainous sentinel on the parapet, or
by one of the “big four.”</p>
          <p>Old Red was a most consummate coward, as was
fully demonstrated one day. He happened to come
up our street alone, but armed to the
<pb id="jcop189" n="189"/>
teeth with two large army pistols; he attempted to
assail one of the prisoners who chanced to be
standing near one of the kitchen slop-barrels. The
prisoner seized a piece of plank near by, and with it
made a lunge at the old villain, who at once turned
and fled for life. It was for dear life that he ran,
followed by the prisoner close at his heels, striking
at his head with the plank at every bound. He ran into
the officers of the guard's quarters to save himself
and for protection, the prisoner following him to the
door. We expected nothing more nor less than for
the prisoner to be riddled with bullets, but we
intended that a few more of us would take a hand at
the game, regardless of consequences; but it
appeared that the officers and other guards were not
disposed to interfere; they only stopped the prisoner
at the door and would not allow him to enter. Old
Red wanted the officers to give him permission to
take two or three and go up to the prisoner's barrack
and give him a flogging; they refused to do so, but
gave him permission to go alone and flog him to his
heart's content, provided he would leave his arms at
the quarters.
<pb id="jcop190" n="190"/>
He postponed the thrashing, and to my knowledge,
the prisoner had failed to receive it up to the time
we left the prison, and I am confident that the
flogging has never been administered. That same
afternoon we learned that the officers witnessed the
beginning of the row, and seeing what they did,
accounted for their non-interference. It was well for
him that he failed to come to the barrack, for we all
determined to so completely dissect him, that not a
piece of him could be recognized or found by the
authorities to bury.</p>
          <p>The flag-pole from which floated the large United
States flag, stood inside the Federal square. The
cord which worked on the roller at the top of the
pole to raise and lower the flag, broke, letting the
flag fall to the ground. A Federal soldier went to
the top of the pole to replace the cord over the
roller; just as he had almost repaired the cord so as
to raise the flag, he let go <sic corr="everything">everthing</sic> and fell, coming
down heels over head like a pair of winding blades
through the air, striking the scaffold, which was
around the pole and some ten feet high, he went
through
<pb id="jcop191" n="191"/>
it and struck the ground, senseless. We could
plainly see him from the prison square. Many of us
were compelled to turn away from this sad sight;
although he was our enemy, we could not witness
such without feelings of pity, and the more so as we
had been informed that the motive by which he was
actuated to make the attempt to replace the cord was
the promise of a furlough to go home and see his
family. We were informed by the guards that he
survived the fall only a few hours. Within a day or
two some of the Federal officers came on the inside
of the inclosure of the prison walls, and hired one
of the prisoners to climb the flag-pole and replace
the cord. He succeeded, and came down all right,
without injury. The guards informed us that he
received thirty dollars and his release from prison
for this feat.</p>
          <p>The sergeant of the guard of our barrack, and who
called our roll, on extremely cold mornings was
more lenient than on other occasions. Whether
from the fact that the cold, biting air had about the
same effect upon him that it did us, we did not
question, as we were only too glad
<pb id="jcop192" n="192"/>
for him to cut the ceremony short. Instead of the
long and tedious calling of the roll, he would ask if
all the members of the barrack were present; of
course we would answer in the affirmative, upon
which he would order us to break ranks and return to
our barrack. He would then go into the barrack and
look up the sick, in order to make sure that none
were missing.</p>

              <l>“Way down in Dixie.”</l>
            </lg>
          </epigraph>
          <p>The Federals called us “prisoners from way down
in Dixie,” and we were known by them as “prisoners
from Dixie.” They applied the term indiscriminately
to everything from the South, and for that reason I
shall give a brief sketch of the origin and use of the
term as I find it in different works. “This country
called ‘Dixie’ is an imaginary place somewhere in
the Southern States of America, celebrated in
popular negro melody as a perfect paradise of
luxurious ease and enjoyment. This term is often
used as a designation of the Southern States.”
“Dixie” is an indigenous Northern negro refrain. It
was one of the every day allusions of boys eighty or
one hundred years ago in all their out-door sports.
And no one ever heard of “Dixie's Land” being other
than Manhattan Island until several years after a man
by the name of Dixie
<pb id="jcop194" n="194"/>
shipped his negroes from that island, when it
was erroneously supposed to refer to the South
from its connection with pathetic negro allegory.</p>
          <p>When slavery existed in New York, one Dixie
owned a large tract of land on Manhattan Island,
and a large number of slaves. The increase of
the abolition sentiment caused an emigration of
the slaves to more thorough and secure slave
sections, and the negroes who were sent off,
many being born there, naturally looked back to
their old homes, where they had lived in clover,
with feelings of regret, as they could not imagine
any place like “Dixie's.” Hence, it became
synonymous with an ideal locality, combining
ease, comfort, and material happiness of every
description.</p>
          <p>In those days, negro singing and minstrelsy were in
their infancy, and any subject that could be wrought
into a ballad was easily picked up. This was the case
with “Dixie.” It originated in New York, and one Dan
Emmett, a celebrated negro minstrel, was the first
singer of “Way Down in Dixie.” It assumed the
proportions of a song in New York. In its travels it has
been
<pb id="jcop195" n="195"/>
enlarged, and has gathered moss. It has picked up a
“note” here and there. A “chorus” has been added to
it, and from an indistinct “chant” of two or three
“notes” it has become an elaborate melody. But the
fact that it is not a Southern song cannot be ruled
out. The fallacy became so popular to the country,
that a writer spared no pains to trace up and give the
origin of it. The song was popular with both armies
during the late war, and it could be heard from the
brass-bands of each almost daily on that celebrated
Georgia campaign. Since the war it has been very
popular, but, as shown, the original is entirely of
Northern origin.</p>
          <p>The parents and relatives of several of the
prisoners visited Camp Douglas for the purpose of
seeing their sons and near relatives, but were not
allowed on the inside of the prison walls. They
made known the object of their visit to the
commanding officer at headquarters, who would
then send for the prisoner whom they desired to
see, and there they could see no other. Many of
these visits were made for the purpose of obtaining
the release from prison of some one;
<pb id="jcop196" n="196"/>
and sometimes they succeeded—that is, when the
proper conditions were complied with, which were
these: the prisoner was required to take the oath of
allegiance, his parents or other relatives were
required to vouch for its faithful observance, in the
shape of a large bond. These were classed as another
grade of loyal men. But were released in this way, as
the sureties had to be wealthy, and true-blue
Northern men who could produce undisputed
evidence as to their loyalty to the Federal
government, which sometimes was very hard to do.</p>
          <p>Sickness of some kind prevailed all the time
within the inclosure of the prison walls. The
diseases most prevalent were fevers and small-pox,
the latter especially so. Those who were sick
received very little attention until removed to the
hospital, which sometimes was not done until the
patient had grown very sick. The only assistance we
could render was to hand them a drink of water, or
some other little simple attention. Their fare was
only the regular rations allowed to them while well;
they suffered for nourishing food, as their appetites
would refuse
<pb id="jcop197" n="197"/>
such as we could obtain for them. After being
removed to the prison hospital they fared much
better in every respect, and many recovered who
would have died had they not been removed to it.
Those who were so unfortunate as to take the small-pox, 
were removed to the small-pox hospital, which
was located somewhere beyond the city limits.</p>
          <p>The prison hospital was located just outside of
the prison square, in what we called the Federal
square,—that is, this square was fenced in with a
plank wall similar to ours, and the troops who were
stationed there for guards had their quarters within
this inclosure. The prison hospital was a large
building sufficient to contain all the sick who were
assigned to it. It was supplied with bunks, cots and
stretchers, mattresses, blankets, sheets, and cotton
pillows, all of which were kept ordinarily clean,—in
fact, everything was about as good as could have
been expected under the circumstances.</p>
          <p>Cases of varioloid, which is a light form of 
small-pox, were of frequent occurrence. The army
surgeons came inside the prison and vaccinated
<pb id="jcop198" n="198"/>
all of us twice, while I was there. Those of the boys
upon whom the vaccine matter took effect and
caught cold with it, had very sore arms, which would
inflame and be very <sic corr="painful">painflul</sic> for several days. I
seemed to be proof against all the forms of this
dreaded disease, as my bunkmate was sick with the
loathsome affection two weeks before being
removed to the hospital, and I was compelled to
occupy the same bunk with him every night, and I
was twice vaccinated all of which failed to have any
effect upon me. I was never sick in the slightest
degree while there. I never missed a meal or 
roll-call, and I attribute my remarkable good health to
my cleanly habits, together with my cold bath at the
wash house, which I never failed to take every
morning before breakfast. Many times when I took
my bath the air was so cold a thin sheet of ice would
freeze on my person before I could dress; in that
event, I had to crawl back into the water, thaw it off,
and then dress as I came out. The lake water was as
warm all the time as spring water, although during
exceedingly cold weather the hydrants where we
obtained
<pb id="jcop199" n="199"/>
our drinking water froze up; then we had to do
without water until they thawed out. We were not
allowed to carry water from the wash houses.</p>
          <p>One morning, after I had been within the
inclosure of the prison walls something over five
months, the sergeant of the guard within our barrack
informed me that he had secured a place for me at
the prison hospital, to act in the capacity of
prescriptionist; that on the following morning he
would come for me, and I must be ready to vacate
my barrack. My feelings of joy were indescribable
at this news. As he had on a former occasion shown
me some kindness, I could not believe that he would
send me to a worse place than I already occupied,
but on the contrary, I had an idea that there was
something better in store for me, hence on the
following morning at roll-call I was ready, and did
not wait for breakfast, but gathered up my few not
worldly goods, but bads, as they looked to be in
about as dilapidated a condition as our Southern
Confederacy at this time, and went with him to the
prison hospital, where he turned me over to
<pb id="jcop200" n="200"/>
the surgeon in charge, at the same time remarking
that all I had to do was to follow instructions and I
would be all right; he then bade me good-bye, and
left. I never had the pleasure of meeting this friend
again.</p>

          <p>After partaking of a better breakfast than I had
been favored with for several long months, in which
the bill of fare consisted of full rations allowed
prisoners of war by the Federal government, with
the additional rations of sugar and coffee, I reported
for duty to the surgeon in charge of the hospital.
The first duty he required of me was to roll up each
patient's medicine separately, and label it with the
patient's name, the time it was to be given and how,
as he dosed it out; he then assigned me to a
particular ward with the medicine for the prisoners
who occupied that ward, with instructions to
administer the medicine to the sick of that ward
<pb id="jcop202" n="202"/>
as labeled or directed. I gave medicine to the sick
of this ward twelve hours out of every twenty-four,  
-  that is, from 12 o'clock (noon) until
midnight, at which time I was relieved and had no
more duties to <sic corr="perform">peform</sic> for twelve hours. The
surgeon had regular hours to visit the sick in the
different wards. Of course, it was not altogether
pleasant to be so closely associated with sick men,
but my duties were light, and I enjoyed more
liberties than when within the inclosure of the
prison walls. Out here I enjoyed another advantage,
that of obtaining newspapers, of which we had been
deprived since our capture; from these I could learn
something of what was going on in the outside
world.</p>
          <p>Every day, as soon as I completed my regular
duties, I sought some one from whom to borrow a
copy of the latest newspaper. Although nearly thirty
years have elapsed, I can vividly recall the eagerness
with which I scanned its pages, to find, if possible,
where our armies had fought and won the victory of
some decisive battle, but in this I was sadly
disappointed and unable to find one single instance
wherein our troops
<pb id="jcop203" n="203"/>
achieved any success. At first I doubted the
correctness of the newspaper reports, but as time
wore on facts quite contrary to my fondest wishes
began to develop.</p>
          <p>The papers began to be filled with news of all
sorts of defeat and capture of our armies, which
would be greeted by the Federals with the booming
of cannon firing salutes. Telegrams were also
frequently coming in at headquarters, announcing
new victories for the Federal armies on the front,
which was made known publicly to the privates of
their army stationed at Camp Douglas, upon the
receipt of which they would send up such a yell and
shout as would almost shake the earth. Such
demonstrations of joy from our enemy proved to us
beyond a doubt that there was some truth in these
rumors, and ere long we received more definite
news of the surrender of the Southern armies. The
authorities notified us that we would be permitted
to take the oath of allegiance to the United States
government, be released and return to our homes;
but it was not until the first squad of five hundred
prisoners marched out of the prison square
<pb id="jcop204" n="204"/>
to headquarters and took the oath, that we could realize
the extent of the news.</p>
          <p>The prisoners were released in squads of five hundred
each day; those at the hospital had to remain and go with
the last squad who left the prison. Early on the morning of
the 20th of June, 1865, we received orders to vacate the
hospital, fall into line, march to headquarters, to take and
subscribe the following oath of allegiance to the United
States Government of America, to wit:</p>
          <div3 type="oath">
            <head>“UNITED STATES OF AMERICA.</head>
