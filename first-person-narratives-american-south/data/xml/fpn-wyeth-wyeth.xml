        <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
        <p>THE chief purpose of this volume is to record from personal
observation something of the social, economic, and
political conditions which prevailed in the South before,
during, and immediately after the Civil War. It was my
good fortune to have been born and reared in a section
where the wealthy landed proprietors and slave-owners,
the poorer whites, and the negroes came together.</p>
        <p>What is written of the delightful society of the aristocracy of
the old South at Huntsville would apply to hundreds
of other communities of that period below “the
Line.” It was only possible with the institution of slavery,
and with the downfall of the Southern oligarchy it disappeared,
never to be repeated. Washington, Jefferson, Madison,
Marshall, Wythe, Monroe, Mason, the Randolphs and
Lees were among the products of that unique civilization.
“There were giants in those days.”</p>
        <p>In my native county the poor whites greatly outnumbered
the rich slaveholders and their slaves. The negroes baptized
them contemptuously as “poor white trash.” They
were poor, comparatively speaking, but they were not trash.
The vast majority were uneducated, many could not read
or write; but they were as a class far from being ignorant,
for they were “good listeners” and close observers of current
events. My father, whom they made at first county
and later district judge, was idolized by these simple people,
<pb id="wyethxiv" n="xiv"/>
and I fell heir to their affectionate guardianship. By the
time I was fifteen years old I believe I was personally acquainted
with every one of these families in our county.
Their homes were chiefly in the uplands or foot-hills or coves
or in the sparsely settled plateau of Sand Mountain.
The houses were of logs, some hewn, many of skinned poles,
and some so primitive that the bark was left on. The roofs
were of rived boards, not nailed, but held in place by split
logs laid on as weights and reinforced here and there by
stones. Some of the floors were of puncheons, others of
planks; and not infrequently the kitchen, smokehouse, and
other added shelters had for flooring the sandy earth. As
might be inferred, their lives were simple, and in general
they were obedient to law. They were, however, high-strung
and quick to resent an affront, and their too ready
appeal to the rifle and the hunting-knife in the settlement
of personal differences was the chief exception to their
common acceptance of the authority which the court-house
represented. Very rarely, far back in some remote fastness,
an occasional mountaineer, who gathered inspiration
from the sun which curved over his head each day without
seeming to pay much attention to human regulations, or
from the free air which the preacher told him “bloweth
where it listeth,” would conclude that the government at
Washington had no right to prescribe in what form the corn
which he raised with his own hands and on his own land
should ultimately be marketed, and would proceed to distil
it into whisky by the light of the moon. I shall never
forget the feeling which was evident as one of these mountaineers
remarked to me: “Your pap put me in jail once
for moonshinin', but I never blamed <hi rend="italics">him</hi> fer it. We all
knowed he was a good man and done what <hi rend="italics">he thought</hi> was
<pb id="wyethxv" n="xv"/>
right.” These poor whites were in the main religious, belonging
to the Baptist or Methodist persuasions, and were
much given to “protracted meetings,” revivals, and exhortations
to secure conversions, which latter was defined
as “comin' through.”</p>
        <p>They dressed with extreme simplicity, usually in cotton
or woolen stuffs, raised, spun, woven, and tailored at home.
The mild climate made it possible to go for at least nine
months without shoes, and the one pair of brogans for the
year was usually put on at Christmas. The young children
and boys to about the sixteenth year wore in summertime
nothing but a single garment made like a long shirt,
which came down to near the ankles and was slit on each
side as high as the knees to allow freedom in walking or
running. As they raised everything they ate, except sugar
and coffee, it may well be said that their wants were few
and easily supplied.</p>
        <p>At least three-fourths of the men who carried guns in the
battle-line of the Southern Confederacy were of this class.
They had no interest directly or indirectly in slavery, and
would willingly have seen the negroes freed and colonized
out of the country. The proportion of non-slave-owners
in my own company and regiment was greater than seventy-five
per cent. Colonel James Cooper Nesbit,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1">1</ref> in his most
interesting and instructive narrative, says: “My company,
H, Twenty-first Georgia regiment, was recruited in northwest
Georgia and Alabama. The muster-rolls show one
hundred and eighty-five names. All were non-slaveholders
except myself. The parents of four owned one or two
slaves, and the father of one of my lieutenants owned forty.
<note id="note1" n="1" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1">1 <hi rend="italics">Four Years on the Firing Line</hi>, p. 69. Imperial Press, Chattanooga,
Tenn., 1914.</note>
<pb id="wyethxvi" n="xvi"/>
This was the average of the Twenty-first Georgia and the
Twenty-first North Carolina of the same brigade, and these
two regiments made the best record of any in Stonewall
Jackson's corps.”</p>
        <p>The brave fight these men made was not for slavery.
Their contention was that freemen had the inherent right
to do as they pleased, and as freemen they would stay in
the Union or secede, as the majority desired. They were
then and are still clean-cut Americans, uncontaminated by
contact or association with the restless, poverty-stricken,
and discontented hordes of immigrants who are crowding
our shores in these latter days either as anarchists, who,
like shedding snakes, strike blindly and viciously at everything
which moves, or like the socialists, whose aim is seemingly
to bring all human endeavor to the common level of
mediocrity. Should the safety of our institutions ever be
endangered I prophesy that these men of the foot-hills and
mountains of the South will be the strongest guarantee of
law and order.</p>
        <p>At various periods in history (and doubtless before the
records were preserved, for in his natural tendency to do
foolish things on a large scale man is the same yesterday,
to-day, and for ever) epidemics of insanity have appeared
with results more unfortunate to moral and intellectual
development than have followed the wide-spread infections
of the body.</p>
        <p>The legend of the Tower of Babel; the numerous racial
migrations; the crusades and the war of the five great nations
now in progress in Europe, each of which, claiming to represent
a Christian civilization, is calling for divine assistance
in robbing and killing, are examples.</p>
        <p>One such epidemic has visited our shores. In the agitation
<pb id="wyethxvii" n="xvii"/>
for and against slavery in the United States, reason and
conscience were finally dominated by fanaticism. There
was a period in the decade from 1830 when by the judicious
co-operation of the advocates of emancipation North and
South a humane and practical solution of this momentous
problem was possible. I ask attention to the fact that at
this time there were in the eight largely agricultural and
slave-owning counties of my native section along the
Tennessee River in Alabama eight active emancipation societies
organized by Southern men, and that in Huntsville a former
slaveholder edited an emancipation newspaper and was
twice nominated for the Presidency of the United States
on the abolition ticket; also to the fact that a single state
freed negroes approximating in value one hundred million
dollars without one penny of remuneration!</p>
        <p>I am firmly convinced that if instead of the nagging, irritating,
insulting, and finally insurrectionary and murderous
meddlesomeness of the Northern abolitionists, the conservative
and better portion had united in earnest and
friendly co-operation with their brothers of the South, who
proved their zeal and devotion to principle by the wholesale
sacrifice of wealth and ease, the humane scheme of
emancipation and colonization as set forth in the “Virginia
Resolutions” would have been carried out and chattel
slavery would have disappeared by peaceful means.</p>
        <p>That portion of the volume which relates to the Civil
War is chiefly a narrative of the every-day life of a private
soldier in camp, in battle, and in prison. A single experience—
namely, the battle of Chickamauga—is discussed from
the standpoint of speculation. In my opinion the Southern
Confederacy was won here by desperate valor and lost by the
failure of the commanding general to appreciate the
<pb id="wyethxviii" n="xviii"/>
magnitude of his victory and to take advantage of the great
opportunity which was his for the capture or destruction of
the entire Union army in Georgia and Tennessee. Chickamauga,
as I interpret it from personal observation and from
careful study, marked the high tide of the Confederacy.</p>
        <p>I have been asked to describe the sensations or emotions
which are experienced under the trying ordeal of battle.
The courage, whether moral or physical, or the combination
of both, which enables a human being to incur the risk
of suffering and death is a common possession. I would
guess that of every one hundred men in our regiment fully
ninety-five would have done, or would have tried to do,
more or less willingly, any duty required. The other five
would shirk and exhaust ingenuity to keep out of gunshot
range by feigning illness, or some temporary necessity, or
lagging until a chance offered to dodge behind an obstacle
whence only the file-closers could drive them to the firing-line.</p>
        <p>In very rare instances the sense of fear became so
overwhelming the victim would run away without regard to the
commands to halt and the danger of being shot in the back
by one's own men.</p>
        <p>Personally I never saw any one do this, but it did occur.
The very unusual experience of the soldier who, when what
was thought to be a dangerous charge was ordered and
we were in the act of moving forward, stepped from the
ranks and handed his gun to our captain and said he couldn't
“go in” is given in the text. Vanity, another name for
which is “family pride,” or the dread of being called a coward,
will account in part for what is usually accepted as
courage; and yet admitting all this as a measure of human
frailty, I have witnessed a great many instances of that
<pb id="wyethxix" n="xix"/>
sublime quality of self-forgetfulness in the performance of
duty which is the crystallization of virtue namely, <hi rend="italics">true
courage</hi>. Appreciating, as every normal human being must,
the instinctive dread of suffering and the love of life, it is
not difficult to realize the awful sensation which is experienced
in the moments given for reflection as one marches
calmly up to the point of danger. It must, as I take it,
count as a supreme moment in existence. Once engaged
and in the excitement of fighting, this sense of impending
disaster is happily lost; and to some there comes an exhilaration
which it would be almost permissible to term ecstatic.</p>
        <p>In my own case, in the first two or three minor engagements
I was not scared; in fact, the excitement or exhilaration
was rather enjoyable; but this was “the valor of ignorance.”
After I had learned what war really was I never
went under fire without experiencing an overpowering sense
of dread and fear, with the single exception of the incident
of riding through the Union lines at Chickamauga, which
is given further on.</p>
        <p>Part II is devoted mainly to my work as a surgeon and
teacher. My aim has been to collect in concise form for
convenient reference those original contributions which
have been generally accepted by the profession.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">The Ligation of the External Carotid Artery</hi> as an accepted
procedure dates from the publication of my essays on the
arteries by the American Medical Association in I878;
the <hi rend="italics">Bloodless Amputations at the Hip-joint and at the Shoulder</hi>,
in 1889; <hi rend="italics">The Cure of Otherwise Inoperable Vascular Tumors
by the Injection into their Substance of Water at a High
Temperature; The Immunizing Effect upon Sarcoma of a Mixed
(Pyogenic) Infection; The Demonstration of the Process of
Arterial Occlusion after Ligation in Continuity</hi>, etc.</p>
        <pb id="wyethxx" n="xx"/>
        <p>Upon these, together with the introduction of systematized
postgraduate medical teaching in America, the
author “rests his case” at the bar of posterity. That the
Polyclinic gave an impetus to and was coincident with
the great awakening in American medicine there can be
no doubt. Once inaugurated, the movement practically
compelled postgraduate study in the general profession, for
it naturally followed, that when even a single practitioner in
any community took advantage of the extraordinary facilities
which were offered for increasing his store of knowledge,
<hi rend="italics">public opinion</hi>, that insistent <hi rend="italics">vis a tergo</hi> of human progress,
compelled the others to follow. Not only has every city
of importance in our own country established one or more
postgraduate medical schools, but abroad (as in London)
our system has been adopted.</p>

THE TENNESSEE VALLEY—MARSHALL COUNTY AND GUNTERSVILLE IN
ALABAMA</head>
          <p>FIFTH in size of the rivers in the United States, the Tennessee,
rising in the mountainous regions of Virginia and North Carolina,
flows in a general direction southwest until, at the great bend in
northern Alabama, it turns northwest to empty into the Ohio.
Although three-fourths of its course is within the boundaries of the
state to which it gave its name, that section of the South widely
known as the Tennessee Valley is wholly within the state of
Alabama.</p>
          <p>Eastward and to the north, from where Lookout stands
sentinel for the mighty Appalachian range, the numerous large
tributaries fairly divide honors with the main stream, while to the
west, after pitching over the great cascade at Mussel Shoals, it
leaves the mountains and the picturesque valley through which it
has flowed for two hundred miles.</p>
          <p>Emerging near Chattanooga from the narrow gorge through
which it has worn its way, walled in by cliffs of stone so steep
and high that from the channel their crests are at times not
within the range of vision, this majestic river enters the beautiful
Valley of the Tennessee.</p>
          <p>Winding in and out among the mountains on either hand,
<pb id="wyeth2" n="2"/>
some near, some far, for most of the year covered with verdure
to the steep cliffs which form their crests, opening here and there
into fertile plains or densely timbered coves that rise as they
recede to reach the summit of the distant heights, on past bold
projecting bluffs which seem to block the way, wide fields of corn
and grain and cotton which long before the frosts of winter fall
shall be as white as snow upon the arctic plains, flows ever on
this gracious gift of nature, blessing with plenty my native
Valley of the Tennessee.</p>
          <p>In 1802 the territory now included in the states of Mississippi 
and Alabama was ceded by Georgia to the United States, and in
1819 Alabama was admitted to the Union. That portion of this new
state lying north of the river had been opened for settlement a
number of years, while to the south stretched the reservations of
three great Indian tribes—the Seminoles, nearest the Gulf of
Mexico; then the restless, warring Creeks, and, closest in touch
with civilization, the wonderful Cherokees. Lovers of peace and
tactful, they were on living terms not only with their war-like
brothers, but friendly also with their Anglo-Saxon neighbors just
across the Tennessee. Builders of houses and tillers of the soil,
these Indians had made such progress toward civilization that
they had in use a syllabic alphabet and a method of printing.
Invented by Sequoyah,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2">1</ref> this alphabet of eighty-five characters,
each representing a single sound of their language, is pronounced
by a writer in the American Encyclopedia to be the “most perfect
alphabet ever devised for any language.”</p>
          <p>While the Cherokees could not hold the Creeks and
Seminoles to peaceful ways, they would not allow them to
<note id="note2" n="2" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref2">1 This remarkable man died in 1843. It was with this tribe that Sam
Houston lived before and after he became Governor of Tennessee.</note>

<figure id="ill1" entity="wyeth2a"><p>MARSHALL COUNTY COURT-HOUSE, GUNTERSVILLE, ALABAMA</p></figure>
<pb id="wyeth3" n="3"/>
pass through their domain to harrow the white settlers north of
the Tennessee. The massacre at Fort Mims, Alabama, on
August 30, 1813, where four hundred men, women, and children
were butchered, led to the annihilation of the Creek
Nation at the battle of the Horseshoe Bend on the Tallapoosa
in 1814, while the remnant of their allies, the Seminoles,
sought refuge in the impenetrable marshes of the
everglades in Florida, where they still survive. For twenty-four
years longer the Cherokees lingered in their native land,
until by treaty in 1836 they marched to the West, and their
former reservation was opened for settlers.</p>
          <p>When from a part of this Indian land the new county of
Marshall was formed, Louis Wyeth, a young lawyer, journeying
by stage from Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, to Pittsburg, by
steamboat down the Ohio to Louisville, Kentucky,
thence by stage to Huntsville, Alabama, and on foot for
the remainder of the way (for as yet there were only trails
in the Cherokee purchase), came to cast his lot with the
other pioneers and to “grow up with the country.”</p>
          <p>He must have taken well with these men of the wilderness, for
they made him their county judge within the first
years of his advent; and, although he did not long remain
on the bench—for he sought a wider field—it may truthfully
be said that throughout a long and useful career he
judged these, <hi rend="italics">his</hi> people, to whose welfare he devoted his
life. In 1848 he founded the town of Guntersville at the
south bend of the Tennessee, built at his private expense a
handsome brick court-house and a well-appointed jail,
which were his gifts to the county and the new town, which
became and still is the county-seat. As a member of the
state legislature he secured a charter for a railroad “to
connect the navigable waters of the Tennessee and Coosa
<pb id="wyeth4" n="4"/>
rivers, with the object of securing an inland system of
transportation between Mobile Bay and the vast rich region
through which flowed the Tennessee and its tributaries.” Of this
railroad, which is now a part of the great Nashville&amp;
Chattanooga and Louisville&amp; Nashville railroad systems, he was
the originator and first president.</p>

EARLY RECOLLECTIONS</head>
          <p>IT would be interesting to determine just when the brain-cells
begin to register impressions that become fixed and
are subject to the call of memory; and also with which of
the senses these early registrations are associated. The
brain is such an unreliable machine that the results of its
operations require careful study and critical analysis before
acceptance. Since older minds (which are considered mature)
are known to entertain absolutely impossible schemes
as fixed convictions, it is not to be wondered at that children
are readily susceptible to self-deception. I have no doubt
that many incidents retold as being the recollections of
early childhood are nothing more than reflected images of
word-pictures from older persons who really were witnesses.
Only to-day a woman of more than ordinary brilliancy and of
unquestionable sincerity assured me she remembered distinctly
being held as a baby in her grandmother's arms when she was
only a little more than one year old!</p>
          <p>It occurs to me that since children are almost wholly animal,
their earlier brain-cell registrations should be associated with
alimentation, and with those to whose personal ministrations they
looked for comfort and protection. It would seem but natural that
one's mother should come first of all things; but with myself, I
am sorry to say, this is not the case. I was four years old when
my memory of things began; and my mother, who, as I now
know, did little
<pb id="wyeth6" n="6"/>
else but devote her time and thoughtful care to me, does not hold
this precedence. My earliest recollection is of a burning house,
and of Mack, one of our slaves, holding me seated on one of the
front gate-posts, where I could have a good view of the
conflagration. The date of this incident is known, and it enables
me to determine that my brain-cells were not registering fixed
impressions earlier than the fourth year. About this time I first
straddled a horse and tumbled off, and that incident was indelibly
impressed, as was a relation thus early established with Aunt
Peggy, our negro cook, whereby without the knowledge of my
mother, at about ten o'clock every morning I found myself in the
kitchen eating from a small wooden tray corn-bread crusts soaked
in “pot-liquor,” a very filling, greasy, and satisfying mixture, which,
I learned later, was a common food of the
negro children of the plantations.</p>
          <p>It is clear, then, as far as I am concerned, that the very first
enduring impression was conveyed to the cells from the retina,
through the so-called “sense of sight.” The second was from
fright, and fused with this is another impression which seems to
indicate that the mind was commencing operations from within
on its own responsibility. I very distinctly remember that as I was
sliding off the bare back of the horse and was about half-way to
the ground my good guardian Mack caught me and placed me
again in position. Being scared, I asked him to let me get off and
walk, but he was as inexorable as the law of gravitation. There
was no getting out of it. I had to learn, and did learn, and from that
time on I almost lived on horseback. This lovable slave not only
taught me to ride, but he gave me a first lesson of inestimable
value, which was, <hi rend="italics">not to get scared and quit</hi>. The third
registration, which, according to the “animal
<pb id="wyeth7" n="7"/>
theory” just expressed, should have come first, was evidently
conveyed through the “sense of taste,” or hunger.
Now, the one—to me—incomprehensible feature of this
retrospection is that up to this period, and even later, I have not
the slightest recollection of my parents. I was on excellent terms
with the cook, and between Mack and his ward there was
established an affectionate association which had already a fixed
place and never ceased; in fact, grew so strong as time went on
that I never wanted to be away from him in daylight.</p>
          <p>At five years of age I was taken to school; and here again
fright comes in, for I doubt if any wretch riding toward the
guillotine ever suffered more than did this victim of civilization on
this occasion. The teacher who preceded the present incumbent
had not spared the rod; in fact, had whipped two of his boy pupils
so severely that his services were dispensed with. Hearing all
this from the older children, I supposed I would come in for my
share from the new man, who was “part Cherokee.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref3" n="3" rend="sc" target="note3">1</ref></p>
          <p>“Mr. Dave” was, however, a mild-mannered man, and, while
he kept a long hickory switch in the chimney corner near his
chair, it was only a reminder of the possibilities which might
follow bad behavior. The worst he ever did was to “thump” us on
the head with the last knuckle of one finger, and usually we got
this punishment for misspelling a word or for some shortcoming
in our studies. My first, and I believe only, experience came
within a day or two after I began. The spelling-class stood in a
row behind one of the long benches. When a word went wrong,
in order to have the correction indelibly impressed on our
<note id="note3" n="3" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref3">1 Descended from intermarriage between a Cherokee Indian and a white
person.</note>
<pb id="wyeth8" n="8"/>
minds the culprit had to walk to where the teacher sat, project his
small head in advance of the perpendicular, and receive thereon a
thump which was light or heavy in proportion to the
gravity of the error. My offense was “separation,” and from
that day to this I have never forgotten that it is dangerous to
change the first “a” of the word into “e.”</p>
          <p>I had been at school for some time, and was well turned into
my seventh year, when on one memorable day I made a
discovery which was worth more to me than the finding of a new
world was to Columbus. I discovered my mother, and incidentally
began to appreciate the fact that I had a father, although at this
early period he occupied a position, to my
vision, very much nearer the horizon than did my newly
discovered planet. The discovery came about in this fashion: a
boy playmate lost his temper at something that happened
between us, and in anger gave me a slap which I did not resent.
At this juncture I heard a voice from a near-by window, and,
turning, I saw my mother leaning out, her eyes flashing so that I
could almost see the sparks flying and her cheeks as red as fire.
In a tone about which there could be no misinterpretation, even
by one who instinctively preferred peace to war, she asked me
if the boy struck me in anger; and when I told her he had, she
blazed up and said, “And you didn't hit him back?” My
response was that father had told me it was wrong to fight,
and that when another boy gave way to anger just to tell
him it was wrong and not fight back. At
this the blue bonnet of Clan-Allan went “over the border,” and
she fairly screamed: “I don't care what your father told you; if
you don't whip that boy this minute I'll whip you!” And she looked
on, and was satisfied when it was all over. I date my career from
that eventful day; for I had come to the parting of the ways.</p>

secondary consideration where duty was involved, but his was
the gift of gentle forbearance and kindly remonstrance to those
who gave way to ungovernable and passionate word or deed. His
was the way of the Nazarene and of that far-reaching wisdom of
which the Proverb says: “Her ways are ways of pleasantness,
and all her paths are peace.”</p>
          <p>My mother, too, was a Presbyterian, the daughter of a minister
of that faith, tender and true to her convictions of duty. Peter
didn't love his Lord any less because he was human enough to
lose his temper and smite off the ear of the servant of the high
priest. My mother and I chose him for our patron saint, and,
turning aside from the path of peace, hand in hand we trod the
rougher road which led up the hill Difficulty. Upon its summit we
stood at last triumphant, and thence, her beautiful face lighted up
with a heavenly smile, an eternal benediction, she left me and
passed down into the valley.</p>

OUR VILLAGE BOYS</head>
          <p>Boys are boys the world over, and we were boys, some good,
some bad. None good all the time; none so bad but that if properly
handled the germ of good in him could have been cultivated to an
aspiration for the ideals of life and for usefulness. It is almost a
maxim that children are what their parents make them. Even the
influences of heredity may in large measure be eliminated if
carefully studied and the value of environment appreciated, for
children, like chameleons, take readily the color of that which is
about them. A left-handed child, or even an adult with a strongly
inherited tendency to use the off-hand, may be made just as clever
with the opposite and unpreferred member by persistent training.
This has been very frequently demonstrated. It is just as possible
to make both members equally useful. This will be done in the
years to come, and it will greatly increase both mental and
muscular efficiency. What is true of a physical defect or deviation
from the normal is just as true of a moral weakness. No one
doubts that Ashanti infants transplanted to a Christian civilization
and reared with refined and cultivated children would cease to be
cannibals and savages. The domestication of wild animals and
fowls is complete evidence of the influence of environment.</p>
          <p>Among the boys of our village very few turned out bad;
<pb id="wyeth11" n="11"/>
and had these few been surrounded in their homes by better
example and received more kindly consideration and
encouragement, even they would not have fallen by the way. Fully
fifty per cent. of my playmates near my age perished in battle or
from wounds or sickness contracted in the military service of the
Confederacy. Most of our time up to our fifteenth year, when as a
rule we were sent away to one of the well-known colleges, was
spent in the long sessions of the village school with its exacting
duties. A week at Christmas and the months of July and August
made up the vacation period. On holidays in the fall and winter
months, when the river and creeks and forests were flush with
game, we were hunters and became adepts in woodcraft and the
use of firearms. Often on Saturday nights, in the colder season,
with the young negro boys, toward whom we white boys were
always kind and considerate, with pine torch-lights and our dogs,
we would roam the heavily timbered bottom lands hunting possums
and coons, and at times on moonlight nights take our shotguns and
seek out the wild-turkey roosts. With the full moon on cloudless
nights we could even shoot turkeys, coons, and possums from the
trees with the rifles, which carried only one ball. It was the
practice to get the dark object between the marksman and the
bright moon, sight into the moon, and slowly lower the barrel until
both sights were darkened by the intervening black object, and at
this moment touch the trigger. We were at home on horseback,
and in the very warm days of the long summers we almost lived in
the river, the temperature of which was several degrees warmer
than the cold water which came in from the near-by mountain
streams. Few of us could remember when we learned to swim,
and the practice was general. No one seemed
<pb id="wyeth12" n="12"/>
afraid of the water, nor was there ever a death by drowning. I
recall that one day in the late spring, when the water in the river
was still cold from the melting snows in the Virginia mountains,
and it was nearly to the top of the banks, five of our group
deposited our scant wardrobes, which consisted of trousers, shirt,
and hat (no one wore shoes in warm weather), in the hollow of a
giant sycamore and swam across the Tennessee and back for the
frolic of it. In going the six hundred yards across the strong
current we were carried fully a mile below the starting-point, and
in returning we were compelled to walk far enough up the river-bank
to offset the force of the current.</p>
          <p>Life was not by any means all play and school with us. It was
the custom with both rich and poor for every boy to do a certain
amount of manual labor, plowing or other work in the garden, or
chopping wood or hauling. The wealthiest planter in our county
insisted that his sons work in the fields with his slaves a certain
number of days each crop season. In one year I raised unaided a
ten-acre field of corn. It was a wholesome custom, for it instilled
in our minds an appreciation of the dignity and value of labor and
made us acquainted with the use of various implements. My father
refused to give me even the small “spending-money” a boy is
supposed to be allowed, but he gave me every opportunity to earn
what I needed by my own efforts. My chief source of revenue
was cutting wood in the forests near town which belonged to him,
and hauling and selling it by the wagon-load to my various regular
customers. With the money so earned I became an early
subscriber to <hi rend="italics">Harper's Magazine</hi> and <hi rend="italics">Harper's Weekly</hi>. One of
the family treasures which was lost when the Union soldiers
burned our home was a much-appreciated
<pb id="wyeth13" n="13"/>
personal letter to me from one of the original “Brothers”
who founded the great “House of Harper.” Thackeray and “Porte
Crayon” were contributors to the <hi rend="italics">Magazine</hi> then, and in the
<hi rend="italics">Weekly</hi> were appearing the illustrations of the Sepoy Rebellion in
India.</p>
          <p>Thoughtful care was always given the selection of our teachers,
and our community was fortunate in securing the services of
Professor W. D. Lovett, of Zanesville, Ohio, a college graduate,
well versed in the classics, an excellent mathematician, patient,
insistent, and conscientious in the discharge of his duty. He was to
me teacher and friend, and with his encouraging help and that of
my father, himself at home with the classics, I was able in my
fifteenth year to pass my college entrance examinations and
matriculate at La Grange Military Academy in January, 1861.</p>

HORSE AND GUN</head>
          <p>THE boy of the old South learned to ride and to shoot
almost as soon as he learned to walk.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref4" n="4" rend="sc" target="note4">1</ref> I began to ride when
I was only four years old, and at ten was the possessor of
my own horse and gun. A saddle was not permitted to
beginners. Stirrups were dangerous entanglements, and
when we grew up to the saddle our stirrups had leather guards to
prevent the ankle from slipping through and hanging. A blanket
fastened on with a surcingle was the favorite seat. For years
before I was big enough to get on a horse without sidling up to a
stump or a fence I rode to the creek to water my horse, or
straddled an evenly balanced sack of shelled corn and made the
trip twice a week to the water-mill a mile away.</p>
          <p>I had also good practice in “riding behind” one or the other of
my parents, for the newness of the country and the absence of
good roads made the use of buggies or carriages practically
impossible and horseback the one reliable way of traveling or of
visiting our neighbors.</p>
          <p>My first gun was a flint-lock rifle of the same death-dealing
<note id="note4" n="4" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref4">1 The girls of the South in my day were equally at home on horseback. Both of my
sisters owned their saddle-horses, were fearless riders, and were expert with gun
and pistol. On one occasion during the war, while all the
men-folk were absent from the plantation in Lee County, Georgia, the negroes
came running in great consternation to tell my eldest sister that a huge alligator
was eating the pigs at the barn down near the lake. With an accurate shot
through the eye she killed the monster, which was over six feet in length.</note>
<pb id="wyeth15" n="15"/>
pattern as those used by the backwoodsmen of Jackson and
Coffee on Wellington's Peninsular veterans at New Orleans. It
was a dangerous weapon at the muzzle, and not altogether
harmless at the other end. I could never entirely overcome the
sense of nervousness at the flash of the powder in the priming-pan
within a few inches of the eye. The bullet used was molded
from bars of lead kept in stock at all
frontier stores. The ball was laid in the palm of the hand, and the
proper charge of powder was measured by pouring enough to
make a pyramid which just concealed it. The powder was then
poured into the muzzle of the barrel held perpendicularly. A bit of
thick cotton cloth greased with tallow on the under side was laid
over the muzzle, and the ball, placed on this, was pushed in until its
top was level with the surface of the barrel, when the patch was
cut smoothly across with a sharp knife. Incased in this lubricated
cloth envelope, the bullet was pushed down upon the charge of
measured powder near the touch-hole by means of a long, slender
ramrod of tough hickory. The priming-pan was next opened and
filled with powder, and the “striker” closed. The flint was so
arranged that when the hammer was cocked and the trigger
pressed a spring drove the flint against the striker and primer,
forcing it open, and thus bringing the powder in the pan in contact
with the igniting spark. These guns, now obsolete, soon gave way
to those equipped with tubes for percussion-caps, and these in
turn to our modern breech-loaders with percussion-cartridges.</p>
          <p>This early training to horse and gun will explain why the
mounted troops of the Confederacy for the first two years of the
Civil War were notably superior to the cavalry of the North. For
the third year honors were about even, and after that to the end
the advantage was on the Union
<pb id="wyeth16" n="16"/>
side. It took the Federal cavalrymen about two years to become
expert riders and marksmen, and as such they held their own
with their opponents. By 1864, when the South was depleted of live
stock, the impossibility of securing good mounts or of maintaining
the efficiency of those in service placed its cavalry at great
disadvantage; and when to the best of horses and seasoned
veterans was added the equipment with the repeating-rifle, as
against the single-barreled muzzle-loader of the Confederates, it
is no wonder that the men who had followed Forrest and
Wheeler and Stuart and Morgan to victory on practically every
battle field in the earlier campaigns could no longer successfully
resist the gallant troopers of Wilson and Sheridan.</p>
          <p>The hunting-season in the South began in the early autumn and
lasted until March. In the wide ranges of uncleared woodland in
the near-by mountains, and in the dense cane-brakes which grew
in the rich bottom land of the Tennessee, there were wild deer and
turkeys in great numbers throughout the year. I counted more than
twenty of the beautiful animals in one herd within three miles of
our village, and I have killed turkeys feeding in the fields and
truck-gardens of our home. So plentiful were they at one time that during
the breeding-season I have often heard, as I sat on our portico, the
drumming sound made by the wings of the males when strutting.
Squirrels, rabbits, raccoons, and opossums were abundant, while
beavers, muskrats, and minks made their homes in the river's
bank. Wild duck and geese came with the cold weather and
remained until spring. Of the migrating birds the wild pigeon was
at once the most beautiful and wonderful. The story of these birds
will seem in this day like a gross exaggeration, and yet there are
many persons still living who saw,
<pb id="wyeth17" n="17"/>
as I have seen, the vast and countless flocks of these swift and
graceful birds of passage as they whirred through the air on their
southward flight, so massed that they cast a shadow like a thick
cloud which shut out the sun, while the noise of their countless
wings sounded like the roar of an approaching cyclone. As far as
the eye could distinguish them their lines were stretched, and one
flock would scarcely be out of sight before another followed. A
favorite feeding-ground was the beech forest near our home, and
one of the most wonderful sights I have ever beheld was the
sudden and almost perpendicular descent of a vast army of these
birds from a height of at least a mile to the tree-tops in the bottom
lands. They simply let go, fell like snowflakes from the heavens,
and alighted in such numbers that the limbs broke beneath the
great weight. When the nuts were all consumed, or threshed off
by the motion of their wings, the birds would swarm to the ground,
many of them lost to sight in the foot-deep leaves which carpeted
the earth beneath these giant trees. My father and I on one
occasion picked up twenty-five pigeons killed by a single volley of
our two shotguns—his a double, mine a single barreled gun. I
have no idea of the cause of their disappearance; but they, like the
buffalo, are now practically extinct. As late as 1870 I saw them in
the White River section of Arkansas, as plentiful as they had been
before the war in Northern Alabama. I am informed by a close
student of ornithology that a reward of $5,000 for a pair of these
birds has for three years remained unclaimed.</p>
          <p>In the cane-brakes and thickly wooded regions we hunted
chiefly on foot, but for deer and turkey and for shooting quail, the
horse was in common use, while for the rare sport of
fox-hunting the gun was discarded, and the
<pb id="wyeth18" n="18"/>
swift horses kept the hunters always close up with the hounds.</p>
          <p>When I became the owner of a saddle-horse it was my duty
to feed and curry and take personal care of my mount; and so
when the war came on, and I rode away on my beautiful Fanny,
we knew each other thoroughly and were as comrades in all the
exciting scenes, the times of danger in battle and of trial, with long
marches and short rations, and all the hardships of an active
cavalry service. Horses are not unlike their two-legged masters in
the variations of character and quality; and a well-bred animal
feels and shows its distinction and superiority over a common plug
as does the man of gentle breeding exhibit certain qualities that
mark him as not of the common run. Fanny was not only the most
beautifully formed horse I have ever seen, but she possessed an
intelligence almost human and could be trusted in any emergency.
A whip or spur she would not tolerate. I could ride and guide her
anywhere without saddle or bridle. A word, a motion of the hand,
or a slight inclination of the body gave to her quick perception the
direction and the gait. If the saddle was not comfortably adjusted
she would stop and back one ear or the other to tell me where it
pinched.</p>
          <p>I trained her to a running-walk, at once the easiest stride for
horse and rider, and day after day she has averaged forty miles
over roads and trails not easy as to going. I rode her twice from
my home to Rome, in Georgia, seventy-five miles, in a day and a
half. When it came to running she was like the wind, and in the
long speeding to safety in our scouting expeditions, when speed
needed stamina to make the goal of the picket-line, she showed
her mettle. As long as I rode this graceful, coal-black creature—
unmarked save
<pb id="wyeth19" n="19"/>
for a white star in the center of the forehead and a white ring on
the nigh hind pastern—I felt no fear of capture. On one
memorable occasion she showed her heels and her rider's back
in most satisfactory fashion to a squadron of Brownlow's Union
Cavalry in a chase from near Triune to our outpost, some four
miles away. There are times in a soldier's life when, as Campbell
expresses it,</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">'Tis distance lends enchantment to the view.</q>
          <p>In the Christmas raid through Kentucky in 1862, when in the
crisis of the pursuit and hemmed in on all sides, we were forced
to ride day and night for thirty-six hours through a merciless
blizzard without stopping, and then, after a rest of six hours, went
on to the end of our seventy-two hours' forced march, there was
not in that entire command of three thousand a horse more fit
than “The Little Black”—for that was her pet name in the
regiment.</p>
          <p>In times of stress, when food was scarce and Fanny was
hungry, I have often shared with her the roasting-ears of corn
issued to me as my rations. At night, when we bivouacked, and
the enemy was so near that every man must be ready to mount at
a moment's notice, I would unspring the bit from the head-stall,
and as she ate her shelled corn from the saddle-blanket I would
sleep holding the halter strap and knowing full well she would
never tread upon or attempt to wander from her sleeping comrade.</p>
          <p>We Southerners rode with long stirrup-leathers, such as the
vaqueros of Mexico and the cowboys of the plains and pampas
use. The trained horseman with this seat is <hi rend="italics">one</hi> with his mount.
When it becomes necessary, the saddle pressure can be lessened
by tiptoeing slightly in the stirrups.
<pb id="wyeth20" n="20"/>
The pigskin-covered, shallow-seated saddle of the
English, with the short stirrup-leathers and the
bobbing-up-and-down style of riding, is, from my point of view
and training, awkward and tiring to both rider and horse.</p>
          <p>Our saddles were strong, and raised behind and in front, so
that when firmly cinched one foot could be caught beneath the
rim as the rider swung head downward on the other side to
pick up any object from the ground. This
we were trained to do with the horse at full gallop. At
mounting we were equally expert, and from either side I could mount or
leap entirely over my horse, and vault into the saddle from
behind, with my pistol buckled around the waist, by placing my
two hands on the horse's rump.</p>
          <p>I said good-by to my little Fanny on June 27, 1863, and
I look back on this as one of the saddest experiences of a
lifetime. It was the day of the battle of Shelbyville. From near
Eagleville on the Triune turnpike our regiment, then on outpost
duty, was ordered to retreat hurriedly to Shelbyville. Near noon
we stopped for half an hour to cool our horses' backs and rest
and feed. As there was no forage except grazing, I stripped my
mount of saddle and bridle and turned her into a near-by
clover-field to feed at will.</p>
          <p>When the bugle blew to saddle up I called “Fanny!” Tossing her
head in the air with a whinny of recognition, she came to me at
once. Leaping on her back without a bridle, I guided her by a
movement of the hand toward my company's bivouac. As I
approached there lay across the way the huge trunk of a fallen
tree. I urged her to a canter, and she jumped over the log as I had
trained her over hurdles before we began our war experiences.
As she rose to take the jump the inner calk of the right fore shoe
caught
<pb id="wyeth21" n="21"/>
in the bark and tore the shoe loose. Unfortunately, the forge and
farrier had moved on ahead; and as the enemy were in sight and
pressing us, I saddled and mounted and joined in the six-mile run
to Shelbyville. Within a mile the flinty bed of the macadamized
roadway had done its work. Fanny began to limp, and then to lag,
as her hoof was split to the quick, and I dismounted and led her.
As good luck would have it, the enemy did not press us, or I
should have been lost.</p>
          <p>As I came up at last the regiment was in line of battle, and the
enemy's line, a mile away, was in sight, evidently preparing to
advance. As I mounted and rode into the line Major Taylor,
seeing how lame my horse was, ordered me to the wagon-train
and would not listen to my entreaty to let me stay. Dismounting
and leading Fanny, now hobbling on three legs, and depressed
beyond measure at the thought of being absent from the first big
fight the regiment was to be engaged in since I had joined it, I
made my way sorrowfully to the rear.</p>
          <p>Two or three hundred yards back I came upon a member of
my company who told me he was detailed to guard the
wagon-train. As he had a fairly good horse and seemed anxious to take
care of one too lame to be in the fight, I changed horses and
equipments; and, exacting a promise that he would take Fanny to
my home in Alabama, where I could find her at the close of the
campaign, I mounted and rode into the line of battle just as the
firing began.</p>
          <p>The story of that fight, from two o'clock to sundown, and the
disaster which overtook me at its close is told elsewhere. The
great tragedy of it was, not that we were beaten or that I was
left on the field, ridden down and over by the victorious enemy,
but that I never again saw my
<pb id="wyeth22" n="22"/>
noble Fanny. The man to whom I intrusted her reported that she
grew so sore of foot she could no longer move, and he had left
her in care of a farmer in Tennessee. At the close of the war my
first duty was to search for my little thoroughbred, but no trace of
her could be found.</p>

MAJOR, THE VILLAGE KING—LESSON FROM THE LIFE OF A
NOBLE DOG</head>
          <p>IT is as true of dogs as of poets that they are “born, not
made.” Major was born great. Not that he had a proud pedigree.
No more have poets as a rule: Shakespeare's father was a
glovemaker; Milton's a scrivener; Spenser's a tailor; Keats's
paternal ancestor kept a livery stable; and the father of Robert
Burns made a very insufficient living as a gardener.</p>
          <p>The average poet, however, knew his father—and here the
comparison becomes embarrassing for Major. Genealogically he
was classified as a mongrel cur, but genealogy, like the
thermometer, does not always register correctly. The laws of
heredity, like the laws of the universe, are as inexorable as they
are wonderful and difficult of comprehension. Major was an
illustration. Even as the planets of our system, after eons of
divergence in space, come again in conjunction, so in this loved
and faithful companion of my boyhood, born to be king of his kind
in the village, there united by some mysterious alchemy
certain ancestral strains, certain inherited qualities, which
made him worthy of founding a dynasty.</p>
          <p>Cast in human form, he would have been another
Forrest or Jackson, a natural-born soldier. Courage and
strategy and tactics were of his mental make-up, and
behind these
<pb id="wyeth24" n="24"/>
qualities there was a magnificent endowment of muscle and bone
which made them savagely effective. Like the “Wizard of the
Saddle,” who said, “five minutes of ‘bulge’ was worth more than a
week of tactics,” Major believed in <hi rend="italics">bulge</hi>. He always “showed
fight,” and never waited to be attacked. Forrest's one “general
order” was: “Whenever you see a Yankee, show fight. If
there ain't but one of you and a hundred of them, show fight.
They'll think a heap more of you for it.”</p>
          <p>Now, Major was not particular about what the other village
dogs thought of him, but he did enjoy a quiet stroll along a dogless
highway. Even Cowper in his “Morning Walk” was not more fond
of solitude, and as my fighter's reputation spread his meditations
were rarely disturbed. At the zenith of his reign, if there was a
canine in all the region round about his Judea upon whose skin he
had not left the indelible register of his prowess, it was only
because the other dog elected to keep between his hide and Major
that distance which lent enchantment to the view. When after one
of these occasional joy-chases in the wake of a fleet-footed
vagrant he would return panting, with his dripping tongue hanging
out of one side of his mouth, and come up to me to get the usual
pat of commendation on his back, he would sit down on his
hunkers and in very human fashion laugh at the comical figure the
scared fugitive had cut. And it was funny enough to make even a
dog laugh; for few things are more ludicrous than precipitate
flight, whether there be two or four legs in action. In my soldier
days I took an active part in more than one cavalry stampede, in
which for the time being my comrades and I parted company with
our family pride, which is another name for courage. On these
occasions, if on no other, I
<pb id="wyeth24a" n="24a"/>
<figure id="ill3" entity="wyeth24a"><p>“MAJOR” AND HIS PUPIL </p></figure>
<pb id="wyeth25" n="25"/>
was inspired with the idea of leadership, and if the inspiration
was of brief duration it was only because the horse I rode was
not equal to the occasion. As one after another the rattled
troopers passed me in the wild scramble toward safety I had
ample opportunity to observe the earnestness which
characterized each individual's effort to annihilate distance.
Notwithstanding the increasing proximity of the pursuers, I
registered the ludicrous features of the situation, and many a time
since then, with bullets and sabres eliminated, I have laughed
over these scenes.</p>
          <p>Somebody has said, or is said to have said, “All the world loves
a lover,” which is generally accepted as true. There is another
saying that “Everybody sympathizes with the under dog.”
Elsewhere and in the abstract this may have been (or may be)
true; but in our village it did not hold. When the bottom dog got on
his feet, saw his chance, tucked his tail between his legs, and ran,
every boy and man whose Christian mother or wife was not in
hearing yelled at him in terms not found in the Westminster
Confession, and added to the fugitive's intensity of purpose the
quickening impulse of a stone or a brickbat.</p>
          <p>Naturally, Major became the pride of the village, his prowess
the talk of the neighborhood; and I, his master, shone, albeit with
reflected glory. We are all more or less influenced by
environment and association, and little wonder it soon came into
my mind that I among my kind must keep stride with my
victorious dog. He expected it of me, and when on one
memorable day I licked the bully of the playground, Major
jumped all over me for joy. Victors on every field, Major and his
master, like Alexander, sighed for more worlds.</p>
          <p>In a near-by settlement there was another fighting dog
<pb id="wyeth26" n="26"/>
of local repute; and one summer's day when the circus came to
town, the boy who owned him and his crowd walked in to see the
sights, bringing with them the redoubtable pup. My chum and I
were engaged in watching the busy showmen put up the big tent,
when the other boys and their champion came on the scene. He
was a magnificent specimen of his kind, brindle-colored, well
muscled, noticeably longer in body and neck, and some two
inches taller than Major. He was evidently game to the core, for
he no sooner saw my pet than he bristled up, fixed his eyes
intently upon him, and assumed that muscular tension peculiar to
the wolf and cat tribes when about to spring. As he and they
approached, the circus men, seeing that something exciting was
in the air, quit work and with the crowd of loiterers attracted by
the “Greatest Show on Earth” turned their attention to the
battle-scene.</p>
          <p>I recall distinctly that sinking feeling which often comes over one
in the first few moments of an impending crisis, the issue of which
is doubtful. I put my hand encouragingly on my companion's neck,
pulled his head against my leg, and said in a low tone, “Steady,
Major.” There must have been some quiver of the arm or tremor
in the voice which betrayed my apprehension, for, while the other
valiant knight was yet some thirty yards away, my champion
turned his eyes reproachfully on mine with a look which said.
“Watch <hi rend="italics">me</hi>.” I did watch him, and, to my surprise, for the first time
in his life Major did not advance to meet the enemy. I knew later
his keen intelligence had cautioned him that this was the heaviest
contract he had ever undertaken, and that strategy and tactics as
well as courage and strength would be needed to win. I did not
know it then, and as the stranger boldly and deliberately advanced
<pb id="wyeth27" n="27"/>
I almost sank to the earth with shame and mortification; for
Major not only failed to meet him half-way, but stood there
stock-still, seemingly not wanting to fight and wagging his tail
in friendly fashion, as if he were about to greet a long-lost brother. So
deceptive was this assumption of friendliness, or timidity, or
cowardice, that the other crowd of boys began to jeer and yell at
the top of their lungs, “School-butter!” “Chicken-liver!” “Soak him!” and a lot
of other objectionable constructions of nouns, verbs, and
adjectives of origin as unknown as they were insulting.</p>
          <p>It was just as this yell of exultation in anticipation of our
discomfiture rose that the strategy of the master was disclosed.
Unused to such a crowd and to such an unearthly noise, the
invader turned his head for a moment toward his shouting mob of
backers. This error sealed his doom; for in that instant, like a
stone from a catapult, with lightning-like swiftness and with
irresistible force, Major bounded forward, striking full-breasted
against the side of the neck and shoulders of the longer dog,
bowling him over and on his back. The stranger did not hit the
ground before his cunning and savage foe had his throat and
windpipe in the grip of a pair of jaws that never relaxed their hold
until the bottom dog was half dead and hopelessly beaten, when
we pulled the victor off. As Major shook himself and stood over
his fallen foe in triumphant pose, ready to renew the attack, the
crowd yelled and hurrahed again and again for him and me. Then
we “town boys” laughed best, because we had laughed last.</p>
          <p>Major's star, ascendant from the day he entered the arena,
reached its zenith in this month, when he was four years old and
when Sirius was in its glory. From this on
<pb id="wyeth28" n="28"/>
his story is briefly told, and I venture to apply to my faithful
friend, tried and not found wanting, a quotation from Froude's
<hi rend="italics">Sketch of Cæsar</hi>:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">Everything which grows holds in perfection but a single moment.</q>
          <p>When the days of the sere and yellow leaf came on for this,
my Cæsar, the college days came on for me; and although I did
not suspect it then, I bade a long and last good-by to the home of
a happy boyhood and to my loved and faithful dog. From college
I went into the Southern army until the end of the Civil War, and
when peace came there was no home, and Major had long since
gone to the undiscovered country. After I had left, one of the
slaves, ambitious to maintain the prestige of the absent member,
brought into the fold a puppy, scion of my village king, who
schooled him as a fighter, alas! to his own undoing.</p>
          <p>As in the course of nature Major's muscles withered and his
jaws became toothless his powerful and plucky son grew more
and more resentful of the painful reprimands inflicted by his
hectoring sire, and at last turned on him in mortal combat. I was
told that when the servants pulled them apart the beaten but
unconquered old warrior, staggering to his feet, tried in vain to
renew the hopeless combat, and then, with head erect and lordly
mien, passed for ever from the scene. A week later they found
him dead in the edge of a forest near the town. Victory or death
was the lesson that came from the spirit of this dumb creature.
The savagery which he exhibited was his by nature, uncurbed and
unchanged by the impossibility of a higher intelligence. That of his
master, whose heart now in ripe old age, and long before he had
reached the years of maturity, was filled with
<pb id="wyeth29" n="29"/>
regret that even in the wild life of the frontier and in the
riot of restless boyhood he could delight in these tests of
animal courage and skill and strength, had less in extenuation.
With all of this the moral of the lesson was not lost: “He who
fights the battle of life to <hi rend="italics">win</hi> or <hi rend="italics">die</hi>, wins.”</p>

EARLY SCENES, RELIGIOUS AND OTHERWISE</head>
          <p>WHILE a large majority of our early settlers were sober and
law-abiding, it was inevitable that some lawlessness should
prevail in the formative period of a community such as this in
which I grew to manhood. Disputed pre-emption claims and other
conflicts of interest led to feuds between individuals and families,
in the settlement of which personal prowess and the bowie-knife
or rifle were too often appealed to instead of argument or
arbitration or reason and law.</p>
          <p>In partial extenuation of these brutal combats it must be said
that they usually were open fights without unfair advantage; in
fact, in all the earlier bloody history of Marshall County I knew of
but a single instance where one man shot and killed another from
ambush. I witnessed a number of these affairs, as they often took
place in the streets of my native village, where the county and
district courts were held, and where from far and near the people
came to political conventions, or to vote on election days, or to
take part in the annual muster of the militia. During the afternoon
of one election contest in which excitement ran high I saw a half-dozen
different combats, while fully as many more, as I afterward
learned, took place <sic corr="beyond">beyong</sic> my field of vision.</p>
          <p>The business center of our village was confined to a single
street, on either side of which for some two hundred yards
<pb id="wyeth31" n="31"/>
the stores and shops were located. One of these stores, with a
roof that sloped away from the street, the comb or highest portion
of which was parallel with the edge of the sidewalk, was a
favorite rendezvous for our crowd of boys, who never willingly
missed those exciting scenes. Upon one pretext or another we
would manage to get away from home and climb to our gallery on
Kinzler's grocery. This point of vantage not only gave us a
commanding view of the street, but it possessed another
attractive feature, for we could peep over the edge and see all
that was going on with nothing but our eyes and the tops of our
heads in danger. Whenever a gun was pointed our way, or a
badly aimed stone or stick flew too high, we had only to slide
back a few inches and duck our heads to be safe until the gun
went <sic corr="off">of</sic> or the missile had passed on. The casualties on one
occasion included one man killed and a large number laid up for
repairs.</p>
          <p>Another personal encounter that came under my observation
was a fight between two men, for each of whom even as a small
boy I had formed a warm friendship. Passing along the sidewalk
on an errand to my father's office, I came upon my two friends in
excited conversation standing on a platform or open porch which
served as entrance to a candyshop where I was a frequent
visitor. As I stood within a few feet of them the proprietor of the
shop, a very small but wiry man, stepped back quickly, drew a
single-barreled pistol from his pocket, and pointed it at the other
larger man, saying, “If you take a step toward me I'll kill you.”
The big man did not advance. He said, “I am unarmed; but if
you'll wait I'll be right back, and we'll settle it.” With this he
hurried across the street to a dry-goods store and asked the
merchant for the loan of a pistol, which was
<pb id="wyeth32" n="32"/>
refused. He then picked up an ax, which he held in his right
hand. With the other he seized the top of a wooden packing-box,
and holding this in front of his chest and abdomen as a Kaffir
would hold his <hi rend="italics">pavise</hi>, or rawhide shield, to ward off a thrust
from an <hi rend="italics">assagai</hi>, he walked straight toward his adversary.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the small man was standing at the edge of the
platform, pistol in hand, and pointing now directly at the big miller,
who was advancing at a fast walk. The one thing which made the
most vivid impression on my mind of what happened here was the
self-cocking feature of the pistol. As the man pulled the trigger I
saw distinctly the hammer rise just before the flash and noise of
the explosion. I had never before seen a “self-cocker.” My big
friend interposed the box-top, through which the bullet passed
before it buried itself in the muscles of his broad chest, where it
remained many years, to the day of his death. As it struck him he
staggered back with the ax slightly raised, whereupon the other
fighter hit him a stunning blow with the heavy barrel of the empty
pistol. By this time some other men had come up and separated
the combatants.</p>
          <p>This pioneer settlement was about as active and violent in
matters of religion as in the occasional settlement “outside the
law” of personal differences. Of the various sects the Baptists
and the Methodists were about equally divided—these two
outnumbering all the rest. I do not think there was a single
Catholic in our community, and only one family of Episcopalians,
while our immediate family furnished the Presbyterian contingent.</p>
          <p>When my father founded the present village of Guntersville he
gave a spacious lot to each sect, to be deeded
<pb id="wyeth33" n="33"/>
when a house of worship was erected; but up to the breaking out
of the Civil War, in 1861, there was not a single church edifice in
the town. The school-house, the courthouse, and later the large
Masonic Hall were used for Sunday services. Our preachers
were all “circuit riders,” and occupied the pulpit in turn, all the
sects attending to swell the congregation. There was Sunday-school
from ten to eleven o'clock in the morning, preaching from
eleven to twelve, and again by candlelight, to which each family
contributed a candle and a sconce, or holder, which was fastened
to the wall.</p>
          <p>The Baptists were spoken of as the “Hardshell” and “Foot-washing”
sects, and were believers in total immersion; and the congregations
of this particular church celebrated once or twice a year the
ceremony of foot-washing. The creeks or the Tennessee River
furnished holes deep enough for immersion, which usually took
place in warm weather, while a piggin of water and a towel served
the parson or assistants who performed the foot-washing rite.</p>
          <p>At certain times, usually in the late summer months, in the
periods of comparative leisure in a farming community after the
crops were “laid by” and before “gathering-time,” would be held
what were called “protracted meetings” or “revivals.” When the
attendance proved too large for the meeting-house the
congregation would move out under the shade-trees; or more
frequently great arbors made of the branches of thick-leaved
trees would be hastily constructed. The negroes spoke of these as
“Bresh-Harbor” revivals.</p>
          <p>The “circuit-riders,” so called because they were designated to
preach in a circuit of several counties, traveled their rounds on
horseback, as the roads were new, ill kept, and often impassable
to any kind of vehicle except the
<pb id="wyeth34" n="34"/>
crude, heavy wagons drawn by oxen. At these protracted
gatherings the exercises lasted three or four days, and when the
excitement ran high a longer time was utilized until the supply of
“mourners” and “converts” was exhausted.</p>
          <p>The assistants to the leading clergymen were known as
“exhorters,” selected, it seemed to me, on account of their
cleverness in appealing to the emotional qualities of their hearers.
Most of them had good voices, and at certain periods in their
exhortations to all who had not been converted to come up to the
mourners' bench, confess their sins, and be saved, they would at
the psychological moment break forth in some one of the many
revival songs which rarely failed to fire the train of religious fervor
or hysteria which the preacher's sermon and his own preliminary
exhortation had prepared for explosion.</p>
          <p>Of one of these songs I recall a verse or two:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Jesus my all to heaven is gone;</l>
            <l>Glory halleluiah!</l>
            <l>Him whom I fix my hopes upon;</l>
            <l>Glory halleluiah!</l>
          </lg>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>His track I see and I'll pursue;</l>
            <l>Glory halleluiah!</l>
            <l>If you get there before I do,</l>
            <l>Tell all my friends I'm coming, too;</l>
            <l>Glory halleluiah!</l>
          </lg>
          <p>And so on for a number of stanzas. When the song began he
would leave the place in front of the pulpit, where he had been
standing, and rush along the aisles, shaking hands vigorously right
and left with all in reach, and calling them by name as “my
brother” or “my sister”—there being as a rule about three sisters
to one brother. There was a very large lady in our village easily
moved to tears
<pb id="wyeth35" n="35"/>
and hysterical sobbing, who usually gave way first and, like Abou
ben Adhem, led all the rest. By the time the sermon was over
she was about ready for the outburst, and when the exhorter
broke loose with his “Glory halleluiah” song she would clap her
hands violently together with a resounding smack, sway her body
back and forth, and scream out at the top of her high-pitched
voice: “Bless the Lord! Bless the Lord! Oh, my Jesus!” And with
this she would follow on the trail of the exhorter, crying out to her
two sons, about eighteen and twenty-two respectively, to “Come
to Jesus.” These young men, knowing their mother's weakness,
found it convenient to sit near the door or an open window,
through which a quick exit was possible when she began a rush
for them.</p>
          <p>I remember on one occasion one of the boys reached the door
and escaped, and the dear old lady cut the other off from that exit
only to see him leap through a window at least six feet from the
ground. With twenty or thirty mourners kneeling before the
parallelogram of benches arranged for them just in front of the
pulpit, many of these sobbing, the exhorters singing and shaking
hands in and out among the congregation, and a half-dozen
hysterical women shouting as loud as they could scream,
confusion reigned. There was one young man whose fondness for
alcohol caused him to fall from grace with recurring regularity,
and his way of restoring himself to divine favor was to confess his
errors at these revivals and ask to be taken back in the fold. He
immortalized himself with the smaller boys in our neighborhood by
breaking out on one occasion in an ecstasy of song which, as far
as I knew, was entirely original. As the exhorter was on his
rounds, Jasper leaped from his seat, grasped him by both hands,
and, jumping up and down, not
<pb id="wyeth36" n="36"/>
unlike the movements of a turkey-gobbler in the early spring
chanted:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>The devil is dead, and I am glad;</l>
            <l>Glory halleluiah!</l>
            <l>He ain't got the soul he thought he had;</l>
            <l>Glory halleluiah!</l>
          </lg>
          <p>My parents, being Presbyterians, did not wholly approve of
these excitable religious demonstrations, and I did not attend as
many as I should have liked. Their minister, who always stayed
at our house, did not reach us in his circuit oftener than once in
four or five weeks, and the intervening Sundays I spent in
familiarizing myself with the Westminster Confession of Faith,
the religious section of the <hi rend="italics">New York Observer</hi>, and
Alexander's Sermons, one of which I was called upon to stand up
before the family and read aloud. How long each one of these
effusions of the good old Princeton theologian seemed! Visiting in
1913, in one of the private rooms of the Polyclinic Hospital, a
grandson of their author, himself eminent in the affairs of the
metropolis, I was answered with a smile when I told him I
rejoiced at last to have an opportunity of taking revenge on the
family for the wrongs I had suffered at the hands of his
grandfather.</p>

<lb/>
THE ARISTOCRACY OF THE OLD SOUTH</head>
          <p>IT would be difficult to imagine a society more cultured,
hospitable, and delightful, more in harmony with that definition of
gentlefolk as “those whose rule of conduct is consideration for
others,” than that to which, thanks to my mother, I found
admission in the community of Huntsville in the days of the old
régime. This may savor of exaggeration or prejudice, or perhaps
of conceit; but in the larger view which has come from reading
and travel, and an association of more than forty years with
many of the noblest and best of the metropolis, nothing like it has
come to my knowledge. Such a society was possible only with
the institution of slavery; and when slavery ended it ended never
again to be reproduced. The people composing this society were
almost wholly descended from the cavaliers of Virginia, many of
the earlier settlers coming directly from the tide-water section of
the Old Dominion; others indirectly, from Kentucky and
Tennessee and North Carolina—countries which were stocked
by the Virginia overflow.</p>
          <p>In the spirit of adventure, and with the wealth in slaves
inherited from their fathers, these hardy scions of a noble race
passed over the mountains, pre-empted the rich valley of the
Tennessee, and established there a New Virginia. Twelve miles
north of the Tennessee River, in the upper
<pb id="wyeth38" n="38"/>
reaches of a rich agricultural section, where the spurs of the
Appalachian range begin to hem it in from the north, at the base of
a picturesque limestone cliff, there gushes from the earth a spring
of crystal water. It is of such volume and force that it sets in
motion the powerful machinery which carries unlimited luxury into
every home. Upon the summit of the bluff which overlooks this
marvelous spring and the far-reaching valley through which the
silvery stream flows toward the great river, one of those restless
pioneers, John Hunt by name, built his cabin of cedar logs in 1806
and claimed the region roundabout. There was no Alabama then—
only Indians and wilderness. The area which now forms the states
of Alabama and Mississippi was ceded in 1802 by Georgia to the
United States. The fact that the Cherokee Indians had lived there
from time beyond the memory of man and still claimed the land
did not matter to John Hunt. He was friendly with the aborigines,
and sent his Calebs and Joshuas back to civilization to spread the
news of the rich Canaan, and others just as hardy and just as
hungry for land joined him. The discreet Cherokees, children of
the great Sequoyah, wisest of all the Indian tribes, realizing that the
better part of valor was discretion, and seeing that the white man
was surely crowding him out, ceded in 1819, for a price, all their
claims north of the Tennessee River, and in the same year
Congress made of Alabama a sovereign state.</p>
          <p>Huntsville had not waited for this. Indians or no Indians, it was a
town already, having incorporated itself in 1811; and in 1812, the
year that our second war began with England, when Napoleon's
Grand Army was freezing to death in Russia, and one year before
the great Tecumseh passed along the Creek Path in sight of these settlers' log
<pb id="wyeth39" n="39"/>
defenses and made those speeches which stirred the red men to
the massacre of Fort Mims and to other bloody deeds, Huntsville
was publishing <hi rend="italics">The Madison Gazette</hi>, the first newspaper
printed within the limits of the present state.</p>
          <p>The first sessions of the legislature were held here, and but for
its location in the extreme northern end of the state it would
without doubt have been the permanent capital. It remained,
however, the political capital and the social and commercial
center of one of the most enterprising and productive agricultural
communities in the New World. For more than a hundred miles in
all directions the rich owners of vast estates whose work was
done by slaves, and the humbler settlers who came in covered
wagons and cleared their small farms and tilled them with their
own hands, everybody, except the outlaws and the rowdies, who
haunted the wilderness for refuge, made of Huntsville even in
these earlier days the Mecca toward which all eyes were turned.
The wealthier people built their homes and churches here,
established in 1812 the famous Greene Academy, a college-preparatory
school, whence to La Grange College, or Henry and
Emory, or William and Mary, or the University of Virginia, or
Princeton, or elsewhere in the then far-away world their sons
went for their finishing studies. The Huntsville Seminary
(Presbyterian), where my mother and her daughters were
educated, and the equally famous and popular Female College
(Methodist), were other institutions of learning which won for this
beautiful city the well-deserved name of the “Athens of the
South.” The country was so new, the atmosphere and
environment so inspiring to endeavor, that, instead of
yielding to the softening influences of wealth and the
luxury which the institution of slavery implied, the men of
this period turned their attention to
<pb id="wyeth40" n="40"/>
active pursuits, to the excitement of politics, to manufacturing 
and commercial enterprises, and to public improvements. Theirs
was the first cotton factory in the state, and probably in the far
South, established in 1832, the machinery being run by the
water-power of Flint River. The magnificent macadamized roads, which
stand to-day as models of highway construction, were built by
them while yet the crack of the Indian's rifle was heard in the
near-by brakes.</p>
          <p>In this delightful society, through years of peace and prosperity
and happiness, my mother had lived from infancy to the fullness of
a noble womanhood; hither came Louis Wyeth, a young lawyer,
just turned of twenty-seven, and already appointed by the state
legislature judge of the new county of Marshall, carved out of the
Cherokee country, and lately opened for settlement. Thence went
this man and woman, whom God had joined and nothing but death
could part, to their new home in the wild and sparsely settled
region to the south, from which as yet the Indians had not wholly
departed. John Allan, her father, had graduated from the
University of Georgia in 1807. In addition to the Greek and Latin
classics<sic corr=",">;</sic> he had mastered the French language, and, supplementing
his college course with another in theology, he made himself
familiar with Hebrew literature. Having been admitted to the
ministry, and having married the daughter of a soldier, who in
recognition of his services in the war for independence had been
granted a rich estate in the blue-grass region of Tennessee, he
accepted the call to the Presbyterian church in Huntsville. From
the pulpit, and in his professorship of the classics in the Greene
Academy, he became a power for good, and died at his post,
universally beloved and lamented.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth41" n="41"/>
          <p>Naturally, the home of such a family as his became a center of
the refinement and culture of the community, a rallying-point of
the remarkable group of men and women, many of whom as
they grew to maturity found high places in the esteem of
mankind and later wrote their names in history. First of all, as the
memory of these earlier days flashes through my mind, there
comes a woman, the girlhood and lifelong friend of my mother,
Virginia Tunstall, descended as were almost all of them from the
cavaliers; later to be more widely known as the brilliant leader of
society at the national capital in the decade that preceded the
tragedy of 1861-65, as the wife of Senator Clement C. Clay, Jr. The
story of that unique period is known to all readers of our native
literature in a most fascinating book by Mrs. Clay, <hi rend="italics">A Belle of the
Fifties</hi>. Still holding, in 1914, the sway she could not relinquish if
she would, the sole survivor of the brilliant throng of whom I
write, one can fitly apply to her that unsurpassed
compliment of Shakespeare to womanhood:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale</l>
            <l>Her infinite variety.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The Clays all came from Virginia. The famous orator was
from Ashland, near Richmond, and I have always felt a touch of
pride that my kinsman, George Wythe, discovered Henry Clay,
educated him, and trained him in the law. Clement C. Clay, the
elder, from Halifax, in the Old Dominion, came to Huntsville in
1811, served many terms in the legislature, and was governor and
United States Senator. Clement C. Clay, Jr., his son, “to the
manner born and native hero” with his university degree,
succeeded his father in the United States Senate, and was
the first
<pb id="wyeth42" n="42"/>
Senator elected from Alabama to the Southern Confederacy.
His history, even down to the long and wearisome and unjust
persecution of imprisonment in Fortress Monroe, is known to all.
The record stands without a stain. And here Jere Clemens,
lawyer, legislator, soldier of the Mexican War, Senator of the
United States, and, beyond all such ordinary distinction to my
youthful mind, author of <hi rend="italics">Bernard Lile</hi>, <hi rend="italics">Mustang Gray</hi>, and <hi rend="italics">The
Rivals; or, the Days of Burr and Hamilton</hi>. How many a
tallow candle that I helped my mother mold have I seen melt
away as I read and reread these “romances, couched in gorgeous
diction and abounding in thrilling episode,” when I should have
been absorbed in the brain-racking exercises of algebra or
geometry! A college man of La Grange and the State University,
handsome of feature and proud of carriage, no wonder the
maidens of the land fell victims to his charms. Virginia Tunstall
was not alone in the list of young girls whose hearts beat faster
at first sight of this “Romeo of Madison County.”</p>
          <p>Let her tell it in her own inimitable way:<ref targOrder="U" id="ref5" n="5" rend="sc" target="note5">1</ref></p>
          <p>“It was to my Uncle Tom that I owe the one love sorrow of
my life. It was an affair of the greatest intensity while it endured,
and was attended by the utmost anguish for some twelve or
fourteen hours. During that space of time I endured all the
hopes and fears, the yearnings and despairs, to which the
human heart is victim. I was nearing the age of fifteen when
my uncle one evening bade me put on my prettiest frock
and accompany him to the home of a friend, where a dance
was to be given. I was dressed with all the alacrity my old
mammy was capable of summoning, and was soon ensconced
in the carriage and on my way to
<note id="note5" n="5" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref5">1 <hi rend="italics">A Belle of the Fifties</hi>, Doubleday, Page&amp; Co., 1904.</note>
<pb id="wyeth43" n="43"/>
the hospitable scene. <hi rend="italics">En route</hi> we stopped at the hotel, where
my uncle alighted, reappearing in a moment with a very
handsome young man, who entered the carriage with him and
drove with us to the house where he, too, was to be a guest.</p>
          <p>“Never had my eyes beheld so pleasing a masculine wonder!
He was the personification of manly beauty! His head was
shapely as Tasso's (in after life I often heard the comparison
made), and in his eyes there burned a romantic fire that enslaved
me from the moment their gaze rested upon me. At their warmth
all the ardor, all the ideals upon which a romantic heart had fed,
rose in recognition of their realization in him. During the evening
he paid me some pretty compliments, remarking upon my hazel
eyes and the gleam of gold in my hair, and he touched my curls
admiringly, as if they were revered by him.</p>
          <p>“My head swam! Lohengrin never dazzled Elsa more
completely than did this knight of the poet's head charm the
maiden that was I. We danced together frequently throughout the
evening, and my hero rendered me every attention a kind man
may offer to the little daughter of a valued friend. When at last
we stepped into the carriage and turned homeward the whole
world was changed for me.</p>
          <p>“My first apprehension of approaching sorrow came as we
neared the hotel. To my surprise, the knight was willing, nay,
desired to be set down there. A dark suspicion crept into my mind
that perhaps, after all, my hero might be less gallant than I had
supposed, else why did he not seek this opportunity of riding
home with me? If this wonderful emotion that possessed me also
had actuated him—and how could I doubt it after his devotion
throughout
<pb id="wyeth44" n="44"/>
the evening?—how could he bear to part from me in this
way without a single word or look of tenderness?</p>
          <p>“As the door closed behind him I leaned back in the darkest
corner of the carriage and thought hard, though not hardly, of
him. After a little my uncle roused me by saying, ‘Did my little
daughter enjoy this evening?’ I responded enthusiastically.</p>
          <p>“ ‘And was I not kind to provide you with such a gallant
cavalier? Isn't Colonel Jere Clemens a handsome man?’</p>
          <p>“Ah, was he not? My full heart sang out his praises with an
unmistakable note. My uncle listened sympathetically; then he
continued, ‘Yes; he's a fine fellow, Virginia, and he has a nice
little wife and baby.’</p>
          <p>“No thunderbolt ever fell more crushingly upon the
unsuspecting than did these awful words from the lips of my
uncle. I know not how I reached my room, but, once there, I
wept passionately throughout the night and much of the following
morning. Within my own heart I accused my erstwhile hero of
the rankest perfidy, of villainy of every imaginable quality; and in
this recoil of injured pride perished my first love dream, vanished
the heroic wrappings of my quondam knight!”</p>
          <lb/>
          <p>With all his charm of manner and handsome face, this gifted
man fell short of his opportunities. The judgment of Jacob upon
his first-born son might well apply to him! “Unstable as water,
thou shalt not excel.” Although a member of the Secession
Convention, signing the ordinance which carried his native state
into the Southern Confederacy, and accepting the chief command
of all the Alabama forces when hostilities were declared, he
resigned later, and when the armies of the North occupied
Huntsville he went
<pb id="wyeth45" n="45"/>
over, “foot, baggage, and artillery,” to those making savage war
upon the people among whom he was born and reared and to
whom he owed the distinction that had been accorded to him. His
kinsman, Samuel L. Clemens (Mark Twain), joined the
Confederate cavalry as a lieutenant, and deserted, as did Henry
M. Stanley, the noted explorer.</p>
          <p>From Virginia also came John W. Walker, a Princeton
graduate, and the first United States Senator from Alabama, and
his two sons, Richard and Pope, born in Huntsville and schooled
at Greene Academy and at the University of Virginia and at
Princeton; the former a Confederate State Senator, the latter the
first Secretary of War in the Confederate cabinet. Gabriel Moore,
lawyer, governor, Congressman, United States Senator, and
James G. Birney were Huntsville men. The latter, with my
mother's father, John Allan, organized the first “Society for the
Emancipation of Slavery” in Alabama, published a newspaper
founded to advocate the cause of abolition, and was the nominee
on this ticket in 1840, and again in 1844, for the Presidency of the
United States.</p>
          <p>Also came hither Reuben Chapman, of Caroline County,
Virginia, lawyer, legislator, governor, and Congressman. I
remember my father reading to me a letter from this famous
politician, asking his advice as to whether or not he could safely
vote for an appropriation then before Congress for a certain sum
of money to construct an experimental telegraph line from
Washington City to Baltimore. My father advised him to vote for
it by all means, but added, “You need not hope to be re-elected if
you do.”</p>
          <p>Dr. Henry Chambers, from the Old Dominion, the only
member of the medical profession ever elected to the Senate of
the United States from Alabama, was a practising physician
<pb id="wyeth46" n="46"/>
here. James White McClung, the brilliant and dissipated
orator; William Smith, who was offered and declined an
associate-justiceship in the Supreme Court of the United States; Silas
Parsons, of the state Supreme Court; Colonel Robert and Dr.
Thomas L. Fearn, the Erskines, Mastins, Popes, Coles, Brandons,
Facklers, Donegans, Lanes, Acklens, Garths, Irbys, Russells,
Newmans, Mathewses, Leftwicks, Calhouns, Phelans, Beirnes,
Hales, Weedons, and Pattons, and many others were of this
extraordinary community of pioneers in which my parents moved.
The list would not be complete did I not mention Robert C.
Brickell, the famous chief justice of the state Supreme Court, and
his associate in law, Septimus D. Cabaniss; also Peter M. Dox
and Wm. M. Lowe, members of Congress, each of whom was
bound to my father by the ties of personal friendship.</p>
          <p>Into this community I made my first entrance when I was nine
years old. I had learned the story of Aladdin, and now I felt as if
his lamp was mine. Born in a log cabin and reared in the country
of the Cherokees, as yet little more than a wilderness, I knew
nothing of the outer world except what I had gathered from
conversation with my parents. The sun which rose over the high
mountains an hour's walk from our home, and went down behind
the range which shut in our beautiful valley on the west, measured
the limits of my horizon. The near-by hills and valleys and
streams and woods made up my world. I knew the trees in the
forests and the animals and birds, wild and tame, before I
knew the names of the human beings coming in ever-increasing
numbers into the newly opened territory.</p>
          <p>My father made frequent journeys away on errands
connected with his law practice, and every year my mother
made a visit of a few weeks to her old home and girlhood
friends
<pb id="wyeth47" n="47"/>
in Huntsville, and this time I was to go with her. We took the
steamboat <hi rend="italics">Lookout</hi>, which puffed and whistled and churned the
water into huge waves that went surging from underneath the
great stern wheel, which turned over so fast and made such a
mighty splashing. Captain Matt Todd, whose boat it was, took me
on the roof—he called it the “hurricane-deck”—and held me as
I leaned over to watch the water fly from the strokes of the
paddles, or “buckets,” and then into the pilot-house, where the
man at a smaller wheel turned it one way and then another,
always busy and watchful, as our boat plowed between great
rocks that we could see down below the surface, or sunken logs
or “sawyers” (loose, half-submerged logs), or swept around a
bend in the beautiful river. Great cliffs of stone, with cedars
clinging to the fissures in the rock, rose up on one or the other
side so high at times I wondered if anybody ever climbed to the
top.</p>
          <p>On we went, by great plantations of corn and cotton; and
every now and then the deafening whistle blew, and the big bell
rang, and the noisy wheel stopped as we swung around bow up-stream
and tied to the bank to take on or put off travelers and
freight. At the mouth of Flint River, where the shoals were bad,
the good <hi rend="italics">Lookout</hi> went aground, and a great rope hawser had to
be taken ashore and fastened by one end to a big tree while the
other was wound around the capstan until our boat was pulled
back into the channel.</p>
          <p>From Whitesburg Landing we drove the twelve miles to
Huntsville in a stage-coach. The road was so wide and white and
hard I wondered if it was the same kind of earth we were used
to. No dust, no stumps for the wheels to bump over, no loose
rocks, and no mud-holes. Then my mother told me of a Mr.
McAdam, who taught people how
<pb id="wyeth48" n="48"/>
to build good roads of crushed stone, and how “her people” had
learned to do this long ago. Near sundown we climbed a high hill,
and from the top of this I saw ever so many houses clustered
together, and one with a great round dome high above the others,
and farther on a steeple even higher still. They told me one was
the court-house and the other, my mother said, was her father's
church. We had no court-house where we lived, and up to this
moment I had never seen a church. There were preachers at
times in Marshall, “circuit-riders” who came to our village every
once in a while, usually on horseback, with their sermons and
belongings in a pair of saddle-bags, preached and held “revivals”
in our log school-house, and in summer-time under brush arbors.</p>
          <p>Somewhere, in a street with great houses stretching away on
both sides as far as I could see, our stage stopped, and we got out.
I remember the high iron fence, and the gate that opened into the
park-like yard, and the smoothly mown blue grass, and ever so
many shade-trees on either side of the long brick walk which led
up to the mansion. The servants took our luggage, and Colonel
Fearn and his dear wife came out to welcome my mother. They
called her by her school-girl name, and she spoke to them as
“Robert” and “Mary,” for they had grown up together. Even
Caledonia, the seamstress, who had been lady's-maid to her
young mistress in their younger days, courtesied and took my
mother's hand as she said, “Howdy, Miss Phemie.” I wondered
why Carter (I can't spell it as Colonel Fearn pronounced it, for he
had the tide-water accent), the butler, wore a red waistcoat and a
blue coat with shiny brass buttons; and I was told that was his
livery. The wide front portico was nearly as large as all of our
little house at
<pb id="wyeth48a" n="48a"/>
<figure id="ill4" entity="wyeth48a"><p>A HUNTSVILLE MANSION OF THE EARLY DAYS</p></figure>
<pb id="wyeth49" n="49"/>
home, and the great white columns went up two stories to the
roof; and inside there was a maze of rooms and winding stairs
and strange, old-fashioned furniture—bureaus and tables, and
beds with long posts which reached to near the ceiling, and had
tops or testers, with curtains on the sides. How strange it all was,
and a lonesome feeling came over me, and I wanted to go back
home!</p>
          <p>I remember vividly that when we went to the supper-table I
saw for the first time a silver fork, and it felt so awkward as I
tried to eat with it that I boldly asked Colonel Fearn if I couldn't
have “a sure-enough fork instead of a split-spoon.” He laughed
louder than I thought he ought to as he said: “Carter, go to the
kitchen and bring that child another fork.”</p>
          <p>Another great surprise was in store for me when I discovered
up in our room that there were pipes which carried cold and hot
water, and that we didn't have to go to the spring with a bucket
and bring it in by hand. I learned later that there were hydrants
on the corners of all the streets, and I soon learned that by
pushing down on the handle and slipping a pebble above it I could
keep the clear stream flowing until the gutter was as full as the
spring branch at home; and one day a rude policeman took the
pebble out and stopped the water from wasting, with a threat to
arrest me if I did it again. But the greatest surprise was in store
for me when I saw what I was told was gas-light; no wick or
candle or lamp, just light; and there was nothing to do but to turn
a brass key and strike a match. What a wonderful new world all
this was to a boy of nine years who had never before been out of
sight of his home in the backwoods!</p>
          <p>I shall never forget those Huntsville gardens and the
<pb id="wyeth50" n="50"/>
beautiful flowers. These we had at our home; for mother
watched and cared for her rose-bushes and flower-beds with
her own hand, and, as I was always with her, I had
learned their names; but here the grounds were very large, and
this garden was laid out like a big Chinese puzzle.
There were tiny paths that led in all directions, with dense rows of
box along the edges, and the beds were grouped in all sorts of
fantastic shapes, and down at one end stood a small house all of
glass windows where they put things away in cold weather to
keep the frost from killing them. Farther away was the vegetable
garden, for there were no market-houses in those early days, and
every home provided for itself; and back of this, opening on an
alleyway which cut the block in two, were the spacious stables for
the milk-cows, horses, and carriages.</p>
          <p>As we entered the church the next Sunday morning I found
myself in the largest room I had ever been in, with row after row of
benches—enough, it seemed to me then, to seat all the people in
Marshall County. On the high wall at the end where the preacher
stood was a tablet, and in big letters was written my grandfather's
name, and when he was installed as pastor, and the date of his
death. When the minister said the prayer I started to kneel down as
we did when my father had family prayers at home, but here they all
stood up to pray. What was just as strange as this was the way he
gave out the hymn, which he read verse after verse all through
before any one began to sing. At our “meetings” the preacher alone
had a hymn-book, and he gave out only two lines at a time, which
was as much as he thought the congregation could remember, and
then when they had sung these he would go on with more until the
whole hymn was finished.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth51" n="51"/>
          <p>When the Huntsville minister read the last verse, a half-dozen
young people stood up over in the corner of the church, and as
they began to sing there sounded with their voices the soft, low
tones of some—to me—strange instrument (the organ), and
such heavenly harmonies as I had never dreamed were in the
world. No wonder my mother loved to come to Huntsville, and
no wonder I looked forward after this first visit to the many I was
to make, and did make, in the years which followed, until I felt
at home, and knew by face and name all of these delightful people,
the like of whom I shall not look upon again.</p>
          <p>Their “literary circles,” the yearly “college commencements” in
which they took such justifiable pride, and, above all, as I grew
older and better able to appreciate them, the great political
debates in which the foremost men of that period figured in the
tournaments of oratory, were among the great attractions to this
exceptional community. It was here, in 1859 or 1860, in the shade of
a beautiful grove of oaks, where thousands of people were
gathered, I sat for four hours and had no thought of the lapse of
time as I listened to the fiery argument in favor of secession by
William L. Yancey, then famous as one of the greatest
political orators of our country.</p>

<lb/>
THE NEGRO AND SLAVERY IN THE OLD SOUTH</head>
          <p>THE negro of the South in the days of slavery so little
resembles the “colored citizens” of half a century later that we of
the earlier period scarcely recognize in him the descendant of
those of his race with whom we were once so happily
associated. The charm of manner, the pride of family—the
“quality,” as they so aptly termed it—the sentiment of loyalty,
affection, and trust which characterized the relation between
these faithful, patient, submissive, and happy creatures and the
“white folks” in the “big house” is now only a memory.</p>
          <p>For nearly two hundred miles the fertile valley of the
Tennessee, in which I was born and grew to manhood, was a
succession of plantations tilled almost wholly by slaves. On some
of these the owner lived and superintended in person the laborers,
while on others an overseer took charge for the master, whose
home was in some center of culture, usually where there were
schools or colleges which the children attended.</p>
          <p>As child and boy I played and romped with the younger
negroes belonging to my parents and neighbors; visited the
various plantations, and knew intimately scores of this race living
under the various conditions of slavery; and I know that with
very rare exceptions the negroes were treated with great
kindness and consideration. They were well
<pb id="wyeth53" n="53"/>
fed, housed, and clothed, and when ill had the best available
medical attendance. Had human sympathy been entirely absent,
the protection of valuable property would for selfish reasons
have assured this fostering care. They were happy and
contented, and proved their gratitude by an affectionate loyalty
and an efficient and profitable service. To my mind, in no other
way can there be explained that wonderful exhibition of devotion
in those millions of slaves toiling away on the home plantations
during the four years of the war which their absent owners were
waging for their continued enslavement. And this
notwithstanding the knowledge which was general among them
that the success of the Federal army meant for them freedom!</p>
          <p>As there were no white domestic servants in the South and no
freed negroes in Alabama, since the law required that all
emancipated slaves should be transported to a free state or
exported to Liberia, my parents, both of whom favored
emancipation, bought for house service two families of negroes,
each consisting of the father and the mother and their children,
some twelve or fifteen in all. They were as near being members
of the family as was possible in the kindly relation of master and
mistress and slave. When “Mack,” our majordomo, was taken
seriously ill, a room was given him, not in his own comfortable
house, but in our residence, where we thought he could be more
carefully watched. His wife, a woman of fine character, was a
second mother to us as children. We called her “Mammy,” and
when our own mother was not at hand we knew to whom to
look for our needs.</p>
          <p>When in later unhappy years the war came on and I was about
to mount my horse and ride away to take my place in the ranks,
and said good-by to my mother and my father,
<pb id="wyeth54" n="54"/>
I knew that back in the kitchen this devoted black woman was
waiting for me to come to have her blessing; and there, with her
arms around “the boy she had brought up”—for I was not yet
eighteen years old—I had the only “crying-spell” of the parting
scene. I said, “Mammy, the chances are you won't see me again,
and I know you will take good care of all the folks at home.” She
said she would; and she was true to her word, even refusing, as
did all of our slaves, to go away when the Union army occupied
our section and offered them their freedom from bondage.</p>
          <p>It was my father's custom to have family prayers, and the
negro children were required to be present, the only distinction 
being that we sat on chairs and they had stools or small ottomans.
Physical punishment was unknown except when the parents
switched their own children for cause. I cannot imagine a more
mutually satisfactory arrangement than such servitude under such
humane conditions. There was a very great deal of this sort of
relationship in our section, and, as I believe, throughout the entire
South. There was another side to the picture, however; for the
system did allow of cruelty and inhumanity, and, though this was
very rare, it could and did exist at times, and it was the
knowledge of this fact that made so many of the best people of
the South emancipationists.</p>
          <p>The number of slaves belonging to a single plantation varied in
our section from ten to twenty-five or fifty, rarely exceeding one
hundred. While I knew personally every slave-owner in our
county and a great many of the slaves, it so happened that I
spent more time and became more intimately acquainted with the
management of the establishments belonging to my cousin, Mr.
James A. Boyd, in Madison County, where I frequently visited,
remaining for
<pb id="wyeth55" n="55"/>
weeks at a time, and that of Dr. Sydney Harris, a retired
physician who lived on and managed his own plantation near our
village. His residence—known in plantation parlance as “the big
house” or “the white-folks' house”—made of smoothly hewn logs
with chinking filling the interstices, all painted in white, with large
halls and passageways, stood on a slight elevation or hillock,
surrounded by a grove of oak and hickory trees, which almost hid
it from view as one approached through the half-mile of open
road which led from the front gate through the fields of cotton,
corn, and grain.</p>
          <p>Beginning some seventy-five yards to the rear in the same
grove, and arranged in two parallel rows, each with its spacious
yard and vegetable garden, were ranged a dozen or more
comfortable whitewashed log cabins of different sizes to
accommodate the various families of slaves. Still farther back
were the stables and the barns, the gin-house, the cotton-press,
and the fields for pasturage. It was the duty of the head-man, the
most trusted and capable of the slaves, to be up early to see that
the work-animals were properly fed and curried; and at daybreak
the horn blew, calling all hands to breakfast. By sunrise the plows
and hoes were going, and kept busy until twelve noon, when a
blast from the horn sounded the hour of rest and dinner; then
back to the fields till sundown.</p>
          <p>There was no white overseer or slave-driver on this
place. One of the negroes was in charge to see that each did
his duty. On rainy days there was plenty of indoor
employment, such as spinning and weaving, making or
mending harness and shoes and repairing the wagons, for every
big plantation had its blacksmith and carpenter shop, ran
spinning-wheels and looms, and made most of its clothing.
When
<pb id="wyeth56" n="56"/>
the crops had been gathered, the winter supply of wood was cut
and hauled in; and the thousand and one odds and ends of keeping
a great estate in order and in getting ready for the next crop
were attended to. The physical and moral welfare of these slaves
was carefully looked after by the good doctor and his gentle and
cultured wife.</p>
          <p>After the work of the day was over, the negroes were
required to remain on the place, and usually from fatigue and the
necessity of rising early they were in bed an hour after dark. On
Saturday nights singing and dancing were permitted in the cabins,
and, by special permission in writing, visits could be made to
neighboring plantations. The constable of each township or “beat”
was the official patrol, and had authority to punish by arrest and
whipping any negro slave found “after an hour by sun” away
from his home without a written and signed “pass and repass.”
The form was: “Pass the bearer to and from the plantation
named between eight and twelve o'clock to-night.” (Dated and
signed by the owner.)</p>
          <p>This precaution was taken to prevent vagrancy, to keep the
laborers in good condition for work, and to guard against the
possibility of conspiracy and insurrection. While the relations
between the white people of the Tennessee Valley and the
negroes were in every respect, as far as I was able to judge,
kindly and mutually trustful, the Southern people had learned from
the occasional outbreaks, and especially from the midnight
massacre of women and children in the Southampton uprising in
1831, that watchfulness was as essential a guarantee of safety as
kindliness.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref6" n="6" rend="sc" target="note6">1</ref></p>
          <note id="note6" n="6" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref6">1 Nat Turner, the instigator and leader of the Southampton massacres, was the
trusted head-man and overseer of his owner. The kindly relations of owner and
slave were exemplified in his case. On the day of the night when
he began his murders he feigned illness, and the lady to whom he belonged
cooked and carried to his cabin the food she thought would be best for a sick
man.  He repaid these kindly acts by slipping into their room at dead of night
and knocking her husband and herself in the head with hatchet or ax and
braining her baby against the fireplace. Details of this insurrection will be
given in the chapter devoted to the movement for the abolition of slavery
and the Harper's Ferry attempt at servile insurrection.</note>
          <pb id="wyeth57" n="57"/>
          <p>The negroes of our section were so well behaved that
punishment of any kind was almost unknown. I never heard of a
negro being whipped by the patrol in our county, and knew of but
a single instance where a rawhide was used in chastisement. A
negro man who had done some injury to another received thirty-nine
lashes on his naked back from the constable of our town,
under an order of the court. With the enterprising curiosity of a
boy, I climbed the jail-yard fence and witnessed this
performance. The first half-dozen lashes were severe enough to
cause the unhappy victim to cry out, and after that only the form
of the law was carried out.</p>
          <p>It was on the occasion of one of my earlier visits to the
plantation of my cousin, Mr. James A. Boyd, in Madison County,
that I first witnessed a “corn-shucking.” In gathering the corn the
ears were pulled from the stalks and piled in pens near the cribs.
The negroes on one plantation were privileged to invite those of
other places near by to come at dark on Saturday night. A
bonfire was built at a safe distance, by the light of which the men
and the women ranged themselves around the corn-piles and
began to strip the shuck, or husk, from the ear, to the cadence of
their African chants and weirdly melodious singing. One of the
number, by reason of his greater accomplishments, took the part
of leader, and from the top of the heap sang out or chanted a line
of a verse often improvised. When he
<pb id="wyeth58" n="58"/>
ceased, the chorus of from fifty to one hundred voices would
take up the refrain and carry it in a strange and varying cadence
of sounds without words, which typified joy or sorrow, or an
emotion in full sympathy with the sentiment
expressed by the leader.</p>
          <p>I can recall only a few of these lines, and wish I could
transcribe the music. For instance, the leader would sing “I'm
gwine away to leave you,” and, as this was suggestive of the
sadness of parting, the chorus would begin in a low moan, which,
rising and falling, would for a minute or two be carried to the
fullest tone, and then die away so gradually one could scarcely
say just when it ceased. Then the leader would chant in tones a
little less tinged with sadness: “I'm gwine to de happy islands!”
And, as this suggested the consummation of a dream of rest, the
chanting of the chorus was more cheeringly rendered.</p>
          <p>On these occasions extraordinary liberties were permissible,
and not infrequently, as the white people of the premises were
listening, the bold leader would by suggestion open the way for a
holiday, or a barbecue, or a dance, or extra Christmas vacation,
when they visited relatives and friends on other plantations. For
example:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Marster an' Mistus lookin' mighty fine—</l>
            <l>Gwine to take a journey; gwine whar day gwine;</l>
            <l>Crab-grass a-dyin', red sun in de west—</l>
            <l>Saturday's comin', nigger gwine to rest.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>And much more in this happy vein. Meanwhile everyone was busy
stripping corn, throwing the ears into the winter crib and packing
the shucks in the rail pens. It took usually about three hours
for the many hands to strip all the corn raised on the place,
and then there was a
<pb id="wyeth59" n="59"/>
supper with all sorts of home-made edibles, especially pumpkin
pies, sweet cakes, and persimmon beer, a refreshing,
unfermented beverage which the negroes made from this fruit.</p>
          <p>Among the articles of diet peculiar to the negroes on the great
plantations were the “ash-cake,” the “hoe-cake,” and the
“Johnny-cake.” The two first named were made of corn-meal dough. For
hoe-cake the dough was spread or “patted” thin on the smooth
surface of a hoe and held close to the fire until it was cooked
brown. The other was wrapped in corn-shucks, leaves, or brown-paper,
and buried under the hot ashes and embers until it was
well baked or roasted. The Johnny-cake was made of wheat-flour
dough, with “shortenin' ” (some form of grease or fat) in it;
and this, as with the hoe-cake, was spread thin on a hickory or an
ash board and baked before the coals. Many a time I have
shared these—to me then—delicious breads with my friends
and playmates of another race.</p>
          <p>The real fun began with the dancing. The banjo and the fiddle
made up the orchestra, and there were accompanists who
“patted” with the hands, keeping accurate time with the music.
In patting, the position was usually a half-stoop or forward bend,
with a slap of one hand on the left
knee followed by the same stroke and noise on the right, and then
a loud slap of the two palms together. I should add that the left
hand made two strokes in half-time to one for the right,
something after the double stroke of the left drumstick in beating
the kettle-drum. In rare instances I have seen the triangle in
these crude orchestras or trios, and have heard that before the
triangle came into vogue the dried and resonant jaw-bone of the
ox or horse was used this way, the sides being rhythmically
struck with

a rib. I have no doubt of this, for I learned from one of their
songs, handed down by repetition, probably, from pre-American
sires, these lines:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Oh, de jaw-bone walk,</l>
            <l>And de jaw-bone talk,</l>
            <l>And de jaw-bone eat</l>
            <l>Wid a knife and fork:</l>
            <l>I laid my jaw-bone on de fence,</l>
            <l>And I hain't seed dat jaw-bone sence.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>When on these occasions the crowd was very large, they would
divide and go to the cabins in smaller parties, or the big floor of
the gin-house may have been selected. Strange to say, they did
not relish dancing on the ground, in the manner of the American
Indians; and I think this can be explained by the negroes'
instinctive love of rhythm, which
the Indian does not seem to possess. The shuffle of the feet, in
many instances unshod—for in warm weather they would pull off
their shoes to keep their feet cool—could not be heard as
distinctly on the ground as on a plank floor or a tight puncheon.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref7" n="7" rend="sc" target="note7">1</ref> I
have often seen them dance on the bottom of a wagon-bed, which
made an excellent sounding-board. The dances were primitive
and gave opportunity for great activity; and when two danced
alone, whether of the same sex or not, the object seemed to be to
determine which could outdo the other. As the “steps,” or
gyrations and contortions, not only of the body and the legs, but of
the arms and the hands, grew more violent and rapid,
<note id="note7" n="7" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref7">1 A puncheon was the flat surface of a split log, smoothed with an ax and
pinned to the joists to make the floors of the rude cabins constructed before
sawmills were introduced. Sometimes they became loose, and rocked or rattled
when trod upon. When the negroes would dance a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">pas de deux</foreign></hi>, a tight puncheon
was selected, and the two danced forward and back on this single slab. Hence
the common expression, “Hunt your puncheon,” when something fixed or solid
or sure was desired.</note>
<pb id="wyeth61" n="61"/>
the spectators would begin to pat and shout words of approval or
kindly criticism, until at last one of the contestants gave up and
the victor was hailed as the “best man.” At midnight the frolic
ended, and the visitors returned to their several homes.</p>
          <p>The banjo was the real musical instrument of the Southern
negroes, not the fancy silver or nickel rimmed article with frets
seen now on the minstrel stage or in the shops, but a very crude
device, which I believe to be of native origin, notwithstanding the
name is said to be corrupted from the Spanish <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="es">bandore</foreign></hi>. The
most primitive instrument was made from a large gourd with a
long, straight neck or handle, shaped like those of smaller growth,
used commonly then for drinking-dippers. The bowl of the gourd
was cut away on a plane level with the surface of the neck, the
seed and contents removed, and over this, like a drumhead, a
freshly tanned coonskin was stretched, fastened, and allowed to
dry. The five strings of homemade materials passing from the
apron behind over a small bridge near the middle of the
drumhead were attached to the keys in proper position on the
neck.</p>
          <p>I learned to play upon a banjo which one of our slaves, who
was a very good performer, helped me to make, when I was
about eleven years old. The rim was made from the circle of a
cheese-box. A calfskin soaked in lime solution, which removed
the hair, was tacked while wet over one surface of this, while the
stem was carved from a suitable piece of soft poplar. I was
extravagant enough to import four catgut strings and a wire bass,
which excited no little curiosity, as they were the first ever seen
by our negroes. To the uninitiated there would probably be some
surprise at the quality of the music or harmony—even if crude—
which
<pb id="wyeth62" n="62"/>
could be produced by playing on this primitive instrument.
“Billy,” my teacher, accompanied his various tunes with
songs rendered with no ordinary skill—at least, that was the
verdict of his pupil. One of these “selections” was a great
dancing-score entitled “Jimmie Rose,” and no one with any love
of music, or even an ordinary sense or appreciation of rhythm,
could keep his feet still as Billy “waked to ecstasy,” not “the living
lyre,” but our home-made banjo.</p>
          <p>The song was something in this
strain:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Jimmie Rose he went to town;</l>
            <l>Jimmie Rose he went to town;</l>
            <l>Jimmie Rose he went to town;</l>
            <l>To 'commodate de ladies.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Fare ye well, ye ladies all;</l>
            <l>Fare ye well, ye ladies all;</l>
            <l>Fare ye well, ye ladies all;</l>
            <l>God Ermighty bless you.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>And so for an hour or more my instructor would continue with the
exploits of his hero, Jimmie Rose, while the other in twos or fours
danced away, “cutting the pigeon-wing,” “the back-step,” “the
double shuffle,” and other steps which required not only a keen
sense of keeping time with the music, but agility and muscular
power of a high order.</p>
          <p>The real negro music as I knew it was, as one would expect,
simple and crude, and quite unlike that which modern negro
minstrelsy has made popular. One of the best-known “jig,” or
short-step, banjo and dance tunes was called “Juba.”</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Juba dis and juba dat;</l>
            <l>Juba kill a yaller cat.</l>
            <l>Juba up and juba down;</l>
            <l>Juba runnin' all aroun'.</l>
          </lg>
          <pb id="wyeth63" n="63"/>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Ole Aunt Kate she bake de cake;</l>
            <l>She bake it hine de garden gate.</l>
            <l>She sift de meal, she gim me de dust,</l>

            <l>She eat de meat, she gim me de skin,</l>
            <l>And dat's de way she tuck me in.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Another piece much in vogue was:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Sugar in de gourd; when you want to git it out,</l>
            <l>Way ter git de sugar out roll de gourd about.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>There was one old-time tune called “Johnny Booker,”
which I learned very early from the negroes, and I believe it to
have originated with them. It had a swing and go to it which
suited the banjo as played by the plantation negro—that is,
“over-hand,” and not “guitar fashion,” as almost all are taught
now.</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>I went down de back ob de fiel';</l>
            <l>A black-snake cotch me by de heel</l>
            <l>I cut my dus', I run my best;</l>
            <l>Run my head in a hornet's nest</l>
            <l>Oh! do, Mr. Booker, do; Oh, do, Johnny Booker, do;</l>
            <l>Oh do, Mr. Booker, Johnny Booker, Mr. Booker, Mr. Booker, Johnny
Booker, do!</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Another popular song referred to the “patrol,” which the
negroes styled “patter-rollers”:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Run, nigger, run; patter-roller catch you;</l>
            <l>Run, nigger, run; it's almos' day;</l>
            <l>Run, nigger, run; patter-roller catch you;</l>
            <l>Run, nigger, run; you'd better git away.</l>
            <l>Dis nigger run; he run his best;</l>
            <l>Stuck his head in a hornet's nest.</l>
            <l>Jump'd de fence and run frew de paster;</l>
            <l>White man run, but nigger run faster.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>There was an embellishment of this “star” selection which
may be of interest. After playing the music of the chorus,
<pb id="wyeth64" n="64"/>
Billy would pause, lay the banjo across his knees, and speak
in about this style, preluding his remark with one of those
long-drawn-out grunts or weirdly intonated expressions of
great surprise which only the African seems to enjoy: “Golly!
folks; I went to see Miss Sal last Sat'day night. Sal's a handsome
gal, too, no 'ceptions to dat. I ain't more'n had time to 'spress
myself on de occasion when Sal say, ‘Looky dar, Peet!’ ‘Looky
whar, Sal?’ ‘Look at dat patter-roller peepin' frew de crack!’”
Then a second long grunt or ejaculation of surprise.</p>
          <p>“Golly! chillun; dis yer nigger riz as quick as a nigger
could convenient; jumped frew de winder, fell ober de
wood-pile, knocked de wood into short sticks, an' took down de
road fas' as my laigs could go, an' de white man he tuk airter me,
an' ebery jump I make de white man say” (then he would sing):</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">“Run, nigger, run, patter-roller ketch you,” etc.</q>
          <p>“Sech a gittin up-stairs I nebber did see,” and “Susanna,
don't you cry,” were also banjo tunes of more modern origin. I
can recall only a single verse and the refrain of the latter:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>I jumped on board de telegraf,</l>
            <l>An' floated down de ribber.</l>
            <l>De 'lectric fluid magnified</l>
            <l>An' killed five hundred nigger.</l>
            <l>Oh, Susanna, don't you cry for me,</l>
            <l>For I'se down in Alabama wid de banjo on my knee.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Still another:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Ole Aunt Dinah she done got drunk;</l>
            <l>Fell in de fire; kicked up a chunk.</l>
            <l>De red-hot coals got in her shoe—</l>
            <l>Good Lord! how de ashes flew!</l>
          </lg>
          <pb id="wyeth65" n="65"/>
          <p>“Nellie Gray,” “Ole Dan Tucker,” “Jordan am a Hard Road to
Trabbel,” “I'se Gwine on Down to Lynchburg Town,” and scores
of other pieces of more modern production were in vogue, and
popular with the negroes.</p>
          <p>In addition to their love of melody they were fond of story-telling,
and many a night I have slipped off to Mammy Tildy's
cabin to sit by her at the kitchen hearth and listen to the weird
stories of ghosts and other “skeery” things, until I was afraid to go
alone in the dark the very short distance between her door and
the porch of our house. Joel Chandler Harris has done much to
popularize the negro folk-lore stories, but I do not recall that he
dwelt upon the pantomime accompaniment which was a part of
some of these dramatic recitals.</p>
          <p>By way of illustration I will repeat a story which I learned from
a very superior member of his race, a coal-black negro with clear-cut
features after the type of physiognomy of the African East
Coast. “Uncle Henry Moore” was one whose ability and
character obtained for him the confidence of his master and of
the entire community, and, with the exception of the franchise, he
was granted about every privilege that the ruling whites enjoyed;
with all of which, together with freedom from responsibility and
taxes, he should have been, and I believe was, a happy and
contented being. He did not even require a “pass” at night, and he
could come and go at all hours without molestation. He was a
frequent visitor with our servants, and I never tired of listening to
him. This is one of his stories, entitled, “Uncle Efra'm and de Lord”:</p>
          <p>“Ole Marster come along down de quarter one dark night, and
dess as he was passin' Uncle Efra'm's cabin he heered de ole
man a-prayin' so loud and so e'rnes'-like, he dess say
<pb id="wyeth66" n="66"/>
to hisself: ‘I'se gwine ter stop and listen ter what Efra'm's
a-sayin'.’ So he walk up on hes tiptoe an' put his eye ter a hole in de
chinkin', an' dar was Efra'm down on hes knees a-prayin' and
a-supplicatin' to de good Lord, an' he say—an' ole Marster he
heared ever' word he say—‘O Lord, hear de pra'r ob old Uncle
Efra'm, for he tired o' livin' in dis yer worl' whar de grass grow so
fas' and de sun shine so hot, and de nigger do all de wu'k, and ole
Marster he dess set aroun' in de shade; and O Lord, come down
and take Uncle Efra'm inter Abraham's bosom, whar dar ain't no
grass a-growin' an' de sun don't shine like a bresh-heap a-burnin'.
Yes, Lord, come down right now!’</p>
          <p>“An' when old Marster hear dat he say to hisself, ‘I gwine ter
try Uncle Efra'm’; an' so he knock free times wid de butt en' ob
his walkin'-stick on de side ob de cabin, and when Efra'm hear de
knockin' he stop a-prayin', an' he say, ‘Who dat knockin'?’ An' ole
Marster he dess change hes voice, an' he say pow'ful slow, ‘It's
de Lord come down to answer Efra'm's pra'r!’ An' de ole nigger
was dat skeered he didn't know whether he los' his hearin' or not,
an' he holler out loud, ‘Who's dat you say you is?’ An' ole Marster
he say ag'in, ‘It's de Lord come down to take Efra'm to
Abraham's bosom’; and by dat time Efra'm was a-shakin' all over
like he have a chill, an' he say, a-tremblin', ‘Look here, Lord;
Efra'm don't live her no mo'—he done move away!’ ”</p>
          <p>All through this recital Uncle Henry's voice would be
modulated to suit the meaning he wished to convey, and every
gesture and movement was in sympathy with the text. He would
kneel down to show how Ephraim prayed, and then get up and
walk to the door, open it, lean outside, knock three times on the
wall, and then imitate from without
<pb id="wyeth67" n="67"/>
in the dark the voice of the Lord. By this time the children
in the half-circle about the fireplace—for all the cooking was
done then on the open hearth—would be in such a condition of
excitement that I for one would not have been surprised to see
the Lord walk right in and snatch Black Mammy and me
(for I was sticking so close to her He would have had to take us both),
and flit way to plant us in Abraham's bosom. I might add pages
of negro folk-lore stories and of incidents associated with the life of
the slave with us, but what I have already said
is enough to show the true relation of the negro slave to the
white people of our immediate section. I will add one very
remarkable experience connected with this race, for fear there
may be made of it no other published record.</p>
          <p>Three miles from our village, at a plantation known as “Beard's
Bluff,” on the Tennessee, there lived a Mr. McLemore, who
owned a negro called “Cap.” He was about twenty-five years
old when I first remember him; dark brown or almost black in
color, and of normal development physically, with the exception of
his eyes, which were unusually prominent (exophthalmus) and
opened wider than I had ever observed. The almost constant
rolling movement of his eyeballs, which, as it seemed to me, he
could not fix steadily on any object, gave him an uncanny
expression. In fact, he was mentally defective in the ordinary
sense, and had to be cared for as if he were a child.</p>
          <p>As his parents were field-hands, at work on the plantation
during most of the day, the kind master had built a cabin for them
in the yard of his own home, where the helpless boy might be
cared for while the mother was absent. When he was about
fifteen years old Mr. McLemore noticed one day that the boy
who had been shelling the grains from
<pb id="wyeth68" n="68"/>
an ear of corn had arranged them decimally—<hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi>, in squares of
ten rows, each row containing ten grains. He stopped for a
moment and said, “Ten times ten makes a hundred, ten times one
hundred makes one thousand.” The negro's face lighted up with a
look of surprise or joy, and he repeated the words of the master,
who then repeated the numerals, and soon discovered the boy's
wonderful aptitude for figures and for calculation. Although he
never learned to read or write, he developed into one of the most
remarkable mathematical machines I have ever known. He
would solve instantly problems in multiplication which would take
me an hour or more to work out and prove. For instance, he was
given this example:</p>
          <p>“Cap, the hind-wheel of a wagon is five feet in diameter; it is
forty miles from here to Huntsville. How many times will it
revolve in going that distance?” As the proposition was being
given out his eyeballs would turn upward, and, with the lids half
closed, only the white portion was visible. By the time the last
word of the questioner was spoken he would begin with the
answer, which was invariably correct; and after the last figure
was named his eyes would open as he politely added “Sir” to each
answer. Time and again I have tried to catch him in the
multiplication of the most confusing figures, such as 789, 687, 431,
and so on, by the same figures rearranged. Though the answer
ran into quadrillions, it made no difference to him, for he
gave the correct answer immediately. In the course of time
many well-known persons, teachers, professors of
mathematics, and others came to investigate this phenomenon or
to satisfy curiosity. He would have been as profitable on
exhibition as was Blind Tom, another negro prodigy, but his
kind-hearted and proud master would not permit his
<pb id="wyeth69" n="69"/>
ward to be carried around as a money-making show. When the
war was over, and the various county-seats of the Southern
states were garrisoned by negro soldiers (to keep us “rebels” in
subjection), the white captain of the company stationed at
Guntersville, under the operations of the famous “Freedman's
Bureau,” had himself appointed guardian for “Cap,” and was
preparing for a tour of exhibition when the negro died of cholera.</p>
          <p>I have always regretted that his brain could not have been
submitted to the careful study of a competent anatomist. As he
was mentally deficient in the ordinary sense, it is probable that
certain brain cells, which in the average human beings are
arranged to carry on the various functions of this puzzling organ,
were crowded into his mathematical center, enormously
developing it.</p>
          <p>In Blind Tom's case the center of music or harmony was the
seat of this extraordinary development. From what I could see in
the study of this wonderful creature, I felt that in some way the
secret was related to the decimal system. Dreaming, sometimes,
I have dared to think that perhaps the brain of this poor, helpless
negro was more nearly attuned to the universal harmony than
ours, which we deem normal; more nearly in touch with that
mysterious influence which holds planets and systems in
unchanging relationship, with that eternal influence which we of
our time and limited knowledge “call God and know no more”!</p>
          <p>Another phase of slave life in Alabama may be illustrated in a
brief sketch of “Uncle Dan Gilbreath,” a pure-blooded negro of
the prevailing East Coast or Somali type. He and his master
were of the same age and had grown up together on the
plantation. They had played and hunted and fished in their
younger days in constant companionship.
<pb id="wyeth70" n="70"/>
When the young man came into his inheritance he gave Dan all
the privileges of a freeman. Far from abusing the confidence and
affection of his master, he was industrious, conscientious, and
had developed a fair degree of business ability. It was not to be
expected that a slave who, as the other negroes expressed it,
had “growed up in de white folks' house” would labor with the
field-hands, but none the less Dan made himself useful and
profitable.</p>
          <p>Years before the Emancipation Proclamation, which was at first
only effective in theory, and even before the collapse of the
Confederacy, which made all slaves free, Dan had earned enough
money to ransom himself, but he was too wise in his generation to
accept freedom with the risks of exportation to Liberia, for such
was then the law. There was never a public occasion which would
draw a crowd to the county-seat at which Uncle Dan did not
appear driving his yoke of steers with the two-wheeled cart with
melons or fruits or some enticing article of food or drink. When
fruits were out of season he had the art of making chicken-pies,
ginger-cakes, and cider or persimmon beer, which made him
famous in every nook and corner of the county. The allurements
of freedom or of “reconstruction politics” could not seduce Dan
from his loyal appreciation of the white people who had always
shown him kindness. Respected by all classes, he lived to a very
old age. In common with his race he possessed a keen sense of
the ludicrous and the ability to describe humorous or exciting
incidents. I am tempted to give in his own language as near as I
can remember it his description of a personal experience when the
Federal artillerists first turned their guns on our quiet village.</p>
          <p>The incident I am about to relate occurred on the 27th
<pb id="wyeth71" n="71"/>
of July, 1862. That portion of Alabama north of the Tennessee
River had been occupied by the Federal armies. The
Confederate pickets held the south bank, and the village of
Guntersville was a mile still farther south, yet in full view from
the high bluff on the north side of the river. By a night march a
regiment of Union infantry, half a regiment of cavalry, and a
section of artillery reached the river opposite the town, and from
a commanding height had two six-pounder Parrott guns in
position and trained upon it.</p>
          <p>When daylight dawned the villagers bestirred themselves in
peaceful unconsciousness of the storm impending. An hour later,
Uncle Dan, seated upon the cross-plank of his two-wheeled
ox-cart, drove down Main Street, which, running north and south,
was for half a mile in plain view of the Union artillerists across
the Tennessee. Like his master, Dan was of the “old school.”
The former still held to the customs and costumes of the Virginia
planters from whom he had descended; and Dan, who fell heir to
the costumes, sat erect and proud, clad in the long-tailed,
blue-cotton, brass-buttoned frock coat which he had received from his
owner. Farther on he turned aside and drove his panting team for
shelter from the hot July sun into the cool shade behind the big
brick edifice which served not only as county and district
court-house, but as town hall, Masonic lodge, and a place in which
wandering one-night Thespians could give their entertainments.</p>
          <p>Before he could unhitch his oxen preparatory to making the
usual display of his melons the unexpected had happened—a
flash of lightning from a cloudless sky. Not even the blast from
Gabriel's trumpet sounding the Day of Judgment could have
startled the villagers or Uncle Dan more
<pb id="wyeth72" n="72"/>
than this unlooked-for boom of a cannon, the reverberation of
which, while waking the echoes upon the mountainsides, was
accompanied by the whiz of a shell which rent the air above the
housetops, exploding with deafening noise and sending its
whirring fragments to the ground.</p>
          <p>The white citizens of the village knew what was at hand and
stood not upon the order of their going, but fled for safety to a deep
ravine which crossed Main Street near the upper end of the
village.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref8" n="8" rend="sc" target="note8">1</ref> There a hundred or more women and children were
huddled against the northern slope of the hillside when Dan flashed
by in flight so meteor-like and swift and in demoralization so
complete that he did not know whether he was running or flying,
living or dead. I can do no better than repeat the story as nearly as
possible in Dan's own language:</p>
          <p>“When de fust shell busted I was dat skeered I mighty near
drapp'd dead. I look up quick for thunder, but dar warn't no cloud
in de sky, an' I knowed den it warn't a storm a-comin', but I didn't

THE POINT OF VIEW—HISTORY OF AMERICAN SLAVERY AND
THE ABOLITION CRUSADERS—SOME TRUTHS ABOUT JOHN
BROWN AND THE SO-CALLED MARTYRDOM</head>
          <p>IN the discussion of slavery and the movement for its abolition
in the United States one may be open to the criticism, however
trite, that one's convictions depend largely upon the point of view.
While my viewpoint is Southern, it is that of one convinced early
in life of the moral wrong and economic unwisdom of chattel
slavery.</p>
          <p>My father was born and reared in a Northern community, and
his training and early associations were with those who believed
in universal freedom. My mother came of a family of Southern
emancipationists. Her father, John Allan, a Presbyterian minister,
liberated his slaves, his six children jointly signing the articles of
manumission. In association with James G. Birney, who twice
preceded Frémont and Lincoln as the nominee for the Presidency
on the Abolition platform, he organized in Huntsville, Alabama,
one of the early societies of Southern emancipationists, and
published there an abolition newspaper. There were in 1835 eight
emancipation societies organized in seven of the wealthy and
populous agricultural counties in the Tennessee Valley in northern
Alabama. In Lawrence County, where one of these existed, an
uncle of mine, David A. Smith, in 1838 liberated all of his slaves
and transported
<pb id="wyeth75" n="75"/>
them to, and provided them with homes in, Morgan County,
Illinois.</p>
          <p>The gravest of the many errors made by the Northern
abolitionists was their failure to appreciate the strength and the
possibilities of the Southern emancipation movement. It was
undoubtedly well under way and gaining strength steadily. The
example and teaching of Washington, Jefferson, Madison,
Monroe, the Randolphs, and a host of the great leaders of
Virginia, to whom the whole South looked for guidance, had
exercised a profound influence on the best minds of the
slave-holding class. My kinsman George Wythe not only freed his
slaves, but, in order to show the possibilities of the race, gave one
of his young negro lads a classical education. This influence was
widely felt in North Carolina, Kentucky, Tennessee, and
Alabama. In 1827 the legislature of Alabama enacted a “law
forbidding the importation of slaves for barter or hire.” As early
as 1722 the Virginia assembly had authorized private
emancipations, and in 1778 this assembly prohibited slave
importations, imposing a fine of five thousand dollars for each
offense. Ballagh, in his history, says, “Virginia had thus the honor
of being the first political community in the civilized world to
prohibit the pernicious traffic.” After Virginia in 1784 ceded the
Northwest Territory to the United States, her delegates in
Congress were the leading spirits in securing the adoption of the
ordinance for ever excluding slavery from that vast empire.</p>
          <p>At the close of the Revolution there were less than three
thousand freed negroes in the state. By 1810 there were more
than thirty thousand. By 1860, despite the deportation of
thousands whose masters had freed them and settled them in
Liberia and elsewhere, nearly sixty thousand freed
<pb id="wyeth76" n="76"/>
negroes still remained. Mr. Ballagh, author of <hi rend="italics">The History of
Slavery</hi>, estimates that Virginian planters had manumitted
up to that time, “without a penny's compensation, one hundred
thousand of these bondsmen,” the money value approximating one
hundred million dollars. Of this period W. Gordon McCabe, in his
careful review<ref targOrder="U" id="ref9" n="9" rend="sc" target="note9">1</ref> of this subject, says: “Unfortunately, when the
hopes of Virginia emancipationists were highest during the
famous session devoted to ‘Slavery Debates’ the rabid abolitionists
of the North, through secret emissaries, flooded the state with
abusive and incendiary pamphlets calling on the slaves to rise and
re-enact the horrors of Haiti and San Domingo. One of these—
the notorious Walker pamphlet—referred to ‘Haiti, the glory of
the blacks and the terror of tyrants.’” Then came the Southampton
Insurrection, in 1831, an event of horror which created intense
excitement throughout the South. Speaking for Virginia, McCabe
says: “The reaction was immediate, even the strongest antislavery
advocates were disgusted and repelled, and the movement
collapsed.” In the campaign of vilification which dealt this
stunning blow to the Southern emancipationists the <hi rend="italics">Genius of
Universal Emancipation</hi>, edited by Benjamin Lundy, of
Baltimore, and the <hi rend="italics">Liberator</hi>, founded by William Lloyd Garrison
in Massachusetts, were prominently aggressive. Passing from
words to deeds, the “Underground Railroad,” a numerous, active,
and wealthy organization, the outspoken business of which was
the unlawful enticing away of slaves, began its operations. These
openly disregarded the Constitution (the basis of the
Union), which guaranteed protection in property of slaves, and by
mob-rule and the enactment of state laws persistently
<note id="note9" n="9" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref9">1 London Saturday Review, March 5, 1910.</note>
<pb id="wyeth77" n="77"/>
and successfully set at naught the laws of Congress.</p>
          <p>Then came the armed invasion of Virginia by John Brown and
his band of outlaws, and with this effort to arm a servile race and
repeat the Southampton Massacre on a large scale secession
was made possible and the hope of peace was gone. Living as I
did through this period of intense excitement, a close observer of
events as they were happening, I am convinced that but for this
murderous foray the leaders of secession in the South could not
have carried Virginia, North Carolina, Tennessee, and Alabama
out of the Union; and without these there would have been no
Southern Confederacy and no Civil War.</p>
          <p>Slavery was already doomed, and a bloody war was not
necessary for its extinction.</p>
          <p>A large majority of the Anglo-Saxon South did not own a slave,
and had no selfish interest in perpetuating slavery. Fleming, the
historian, says that as late as 1860 a majority of the white people of
Alabama were opposed to slavery. They realized that the verdict
of the higher civilization was against it; and, although the
movement for emancipation which at one period was gaining a
strong and influential backing in the slave-holding section was
temporarily checked in the resentment which followed the
mistaken policy of the militant abolitionists of the North, it could
not have been long deferred.</p>
          <p>Mr. Benton said in the United States Senate in 1829: “I can truly
say that slavery, a hereditary institution, descended upon us from
our ancestors, has but few advocates or defenders in the slave-holding
states, and would have fewer if those who have nothing
to do with the subject
<pb id="wyeth78" n="78"/>
would only let us alone.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref10" n="10" rend="sc" target="note10">1</ref> I have no doubt that but for this
meddlesomeness to which Benton refers, the Southern people,
aided by the kindly sympathy of their Northern kinsmen, would
long before this have carried out a humane plan of emancipation,
giving the African race a home of their own in a “territory
where, secure from external dangers, they would enjoy civil and
political liberty,” (Report of the Virginia Committee.) How much
better for both blacks and whites would this have been than the
long, bloody, and cruel war, which, as I maintain, only the
aggressive abolitionists made possible.</p>
          <p>The introduction of negro chattel slavery in the North
American colonies dates from 1619, when a Dutch ship sold to
the settlers along the James River, in Virginia, a small cargo of
slaves. There followed other consignments, distributed along the
Atlantic coast, until by 1700 African slavery existed in all of the
thirteen original colonies, these aliens forming then about
one-sixteenth of the entire population. Vessels owned chiefly by
skippers from New England and New York took up the
profitable traffic, with Newport and Bristol, Rhode Island, as the
chief ports of distribution in the North, and Charleston and
Savannah in the South. Although in the more fertile sections of
New York, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey negroes were
purchased in considerable numbers by individual owners for work
upon the larger plantations, in New England and in the states
north of Maryland in general ownership was more frequently
limited to a single slave or to one family, the members of which
performed the duties of house-servants.
<note id="note10" n="10" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref10">1 With this conviction, Benton would doubtless have approved Wendell
Phillips's assertion that a New-Englander's definition of hell is a place where
every man has to attend to his own business.</note>
<pb id="wyeth79" n="79"/>
It soon became evident that the rigorous climate of the
North was unsuitable to the profitable employment of
a race born and reared under tropical conditions and suddenly
subjected to the long winters, the frosts and snows of the North
Atlantic colonies.</p>
          <p>In the lower temperate zone and nearer the equator in the
southern settlements, where a semitropical climate prevailed,
profitable employment for negroes was found; and hither, in
obedience to the inexorable law of demand and supply, the
system of slavery gravitated.</p>
          <p>It has been stated with great positiveness by certain writers that
the introduction of the cotton-gin, invented by Eli Whitney in
1794, by giving renewed impetus to the cultivation of cotton,
increased the demand for slave labor as a necessity for its
production and added largely to the money value of slaves. In
view of the fact that for the thirty-six years following this
invention the annual increase in the number of bales produced
was less than thirty thousand, I am not willing to accept the
statement. In 1800 the output was two hundred and ten thousand
bales, and the million-bale mark was not reached until 1830.
Meanwhile, during the forty years from 1790 to 1830, the
number of negro slaves increased from seven hundred thousand
to two millions. As the African trade ceased in 1807, it may be
inferred that conditions in the South were favorable to procreation
in this alien race. The market price of negroes had risen from fifty
to one hundred dollars, in early colonial days, to about five
hundred dollars in 1830, and they continued to become more
valuable, until by 1860 a “prime field-hand” brought from one
thousand to fifteen hundred dollars. Other causes than cotton
must be looked for to explain the rise in value. That the negro was
not essential
<pb id="wyeth80" n="80"/>
to the cultivation of this great crop has been amply demonstrated
in late years by the millions of bales produced annually in
vast areas of the South where only white labor is engaged. What
is true of cotton is equally true of rice and cane, and but for the
unfortunate presence of the blacks the Southern country would
long ago have swarmed with white laborers of the same
intelligence and thrift that have created the wealthy, prosperous,
and thickly populated Northwest.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding the fact that slavery had existed in practically
every nation of the earth since the dawn of history, and that even
in the early settlement of America white persons from Great
Britain had been sold and indentured as slaves to the colonists,
yet the vast majority of these hardy pioneers had sought the
wilderness for a greater liberty than the older civilization allowed,
and it was to be expected that from the very beginning African
slavery would meet with strong protest and formidable opposition.
Theirs was the broad and just contention that, however humanely
practised, chattel slavery was wrong; that involuntary servitude
was repugnant to the instinctive love and natural right of liberty;
and that ownership as a chattel to be leased or sold permitted the
infliction of bodily punishments and the enforced severance of the
family relation which were cruel and inhuman.</p>
          <p>As far back as 1641 Massachusetts forbade the importation of
African slaves, and Rhode Island followed her sister colony's
example in 1652; but these regulations could not then be
successfully enforced, and the traffic and slavery continued for
more than one hundred and twenty-five years. In 1688 a society of
Friends in Pennsylvania made public protest against the growing
practice of slavery, but it was
<pb id="wyeth81" n="81"/>
not until 1775 that the first abolition society was formally organized
(in Pennsylvania), with Benjamin Franklin as
president.</p>
          <p>The first state to enact emancipation was Vermont, which in 1777
freed all slaves at majority (twenty-one years). Pennsylvania
followed in 1780, fixing the age at twenty-eight; and
Massachusetts in the same year freed all slaves without regard
to age. New Hampshire in 1783, Rhode Island and Connecticut in
1784, New York in 1799, and New Jersey in 1804 enacted schemes of
gradual emancipation. In 1807 Congress absolutely forbade the
further importation of slaves into the United States.</p>
          <p>By 1820 slavery, formally recognized by the Constitution, the
compact of union, which guaranteed protection to slaves as
property, was accepted as a permanent institution in the states
then existing south of the Mason and Dixon line, although at the
North the antislavery organizations had already grown in numbers
and influence to formidable proportions. In this year slavery first
came prominently before the American people as a political
issue. The proslavery politicians, in the effort to counteract the
growing influence of the champions of emancipation, succeeded
in having Missouri admitted as a slave state. The opposition,
however, was strong enough to compel a “Compromise,” which,
while permitting slavery in Missouri, excluded it from all the rest
of the Louisiana Purchase north of a line which from the
Mississippi River followed westward the 36° 30' degree of north
latitude, which line was the southern boundary of Missouri.</p>
          <p>A period comparatively free from agitation followed the
Missouri Compromise from 1821 to 1836, when Texas, having
declared its independence of Mexico, asked to be
<pb id="wyeth82" n="82"/>
taken into the Union as a slave state. The antislavery
advocates, North and South, resisted this proposition so
successfully that the Lone Star State was not admitted until
1845. In 1854, under the leadership of Stephen A. Douglas, of
Illinois, the spokesman of Democracy, North as well as
South, the proslavery politicians made the fatal blunder of
reopening the fight for the further extension of this institution in
the territories, and, although they succeeded in repealing the
Missouri Compromise and in passing the Kansas-Nebraska bill,
which in substance left it to the bona-fide settlers to determine
by popular vote whether or not slavery should be permitted in
the states to be admitted, they sealed their own doom.</p>
          <p>It was this action which precipitated the “Kansas conflict” and
made of this territory for several years the battle-ground between
the contending forces of slavery and antislavery. In this period the
generally accepted laws of God and man which are supposed to
govern a Christian civilization were in large measure suspended,
and the so called “higher law” was substituted. It seemed a ready
transition from the enthusiast to the zealot, from the zealot to the
fanatic; and these, given as of old to the wildest exaggeration of
their own importance in the reformation of their kind, flattering
themselves into the delusion that they were ordained of God for
the accomplishment of a great and self-imposed purpose, ran
amuck in bloodshed and robbery. “Bleeding Kansas” became the
storm-center of the great controversy, around and over which
since 1820 the darkening clouds of sectionalism had been gathering;
and from this center, in ever-widening circle, spread a cyclone of
insanity which swept over North and South alike in its maddening
progress. Reason, like a lightship parted
<pb id="wyeth83" n="83"/>
from its moorings, was carried away to be lost in the stormy
sea of differing opinions. Forbearance and charity and
kindly argument as to right and wrong gave way to reckless and
passionate assertion and to the bitter speech of
prejudice, and conscience became dulled to that deplorable
degree which permitted the end to justify the means.</p>
          <p>Out of this turmoil emerged a weird, red-handed specter
in human form whose name but for his lawless deeds in Kansas
would never have crossed the boundaries of that fair State had
he not become the agent in one of the most nefarious plots
recorded in history. A group of men of intelligence, position, and
wealth aided him in the armed invasion of a peaceful and
law-abiding community. Brown's
purpose was the treasonable capture of the United States
arsenal and the appropriation of government property to an
unlawful purpose, the robbery of the houses of law-abiding
citizens, and murder. He sought to incite a widespread slave
insurrection and the consequent massacre of thousands of
helpless women and children. This wicked deed, known as the
“Harper's Ferry Raid,” made secession possible and brought on
the Civil War.</p>
          <p>The world knows that the active leader of this enterprise
was John Brown. It may not know that among those who
very substantially aided him were such men as Gerrit
Smith, George L. Stearns, Theodore Parker, Dr. S. G.
Howe, Frederick Douglass, F. B. Sanborn, Judge Thomas
Russell, T. W. Higginson, Edwin Morton, and F. G. Merriam.
Those who aided Brown practically all denied any
intention to incite a servile insurrection; yet for what other
purpose did Brown carry one thousand pikes than to arm
such slaves as could not yet use the guns to be taken by
<pb id="wyeth84" n="84"/>
force from the United States arsenal? The civilized world cried
out at the shame of it. Brown had declared it were “better that a
whole generation of men, women, and children should be wiped
out than that slavery should endure.” He also said after his
capture<ref targOrder="U" id="ref11" n="11" rend="sc" target="note11">1</ref>: “I knew the negroes would rally to my standard. If I
had only got the thing fairly started, you Virginians would have seen sights
that would have opened your eyes, and I tell you if I was free
this moment and had five hundred negroes around me I would
put these irons on Wise himself before Saturday night.” He had
said to Frederick Douglass, “When I strike, the bees will swarm.”
What more positive evidence of Brown's purpose than is set
forth in Gerrit Smith's letter of August 27, 1859, only a few weeks
before the invasion of Virginia:</p>
          <p>“It is perhaps too late to bring slavery to an end by peaceful
means. The feeling among the blacks that they must deliver
themselves gains strength with fearful rapidity. The South would
not respect her own Jefferson's prediction of servile insurrection,
and is it entirely certain that these insurrections will be put down
promptly? Will telegraphs and railroads be too swift for even the
swiftest insurrections? Remember that telegraphs and railroads
can be rendered useless in an hour. Remember, too, that many
who would be glad to face the insurgents would be busy
transporting their wives and daughters to places where they
would be safe,” etc. To this letter Sanborn adds: “He knew what
Brown's purpose was, and his last contribution of money to
Brown's camp-chest was sent about the time this letter was
written” (page 545). And what else could Dr. Howe have in mind
than an insurrection of slaves
<note id="note11" n="11" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref11">1 <hi rend="italics">Life and Letters of John Brown</hi>. By F. B. Sanborn. Page 572.</note>
<pb id="wyeth85" n="85"/>
when he wrote that he trembled at the fate which might befall
his friend in the South?</p>
          <p>Strongest of all the evidence, to my mind, is the action of many
of Brown's backers, who promptly fled beyond the borders of
their own country—the country to whose laws they owed
obedience. True, they had begun their course with an earnest
and laudable purpose, and at first by open and honorable
methods of protest and argument sought to free the slaves in the
South. Under the excitement of a passionate antagonism they
had advanced by rapid strides from enthusiasm to zeal and from
zeal to fanaticism, which in many cases blinded their perception
of right and justified in their minds even horrible and bloody
means for the accomplishment of the end they had in view.</p>
          <p>When the news was heard of the failure of Brown's nefarious
plot, Gerrit Smith retired to an insane asylum at Utica, New
York. As late as 1874 he attempted some explanation. Still later,
when Sanborn notified him of his probable utterance on the
subject, he wrote: “If you could defer your contemplated work
until after my death you would lay me under great obligations to
your kindness.”</p>
          <p>Scarcely less pitiable was the position of Dr. S. G. Howe.
Referring to a visit, shortly before the John Brown raid, to
Wade Hampton's plantation, he said he shuddered to think
of what might have happened to these people, of whose
hospitality he had been lately the recipient, as a result of
this foray into the South. Dr. Howe promptly went to
Canada. He wrote on November 4, 1859: “Rumor has
mingled my name with the events at Harper's Ferry. That
event was unforeseen and unexpected by me.” When, at
last, he appeared before the Mason committee he tried to
<pb id="wyeth86" n="86"/>
convince them that the last fifty dollars he gave went toward the
purchase of the Thompson farm for Brown.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref12" n="12" rend="sc" target="note12">1</ref></p>
          <p>Commenting on Dr. Howe's conversation in the summer of
1859 with John Brown, Mrs. Adams, Brown's daughter writes:
“It was after father had become weary and even discouraged
with begging for money and men to carry out his plan that he
made up his mind to confiscate property that the slave or his
ancestors had been compelled to earn for others—property that
he needed to subsist on. At a former time when Dr. Howe was
parting from father, he gave him a little walnut box with a fine
Smith&amp; Wesson revolver in it. I have it still.” “Now, in making
this gift, Dr. Howe fully expected Captain Brown to break the
law against carrying concealed weapons, and possibly the
commandment ‘Thou shalt not kill’ ” (Villard, pages 181-2).</p>
          <p>George L. Stearns fled to Canada, and later, according to
Sanborn, twisted the truth out of shape in his efforts to square his
conscience and escape indictment. The Reverend Theodore
Parker remained abroad, and died there. This exponent of the
Divine Law in a letter to Judge Russell, dated April, 1857,
wrote as follows:</p>
          <p>“MY DEAR JUDGE,—If John Brown falls into the
hands of the marshal from Kansas he is sure of the gallows or of
something worse. If I were in his position I should shoot dead
any man who attempted to arrest me for those alleged crimes;
then I should be tried by a Massachusetts jury and be acquitted.”
Then, with the exquisite capacity for dodging which many
developed at about this time, he added: “<hi rend="italics">P. S.</hi> I don't advise J. B.
to do this; but it is what I would do.”</p>
          <p>The high regard for morals and law which prevailed in
<note id="note12" n="12" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref12">1 <hi rend="italics">John Brown, Fifty Years After</hi>. By Oswald Garrison Villard.</note>
<pb id="wyeth87" n="87"/>
Massachusetts at this period in the minds disordered on the subject of
slavery is evident in this letter from a preacher to a judge.
Edwin Morton hastened to inform Sanborn that important
letters had been “buried under a brick walk leading to Mr.
Smith's door,” and then took refuge in Switzerland, where
at length he died.</p>
          <p>Judge Thomas Russell's activities seemed to have ceased
when he did not accept his friend's offer of “two hundred and
fifty dollars and a good big fee besides <hi rend="italics">in personal property,</hi>”
which Brown had accumulated overnight from the silver and
valuables of Colonel Washington and other citizens south of
Mason and Dixon's line. Frederick Douglass lost no time in
crossing the boundary-line between Canada and the United
States, and found a residence with the Atlantic Ocean between
him and his native land. Francis J. Merriam alone demonstrated
in a measure the courage of his convictions by venturing as far
as the Maryland side of the danger-line when the attack was
made, whence with Owen Brown (also with the wagon-train) he
ran away at an early and propitious moment and escaped over
the mountains. F. B. Sanborn, instead of following the object of
his obsession to glory and the grave in Virginia, fled to Canada.
Venturing back to the Concord Circle, when he and his friends
thought the danger had passed, he was arrested by officers of
the law and released (not by a mob—only “one hundred and
fifty men and women present”) by the Massachusetts
construction of justice and law.</p>
          <p>In the New York <hi rend="italics">Evening Post</hi>, March 15, 1878, Sanborn lays
bare some facts connected with this scheme which it would
appear he had hesitated to make public until everybody else
concerned was dead.</p>
          <p>He writes: “My own first knowledge of the plans of John
<pb id="wyeth88" n="88"/>
Brown for invading the South and forcibly emancipating
slaves, the same plans he afterward attempted to execute in
Virginia, was obtained from Brown in Gerrit Smith's house at
Peterboro, February 22, 1858, and in the presence of Mr. Smith
himself, with whom I discussed them fully on that day, the
following day, and again on the 24th of May, 1858, at the Revere
House in Boston. We two—Mr. Smith then sixty-one years old,
and myself a little turned twenty-six—on the 23d of February,
1858, at about the hour of sunset, did deliberately and earnestly
engage with each other that we would stand by and support
John Brown in his undertaking. Up to the day of John Brown's
capture at Harper's Ferry in October, 1859, that engagement was
faithfully kept.</p>
          <p>“Neither of us, probably, was ever fully or coolly convinced of
the wisdom of his scheme. At no time during the nineteen months
between February 19, 1858, and October 18, 1859, did Mr. Smith cease
to aid the plan. When he wrote me that ‘as things now stand it
seems to me it would be madness to attempt to execute it’ (May
7, 1858) he had just given money to aid it, and within a month
afterward he gave money again. He allowed Brown to take
the responsibility of failure. Such was then my opinion, and when
Smith met at his own room in the Revere House, Boston, May
24, 1858, with Theodore Parker, Dr. Howe, George L. Stearns, and
myself, to decide whether Brown should be allowed to go on at
that time, Mr. Smith was an active participant in the
discussion. It resulted in sending Brown back to Kansas until
such a time as he could more safely undertake his Southern
campaign. It was understood that Brown should go to Kansas for
the summer and autumn of 1858, but should be aided to begin
his Southern campaign
<pb id="wyeth89" n="89"/>
in the winter and spring of 1859, when two or three thousand
dollars should be raised for him by Messrs. Stearns,
Smith, and the rest of us. In accordance with this agreement, in the
following spring, April, 1859, Brown presented himself at
Peterboro after delivering his twelve forcibly emancipated
Missouri slaves in Canada and received from Mr. Smith there a
subscription of four hundred dollars. With some of this money
Brown paid in part for his pikes at Collinsville, Connecticut, to
arm the slaves of Virginia.</p>
          <p>“Again, in August, 1859, when Brown wrote me from
Chambersburg that he still wanted three hundred dollars with
which to begin the attack, I sent his letter to Smith, who at once
sent Brown a draft for a hundred dollars on the State Bank of
Albany. I am certain that this was sent with a full general
knowledge of what Brown would do with it. How, then, could
Mr. Smith, G. L. Stearns, and Dr. Howe deny, as they all did,
that they knew of the Harper's Ferry attack—simply because
they did not know, or guess, that Brown meant to begin it? We
expected he would go farther west, into a region less accessible,
where his movements might escape notice for weeks except as
the alleged acts of some marauding party. In this respect, and in
this alone, as far as I know, he changed his plans of 1858, which
he fully explained. Being called to testify at Washington, the two
last named (as they both<ref targOrder="U" id="ref13" n="13" rend="sc" target="note13">1</ref> told me) found the questions of the
Senate committee so unskilfully framed that they could without
literal falsehood answer as they did. I do not say they were
justified in this, but such was their own opinion. Probably Gerrit
Smith also felt justified at the time in making public statements
which told a part of the truth, but not the whole. He was not a

witness at Washington, being an asylum patient at Utica; but in
1860 and again in 1867 he published papers which, had I seen them
in manuscript, as I did that of 1874, I should have protested
against their publication.”</p>
          <p>The Southern people were fully alive to the significance of this
attempt by John Brown and his sympathizers in the North to arm
and liberate the slaves. Had they succeeded the enterprise would
have led to a wide-spread servile insurrection. Of several such
uprisings in Virginia the details of one shall be here given. The
leader of this insurrection was a negro, Nat Turner, thirty-one
years old, who had been kindly reared in the Turner family of
Southampton County, Virginia.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref14" n="14" rend="sc" target="note14">1</ref> He had been taught to read; he
professed religion, became a preacher of the Baptist sect, and
was intrusted as overseer of the work and in the management of
the other slaves on the plantation. Of the kindly nature of the
treatment to which he was accustomed it is known that upon his
feigning sickness on the Sunday of the outbreak the wife of his
owner carried
<note id="note14" n="14" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref14">1 Professor William S. Drewry, <ref targOrder="U" id="ref15" n="15" rend="sc" target="note15">2</ref> after a most exhaustive study of the matter,
shows that undoubtedly this fanatical negro, of more than ordinary intelligence, had
been informed of the uprising of the slaves in Haiti and San Domingo, and had
persuaded himself that the success of that insurrection could be repeated in the
Southern states. In 1793 a crowd of refugees escaping from Haiti arrived in
Baltimore, bringing with them about six hundred slaves. Some of these refugees
settled in Southampton County. In 1800 and 1801, and in succeeding years, rebellious slaves in various sections of Virginia confessed that they had been 
inspired by the hope that the uprising in Haiti might be successfully repeated. Of 
these earlier outbreaks, the one in Henrico County in 1800 was the most formidable. Moreover,
the militant abolitionists of the North were active in encouraging the negroes to
insurrection. Benjamin Lundy, of Baltimore, editor of the <hi rend="italics">Genius of Universal
Emancipation</hi>, published and circulated in 1828 a detailed history of these various
insurrections, and in 1830 the celebrated “Walker Pamphlet” was secretly distributed,
urging the negroes to remember Haiti, “the glory of the blacks and the terror of
tyrants.”</note>

to his cabin some specially prepared articles of food for the
supposed invalid, to whom the family were attached. As Mrs.
Turner slept that night with her infant at her side, she and her
husband were slain with axes, and the baby's
brains were dashed out against the brickwork of the fireplace.
Two other children, boys of about twelve and fourteen, were fatally
struck on the head as they slept.
Having wiped out this family at dead of night, Nat and
his seven negro accomplices armed themselves with the guns belonging to
his dead master, mounted themselves on horseback and rode to
the home of Mr. Francis, a bachelor brother of the woman they
had just slain, called him under the pretext that there was a
message for him, and, as he opened the door, killed him. Mrs.
Reese and her son William were the next victims of the ax, and
Mr. James Barmer, being hit on the head, fell limp and
unconscious and was left for dead, but ultimately survived—a
life-long cripple. Three miles away to the farm of Mrs. Elizabeth
Turner they rode quickly, and she, Mrs. Newsom, and a Mr.
Peebles were murdered. The company of negroes now numbered
fifteen, nine of whom were mounted. Mr. Henry Bryant, his wife
and child, and his wife's mother died next, and these were
followed in short order by Mrs. Whitehead and her son Richard,
three daughters, an infant, and the grandmother. One of the
daughters, fleeing to escape, was pursued by Nat Turner,
who beat her brains out with a piece of fence-rail. Harriet,
another daughter, successfully concealed herself beneath the
mattress in a box-bed, the only survivor of this family. About
sunrise, as they were proceeding to the next farm, they met Mr.
Doyle in the road and killed him. Mrs. Williams and her
little child and two small boys were then butchered. Another
<pb id="wyeth92" n="92"/>
Mr. Doyle, Mr. John Barrow, George Vaughan, Mrs. Levi
Waller and her child, Martha Waller, Lucinda Jones and eight
other school-children, Mr. Williams and wife, Miles and Henry
Johnson, Mrs. Warrell and child, Mrs. Vaughan, her son and
niece, Mrs. John K. Williams and child, Mrs. Jacob Williams
and three children, and Mrs. Edwin Drewry were among the
other victims of this horrible slaughter. Drewry, the historian,
says this is not the complete list.</p>
          <p>Only a few of these victims were shot. The negroes were not
accustomed to the use of firearms. Axes and hatchets and
grubbing-hoes were preferred as weapons. The pikes John
Brown had made, which philanthropists like Stearns, Gerrit Smith,
Sanborn, and their associates had paid for, were well suited to the
purpose these conspirators had in mind. In the course of the trials
which ensued—for none of these murderers was lynched—it
was shown that the razor was used to despatch only one person.
The head of a small boy, who ran up to one of the negroes he
knew and asked him to take him up behind him for a ride, was
completely severed from the body by a single stroke of an ax.
Some few armed themselves with scythe-blades; all robbed the
dead; and finally nearly the whole of this murderous gang
became drunk.</p>
          <p>They had gone about their bloody work in cunning fashion. The
region was not thickly settled. The farm-houses were so far apart
that the screams of the frightened and dying could not be heard
at the place the negroes were next to visit; then, having killed
every one, they rode hurriedly to the next house. In this way the
bloody work went on all through the night, and it was only after
broad daylight that some one escaped and began to spread the
alarm; so that the remaining women and children fled to the
woods
<pb id="wyeth93" n="93"/>
to hide themselves, and the men and lads began to gather to
put down the desperate rabble. It so happened that a neighbor
escaping galloped along the road shouting to each household as
he passed the great danger of remaining indoors.</p>
          <p>In one of these homes was then living Mrs. John Thomas, and
as Nat Turner's band was seen approaching she and her
fifteen-year-old son narrowly escaped the common doom by running,
closely pursued, into the dense forest, where they were safely
concealed. By this narrow margin was saved the life of the one
human being who, in my opinion, defeated the Southern
Confederacy and saved the cause of the Union in the crisis of
the Civil War on the field of Chickamauga, where the
independence of the South was won and thrown away. That
fifteen-year-old boy was George H. Thomas, who lived to be the
“Rock of Chickamauga.”</p>
          <p>By noon the white men of the country had rallied under arms,
and soon killed, captured, or dispersed the negroes. The
ringleaders and some fifteen others were tried, convicted, and
hanged. Thus ended the sickening slaughter. Haiti and San
Domingo had been imitated.</p>
          <p>John Brown treasonably and murderously led an armed
invasion of this same state to liberate and arm the slaves and
subject the helpless women and children to a repetition of these
scenes of horror on a more extended scale. The heartless
fanaticism of the antislavery agitation is indicated in Sanborn's
<hi rend="italics">Life and Letters of John Brown</hi>. Upon receipt of the news of
this massacre at the home of Brown in Ohio, Squire Hudson
exclaimed: “Thank God! I am glad of it. The slaves have risen
down in Virginia!”</p>

SOME FACTS ABOUT JOHN BROWN NOT GENERALLY KNOWN</head>
          <p>HAVING failed at every one of a half-dozen different vocations
to make a living for his family and himself, a rolling stone so
mossless that at the age of fifty-five he was absolutely
bankrupt in fortune, and no less so in honorable reputation,
John Brown turned up in Kansas in October, 1855, in the rôle of a
professional Free-soil agitator in the employ of Mr. Amos A.
Lawrence, Secretary and Treasurer of the New England
Emigrant Aid Society, of which Mr. Eli Thayer, of Massachusetts,
was the president. It is safe to say that had his antecedents been
known to these honorable gentlemen, they would not have given
him employment or furnished him the money to pay his 
traveling-expenses to the territory (without which he could not
have made the trip), for as soon as his misconduct there revealed
his true character—and this was soon in evidence—they repudiated
him and publicly denounced him as unworthy of confidence and
respect and an injury to the free-state cause.</p>
          <p>Disappointed and embittered at the age of fifty-five, “fit for
treason,” looking for “spoils,” and ready with whatever “stratagem”
was required to secure them, he, with scant regard for the laws of
God and man, began the mad career of crime which in the course
of four years of robbery, bloodshed, and murder, carried into
untimely graves three of his sons and one son-in-law and ended on
December 2, 1859, in his legal execution at Charlestown, Virginia.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth95" n="95"/>
          <p>Born in 1800 of poor and respectable New England parents, who
moved in 1805 to Hudson, Ohio, where there were scant
opportunities for schooling, John Brown learned to read and
write, and later in life acquired a working knowledge of
surveying. Here he worked at tanning and surveying, then moved
to Pennsylvania, thence to Portage County, Ohio, where he
speculated in lands which “did much to injure his standing and
business credit,”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref16" n="16" rend="sc" target="note16">1</ref> tried public contracting, at which he failed, and
went into bankruptcy.</p>
          <p>“On July 11, 1836, he was sued on a debt of six thousand dollars,
and his surety, a Mr. Oviatt, was forced to pay the debt. Brown
made a bond to Oviatt, to secure him on a piece of land he had
traded for, but without recording the deed. When the deed was
finally recorded, without notice to Oviatt, to whom he was under
every obligation of honor, Brown mortgaged the land to two other
men.” Mr. Villard says: “This transaction bears an unpleasant
aspect.” In 1837 he moved back to Hudson, Ohio, and went into the
business of breeding race-horses, and changed in 1838 to the cattle
and sheep raising business. In one of a number of suits brought
against him about this time, which was decided against him, he
resisted the process of the law. With his three sons, John, Jason,
and Owen, he barricaded himself in a house on the land in
question and held unlawful possession until the sheriff with a
posse compelled them to vacate and placed them in the jail at
Akron, Ohio.</p>
          <p>“On June 15, 1839, John Brown received from the New England
Woolen Company at Rockville, Connecticut, the sum of twenty-eight
hundred dollars, through its agent, George Kellogg, for the
purchase of wool. This money he
<note id="note16" n="16" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref16">1 <hi rend="italics">John Brown, Fifty Years After</hi>. By Oswald Garrison Villard. The most
reliable history of this subject yet printed.</note>
<pb id="wyeth96" n="96"/>
purloined for his own benefit, and was never able to redeem.
Fortunately for him, and very probably convinced that their
chance of securing the return of all or a part of this money was
better with the defaulter at large than in the penitentiary, the
company exercised leniency toward him, in return for which he
promised, in 1842, after passing through bankruptcy, to pay the
money from time to time with interest, as Divine Providence
might enable him to do.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref17" n="17" rend="sc" target="note17">1</ref> Although he lived twenty years after
this transaction and robbed much, none of the stolen money was
ever repaid.</p>
          <p>Villard states: “On the records of the Portage County Court of
Common Pleas at Ravenna, Ohio, are no less than twenty-one
lawsuits in which John Brown figured as defendant. Thirteen
were actions brought to recover money loaned to Brown, singly or
in company with others. The remaining suits were mostly for
claims for wages or payments due or for nonfulfilment of
contracts. Judgment against Brown was once entered by his
consent for a nominal sum. In ten other cases he was successfully
sued, and judgments were obtained against him. A serious
litigation was an action brought by the Bank of Worcester to
recover on a bill of exchange drawn by Brown and others on the
Leather Manufacturers Bank of New York, and repudiated by
that institution on the ground that Brown and his associates had no
money in the bank. When judgment against Brown and his
associates was rendered it was for nine hundred and seventeen
dollars and sixty-five cents.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref17b" n="17" rend="sc" target="note17">1</ref> Mr. Sanborn says <ref targOrder="U" id="ref18" n="18" rend="sc" target="note18">2</ref> that when he
questioned Mr. Simon Perkins, of Akron, about Brown's wool-growing
and wool-dealing, he replied, “The less you say about
them the better.” In 1841 Brown hired out as a sheep-tender at
Richfield, Ohio;

<pb id="wyeth97" n="97"/>
went back to tanning in 1842; and gave it up once more in 1844.
In 1846 he was settled in Springfield, Massachusetts,
as a wool-dealer, in association with the Mr. Perkins mentioned
above, and in 1849 made a trip to England in connection with this
business, failed, and caused his partner a loss of forty thousand
dollars. Suit was brought against Perkins&amp; Brown for sixty
thousand dollars for breach of contract. The case was tried in
1853. According to Villard, it was settled out of court, “counsel
deeming it wiser to compromise than to face a jury.” From this
time to his death, in 1859, he had no business and no visible means
of support except “gifts made to maintain him as a guerrilla
leader in Kansas or as a prospective invader of Virginia.”</p>
          <p>Five of Brown's sons, John, Jason, Owen, Frederick, and
Salmon, chips of the old block, able and willing to commit murder
and rob defenseless settlers in a new country, squatted on lands
in Kansas in the spring of 1855, and here their father joined them in
October, 1855.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref19" n="19" rend="sc" target="note19">1</ref> The excitement over the struggle between the
proslavery and the free-state partisans in the territory was
already great. In all probability the most important factor in
finally winning Kansas as a free state was the New England
Emigrant Aid Company, chartered in February, 1855. The head
and prime mover in this far-sighted measure was Mr. Eli Thayer,
who represented Worcester in the Massachusetts legislature and
later was a member of Congress. Of this company Mr. Amos A.
Lawrence, for whom I believe the city in
<note id="note19" n="19" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref19">1 As an index of the character for thrift and industry of these sons of Brown it
may be stated that John, Jr., was thirty-four years old; Jason, thirty-two;
Owen, thirty-one; Frederick, twenty-five; and Salmon nineteen; and all they
had to show for their lives to this time were eleven cattle and three horses.
They were worthy sons of their sire, and went to Kansas ripe for the era of
plunder and murder in which they moved with much success.</note>
<pb id="wyeth98" n="98"/>
Kansas is named, was the treasurer, and it was he who paid
Brown to go to Kansas to take part in any activities which
might require the use of Sharp's rifles, or “Beecher Bibles,” as
the markings on the boxes specified. A man of blameless life,
whose reputation for cautious speech and perfect truthfulness is
unquestioned, Mr. Lawrence said before the Massachusetts
Historical Society in May, 1884:
“When Eli Thayer obtained the charter for the company, Dr.
Robinson was chosen territorial agent. It was to support the
party of law and order and make Kansas a free state by
bona-fide settlement. Charles Robinson had the requisite qualities to
direct this movement. He was cool, judicious, entirely devoid of
fear, and in every respect worthy of the confidence reposed in
him by the society and the settlers. He was imprisoned, his house
burned, his life was threatened, yet he never bore arms or
omitted to do what he thought to be his duty. He sternly held the
people to their loyalty to the government against the arguments
and the example of the ‘higher-law’ men, who were always
armed, and who were bent on bringing on a border war.</p>
          <p>“But what shall we say of John Brown? His course was the
opposite of Robinson's. He was always armed, he was always
disloyal to the United States government, and to all government
except what he called the ‘higher-law.’ He was always ready to
shed blood, and he always did shed it without remorse.</p>
          <p>“It fell to me to give John Brown his first letter to Kansas,
introducing him to Governor Robinson and authorizing him to
employ Brown and to draw on me for his compensation, if he
could make him useful in the work of the Emigrant Aid
Company. But very soon Governor Robinson wrote that he
would not employ him, as he was unreliable and
<pb id="wyeth99" n="99"/>
would as soon shoot a United States officer as a border ruffian.
When he was a prisoner at Harper's Ferry I wrote to Governor Wise,
advising his release on the ground that he was a monomaniac
and that his execution would make him a martyr. John Brown
had no enemies in New England, but many friends and admirers.
He was constantly receiving money from them. They little knew
what use he was making of it, for he deceived everybody. If he
had succeeded in his design at Harper's Ferry of exciting a servile
insurrection the country would have stood aghast with horror.”</p>
          <p>Eli Thayer says in the <hi rend="italics">Kansas Crusade</hi> (page 189): “John
Brown induced Mr. Amos A. Lawrence to furnish him money to
pay his expenses to Kansas. It was easy for any one who
professed a desire to aid in the work of making Kansas a free
state to secure his entire confidence. But his confidence was
sometimes abused, notably in the case of John Brown. Mr.
Lawrence furnished him the money which enabled him to pay his
fare to Kansas, late in 1855. Subsequently he contributed for his
use in the territory, and for traveling outside of it, many important
sums. He also furnished about one thousand dollars to pay a
mortgage on Brown's home at North Elba, New York. For one
or two years he regarded Brown as an honest man and an aid to
the free-state cause. At length, however, he learned how his
confidence had been abused, and from that time no one ever
denounced the Pottawatomie assassin in more vigorous English.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Thayer says further: “The Republican convention which
nominated Lincoln for the presidency in 1860 named John Brown
as one of the greatest of criminals.</p>
          <p>“When Brown made his invasion of Virginia, and during
<pb id="wyeth100" n="100"/>
his trial, conviction, and execution, I was a member of Congress,
and had the means of knowing the opinions of members.
There was not one of that body who considered his punishment
as unjust. A few, however, were of the opinion that it would
have been better to have put him in a mad-house for life. This
would have prevented the grotesque efforts of a few of his
sympathizers and supporters to parade him before the country
as a martyr.</p>
          <p>“John Brown arrived in Kansas nearly two years after the
conflict there against slavery began. He was a great injury to
the free-state cause and to the free-state settlers. He said, ‘I
have not come to make Kansas free, but to get a shot at the
South.’ He wished to begin a civil war. He never had any
property in Kansas which might be subject to retaliation and
reprisal for his crimes. Skulking about under various disguises
and pretenses, he left the free-state settlers to suffer further
numerous outrages. At length they compelled him to leave the
territory.</p>
          <p>“To the above should be added the robbing of slaves in
Kansas, the stealing of horses, and about four thousand dollars'
worth of oxen, mules, wagons, harness, and such valuables and
property as he could find. He was a merciless and most
unscrupulous jayhawker. . . . After his midnight murders the
people about Ossawatomie assembled to express their
indignation. Here on most friendly terms were the free-state
men and the slave-state men. In the overshadowing gloom of
such a terrible crime all partisan issues were forgotten. John
Brown, with characteristic lying, denied that he was present at
this massacre or that he had had anything to do with it. No fact
in history is now better established than that he was the
father of the crime and leader of the assassins.”</p>
          <pb id="wyeth101" n="101"/>
          <p>Mr. Thayer says further: “He came to me in Worcester to
solicit a contribution of arms for the defense of some Kansas
settlements which he said he knew were to be attacked. Not
doubting his word, I gave him all the arms I had, in value about
five hundred dollars. Under the same false pretense he received
another contribution from Ethan Allan&amp; Co., manufacturers in
this city. These arms were never taken to Kansas, but were
captured at Harper's Ferry. Under the same false pretense of
assisting the settlers, he procured funds from several New York
merchants.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Thayer says that after the raid in Missouri, in December,
1858, when William Cruse was murdered, Brown stole about four
thousand dollars' worth of property and valuables, along with
eleven slaves; and then, in order to make them useful for the
purpose of securing funds, he took from December to April to
get his liberated slaves to Canada. He sent agents in all
directions to solicit aid.</p>
          <p>In an editorial comment on Mr. Thayer's statement, the New
York <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi> of November 27, 1887, says: “Mr. Thayer speaks from
intimate personal knowledge; describes John Brown as a felon
or a fiend, a robber, murderer, and
traitor, and gives instances of his conduct to justify the truth of
his description. Abraham Lincoln in his famous speech at
Cooper Institute agrees with Mr. Thayer in ranging John Brown
with the monomaniacs who resort to assassination for the cure
of what seem to them social or political evils. Orsini's attempt on
Louis Napoleon and John Brown's attempt at Harper's Ferry
were in their philosophy the same. These words expressed a
sentiment so general in the North that the first Republican
leader felt it necessary to speak so emphatically. At that time the
<pb id="wyeth102" n="102"/>
abolitionists, always a small and detested body of fanatics, had
reached the firm conclusion that their only hope lay
in the dissolution of the Union. They were out and out
disunionists, trampling on the Constitution at their meeting as
‘a league with death and a covenant with hell,’ and declaring that
‘there was no issue of any importance except the dissolution of
the Union.’ They were therefore quick to make John Brown a
martyr to their cause. These are doubtless the facts of history,
and Mr. Thayer does the public a service in calling attention to
them at a time when anarchists are attempting to justify their
savagery by pointing to John Brown as a great moral hero
whose memory is revered by his countrymen and honored by
the whole world.”</p>
          <p>I have quoted these men of high character and unquestioned
veracity because they were men of strong conviction, who
believed that Kansas was a battle-ground where under the law a
stand-up fight might be made in the open, and with guns if need
be, between the opposing forces of slavery and antislavery.
They were wise enough to see that carrying hardy farmers and
planting them as tillers of the free soil was the one legitimate
and logical way of doing what Thomas Jefferson of Virginia
tried to do—namely, prevent the extension of slavery into the
territories. These men were in personal contact with John
Brown, and they knew him. Eli Thayer was of such
prominence in his day that, according to the New York
<hi rend="italics">Independent</hi> of December 16, 1875, “Charles Sumner said in
January, 1857: ‘The state of Kansas should be named
“Thayer.” ’ ”</p>
          <p>In 1910, at a meeting of the veterans of '56 in Kansas,
Colonel O. E. Learnard, of Lawrence, made an address
from which what follows is taken. While I felt sure, from
the
<pb id="wyeth103" n="103"/>
tone of the protest, that its author could say nothing that was of
doubtful truthfulness, I wrote to a brother physician in Lawrence,
Dr. George W. Jones, making proper inquiry. He assured me that
“Mr. Warren, a former State Senator; Mr. Brooks, once member
of the legislature; Mr. Kennedy and Captain Huddleston and
Colonel Learnard were in every respect among the foremost
citizens of the state. Of Colonel O. E. Learnard, the noblest
Roman of them all, one cannot say too much in praise of his noted
integrity. A man who has had about all the honors the community
could give him is now in retirement, universally respected. Colonel
Learnard was an abolitionist Republican.”</p>
          <p>In the address entitled “John Brown's Career in Kansas,”
Colonel Learnard said:</p>
          <p>“At the meeting of this association two years ago I was to have
made some remarks in relation to John Brown and his career in
Kansas, but was unable to do so on account of ill health. Since
then I have given the matter very little thought until the recent
much-heralded event at Ossawatomie,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref20" n="20" rend="sc" target="note20">1</ref> by and through which
was revealed a stated purpose to pervert the facts in the interest of
a mawkish sentimentality that deliberately ignores and derides
well-authenticated history.</p>
          <p>“The late Joel K. Goodwin, in a letter to Governor Robinson,
said: ‘The sickening adulation and offensive slobbers over some of
the imaginary saviors of Kansas to freedom which have passed
the lips of ministers and laymen, lecturers and politicians, editors
and essayists during the past thirty years has added little to the
truthfulness of history or the healthy education of the young men
and young women of the state.’ Under the circumstances it seems
<note id="note20" n="20" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref20">1 In reference to the address of ex-President Roosevelt.</note>
<pb id="wyeth104" n="104"/>
pertinent that at least some of the salient facts of the matter
should be stated, and I do this from no motive or wish other
than a vindication of the truth of history. It is conceded at the
outset that most of the early settlers, those who were cognizant
of the facts, most of whom were participants in these events,
did not, and do not, share the sentiments which have recently
been expressed as to the character and achievements of John
Brown. I have always thought that some of us who survive
think they <hi rend="italics">know</hi> better. Of those who have passed away I
readily recall General Thomas Ewing, Marcus J. Parrott,
Colonel W. Y. Roberts, Colonel Campbell, Colonel C. K.
Holliday, General R. B. Mitchell, Guilford Dudley, George A.
Crawford, Senator Alex. McDonald, Colonel Blood, C. W.
Babcock, Lyman Allen, B. W. Woodward, Judge Emery,
General G. Deitsler, and Joel K. Goodwin—indeed, the list
might be extended almost indefinitely.</p>
          <p>“Those present here to-day, Mr. Morrow, Paul R. Brooks,
Scott Kennedy, your president, Captain Huddleston, and others
who were active participants in nearly all the stirring events of
'56, of my personal knowledge—these gentlemen can speak
for themselves. The claims made for John Brown are that he
was the savior of Kansas to freedom, that he inspired the
organized armed resistance to border-ruffian aggression, and
was its master spirit and guide. Each and all of these claims on
his behalf I unhesitatingly and absolutely repudiate and deny.</p>
          <p>“The first organized and armed resistance was in what is
designated as the ‘Wakarusa War.’ Governor Robinson was
chief in command, and General Lane second. John Brown had
but recently arrived, and on the strength of the representation
that he had fought in the battle of Plattsburg
<pb id="wyeth105" n="105"/>
in the War of 1812—a representation, by the way, that was
absolutely false—he was given the nominal command of a
small squad of men.</p>
          <p>“During that brief and bloodless campaign John Brown spent
most of his time in faultfinding and growling about the camp,
particularly of the Topeka company; so that they ordered him to
get out and stay out. This statement is made on the authority of
the late Guilford Dudley, for a great many years a prominent and
well-known resident of Topeka, who was a member of the
Topeka company. John Speer, in his <hi rend="italics">Life of General Lane</hi>,
referring to the treaty that closed the ‘Wakarusa War,’ says: ‘The
conflict was remarkable for the harmony among the free-state
leaders. I heard of no disagreement except Brown, who
was bitter against any settlement.’</p>
          <p>“And this same habit of growling and faultfinding characterized
all his later relation to the free-state movement and its leaders.
During the spring and summer of 1856 John Brown was only
occasionally about Lawrence, and only for brief periods, and at
no time did he have a command here. He was here on the 14th
of September. I saw him a little after noon as twenty-five of us
mounted men started to locate the Missourians, about whom
all sorts of rumors were afloat. I saw no more of him that day,
and I know of no one who did. The only free-state forces
employed that day other than our twenty-five horsemen, who
occupied the outpost southeast of town until the troops came,
was a small company under the command of Captain Joseph
Cracklin, stationed out in Earl's addition, and some members of
the Cabot guards, and other citizens in the stone fort on the hill. I
saw Brown at Rock Creek camp and one or two other times
during the summer. When Lane proposed
<pb id="wyeth106" n="106"/>
to me to make the demonstration on Leavenworth
that summer he coupled with it the suggestion that Brown
accompany us. I replied that I was willing to make the
trip, but that Brown could not go with us; and, of course, he did
not.</p>
          <p>“Most of his operations were in the border counties of Kansas
and Missouri—forays, night alarms, and frightening peaceful
citizens. Generally his raids were fruitful of plunder. A proslavery
man, or even a free-state man who did not accord with his views
and methods, had no rights of person or property that Brown
respected. This condition continued long after the free-state issue
was settled and the territorial legislature was in the hands of the
free-state men, as well as the administration of local affairs in the
border counties. Indeed, a condition of disquiet and apprehension
prevailed to a greater or less extent in the border counties until
Brown left Kansas for good.</p>
          <p>“His achievements for the most part were of the order of that
noted by Professor Spring, as follows: ‘At St. Bernard, five miles
from camp, a successful proslavery trader had a miscellaneous
store, filled with dry-goods, clothing, drugs, groceries, firearms,
hardware, boots and shoes. A necessitous company of guerrillas
could scarcely be expected to neglect so favorable an opportunity
to supply their wants at the expense of a Southerner. Certainly
the company camped on Middle Creek did nothing of the kind.
About nightfall, June 3d, such is the drift of the testimony before
the Strickler Commission, “part of a company commanded by one
John Brown, armed with Sharp's rifles, pistols, bowie-knives, and
other deadly weapons, came upon the premises and attacked and
rushed into the said store”—a sudden condition of affairs so
warlike that the employees
<pb id="wyeth107" n="107"/>
were deterred, threatened, and overpowered by the desperadoes,
who demanded a surrender of the goods and chattels,
threatening immediate death and destruction should the slightest
opposition be offered. Finding the prize richer than they had
anticipated and their appliances for transportation inadequate, the
gang returned in the morning and resumed operations. They
evidently left nothing to be desired in point of thoroughness.<corr>’</corr> ”</p>
          <lb/>
          <p>Redpath, in his <hi rend="italics">Life of John Brown</hi>, says: “Brown then lay
down by our side and told us of the wars and trials he had
passed through; that he had settled in Kansas with a large family,
having with him six full-grown sons; that he had taken a claim in
Lykens County, Kansas, and was attending peacefully to the
duties of husbandry when the hordes of wild men came over
from Missouri and took possession of all the ballot-boxes,
destroyed his corn, stole his horses, and shot down his cattle,
sheep, and hogs, and repeatedly threatened to shoot, hang, or
burn him.” Commenting upon this, Dr. George W. Brown, who
has written some of the most accurate of Kansas history, and
who lived a great part of it, says: “Need we write, even at this
distance in time from those occurrences in Kansas history, that
probably there was not one word of truth in all that statement?
Old John Brown had participated in no wars; he never settled in
Kansas with his family, hence did not have any six sons with him
in that family; he never entered any claim in Lykens County,
Kansas, nor anywhere else; he did not attend to the duties of
husbandry; he was not in the territory until six months after the
Missouri usurpation of the ballot-boxes. The only horses he ever
owned, save the one he drove into the territory, were stolen,
and the same is true of
<pb id="wyeth108" n="108"/>
his blooded stock, his sheep, and his hogs, if he had any.”</p>
          <p>The late General J. K. Hudson, for many years editor of the
Topeka <hi rend="italics">Capital</hi>, and one of the foremost writers of the West,
said in the course of an editorial in the Topeka <hi rend="italics">Capital</hi>: “There
is not written in the annals of Kansas a single incident that
reflects credit upon the intelligence of John Brown, his industry,
his integrity, or reveals a single admirable quality of heart or
mind. Kansas has been wont to veneer the character of John
Brown with excessive praise. It has habitually spread upon his
memory the spittle of effulgent adulation. Isn't it about time to
take the measure of his true value as a citizen? Isn't it about time
to admit the truth, which is that he was a loafer, a brawler, a
disturber who did nothing to his own credit and who scattered
misery with the hand of a sower?”</p>
          <p>As to the alleged “battle of Ossawatomie,” August 30, 1856,
John Brown, in a letter to his wife recently published, stated that
he had had a hard fight with the Missourians, whom he had
defeated, their killed being estimated at from seventy to eighty
men. Dr. Updegraft, in his speech at the dedication of the John
Brown monument, fixed the number of killed at from thirty to
forty and the wounded from seventy-five to one hundred. The
well-authenticated facts are that not one of the Missourians was
killed, and only three were wounded by gun-shots.</p>
          <p>Judge Robinson, for years a prominent citizen of Paola, who
wrote the history of Miami County, verifies this statement, and
adds:</p>
          <p>“When I came to the battle of Ossawatomie, wishing to be
historically correct, I spent a good deal of time investigating the
subject; and, while my sympathies are and always
<pb id="wyeth109" n="109"/>
have been with the defenders of Ossawatomie, and I should
have been glad to have had the Missourians routed or captured,
sentiment cannot be used in making history—facts are required.”</p>
          <p>Colonel William Higgins, formerly secretary of state for
Kansas, and at present postmaster and post commander of the
G. A. R. at Bartlesville, Oklahoma, then a boy who was present
on the occasion as a teamster in the Read, or proslavery,
command, says: “Two of the gunners were wounded, and one
man with a bad shot in his left arm. The two wounded gunners
were conveyed back to Missouri in a wagon, while the other
wounded man was able to ride his horse. This covers the total
loss and damage sustained by the border ruffians, while but two
of the free-state men were killed, and they on the picket-line in
the morning.”</p>
          <p>These were Fred Brown and George Partridge, the only
authenticated victims of the engagement. Mr. Higgins adds:
“While the fires were still burning the roll was called, and every
man that marched to Ossawatomie was accounted for; not one
killed or missing.”</p>
          <p>Captain J. M. Anthony, brother of Colonel D. R. Anthony, a
resident of Ossawatomie at the time, in a letter to the
Leavenworth <hi rend="italics">Times</hi> recounting the incidents of the occasion,
said: “A few shots were exchanged. When pressed by the enemy
there was no orderly retreat, but a general skedaddle, every man
for himself—John Brown with the rest.” He adds: “I went down
to the barnyard to milk the cow, having had nothing to eat since
breakfast, and while milking saw Brown advancing up the ravine.
When about twenty-five feet from me he stopped and called out:
‘Hello! Is that you?’ I replied that it assuredly
<pb id="wyeth110" n="110"/>
was. He then asked me about the day's engagement, seemingly
entirely ignorant of the result, and, like Dr. Updegraft and
everybody else, thought the whole community had been killed.”</p>
          <p>As an example of the reliability of any statement emanating
from John Brown or any member of his family the following
extract is taken from a letter of Brown's printed in Sanborn's
book and dated Lawrence, Kansas Territory, September 7, 1856:</p>
          <p>“On the morning of the 30th of August an attack was made by
the ruffians on Ossawatomie, numbering some four hundred. At
this time I was about three miles off, where I had some fourteen
or fifteen men. These I collected with some twelve or fifteen
men, and in about three-quarters of an hour I attacked them from
a wood with thick undergrowth. With this force we threw them
into confusion for about fifteen or twenty minutes, during which
time we killed or wounded from seventy to eighty of the enemy,
as they say. Four or five free-state men were butchered during
the day in all. I was struck by a partly spent grape, canister, or
rifle shot which bruised me some but did not injure me seriously.
‘Hitherto the Lord has helped me,’ notwithstanding my
afflictions.”</p>
          <p>The simple facts above given are from sources no sane person
will question, and this distortion of truth by John Brown, which his
biographers use as a text for a sermon on one of his greatest and
most heroic battles for free Kansas, demonstrates the force of
the maxim that there is but “a step from the sublime to the
ridiculous,” which is still further emphasized when we reflect that
the people of Kansas have been deceived into erecting a
monument on this battle-field, on one side of which is blazoned the
“Heroism of
<pb id="wyeth111" n="111"/>
Captain John Brown, who commanded at the Battle of
Ossawatomie August 30, 1856; who died and conquered
American Slavery at Charlestown, Va., December 2, 1859.”</p>
          <p>It may be illuminating to quote from a letter from Mr. Richard
Mendenhall, a Quaker (Sanborn, page 326): “I next met John
Brown again on the evening before the battle of Ossawatomie.
He with a number of others was driving a herd of cattle which
they had taken from proslavery men. He rode out of the
company to speak to me when I playfully asked him where he
got those cattle. He replied with a characteristic shake of the
head that ‘they were good free-state cattle now.’ ”</p>
          <p>Governor Charles Robinson, in his <hi rend="italics">Kansas Conflict</hi>, says (page
330): “The only battles in which Brown was engaged were at
Black Jack and Ossawatomie. At the first Captain
Shore had nineteen men and Brown nine. Shore with his men
attacked Pate from the open prairie and drove him into the
ravine, while Brown took to the ravine at once and was not in
sight of the foe at all. Shore also went into the ravine, and shots
were exchanged for several hours, till Captain J. B. Abbott
appeared in sight of the enemy with his company, when Pate
surrendered. This is substantially the part played in this battle by
Brown.”</p>
          <p>The truth is that Brown's most famous engagement, and one
that will be remembered when Black Jack and Ossawatomie are
forgotten, took place on the night of May 24, 1856. On this night,
accompanied by his four sons Owen, Frederick, Salmon, and
Oliver, his son-in-law Henry Thompson, a Jew named Wiener,
and Townsley, a settler, about two o'clock in the morning he took
from their beds and homes three men and two lads, one under
age, and made his sons
<pb id="wyeth112" n="112"/>
and the others cut these to death in a manner almost too horrible
to be believed. That their leader and his gang were careful of
their own lives is attested by the statement of Salmon Brown, one
of the murderers, who wrote later: “Soon after crossing the creek
some one of the party knocked at the door of a cabin. There was
no reply, but from within came the sound of a gun rammed
through the chinks of the cabin walls. At that we all scattered.
We did not disturb that man” (Villard). They next proceeded to
the cabin of William Sherman, knocked, and the door was
opened. James Harris in his testimony before the committee of
Congress swore: “I took Mr. William Sherman out of the creek
and examined him. Mr. Whitman was with me. Sherman's skull
was split in two places, and some of his brain was washed out by
the water. A large hole was cut in his breast, and his left hand
was cut off except a little piece of skin on one side.” Sanborn
says: “When the bodies of the dead were found, there went up a
cry that they had been mutilated; but this was because of the
weapons used.” Ordinarily it would seem that two gashes through
the skull from which the brain was oozing might suffice without
the extra thrust on the side and lopping off of the hand.</p>
          <p>Another of the victims was a Mr. Wilkinson, who was the
postmaster at Shermansville (now Lane), and also a member of
the territorial legislature of Kansas. Mrs. Wilkinson in her
testimony said that she was sick in bed with the measles; that she
begged them to let her husband stay with her, as she was
helpless. “The old man [Brown] who seemed to be in command
looked at me and then around at the children, and replied, ‘You
have neighbors.’ They then took my husband away. One of them
came back and took two
<pb id="wyeth113" n="113"/>
saddles. The next morning Mr. Wilkinson was found. I believe
that one of Captain Brown's sons was in the party
which murdered my husband. My husband was a quiet man
and was not engaged in arresting or disturbing anybody.”</p>
          <p>Three Doyles, father and sons, one of the lads under age,
were also murdered. John Doyle, a son of the murdered man,
testified: “I found my father and one brother, William, lying
dead in the road about two hundred yards from the house. I saw
my other brother lying dead on the ground
about one hundred and fifty yards from the house. His fingers
were cut off, and his arms were cut off; his head was cut open,
and there was a large hole in his breast. William's head was cut
open, and a hole was in his jaw, as if made by a knife; and a hole
was also in his side. My father was shot in the forehead and
stabbed in the breast” (page 160). This done, the horses and saddles
of the dead men were
taken along and, according to Sanborn, traded off in northern
Kansas.</p>
          <p>John Brown denied killing any of these men with his own
hands, and yet a pistol-shot was fired, and Doyle was found with
a bullet through the forehead. Salmon Brown says that Owen
and another killed the Doyles; and Villard adds, “By a process of
elimination it is apparent that the other could only have been
himself.” Salmon Brown will not positively state that his father
fired this shot, but admits that no one else in the party pulled a
trigger. He is at a loss to explain why the shot was fired. He
said Doyle was dead; it was probable that the old man fired into
the dead man's skull for additional moral effect.</p>
          <p>Of this affair Andrew Johnson said in the United States
Senate: “Innocent and unoffending men were taken out,
<pb id="wyeth114" n="114"/>
and in the midnight hour fell victims to the insatiable thirst of
John Brown for blood. Then it was that he shrank from the
dimensions of a human being into those of a reptile. Then it was,
if not before, that he changed his character to a demon who had
lost all the virtues of a man.”</p>
          <p>Professor L. W. Spring, in his <hi rend="italics">Kansas</hi>, says: “John Brown's
statements were sufficiently evasive to deceive members of his
own family and personal friends who long denied that he led the
foray. The five squatters upon whom he laid a tiger's paw were
not exceptionally bad men; and the squatters, without distinction
of party, denounced the deed as ‘an outrage of the darkest and
foulest nature, by midnight assassins who murdered and
mangled them in the most awful manner.’ To this must be
charged most of the havoc and anarchy in which the Kansas of
1855 weltered. It set afoot retaliatory violence, and finally issued
in a total military collapse of the free-state cause.”</p>
          <p>Villard says (page 264): “Between November 1, 1855, and
December 1, 1856, about two hundred people are known to have
lost their lives in the anarchical conditions which prevailed, and
the property loss in this period is officially set down at not less
than two millions of dollars. However superior in character and
intelligence and industry the free-state emigrants indubitably
were in the beginning, there was little to choose between the
border ruffians and the Kansas ruffians in midsummer of 1856.
The Whipples and Harveys and Browns plundered and robbed
as freely on one side as did the Martin Whites, the Reids, and
the Tituses on the other, and there was not the slightest difference
in their methods.”</p>
          <p>Concerning the Pottawattomie murders, the governor of the
territory (Shannon), on May 31, 1856, wrote to the
<pb id="wyeth115" n="115"/>
president of the United States: “The respectability of the parties
and the cruelties attending these murders have produced an
extraordinary state of excitement in that portion of the territory
which has heretofore remained comparatively quiet” (Villard,
page 169).</p>
          <p>Major John Sedgwick, who later won undying fame as
commander of a corps in the Army of the Potomac, reported:
“Five men were taken out of their beds, their throats cut, their
ears cut off, and their persons gashed more horribly than our
savages have ever done. I sincerely think that most of the
atrocities have been committed by the Free-soil party, but I
cannot think that they countenance such acts—that is, the
respectable class” (Villard, page 169).</p>
          <p>Mr. Adair, a Free-soiler, when Owen Brown, who with his
brother Salmon had cut the Doyles to death, asked to stay all
night, said to him: “Get away—get away as quickly as you can.
You are a vile murderer, a marked man.”</p>
          <p>“ ‘I intend to be a marked man,’ shouted Owen, and rode away
on one of the murdered man's horses” (according to Mr.
Villard).</p>
          <p>John Brown, Jr., was deposed from command of a company
(Villard, page 151) because a man rode into camp in great
excitement, saying, “Five men have been killed on Pottawattomie
Creek, butchered and most brutally mangled, and old John
Brown has done it.” Jason Brown says: “This information caused
great excitement and fear among the men of our company, and
a feeling arose against John and myself which led the men all to
desert us.”</p>
          <p>Villard says (page 187): “From the ethical point of view John
Brown's crime on the Pottawattomie cannot be successfully
palliated or excused. It must ever remain a complete indictment
of his judgment and wisdom; a dark
<pb id="wyeth116" n="116"/>
blot upon his memory; a proof that, however self-controlled, he
had neither true respect for the laws nor for human life, nor a
knowledge that two wrongs never make a right.”</p>
          <p>Biographers of Brown, notably Sanborn and Redpath,
disclaimed his reponsibility or participation in this crime until the
proof was so positive that even the former accepted it. He
then justifies the murders as “executions” in which his hero
became judge and jury, holding midnight sessions of about one
minute each for each defendant—“brief but sufficient trials,” as
he beautifully expresses it. Sanborn's qualifications
for his self-imposed task may be judged
from his treatment of this incident. Redpath, another “reliable”
historian, says he was twenty-five miles away. The retaliatory
killings at the Marais des Cygnes were not “executions,” but
murders! The poet Whittier, who sang of the Marais des Cygnes
outrage, could not tune his lyre to the measure of the
Pottawattomie. The wrong ox had been gored. The zealots of
abolitionism were so far lost to the sense of justice and to truth
itself that they made of themselves the apostles of
misrepresentation. Witness Longfellow's “The Slave in the
Dismal Swamp” and Whittier's “Barbara Frietchie,” recited by
thousands of impressionable school-children and read by many
more thousands of older persons who may never know the truth
and will accept this version of an incident which occurred only in
the imagination of the poet as an indictment of the Southern
soldier and of his section.</p>
          <p>I know from a brother physician, an honorable member of my
profession and of this same family in Frederick, who assured me
that his aged relative never saw Stonewall Jackson or a single
Confederate soldier, and that when the poet of New England
sang of her as leaning out of the window
<pb id="wyeth117" n="117"/>
waving her country's flag in Jackson's face and daring him to shoot,
she was a block away, hopelessly bedridden. Her joints were
stiffened to such a painful degree that not only was it impossible
for her to get out of bed and walk, but she could not even have
stood upright had she been placed on her feet!</p>
          <p>As late as November 10, 1913, this often resurrected falsehood
arose again from the dead through the medium of the New
York <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi>, and was again temporarily laid to rest by Professor
W. Gordon McCabe, of Richmond, Virginia, with the timely aid
of Mr. Valerius Ebert, of Frederick, Maryland. The original was
published in the Baltimore <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi>:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">

                  </opener>
                  <p>—I have just read a communication in the <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi>, purporting to set forth
certain facts in relation to the life and character of the late Barbara Frietchie,
the heroine of Whittier's celebrated war poem. It may be proper to state that I
am the nephew of Dame Barbara, and had the settling up of her husband's
estate in the capacity of administrator.</p>
                  <p>This necessarily threw me into frequent communication with the ancient and
venerable dame. Barbara Frietchie, my venerable aunt, was not a lady of
twenty-two summers, but an ancient dame of ninety-six winters when she
departed this life.</p>
                  <p>As to the waving of the Federal flag in the face of the rebels by Dame
Barbara on the occasion of Stonewall Jackson's march through Frederick, truth
requires me to say that Stonewall Jackson with his troops did not pass
Barbara Frietchie's residence at all, but passed up what in this city is
popularly called “The Mill Alley,” about three hundred yards above her
residence, then passed due west to Antietam, and thus out of the city.</p>
                  <p>But another and stranger fact with regard to this matter may be presented:
the poem by Whittier represents our venerable relative (then ninety-six years
of age) as nimbly ascending to her attic window and waving her small Federal
flag defiantly in the face of Stonewall Jackson's troops. Now, what are the
facts at this point? Dame Barbara was, at the moment of the passing of that
distinguished general and his forces through Frederick, bedridden and helpless,
and lost the power of locomotion. She could at this period only move as she
was
<pb id="wyeth118" n="118"/>
moved by the help of her attendants. These are the true and stern facts, proving
that Whittier's poem upon this subject is fiction, pure fiction, and nothing else,
without even the remotest semblance or resemblance of fact.</p>

          <p>Such is the explicit testimony of one who could “speak with
authority,” and such must be reckoned the real “truth about
Barbara Frietchie.”</p>
          <p>This same otherwise lovable man is also responsible for
another unpoetic untruth, “Brown of Ossawatomie,” which
served its purpose of aiding to establish his martyrdom— <hi rend="italics">viz.</hi>,
the kissing of a negro baby as he was walking to the gallows,
which deed, according to the standard of zealots, cleaned his
record of all misdeeds. Even Sanborn now admits it could not
have taken place; and, in fact, nothing of the kind did occur.</p>
          <p>Brown's next notorious expedition was over the border in
Missouri on December 20, 1859. “With him were a well-known
horse-thief, ‘Pickles’ by designation, Charles Jemison, Jeremiah
Anderson, Gill, Kagi, and two young men named Ayres, besides
one or two others. At midnight Hicklan's (a slave-owning
citizen's) door was quickly forced by men with pointed revolvers,
and he was informed of the mission of the raiders. Gill, one of
the raiders, says: ‘Watches and other articles were taken; some
of our number proved to be mere adventurers, ready to take
from friend or foe as opportunity offered’ ” (Villard).</p>
          <p>Mr. Hicklan testified: “Nothing that was taken was ever
recovered. I learn that it was stated by John Brown that he
made his men return all the property they had taken from me.
This is not true. They did not give anything
<pb id="wyeth119" n="119"/>
back. Brown said to me that we might get our property back if
we could; that he defied us and the whole United States to
follow him” (Villard, page 368).</p>
          <p>“Besides the negroes Brown took from the Lawrence estate
two good horses, a yoke of oxen, a good wagon, harness,
saddles, a considerable quantity of provisions, bacon, flour, meal,
coffee, sugar, etc., all the bedding and clothing of the negroes,
Hicklan's shotgun, overcoat, boots, and many other articles
belonging to the whites. From Larue were taken five negroes,
six head of horses, harness, a wagon, a lot of bedding and
clothing, provisions, and, in short, all the loot available and
portable” (Villard, page 369).</p>
          <p>Meanwhile Stevens's expedition had released but one slave,
and that at the cost of the owner's life. David Cruse, a wealthy
settler, had a woman slave whom the Daniels party wished to
take along. Stevens had hardly entered the house when he said
he thought Mr. Cruse was reaching for a weapon. He fired
instantly, and the old man dropped dead. Stevens, who was
hanged at Charlestown with Brown, freely admitted the killing,
though it weighed heavily upon him. The Cruse family charged
wholesale looting of the house, the taking of two yoke of oxen, a
wagon-load of provisions, eleven mules, and two horses. John
Brown says of this expedition that a white man who resisted the
liberation was killed; and Sanborn adds, “He left Kansas pursued
by United States troops.”</p>
          <p>On pages 370, 371 Villard says: “Naturally, the death of Mr.
Cruse created great excitement in Missouri, for, Stevens's
narrative to the contrary notwithstanding, he ranked as a
peaceful, law-abiding citizen, accustomed to minding his own
business. This murder instantly imperiled the safety of all the
Kansas settlements near the border line, for it was
<pb id="wyeth120" n="120"/>
wholly unprovoked and without a shadow of the usual apology—
that Cruse had been guilty of outrages upon the people of
Kansas. Finally, for this crime the President of the United <sic corr="States">State</sic>
offered a reward of two hundred and fifty dollars for the arrest
of Brown and Montgomery, and the governor of Missouri three
thousand dollars for the capture of Brown.” Sanborn admits
that even in Kansas he was “proscribed.” Villard also says that
“Brown, on March 25, 1859, sent from Ashtabula, Ohio, one hundred
and fifty dollars, part of the proceeds of the sale of the horses
taken from the Missouri farmers to his family at North Elba.”
Part of this particular fund paid for a yoke of oxen for the Brown
family.</p>
          <p>In this period as a fugitive from justice he lived under various
aliases: Isaac Smith, Shubel Morgan, James Smith, and Nelson
Hawkins. Naturally he writes, “I am advised that one of Uncle
Sam's hounds is on my track.”</p>
          <p>It will amuse students of the art of war after reading
Xenophon's <hi rend="italics">Retreat of the Ten Thousand</hi>, and Napoleon's
disastrous march from Moscow to the Berezina, to follow the
historian Sanborn's detailed description of the retreat of Captain
John Brown from the plantations he had robbed in Missouri to
Detroit, Michigan, and thence across the river to Canada.
Although Xenophon came home a loser, he was in pretty fair
shape, considering the difficulties he had to encounter. Napoleon
lost about everything; but Brown, like a rolling ball of snow,
gathered as he went. This from Sanborn:</p>
          <p>“The retreat from southern Kansas with his freedmen, and
particularly the first step of his journey, was one of the boldest
adventures of Brown. With a price on his head, with but one
white companion, himself an outlaw, with
<pb id="wyeth121" n="121"/>
their property loaded into an odd-looking wagon drawn by the
cattle taken from the slave-owner in Missouri, Brown
pushed forward in the dead of winter, relying on the mercy of
God and on his own stout heart.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref21" n="21" rend="sc" target="note21">1</ref></p>
          <p>The “himself an outlaw” was Whipple, alias Stevens, who
murdered Mr. Cruse, and who was hung at Charlestown. It took
Brown nearly three months to pull through.</p>
          <p>Eli Thayer, who had employed Brown until he learned his real
character, says that he stole on this expedition some four
thousand dollars' worth of property, and instead of going directly
to Canada, which he could easily have done in two weeks, as no
one hindered him, he dawdled along in all sorts of meanderings,
working everybody for any and every thing he could get, sending
agents in all directions to excite sympathy for the poor captive
slaves, and incidentally to get money for John Brown. The
retreat led through Kansas, Nebraska, Iowa, Illinois, and
Michigan to Canada.</p>
          <p>“At Muddy Creek, with only twenty-three white men and a
dozen negroes, he put to rout a marshal with eighty men, chased
them six miles, and brought back four prisoners and five horses.
The captain told the prisoners they could proceed on foot. Their
horses were retained for prudential motives! and given to the
brave Topeka boys” (Sanborn, page 485). It may be recalled that
in the great battle of Ossawatomie Brown reported some
seventy of the enemy <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">hors de combat</foreign></hi>, when not a single man
was killed.</p>
          <p>The Kansas strategist acquired an item of “one hundred and
thirty-eight dollars in cash received on his private account of J.
H. Painter.” Also something from Gerrit Smith, who, having
“heard of his foray in Missouri,” wrote to friend Sanborn as
follows (page 483):</p>

Kansas. I send you twenty-five dollars, which I wish you to send to

          <p>The italics are in the original, and are significant, as they refer to
the proposed invasion of the South to arm the negroes. Villard
says Brown sent his wife one hundred and fifty dollars from the
proceeds of the sale in Ohio of the horses stolen in Missouri. But
these were insignificant sums when compared with the amount
contributed by the New England contingent. Mr. George L.
Stearns, one of the militant group of abolitionists, was a gold-mine
for the “hero and martyr.” How much he worked this placer for it
is impossible to determine; but, being needy, as was his wont, he
wrote and read at the psychological moment to Mrs. Stearns's “Old
Brown's Farewell,” the last lines of which are: “I am destitute of
horses, baggage-wagons, tents, harness, saddles, bridles, holsters,
spurs and belts; camp equipage, such as cooking and eating
utensils, blankets, knapsacks, intrenching-tools, axes, shovels,
spades, mattocks, crowbars; have not a supply of ammunition;
have not money sufficient to pay freight and traveling expenses;
and left my family poorly supplied with common necessities.” The
dear lady says: “I wish I could picture him as he sat and read,
lifting his eyes to mine now and then, to see how it impressed me.”
Mrs. Stearns was won over, very much won over, as was her
husband, for “when breakfast was over he [Mr. Stearns] drove to
the residence of Judge
<pb id="wyeth123" n="123"/>
Russell and handed Captain Brown his check for <hi rend="italics">seven
thousand dollars!</hi>”</p>
          <p>Discredited in Kansas by reason of his unlawful methods,
disowned by such honorable antislavery leaders as Eli Thayer,
Amos A. Lawrence, Governor Charles Robinson, O. E. Learned,
and a host of men whose names are the synonyms of honor,
integrity, and truthfulness; dismissed from their service and pay
as unworthy of confidence or respect; an outlaw, with rewards
for his apprehension offered by the President of the United
States and by the Governor of Missouri; a fugitive from justice,
slipping about under various aliases; an Ishmaelite with no
possible means of a living for himself and the pitiable family he
had long neglected, except what he might obtain from the
wealthy zealots among the militant abolitionists or appropriate by
violence, John Brown was now in a position to undertake even a
venture that might involve some risk. Like Macbeth in more
ways than one, he was so hopelessly advanced in bloody deeds
'twas just as easy to go on as to recede. He had had in mind
what his historian dignifies by calling it an “invasion of the South”
for the liberation of the slaves. It might or might not involve a
wide-spread insurrection and a repetition on a grand scale in
many remote communities of Nat Turner's massacres in
Southampton. He had said it was better for a whole generation of
white men, women, and children to be wiped out rather than
slavery should continue. He knew what had been done in Haiti,
San Domingo, and in Virginia. Mr. Sanborn, who conspired with
him, and who more than all others, perhaps, is responsible for this
apotheosis, regales us with the record of loud shouting, “Thank
God, the negroes have risen in Virginia at last!” when the news
came to
<pb id="wyeth124" n="124"/>
Hudson, Ohio, about Nat Turner's murderous insurrection.
Will the reader calmly and dispassionately think of this, and
then read the appalling story, only a part of which is given in
this book.</p>
          <p>It is stated that Brown had thought of going down the
Mississippi to near the Louisiana line, where the negroes were
ten to one more numerous than the whites, but in all probability
he abandoned this project as the chances of escape in case of
disaster would not be so good at such a distance from the
Mason and Dixon line. No one who carefully studies each step
of his career at this crisis can doubt that he had no idea of being
caught or of dying. Had he been a really brave man and of
heroic mold, ready and willing to die for the liberation of the
slaves, nothing would have been easier than to have gone down
the Ohio and the Mississippi in a trading flatboat, in which his
guns and pikes and men could have been readily concealed, or on
a raft of logs, which would have disarmed suspicion, and to have
opened his campaign of “arming the slaves” where it was
feasible. He knew that in 1811 in St. John's Parish, in Louisiana,
the negroes, unaided from without, had risen, and that it took a
week to put the insurrection down. With a white leader and his
armed company and guns, and pikes for those who didn't know
how to shoot, what a great success he might have made of it!</p>
          <p>The truth, as I believe it, is that John Brown was a craven at
heart. He and his two sons ran away from the click of a gun
from the inside of a cabin when they were calling unsuspecting
men and boys to the door and, finding them unarmed, hacking
them to pieces with cleavers—in order not to raise an alarm in
that bloody night on the Pottawattomie. There is undoubted
testimony that he
<pb id="wyeth125" n="125"/>
ran at Ossawatomie, from which he emerges as a hero at the
hands of the martyrists. Read Brown's report of this great battle,
with its sixty or seventy of the enemy slain, and then read the
truth, that not one of the enemy was killed, and that there was “a
general skedaddle, John Brown with the rest,” and you begin to
get the measure of a colossal fraud. He evidently expected to
escape into the mountains and then to his harbor of refuge in the
North in case of failure at Harper's Ferry. “He and his men had
studied the country carefully and knew it a hundred times better
than any of the inhabitants. Every avenue of escape was noted”
(Sanborn, page 556). It was the measure of a coward to take
helpless citizens and hold them as hostages in constant danger of
being shot to protect himself in the engine-house, in which, from
a port-hole, he, rifle in hand, was killing or trying to kill his
assailants. He had refused to surrender, saying, “I prefer to die
just here,” but when the crisis came what did he do?</p>
          <p>“One lone man, Lieutenant Green, of the United States Marine
Corps, forced his way through a small aperture made by a ladder
used as a battering-ram, jumped on top of the engine, and stood
a second mid a shower of balls. Singling out John Brown, he
sprang at him, having no weapon but a small officer's sword
which bent double with the first thrust or blow, when Brown fell
down, with his head between his knees, permitting Green to maul
him with the bent weapon, and offering no resistance whatever!”</p>
          <p>Brown was at last face to face with a fearless man, armed as
he was; he had boasted he preferred to die just here, but when
he had the opportunity to fight he behaved as stated before in the
words of an eye-witness, one of the hostages. If there is a
suggestion of the heroic in this, I fail to discern
<pb id="wyeth126" n="126"/>
it. Even after he was caught red-handed he did not abandon
hope or the effort to escape the just penalty of his crimes. He
offered Judge Thomas Russell (among others), who was in the
conspiracy, two hundred and fifty dollars “and personal property
sufficient to pay a most liberal fee to yourself” to come and try
to get him off, and in his anxiety he added, “Do not send an ultra
abolitionist!” They had taken Colonel Washington's silver and
watch, and probably other valuables. Brown had no personal
property beyond what he had obtained illegally. To Senator
Mason he spoke falsely when he said he furnished most of the
money for his expedition, and that he had killed no man except in
fair fight. Standing by and ordering his sons to kill his victims was
not killing unfairly, as he interpreted it.</p>
          <p>Of the trial, Sanborn, his rhapsodist, says: “He was ably
defended.” Brown said: “I feel entirely satisfied with the
treatment I have received on my trial. It has been more generous
than I expected.” He was sentenced to be executed on
December 2, 1859. Then—and only then—when all hope of
escape was gone, came the pose of martyrdom. Sanborn sounds
the slogan when he says: “But he soon began to see that his
mistake” (in not running earlier) “was leading him to his most
glorious success, a victory such as he might never have won in
his own way.” A deluge of letters flowed from the Charlestown
jail to all points of the compass but one—pathetic appeals of a
dying man, of a poor man with a helpless family, of a man who
had lost three sons and a son-in-law and was himself soon to be
judicially murdered by slave-owners, and all because he had tried
to free the slaves.</p>
          <p>Nobody stopped to think that one of his dead sons, Frederick,
was a murderer in Kansas before he in turn was
<pb id="wyeth127" n="127"/>
murdered by a proslavery preacher who got the drop on him;
that Owen, Salmon, and Oliver, and son-in-law Thompson cut
some of the Pottawattomie helpless and unarmed victims into
slices with cleavers; and that the leading candidate for
martyrdom had a long and varied career of deception,
embezzlement, robbery, and murder. Oh no! The maxim of
Napoleon, the great master in the art of pulling the wool over
men's eyes—namely, “Not facts, but sentiment and imagination,
if you would rule mankind”— was the motto of the crusade of
martyrdom. It spread like wild-fire among the militant
abolitionists of the North; it appealed to thousands who never
stopped to reason, only to sympathize. It found a ready lodgment
in the “Concord Circle of Authors.” On December 2, 1859, at the
hour at which the execution was to take place at Charlestown,
with time allowance carefully calculated, the circle began at
Concord the Crusade of Martyrdom. Sanborn furnished “A
Dirge”; Alcott read the “Martyr's Service” and quoted
appropriately from Solomon, David, the Psalms, and Plato;
Thoreau chimed in with selections from the poets, and the
Reverend E. H. Sears “offered prayer.” Alcott, in his Diary,
notes: “The spectacle of a martyrdom such as his must needs be,
will be greater service,” etc., etc. But it was left to Mr. F. B.
Sanborn to settle the matter in this rhapsodical outburst: “From
the crucifixion at Jerusalem a light sprang forth that was
reflected back without obstruction from the ugly gallows of
Virginia. John Brown took up his cross and followed the Lord,
and it was enough for this servant that he was as his Master!”</p>

A DISSERTATION UPON THE PERVERSION OF FACTS—
SKETCHES FROM THE BACKWOODS OF ALABAMA—
THE GRAPE-VINE TELEGRAPH—THE LIARS'
TOURNAMENT—THE SHERIFF'S STORY OF “WHEN
THE YANKEES FIRST CAME”</head>
          <p>ALTHOUGH born a Presbyterian and brought up with a
Bible and the Westminster Confession in either hand, I must own
up to a mental reservation in accepting the definition of a lie as
the “wilful perversion of fact.” I would rather define a real lie as
perversion of fact with intent to avoid an obligation or to harm
another. Deep down in its heart the human family believes that
there are moments when lying is a near virtue. Judas told the
truth when he gave his Master away, while Peter perverted fact
three times with such a rising inflection that his last whopper
started the cock crowing—and yet we all despise the man who
told the truth and applaud the liar.</p>
          <p>If I ever write a book and dedicate it to one of the disciples, I
shall not forget Peter. He was human enough to get mad and to
qualify his nouns with forcible adjectives, and even went so far
once on a time as to cut off the ear of the servant of the high
priest. Then, too, Peter believed in himself. How we all look up
to a man who has the courage of his convictions! He wasn't
willing to let any living man get ahead of him, so when the
Master came near to the boat walking across the surface of the
water, as if
<pb id="wyeth129" n="129"/>
it were the Mall in Central Park, Peter said, “I can do it if He
can,” and overboard he went. Alas for Peter! the law of
gravitation refused to be suspended in his case, and he had to
shout to his Master for help and swim until it
was at hand.</p>
          <p>It may be that I lean toward the twisting of facts because I am
a doctor. In my profession we often feel justified in deceiving
our patients, especially when the truth might contribute to their
mental or physical undoing. The fact that we are caught at it
does not discourage us or stop the practice. I was on one
occasion “sitting up” with a very dear and very sick friend, the
late Dr. J. Marion Sims. He was suffering acutely, and begged
so persistently for a hypodermic injection of morphine that I said
at last, in affected sincerity: “Well, if you will have it, I'll give it
to you; but you must take the responsibility, for you know
Doctors Loomis and Janeway have forbidden it.”</p>
          <p>He said he would, and so I went through all the forms of
sterilizing the solution and the instrument, inserted the needle
and gave him—nothing but plain water. The light was turned
down, and I went back to the cot by the bedside, feigning sleep,
but listening. In a few minutes I heard a whisper calling me. He
said:</p>
          <p>“How much morphine did you give me?”</p>
          <p>I put on my best Presbyterian face and, looking him straight
in the eye, said, “A fourth of a grain.”</p>
          <p>Quick as a flash he said, “Wyeth, you're a liar, and you
know it!”</p>
          <p>I wrote on the chart, “Diagnosis correct.”</p>
          <p>Lawyers, too, are said at times to wander from the straight
and narrow path of truth. On one occasion a group of this
profession, in selecting a site for the county court-house,
<pb id="wyeth130" n="130"/>
requested a Baptist preacher to officiate in dedicating this bit of
earth to its great purpose. He opened the services by asking
those present to join in singing that well-known hymn—</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Come, trembling sinner, view the ground</l>
            <l>Where you shall shortly lie—</l>
          </lg>
          <p>If Bobby Burns is to be believed, even our clerical friends
occasionally part company with facts. In that irreverent poem
entitled “Death and Doctor Hornbook,” he says:</p>
          <lg type="stanza">
            <l>Some books are lies frae end to end,</l>
            <l>An' some great lies were never penn'd;</l>
            <l>E'en ministers they ha'e been kenn'd,</l>
            <l>In holy rapture,</l>
            <l>A rousing whid at times to vend</l>
            <l>An' nail't wi' Scripture.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Even a soldier may find it necessary to protect himself by a
false statement. In one of my war-time experiences I had to go
into the Union lines on an urgent errand. The night was dark,
and the little light which the stars were shedding was shut out
by the overhanging forest and the dense undergrowth, which
grew right up to the edges of the narrow country roadway.
Suddenly as I struck the enemy's pickets my horse shied, and as
I gave him the spurs I recognized the dim outlines of two men
as they sprang to one side to keep from being run over. Our
interview was brief, and very hurried on my part; but had I told
those two pickets the truth as to who I was and what I was up
to, the reader would have been spared the present infliction.</p>
          <p>The definition once given, that “a lie is an abomination in the
sight of the Lord, but an ever-present help in time of trouble,”
might apply to such a situation. There is current a positive,
comparative, and superlative classification,
<pb id="wyeth131" n="131"/>
as lies, damned lies, and statistics. In my boyhood days down in
Alabama you might be called a liar, and survive with something
of character and reputation by promptly replying, “You're
another”; but when in a moment of excitement or anger one boy
called another a “damned liar” he had to fight or go to Texas.
No boy ever took that insult and retained the respect of his
playmates, or even of the grown-ups in that community.
Whenever one of our crowd took it into his head that he wanted
a fight with another boy, all he had to do was to call him a
“damned liar,” and the fight was on. The only delay was in a
rapid exfoliation of hat and coat, and in summer-time the hat
alone was in the way. I suppose boys are alike the world over,
and in these engagements the usual rules of warfare were
enforced. You could pull hair, and hit with your fists anywhere
above or below the belt, smash a nose or blacken an eye or two,
clench and wrestle and bang away until one or the other
“hollered,” but you dared not choke, scratch, bite, gouge, or kick.
If you were guilty of one of these reprehensible practices the
onlookers intervened and declared the victim the victor, and
from that time on the offender was an Ishmaelite, with every
hand against him.</p>
          <p>Modern society recognizes very properly the “white lie,” which
is accepted as a distortion of fact, not only without intent to do
an injury, but often to avoid wounding the sensibilities, or to
amuse, and thereby benefit, another.</p>
          <p>One of the cherished memories of my youth is that of an
intimate association with a man some fifteen or twenty years my
senior, who was endowed by nature with such a keen sense of
humor, coupled with a genius for invention and exaggeration,
that his companionship was always welcome. With the
straightest face and in the most earnest
<pb id="wyeth132" n="132"/>
and impressive way he would tell of the most impossible
happenings. Up to a certain age I believed everything he told
me, and when it dawned upon my awakening reason that I was
the victim of a romancer I felt something of the same sickening
sense that came over me when I first learned that Santa Claus
really didn't come down the chimney. All the same, I loved and
admired this gentle, gifted, blue-eyed, and soft-voiced old friend,
who long ago knocked at the door of heaven; and if St. Peter
knows a good thing when he sees it (and I think he does), James
Swiverly is on the inside. If I am ever lucky enough to get there
with him I'll lay aside my harp at any time to hear him talk. At
heart this man was truthful and the soul of honor. He became
the most popular man in our county, constable of his beat,
sheriff, and a member of the legislature. He was of humble
origin and uneducated. The district in which he was born was
for many years represented in Congress by a statesman who
boasted that there was no use for an education beyond the three
R's—readin', 'ritin', and 'rithmetic. In frontier days—for we
grew up in the Cherokee country of northern Alabama—the
school facilities in Honey-Comb Cove were limited. In all
probability neither his opportunities nor his aspirations carried
him beyond the simpler forms of spelling.</p>
          <p>In addition to his genial disposition, which brought him in
friendly touch and sympathy with every man, woman, and child
in our county, it may be that something of his political success
was due to a serious lameness which incapacitated him for
physical labor, and when the war came on barred him from
military duty. One leg was fully six inches shorter than the other,
and, as he made no attempt to correct the inequality by wearing
a high shoe, his limping
<pb id="wyeth133" n="133"/>
gait made of him a rather grotesque figure as he went bobbing
up and down. With a boy's curiosity I asked him how it
happened that one of his legs was so much shorter than the
other. We were walking down the village street side by side in
our usual familiar conversation. As I made this inquiry he
stopped short and, looking earnestly down at me, turned and led
the way to the back of one of the stores—his look, manner,
and tone indicating that what he was about to say was in the
nature of a confidential communication.</p>
          <p>When we were by ourselves he said: “John, I don't like to brag
about myself in public; but I don't mind talking to you, if you
won't tell it.” I told him I wouldn't. In a tone so serious that I
believed every word, he said: “It come about in this way. When
I was a-growin' up ther' wasn't nobody in Honey-Comb could
lift as big a load as me. One day a lot of us fellers was a-standin'
in front of Rickett's store when a feller drove up with a
bushel bag plum full o' buckshot. He said he'd bet a dollar I
couldn't shoulder the bag, and I took him up. It wasn't no
trouble for me to shoulder a bushel o' shot, but, as bad luck
would have it, my left foot was a-restin' on a rock and couldn't
sink into the ground as the other one did, and the heavy weight
drove that hip-bone half a foot up into my body, and it's stayed
thar ever sence.” Before I could tell him how sorry I was that
the rock happened to be under his foot, he forestalled the
expression of sympathy which he saw coming by adding: “After
all, son, it ain't so powerful bad as a feller might think, specially
in turnin' over ground with a mold-board plow. I just keep my
long foot down in the furrer and the short one up on the land,
and it ain't half so tirin' as bein' in Marshall County one second
and up in High Jackson the next.”</p>
          <pb id="wyeth134" n="134"/>
          <p>In later years, after the dawn of his political career, he
turned this seeming misfortune to his further advantage, for,
as he said, it gave him a chance to meet all classes of people on
their own level. “When I'm a-talkin' to the people in ‘The Gap’ or
over in Honey-Comb, I git down among 'em on my short leg,
familiar like; but when I'm up here in town with the upper ten,
like your pap, I rise up on my other foot, and thar I am.”</p>
          <p>In those earlier days, before civilization moved into Marshall,
there were no cattle laws, and at times not many of any other
kind except those which the rifle and the bowie-knife enforced.
Everybody's hogs ran loose and oftentimes strayed away into the
woods and became wild. More than once in my hunting
expeditions I have had to climb a tree or retire precipitately
before the onslaught of a savage sow on guard over her litter.
When the mast in the forests was scarce these omnivera would
play havoc with the cornfields, gardens, and orchards of the
settlers, and great care was necessary to build tight or close
fences. Jim said: “John Kennedy's razorbacks was so poor and
thin they laughed at fences and palings and went through them as
if they wasn't there. Even tying knots in their tails couldn't stop
'em. Howsomever,” he added, “old Ben Swords got the best of
'em. He went up on the side o' the mountain whar the chestnut-trees
growed twistin', and split rails enough to fence in his peach-orchard.
Well, John, you'd 'a' died laughin' to 'a' seen how foolish
them shotes looked when they struck them cork-screw rails, and
went in and come out on the same side.”</p>
          <p>He furthermore assured me that down in Parch Corn Cove a
friend of his raised so many hogs he couldn't take time to mark
them with “a hole in the left ear and an underbit
<pb id="wyeth135" n="135"/>
in the right,” so he changed his registration to a “smooth
crop for both ears, and mowed 'em off with a scythe-blade.”</p>
          <p>Jim Swiverly was not the only man in politics in Marshall
County. At one time or another about everybody I knew who
wore breeches was running for something, and with some of
our people this was a continuous performance. I remember one
man well along in years when I was just getting big enough to
go with my father to the barbecues and musters and other large
gatherings held after the crops were “laid by,” who at every
convention in the absence of any one else to present his name
would mount the stump when it was possible to get it before
another candidate pre-empted it and announce himself as a
candidate for governor. He did this so often that everybody
knew him by the nickname of “Governor Hutton.”</p>
          <p>An opportunity such as this could not escape the observation of
Jim Swiverly, and there went the rounds the story that after
repeated failures the candidate determined upon suicide. As Jim
stated the facts: “The Governor wasn't a-goin' t' have no flash in
the pan in his case; so he bought him an inch rope, a big dose o'
arsenic, a quart o' turpentine, and a box o' red-headed matches,
loaded his old Derringer so full the bullet stuck half out of the
muzzle, and then, to make things shore, he got in a skiff and
paddled out in the  river, under a leanin' willer, to hang himself. He
tied the rope 'round the tree, slipped the noose over his head, said
his prayers, swallowed the pizen, poured the turpentine over his
clothes, struck a match and set himself on fire, cocked his
Derringer quick, stuck the muzzle agin the side of his head, kicked
the boat out from under him, and blazed away. Well, by doggie, his
head was that hard the bullet glanced off and cut the rope in two,
and Gov, he drapped inter the
<pb id="wyeth136" n="136"/>
water, which put out the blaze and strangled him till he coughed
and throwed up the arsenic, and—would you believe it?—the
river was so shaller he couldn't drown, and he waded to the bank
plum disgusted, shook himself like a wet dog, and swore ‘By  -- ,
he'd be a candidate for life!’ ”</p>
          <p>More than once I've listened to the story of the “Liars'
Tournament,” held around the red-hot stove in Kinzler's grocery
in Christmas week when “Tom and Jerry” and “egg-nog” were
half-price to everybody, and free to all accepted entries. It was
on such occasions that James Swiverly, self-appointed master of
ceremonies, autocrat, and umpire, rose on his long leg to his
greatest height. I can hear him now making the opening address
to the crowd of eager listeners, seated and standing about the
warm fire, all seemingly unmindful of the stifling air which was
only spasmodically relieved when an inrush of cold wind
announced another accession to the throng.</p>
          <p>“Feller-citizens: This meetin' is called to settle the question as to
who's the biggest liar in Marshall County. It's a momentous
question. Everybody knows it's as full o' liars as a watermillion is o'
meat. Some of us is born liars and can't help it; some of us learned
it young, and has stuck close to it for a livin'; and some few,
natterally truthful, have bin obliged to lie to save 'emselves from
drowning and taxation. I've bin assessor five years, and I know
what I'm talkin' about. Thar's a power o' candidates for the fust
prize, and it ain't bin no easy job to thin out the rows to a good
stand. Fur be it from me to intentionally hurt any feller's feelin's, but
after prayerful consideration thar's jest three that's stayed in for
the last heat. Them's Ben Weeks, Jack Holder, and Ezekiel
Burgess. We'll hear first from Mr Weeks.”</p>
          <pb id="wyeth137" n="137"/>
          <p>Ben arose and with modest mien faced the stove and the half-encircling
throng, and spoke as convincingly as his monotonous
low drawl would permit:</p>
          <p>“Boys, you know thar's allers bin feelin' betwixt Parch Corn
and the settlers over in Honey-Comb Cove, 'specially in the
matter of watermillions. As it was me that come out ahead in
the raisin' contest, it got spread over the ‘North Side’ that what I
said about it was made outen whole cloth. Now, thar is liars in
this county, as the sheriff says, and thar ain't as many of 'em
down in Honey-Comb as thar used to be before he moved up to
the county-seat, but thar's enough yit for a farmin' community.
I'm a forty-gallon Baptist and the father of sixteen childen, all
baptized exceptin' the last set o' twins, and they'll be put under
when the circuit-rider comes around, and what I'm a-goin' to-tell
you is the plum truth, and if any man disputes it thar'll be a
vote missin' in his beat at the next election.</p>
          <p>“When Kernal Cobb was a-runnin' for Congress and was
around shaking hands—and I tell you he was so pertickerler not
to slight anybody that he'd wake the babies up in their cradles to
git a chance to tell their mammies how purty they was—he tole
me he had my name down at Washington for a package o'
garden seeds. Shore enough, next spring they come along, and
among 'em was one big, fat-lookin' watermillion seed. He sent
word that it was a new kind, and powerful sca'ce, and cost the
gov'mint five dollars a seed, and I must be very pertickerler to
plant it whar the ground was rich and give it plenty of water and
lots of room. Well, I fenced in a half-acre by the spring branch,
'riched the bed, and planted that seed. It come up next day, run
out just one shoot, and on the end o' that thar come a great big
yaller blossom. And now, gentlemen,
<pb id="wyeth138" n="138"/>
comes the queer part of what I'm a-tellin' you. Instead o'
waitin' a week to shed that blossom, that darned watermillion
growed so fast it pushed it off in one night, and from that time on
tell frost it was all we could do to keep outen the way and not git
run over. It growed so fast you could see its shadder gittin' bigger
every minute of the day. When it was three weeks old it throwed
the fence down, dammed up the spring branch, and made for the
house, and all hell couldn't stop it. When the logs begun to keel
over and the roof was a-fallin' in, me and my wife and childen cut
a door in one end of the watermillion and moved in, and lived on it
tell a week before frost, when we met a drove o' hogs eatin' thar
way through from the other side; and we had to move out and go
and live with my wife's pap, whar we've been a-livin' ever
sence.”</p>
          <p>When the applause died out and Ben had resumed his seat Jim
said he would reserve “all p'inted comments until the other
contestants had spoke,” but there was a semi-malicious smile of
satisfaction, which may have sprung from Cove rivalry, when he
added, “If all of what we've jest heard was as true as the last part
of it, it ought to be a chapter in the Bible.” By the time the laugh
and the muffled comments on Ben's relations to his father-in-law's
corn-crib had ceased Mr. Jack Holder was on his feet.</p>
          <p>“I'm not a church member,” he announced, “and as far as I
know I ain't never been really baptized, for my folks was only
sprinklers; but I'm a thirty-second degree Freemason and a
full-fledged Know-nothing, and I've got a discharge paper from
Gineral Fremont and Kit Carson, certifying that what I seed in
Arizony, when we marched thro' thar on our way to Californy in
1853, was as true as the Book of Exodus. When we fust started out
from Missouri
<pb id="wyeth139" n="139"/>
it looked like we was goin' to have nothin' but a long walk
and lots o' fun, but the farther west we went the thinner the
grass got, and when we got over the Rockies it give plum out.
When we hit the edge of the desert everybody was ordered to
fill up with water and to tote all he could, for Kit said thar wasn't
a drap to be had for one hundred miles of the hot and petrified
forests we marched through. Talk about your pillar of cloud by
day! Why, gentlemen, the childen of Israel never raised such a
dust as we did a-windin' in and out among them rock trees. Thar
they stood, just like they wuz before they turned to stone, and
they must have turned powerful quick when the change come,
for on every petrified tree thar wuz petrified limbs, and them
limbs wuz thick with petrified leaves which never throwed a
shade, and the most surprisin' thing of it all wuz that a-settin' all
over them limbs was thousands of petrified birds, and every darn
bird was a-singin' a petrified song.”</p>
          <p>Amid a considerable clapping of hands and a scattering fire at
the square sawdust-spitbox near the stove, Jack found his seat,
while Jim remarked:</p>
          <p>“The Good Book tells us that when Lot was a-runnin' from
Sodom after the fire broke out, his old woman looked back and
was turned into a pillar of salt. As Judge Shorter said in his
charge to the jury in the case of Feemster agin McShane, ‘I don't
intend to draw any invidious distinctions,’ but in my opinion it
would 'a' bin a great blessin' to this country if ‘Truthful Jack’ had
looked back and been turned into a standin' committee of one
and had stayed out in Arizony a-listenin' to petrified birds a-singin'
petrified songs till Gabriel blowed a petrified blast on his
petrified horn.”</p>
          <p>There was nothing of mock modesty or assumed humility
<pb id="wyeth140" n="140"/>
in the mien or tone of Ezekiel Burgess, a veteran of the Mexican
War, as he arose and with military precision made two steps
forward to the open place in the circle, took off his hat, saluted
the sheriff, and then, looking squarely into the face of a large
chromo of the Father of his Country which adorned the wall of
the saloon, said:</p>
          <p>“Gentlemen, like George Washington, I have served my country.
When the call for volunteers was made to repel the Mexican
invaders of the Lone Star State I offered my humble services, and
they were accepted. When we reached the Rio Grande General
Taylor rode up to me and said, ‘Zeke’ (he always called me that
when we were alone) ‘get on your horse and swim across and
make a scout, and come back and tell me how many of Santa
Anna's men there are over there.’ I found a low place in the banks
and got across, and went ten or twenty miles and never saw a sign
of their men, until just as I was riding around a bunch of chaparral
two hundred Mexican lancers dashed out and came yelling right at
me. There was nothing left for me to do but to break for the river
at the nearest point and trust to luck in hitting a low place. As I
came up to it at full speed I saw, to my horror, that I had struck a
high bluff where it was at least one hundred and fifty feet straight
down to the water. By this time the lancers were so close and
coming so fast I could almost feel their sharp points between my
shoulder-blades. Now, gentlemen, there are times in a man's life
when he who hesitates is lost; and, as I realized it was sure death
to stop or turn, I shut my eyes, said my prayers, stuck my spurs
into my faithful horse's sides, and over the precipice I
went—horse and all—a hundred and fifty feet down into the
Rio Grande.”</p>
          <p>As Ezekiel lowered his eyes from the calm face of George
<pb id="wyeth141" n="141"/>
Washington, repeated his salute, and started to resume his
seat, the sheriff said, “Will Ezekiel Burgess inform this crowd
how long it took him to come up after that dive?” The veteran,
unable to conceal his contempt at such a question, turned only
a moment to reply: “Come up, Mr. Sheriff? Come up? I never
did come up; I'm there yet!” And as he ceased, amid applause
which shook the saloon to its underpinning, the chromo of
George Washington fell with a crash to the floor.</p>
          <p>Startled by the outburst of applause at the way Ezekiel had
downed the sheriff, and before the vote could be taken, Ben
Weeks jumped to his feet and, with eyes turned heavenward
and both hands raised in the same general direction, in a
pleading tone shouted: “Boys, like Moses of old, I'm a-holdin'
my hands up to ask fer a word more. If thar ever wuz a time
when friendship and jestice could jine hands to help Ben
Weeks, it's right now. My repertation down in Parch Corn
Cove is at stake. Up to now over on our side of the river no
man has ever worked with as long a pole as me or knocked
down as many high persimmons. If this vote is agin me, the
chances is ten to one that my wife's pap 'll turn us out, and I'll
have to go back to work to make my own livin'. While I scorn
the idee of usin' undue influence, I want to tell yer that I saved
eight bushels of them watermillion seeds, and they're soon to be
distributed in Marshall County, free, gratis, fer nuthin'.”</p>
          <p>As Ben seated himself the sheriff arose and remarked that, as
Mr. Weeks had added “a codicil to his will,” if the other
candidates desired to speak any “last words” they now had the
chance. Without rising or even uncrossing his legs, and with a
voice of such subdued tone that it gave the impression of
despair, Mr. Jack Holder said, “I pass.”
<pb id="wyeth142" n="142"/>
Not so with Colonel Ezekiel Burgess, who stood erect and with
a gesture which included the whole audience in its sweep said:
“Mr. Sheriff, to draw one card to four aces would be an act of
deception to which a survivor of the Mexican War could never
stoop. Gentlemen, I stand.”</p>
          <p>And Ezekiel Burgess passed into history as the biggest liar the
Cherokee country of northern Alabama had ever produced.</p>
          <p>When the war came on, in 1861, Jim had grown tired of being
sheriff, and ran for the legislature, and was elected, of course, for
nobody could beat him. By the spring of 1862 the Confederate
Army of the West had been driven back to the south side of the
Tennessee River, which then became the dividing-line of the
opposing hosts. Guntersville, my native town, was situated about a
mile from the southerly bank of this noble stream. When
Huntsville, some forty miles to the north, became the
headquarters of the Union forces, communication for us with the
outside world practically ceased. The steamboats could no longer
run, the stages and mail-riders were discontinued or became so
unreliable that we could learn little of what was going on, and war
news was eagerly desired. In this emergency my friend again
rose to the occasion and established what he termed “the grape-vine
telegraph.” He said, “The Yankees may burn our
steamboats, tear up our railroads, cut our telegraph wires, and
stop the mails, but there ain't enough of 'em left to strip the
grape-vines from the trees along the river-banks, and as long as they
last there'll be plenty o' news.” He justified himself by saying:
“Whether it's so or not don't make no difference; for the people is
starving for news, and one kind is jest as good as another.” Over
those wireless lines, long before Marconi
<pb id="wyeth143" n="143"/>
was born, came volumes of the most impossible happenings, as
interpreted by the fertile brain of our proprietor and sole
operator; and by the few at home, mostly old men or cripples
and wounded soldiers on furlough who gathered daily at the
post-office, where the operator made his headquarters, they
were heard with a smile, for no bad news ever came that way.
The Confederacy was always victorious and its diplomacy
invariably prevailed.</p>
          <p>On the occasion of the Mason-Slidell controversy the
irrepressible operator reported that Mason was coming back
with the whole British navy to raise the blockade, while
Slidell and the Emperor Napoleon at the head of a million French
soldiers were marching by way of Moscow and Bering Strait to
take the United States in the rear. Before the cyclone of active
hostilities struck my native village and wiped it out with fire and
sword I had gone to the wars, and for three years I lost sight of
my old friend. When I saw him again during the period of
reconstruction the scepter had departed from Judah and the
ruler's staff from between his feet. Old in body, broken in
health and fortune, he was living the song of “Tam o'
Shanter”—</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Inspiring bold John Barleycorn,</l>
            <l>What sorrows thou canst make us scorn!</l>
          </lg>
          <p>My last recollection of him is the ludicrous story told in one
of his moments of sobriety, or semi-sobriety, of a panic and
stampede in which he took an active part upon the occasion of
the sudden and unexpected visit of a company of Ohio cavalry to
our village.</p>
          <p>The Federal commander at Huntsville had been informed that
the steamer <hi rend="italics">Paint Rock</hi> was hid away in a creek which emptied
into the Tennessee near Guntersville, and he determined
<pb id="wyeth144" n="144"/>
upon its capture. Guided by a native scout, and crossing
the river near Huntsville, an all-night ride over the mountains
brought the Union cavalry upon the unsuspecting villagers about
nine o'clock on an April morning. At this period there were no
soldiers in town, and but few men, and these were non-combatants,
either too old for military duty or exempt by reason
of physical defects. When the advance-guard of the Federals
reached the head of the main street a dozen troopers dashed at
full speed down this highway through the village, paying no heed
to anybody, their object being to seize the steamboat at the
river-landing beyond. All unconscious of what was about to occur, the
sheriff, the village doctor, and a wealthy, pompous, and very
portly planter, who had seen some service in the Mexican
War, were sitting on the open platform in front of the doctor's
drug-store, which served also as the post-office and headquarters
of “the grape-vine telegraph.” Trusting to memory in the
repetition of a narrative tinged, no doubt, with the exaggeration
which a ludicrous incident invites, and may, on occasion, justify,
this was the story:</p>
          <p>“I've been skeered lots o' times in my life, and bad skeered,
too, but I never come so near being paralyzed all over at once as
I was the mornin' them dod-blasted Yankees dashed 'round the
corner and come a-tearin' down Main Street so fast and so
sudden-like that before a feller could say Jack Robberson they
was right on top of him.</p>
          <p>“We all knowed they was over in Huntsville, but nobody ever
dreamt they'd cross the river below and come on us in the back
way. Howsomever, that's jest what they done, and at the
wrong time, too, for Kernel Jim was right in the middle of one of
his big war talks. I disremember whar he left off, for he was a-facin'
up the street, and me and Doc
<pb id="wyeth145" n="145"/>
was a-lookin' the other way, and he seed the Yankees fuss. You
see, Kernel Jim was askin' if thar was any news, and I says
nothin' more than Lee and Stonewall Jackson had whupped
'em ag'in and had tuk Washington City, and Jeff Davis was
a-movin' over from Richmond so he could keep closer to 'em.
With that the Kernel says: ‘That's the only way to end the war—
whup 'em, and keep on a-whuppin' 'em, and drive 'em into the
Atlantic Ocean, and drown 'em, or corral 'em away
up in Cannedy, and hold 'em thar till winter-time comes on
and freezes 'em to death. Fight 'em, just like we fout the
Mexicans at Buny Visty. The more them lancers charged, the
firmer we stood our ground, and when we got 'em a-goin' we
never let 'em stop long enough to git thar wind. Thar's whar
General Beauregard made the big mistake at Shiloh. If he'd
'a' kep' on another hour he'd 'a' drove Grant into the
Tennessee. My motto is to keep on a-fightin' 'em. One
Southern man can whup five Yankees any day, and if they ever
try to take our town we'll—’ And right here Kernel Jim stopped
a-talkin' so short off I knowed somethin' more'n common had
happened.</p>
          <p>“I was a-lookin' straight at him, and as he shut up his eyes
popped wide open, and he riz and jumped over me and Doc and
flew out o' sight into the narrer passageway betwixt the drug-store
and Kinzler's grocery. Four hundred pounds o'
dead weight wasn't interferin' with Kernel Jim's quick action.
As I was a-noticin' the way he was behavin' I heard a
roarin' sound like a drove o' horses a-runnin' away, and, turnin'
'round, thar was the whole road blue with Yankees, and they
was right on top of us. Talk about being skeered! When I
tried to git up my legs wouldn't work, and I slid off my cheer
onto the platform and rolled
<pb id="wyeth146" n="146"/>
into the street. By this time the Yankees was gone, and
everybody else was gone but me. Then my legs come back, and
I run into the alleyway, and thar I seed the comicalest sight I
ever seed in all my born days. Skeered as I was, I jest had to
laugh, for thar, at the back o' the house where the underpinnin'
had sagged down and narrowed the passage, was Kernel Jim
wedged in so tight he couldn't move one way or t'other, and
Doc was jest a-clearin' him with one o' the highest jumps I ever
seed.</p>
          <p>“By this time I was a-movin' so fast I couldn't check up, and I
riz on my long leg and tried to clear the Kernel like Doc, but I
fell short, and my knees hit him right between his shoulder-blades.
Just as I struck him he hollered, ‘Oh, Lord! I'm shot plum through
with a cannon-ball,’ and then he went to prayin' same as if he'd
been a church-member, and as I crawled betwixt his legs and
cleared the openin' he was still a-supplicatin'. By the time I got
through Doc was nearly out o' sight, and I hollered to him to wait
for me, but the louder I hollered the faster he went, and if it
hadn't been for one thing I never could 'a' cotched him. When we
come to the side o' the steep hill back o' town, as good luck would
have it, I struck the slant with my short leg on the upper side, and
then I went by Doc like he was a-standin' still.”</p>
          <p>How the Colonel extricated himself from his unfortunate
position was not included in the story as it was told to me. It may
be that the whole thing was evolved from the fertile mind of the
loquacious sheriff. In any event, its repetition furnished merriment
for many a day thereafter, and no doubt helped to lighten some of
the sad hours of that unhappy period.</p>

<lb/>
THE SNAKES OF NORTHERN ALABAMA</head>
          <p>WHAT I have to say of snakes is based entirely on personal
observation and experience, and not on a scientific study of these
vertebrates. Much that is absurd or untrue or grossly exaggerated
has been uttered concerning snakes, and it would seem as if the
human family, taking its cue from the Garden of Eden on
serpents, and from Jonah and one of the parables on fish, had
exercised a free license in speaking of these creatures. In the
early settlement days there were a great many snakes of
different kinds in Marshall County; but now, owing to the clearing
of the land for cultivation and the common warfare of
extermination, they are comparatively rare with the exception of
the water-moccasin. The snakes that run their prey down and
catch it with their teeth, and when necessary kill it by constriction
and crushing, are not venomous, and when fully grown are
comparatively long (three to six or seven feet), slender, and
graceful in motion. Some of them move with surprising rapidity.
The “coach-whip,” a very dark-brown, almost black serpent, so
called because it looks as if it were a platted coach-whip, I have
seen flash across the road so quickly that if the track it left in the
dust or sand was not there as a witness one might doubt the
testimony of the eye. By reason of their alertness they are rarely
killed. While snakes are in general repulsive, this particular one
may almost be said to be beautiful. Their nests, or dens, were
<pb id="wyeth148" n="148"/>
usually in the ground, in recesses or caverns left by the decay
and disintegration of the long, large roots of dead trees. When
frightened they glide almost like a flash of lightning for their
holes and do not seem to notice the presence of any body
coming between them and the refuge they are seeking. This fact
would seem to account for the superstition, especially among
the negroes, that a coach-whip would attack a man. Like all
other animals, these will always run if they see a way to
escape, and fight only when cornered or wounded and
desperate.</p>
          <p>The rattlesnake comes nearer to being indifferent to the
presence of man than any other creature of its kind. I have seen
coach-whips fully six feet in length. As they move so swiftly, they
are apt to give the impression of being much longer than they
are. The blacksnake, also a constrictor, is quite common in
Alabama, is long, graceful, and moves with remarkable
swiftness, leaving a track or trail only slightly sinuous. In fact, as
it propels itself by the transverse movable scales across its belly,
to which the abdominal and lateral muscles are attached, its
progress is almost in a straight line, as with the common
earthworm. This latter, however, elongates itself, fixes its
anterior extremity, and then draws up its rear portion in a straight
line, which the snake does not. The short or stubby and usually
venomous snakes leave a sinuous or serpentine trail, showing
that they propel themselves by the use of their large lateral
muscles rather than by the abdominal or transverse scale layers.
I infer from this that they are nearer in evolution to the
vertebrates with legs. These move much slower than the
constrictors. They lie in wait for their prey, and kill it by striking
with their poison-injecting fangs, usually holding
<pb id="wyeth149" n="149"/>
on to it until it soon dies from the venom which is rapidly
absorbed in the blood.</p>
          <p>The saying “Be ye wise as serpents” is not without a
meaning as applied to some of the snake tribe, for I have often
observed their cunning when out for prey. I was seated on a log
on a hillside in an open, shady woodland while hunting. Hearing a
rustling above, I turned to see coming toward me a black racer
four or five feet in length, and leaping for dear life about twenty
feet ahead of it was a bullfrog of good size. The frog was clever
enough to leap in zigzags, first to right and then to left; and for the
first four or five manœuvers of this kind the snake followed each
turn of the animal it was chasing; but as the rapidly moving and,
to me, extremely interesting picture arrived opposite my position I
noticed that the racer, instead of turning to the right, glided the
other way, and as the frog, reversing in his course, neared the
ground he fell into the open jaws of his pursuer, who had actually
caught him “on the fly.” Sitting still unobserved, I noted that
without constriction the snake proceeded to swallow his victim.
The frog was at least two or three times as large as the head and
neck of the snake, and I marveled at the way the mouth of the
latter stretched as the morsel began to disappear down its throat.
It was probably half an hour before it was well out of sight.</p>
          <p>I once killed a big blacksnake, and in order to discover the
cause of a large lump or swelling in its abdomen I cut it open to
find an undigested bird, feathers and all. It was a flicker, or
yellowhammer, a beautiful bird of the South about the size of a
Florida quail. The largest diameter of the bird was at least five
times greater than the neck of the snake as it lay dead.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth150" n="150"/>
          <p>The blacksnake and the chicken-snake, constrictors of near kin
to the racer and the coach-whip, but not nearly so swift, are
tree-climbers. I have seen them high above the ground, stretched full
length on top of a long limb, as motionless and fixed as the branch
upon which they were lying in wait for some unwary bird to alight
near enough to be snapped by the lightning-like stroke of the head
and anterior portion of the body. In climbing they take hold by
winding around the trunk of the tree. I recall a fright I
experienced on one occasion when I was riding at a canter along
a narrow path with a worm-fence on one side and a deep gulley
on the other. Just as I was leaning forward on my horse's neck to
pass under the limb of a tree which stretched directly across the
trail, when my face was not a foot away, I saw stretched along
the branch a huge chicken-snake five or six feet in length. It was
too late to check my horse, so I ducked my head to pass under.
The snake, more frightened than I, let loose and fell, striking
across the horse's back just behind the saddle. As soon as he hit
the ground he glided through the fence and was gone. I knew this
one was not poisonous, and I was in no danger; but, although I
have been accustomed to seeing them from childhood, the sight
of a snake, even the picture of one, gives me a shudder.</p>
          <p>Chicken-snakes infest barns and outhouses, and live on tiny
chickens, mice, and eggs. A large one will swallow a half-dozen
hen's eggs without breaking the shells, which are later dissolved
by the gastric juice. The only other snake I have seen in the trees
was a small, slender creature about two feet in length and as
green as the leaves. I do not know whether or not it is venomous,
and I am of the opinion that, like the garter-snake, it lives largely
on insects
<pb id="wyeth151" n="151"/>
The garter-snake is very common, and is not only
harmless, but useful in that it destroys insects. I have seen
people pick them up by grasping them in the middle, and the
wriggling captive would not even try to bite the hand that held it.
Two of the largest of the harmless variety I ever saw were
blacksnakes. They were as large around in the middle as
my arm and fully six feet in length. My father and
I were having a canoe hewn out of the trunk of a large
poplar-tree in the Tennessee bottom. Within fifty yards this pair of
serpents had their den in the roots of a great oak, and every
afternoon near sundown they would appear and chase each
other in a regular frolic, like two children playing hide-and-seek.
No one had a thought of trying to kill them, as they were far
from a habitation.</p>
          <p>Among the venomous serpents of northern Alabama are the
<hi rend="italics">Elaps russelli</hi>, or king-snake; the rattlesnake (<hi rend="italics">Crotalus 
adamanteus</hi>, or diamond-back); the copperhead
(<hi rend="italics">Trigonocephalus contortrix, </hi>or cottonmouth); the
moccasin—two varieties, the highland and the water moccasin
(<hi rend="italics">Toxicophis</hi>); and the spreading-adder, of the order <hi rend="italics">Vipera
berus</hi>. The elaps is quite rare. I have seen less than half a
dozen. They are small, about two feet long, slender, graceful,
slow and deliberate in movement, and seemingly
fearless. Their markings are unique, having from neck to tail
alternating black and golden rings, while the head is black with a
golden arch over each eye. While driving along a lonely mountain
road on a very bright and hot summer day I saw one of this
variety gliding down the rather steep bank on the upper side of
the highway. I stopped the horse, and, seemingly unmindful of
danger or observation, the little creature came into the road,
passed between the front and rear wheels of one side, and went
<pb id="wyeth152" n="152"/>
between the two hind wheels, and thence into the brush wood
on the other side. Several times, as it was directly beneath the
buggy, it shot its forked tongue out of its mouth. It was a very
interesting experience.</p>
          <p>At that time I had no idea of how very poisonous this
seemingly innocent fellow was, but a mountaineer whom I knew
very well told me it was a king-snake, and that he had seen one
kill a rattlesnake several times larger than itself. I took this
statement <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">cum grano</foreign></hi>, as I always take fish or snake reports,
although it may have been true. Later I secured one of these
reptiles alive, brought it to New York, and presented it to Mr.
Conkling, then the superintendent of the Central Park Zoo. As
soon as he saw it he pronounced it the <hi rend="italics">Elaps russelli</hi>, adding
that it was the most deadly snake on the continent. It was on
exhibition in New York for some time.</p>
          <p>The most horrible snake of all is the highland moccasin, a
short, thick, stubby-tailed, and hammer-headed monster. It is said
to be, and I believe is, very venomous. It is sluggish in its
wriggling way of moving, and, as it inhabits lonely and
unfrequented mountainsides, usually under cliffs and boulders,
where it can readily find a fissure for refuge, it is rarely seen. I
had an instructive experience with one of these, and I recall it
vividly because on the same day I was stung in the palm of the
hand by a scorpion. These latter live under rocks and beneath the
loosened bark of fallen trees. While making a survey I planted
the instrument near the trunk of a pine which had been blown
down, and as I was leaning over to sight the flagman I displaced
a piece of the loose bark with the flat of my right hand. Feeling a
sharp sting, I lifted the hand and saw the scorpion, about two
inches long, hanging by his tail, the stinger
<pb id="wyeth153" n="153"/>
fastened in my palm holding it captive. Shaking the vicious
creature loose, I sucked the poison out at once, and thought no
more of it. Clambering over the bluff and well down the crest
of the mountain, peering over a large boulder to find a place to
set the transit, I saw a highland moccasin. It did not budge, and
was probably sound asleep. While not over a foot and a half in
length, it seemed fully three inches in diameter in the middle of
its body. Picking up a large stone, I leaned over and dropped it
directly on the snake, killing it. Cutting the body open, I made
the (to me) surprising discovery that it was viviparous—I had
thought all snakes were oviparous like the chicken-snake, and
racer, and coach-whip.</p>
          <p>The water-moccasins are very numerous, and, as they live
in or near the creeks and ponds, in which they dive out of sight
when approached, their extermination will be long deferred. This
snake is colored on the back and sides a
muddy brown, not quite a black shade, while the belly is
a light salmon. The largest I have seen were from three to four
feet long, but these are exceptional. If a drift of logs or brush is
cautiously approached on a hot, clear day, from one to a dozen
or more may be seen, seemingly asleep and coiled, or half
coiled, evidently enjoying the warmth. Disturbed, they slide
below the surface of the water, where they seem to be able to
remain indefinitely.</p>
          <p>The spreading-adder has a short and not very thick body, and
is dark in color. When teased it will flatten its body until it looks
not unlike thick webbing, and as it raises its head and the fore
part of its body to strike it emits a warning, short hiss. Their
habitat is in the uplands, and preferably among heaps of loose
stones.</p>
          <p>I have saved the rattlesnake for the last out of respect
<pb id="wyeth154" n="154"/>
to this underrated animal. They are admittedly very dangerous
when nearly approached, but they will not strike unless they are
trod on or attacked, and unless asleep when approached they will
always warn you of danger by sounding the rattle with which
nature has adorned their tails. Moreover, they are less afraid of
man than any other living creature. On a hot August day while
on a long horseback-ride, being saddle-weary, I alighted, threw
the reins over the saddle, and walked ahead, my well-trained
horse following. The road was narrow, with dense undergrowth
on either side. Looking ahead some fifty yards, I saw a large
rattlesnake glide slowly into the roadway. When he observed me
he stopped as his head was over one wagon track and his tail
over the other, and head and tail were raised three or four
inches. As I came up within a few feet, instead of going on and
escaping, as he could have done, he rattled his warning note; and
I could see the tail in rapid, short vibration. As my horse now
came up and saw and smelt his natural enemy, he turned to run
back, and stopped only when I spoke. I led him off a short
distance and fastened the bridle to a sapling.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile the rattler had not budged, although he had ample
time to crawl into the underbrush and escape. As it was a wild
and uninhabited stretch, I hoped he would go; but as I approached
again, still stretched full length across the road, it rattled away
and refused to move. It did not coil in defense until I came near
with a long tree-branch, raised to strike. Then it gathered itself in
half-coil; that is, doubling up the posterior two-thirds of its body, the
part nearest the head was drawn back in an S-shape, and the
open mouth, with the large poison-fangs in view, was shot toward
me very rapidly four or five
<pb id="wyeth155" n="155"/>
times. I broke his back and pounded his head. He measured in
length the distance between the regulation wagon-wheels
(forty-eight inches), and had nine rattles and a button, which I cut off
and kept as a souvenir. In passing I may note the practice of
the country fiddlers at home to drop one of these rattles inside
their violins to increase the tone or resonance. I was curious to
register the circumference of this, the largest rattler I ever killed
(I never saw but one larger out of captivity). Having no
measuring-tape with me, I stripped a ribbon of bark from a
hickory sapling, carried it around the animal's body at the largest
part, and marked it. It measured nine inches by the foot-rule.
The sound of the rattle is like the clatter of dry beans in a pod.</p>
          <p>Rattlesnakes are rarely seen in the water. Only once have I
seen one swimming, and this was in Arkansas in 1869. The boat
upon which I was acting as pilot was lying at a wood-yard on
Little Red River, when swimming directly toward us from the
opposite shore we saw a rattler about three feet long. The
engineer and another man rowed out in a yawl, and the former
skilfully caught the animal—which was helpless in the
water—just back of the head with one hand and near the tail
with the other, and brought the captive on board. It was an
exhibition of nerve I had never before seen—one I would not
have repeated for the gold of Ophir.</p>
          <p>There is really very little danger of death even from venomous
snakes, and none whatever from the constrictors of North
America. I saw one of our negroes actually tangled up in the
coils of a very long black racer, and I have never seen a human
being more frightened. I was on horseback, and, with the
negroes on foot, was trying to drive a small herd of cattle along
a country road. As one of the cows started
<pb id="wyeth156" n="156"/>
to turn into a patch of short, stubby bushes I shouted to one of
the men to head her off, and he darted at full speed through the
bushes, which were just about as high as his knees. After he had
started, and before I could possibly give him the alarm, I saw
from my elevated seat on horseback a tremendous long
blacksnake lying at full length near the top of the dense bushes,
evidently waiting for an unsuspecting bird. In another instant,
moving at full speed, the negro's leg hit the snake about its middle
and doubled the frightened creature around him. The darky
screamed, kicked wildly with both legs, and fell over yelling, but
before we could go to his rescue the swift traveler, true to his
name, had raced away.</p>
          <p>There has not been, so far as I am informed, a fatal case of
snake-bite in Marshall County, and, considering the large number
of these reptiles when I was living in this comparatively unsettled
section—1845-1869—very few persons were bitten. A young girl of
twelve was struck on the ankle by a water-moccasin. The leg
was considerably swollen and painful for several days, but the
constitutional symptoms were insignificant.</p>
          <p>There is no danger in approaching a snake in coil or extended,
provided one keeps his distance with ordinary care. That part of
the body which rests upon the ground as it strikes with the
anterior portion never budges. They cannot leap or jump, and
cannot strike while crawling. The so-called suicide of the snake
by biting itself is another fiction, since it is well known that the
venom of a reptile is innocuous to itself or its kind, although it may
be fatal to another snake of a different species. I have frequently
seen them bite at a stick with which I held them down and
occasionally miss the stick and bite themselves, but I believe
<pb id="wyeth157" n="157"/>
the act was accidental rather than intentional. Moreover, they
do not spit their venom. I have seen it ooze out and adhere to
a stick with which I was teasing the snake, but never saw it
leave the mouth any other way. I can imagine that if one were
exuding a large quantity it would be possible, as the animal
struck out in the attempt to bite, to throw off a small quantity;
but I have never seen this happen.</p>
          <p>I have been told by several natives that they had seen very
young snakes run for shelter and disappear down the open
mouth of the mother reptile, but I cannot vouch for this as a
fact. While I have never seen a battle-royal between two
snakes, I do not doubt that they kill and eat each other. One
such combat was witnessed by my friend Mr. John S.
Sutphen, of New York.</p>
          <p>“I was trout-fishing,” he said, “in Pike County, Pennsylvania,
in the spring of 1905, when by a rare chance I saw a fight to the
death between a rattlesnake about thirty inches long and a
blacksnake fully five feet long. I was following a narrow,
winding trail when I heard a rustling in the leaves near by.
Peering through the undergrowth, I observed in a small clear
space not fifteen feet away a small rattler coiled, with his head
up and his rattle buzzing vigorously. Facing him, with his head
about three feet distant, was his natural enemy, a long, graceful,
and beautiful black racer, stretched at full length. Both seemed
oblivious to the presence of a spectator.</p>
          <p>“Presently the black fellow began to encircle the rattler,
carefully keeping out of harm's way as the head above the coil
constantly turned to face him. Soon the strategy of the black
was apparent, for as he spun faster and faster around the rattler
he gradually decreased the distance, and
<pb id="wyeth158" n="158"/>
soon he was so close that the rattlesnake struck—and missed.
Twice the black adroitly dodged the blows, then boldly drew his
circle still closer and glided still faster, as if taunting the foe to
strike again. This the rattler did, when, with a movement so
lightning-like that my eyes could hardly follow it, the black racer
seized him with his jaws just back of the head. In a few seconds
the black coiled himself around the rattlesnake and quickly
strangled it. Then, to my great surprise, the black racer began to
swallow his victim head foremost, and when I left the scene of
the tragedy that had held me in its spell the process was well advanced.”</p>
          <p>Before closing this sketch I wish to record an experience of
my friend the late Dr. John S. Billings, a surgeon in the United
States army for many years, and, at the time of his death, the
librarian of the New York Public Library. It may be accepted as
absolutely true, for I knew him well, and I am indebted to him for
great help in my article on serpent venom in my work on surgery.
In the experiments on snake poisons he was conducting he had in
confinement a six-foot diamond-backed Florida rattler.
Rattlesnakes are difficult to retain alive, as they are fastidious and
will starve to death unless they can have the food which tempts
them. This one would eat only white rats, and one of these was
dropped into the large barrel in the bottom of which the snake
was lying.</p>
          <p>Next morning Dr. Billings was astonished to see the rat resting
at ease by the body of the dead reptile. Upon examination it was
discovered that the spinal cord, just where it joins the <hi rend="italics">medulla
oblongata</hi> at the base of the brain, had been gnawed into and
divided by the sharp, long teeth of the clever and plucky old
rodent. Without doubt, as he
<pb id="wyeth159" n="159"/>
landed in the bottom of the barrel and realized his situation
he had with the instinct of the mongoose, which destroys
the cobra in this same manner, seized his enemy in
the one safe and vital spot and never let loose until his
teeth had cut through the real center of life.</p>

MY YEAR AT COLLEGE—THE GUNBOAT INCIDENT</head>
          <p>HOW few of us realize the career of which we dreamed in
boyhood! Mine was to be a soldier. It may have been the wild life
about me, the early familiarity with horse and gun, or perhaps in
the strain, for the ancestors of each of my parents had fought
through the war for American independence. The first book I
read was the life of Francis Marion. Nothing has ever fascinated
me as did the story of this dashing partisan. I lived over and over
again with him each hair-breadth escape, each thrilling exploit,
and suffered with him the pangs of hunger and the misery of
defeat. Then followed Weems's <hi rend="italics">Life of Washington</hi>, Abbott's
<hi rend="italics">Napoleon Bonaparte</hi>, and a book of the marshals of the great
soldier. My mind was made up.</p>
          <p>One day in the autumn of 1860, when I was fifteen years old,
while attending the fair at Athens, in Limestone County, I saw the
cadet corps of La Grange Military Academy giving an exhibition
drill. It was wonderful. The beautifully fitting uniforms of gray
and white, the tall black caps, the guns and bayonets glinting in
the sunlight, the perfection of manual, the complicated
manœuvers carried out with marvelous precision, left a picture in
my mind which stands out now clear and distinct, despite the
fifty-three years that time has interposed.</p>
          <p>As I was ready for college, and as my father approved
<pb id="wyeth160a" n="160a"/>
<figure id="ill5" entity="wyeth160a"><p>LA GRANGE MILITARY ACADEMY, 1861<lb/>On the right the chapel, armory towers, and section-rooms; on the left Company B barracks; in the center the main building with section-rooms, chemical laboratory, etc., and company barracks.

<pb id="wyeth161" n="161"/>
my selection, I matriculated as a cadet on February 1, 1861. This
institution, famous in the old South, was situated in what was
then Franklin, now Colbert County, Alabama, upon the summit
of a spur of the Cumberland Mountains, which, rising about four
hundred feet above the surrounding country, overlooks the
far-stretching valley of the Tennessee. La Grange College,
chartered by the legislature of Alabama, had opened its doors in
1830, and was conducted strictly as a literary school until 1857,
when the military feature was introduced. Under the new
régime it reached its highest degree of popularity and prosperity.
With wise forethought the state provided for the free education
of two boys from each county, selected by competitive
examination. The only obligation incurred was that each cadet
should teach school in his native county for as many years as he
was at La Grange. In 1861, out of one hundred and seventy
enrolled, forty-seven were state cadets. The course of study
was for four years; the curriculum was that of the National
Academy at West Point. The teaching
was of the highest order, the discipline very strict, but never
unjustly severe. The students almost without exception were
earnest, honest, and manly fellows, of fine physical and mental
development; and but for the unhappy war, which involved this
school in its trail of destruction, it
would without doubt have ranked higher each year as one
of the greatest educational institutions in the South, and of
inestimable value in the moral and mental training of the people.</p>
          <p>Looking back upon the year I spent at La Grange, if I passed
through any unpleasant experiences they have been forgotten,
and there is now present in my mind nothing but the memory of
happy associations and a sincere
<pb id="wyeth162" n="162"/>
appreciation of the fact that the days there were of great help in
fitting me for my subsequent career. Doubtless at the time I
protested inwardly at the hard work which was required, some of
which may then have seemed like drudgery. To sweep the floor,
dust the room, carry water and wood, and to be held responsible
for the order and cleanliness of our apartments were novel
experiences. Nor was the scramble out of bed at the sound of
reveille, the hurry to dress, the rush down-stairs to get in line and
answer to roll-call before being marked late or absent, always a
pleasant duty, especially for boys, who as a rule love to sleep
late. Yet this was a valuable lesson, for no one could have
remained long at La Grange without being converted to the
early-rising habit. Then, when the roll-call was over, there was still the
bed to be made, blankets and mattress rolled and buckled with a
leather strap, the iron bedstead folded and placed against the wall
for economy of space, shoes to be polished, and in a few minutes
more the return to the campus to fall in for breakfast roll-call and
the march to the mess-hall.</p>
          <p>It required a large dining-hall to seat nearly two hundred cadets.
At each table there were ten privates and two officers,
commissioned or non-commissioned, who sat at the head and
foot, respectively, according to rank, the cadets at either side;
and the ranking officer was held responsible for the deportment of
the students at his table.</p>
          <p>After the breakfast-hour we had recitations and study until
twelve. Dinner from twelve until one; in the afternoon recitations
and study until five, and from five to six either infantry or
artillery drill. At six o'clock we had dress-parade, and when we
broke ranks we repaired to our quarters, put away our guns and
accouterments, and
<pb id="wyeth163" n="163"/>
immediately returned to the campus to fall in for supper. At dark the
patrol was posted to stand guard until ten; at nine o'clock the drum
beat for “lights out,” and the day's work was over.</p>
          <p>On Saturday mornings we had full-dress parade and inspection,
in which the most careful scrutiny was made, not only of every
article of clothing as to strict personal cleanliness, but of the arms
and accouterments, belt-plates, and gun-trimmings. In the
afternoon of Saturday we usually played football or “foot-and-a-half,”
a long-distance leap over one another, or exercised on the
ring swings or horizontal bars, or by special permission took long
strolls through the mountain forests or in the valley. On Sunday
we attended church. There were services in the chapel daily.</p>
          <p>At the July examinations my general standing in the fourth, or
freshman, class, the last “half-term” of which I had entered in
February, was eighth in a class of twenty-eight. Then for the two
weeks' vacation I hurried home; and, as the steamboat did not
leave Decatur for two days, we five cadets from Marshall
County left our trunks to come by boat, continued by train to
Woodville, in Jackson County, and walked in eight hours the
twenty-six miles across the mountains to Guntersville. Upon my
return I entered the third, or sophomore, class, and passed all the
examinations before the close of the session for the winter
holiday.</p>
          <p>Earlier in the year the war had begun, and the spirit of unrest
was in the air. South Carolina had seceded on December 20, 1860,
and Florida and Mississippi soon followed. On January 11, 1861,
Alabama passed the ordinance, and these four states, with
Georgia and Louisiana, had on February 4th met at Montgomery
to organize the
<pb id="wyeth164" n="164"/>
Southern Confederacy; but with all this I did not dream of the
great catastrophe which was impending.</p>
          <p>I remember distinctly that one night while on sentry duty,
marching up and down on my post in front of Barracks B, I
noticed a peculiar mist-like star which I soon recognized as a
comet. No one else had observed it, nor had we any notice of its
coming. I called the attention of others to it, and night after night
we watched its approach toward the earth with increasing
interest, until it became the most remarkable heavenly body I
have ever seen. In its nearest position it seemed to stretch more
than half the entire distance across the heavens, the starry point
being toward the west and the nebulous trail spread out in a great
flowing mist far toward the eastern horizon. The superstitious
considered it to be the forerunner of some great disaster. The
wise men of the country should have known then that the disaster
had already arrived.</p>
          <p>By March and April, 1861, there was a call for volunteers, and a
very considerable number of the cadets resigned and returned to
their homes in order to enlist in the first companies which
marched to the front. By the time the first session ended with the
commencement on the 4th and 5th of July, 1861, fully one-fourth of
the corps had enlisted. Among the first to leave were Fielding
Bradford, Bob Coles, and Jimmy Brandon, all of whom had
volunteered with one of the Huntsville companies which made
part of the famous Fourth Alabama Infantry. Bradford was killed,
and Jimmy was wounded at the Battle of Bull Run, in July, 1861.
Soon after this Brandon came home on furlough and visited his
college-mates at La Grange. His presence excited the envy of
every lad who had not been allowed to go home to volunteer.
To have been in a great battle,

<pb id="wyeth165" n="165"/>
wounded and furloughed, made Jimmy a hero, and all of us
would probably have given our hopes of immortality to have
been in his place. This gallant, handsome lad joined my regiment
in 1863, and was killed at Big Shanty in 1864.</p>
          <p>When, early in 1862, northern Alabama became the scene of
active hostilities the college closed its doors and remained
unoccupied until April 28, 1863, when it was destroyed by fire by
Federal cavalry under the command of Colonel Florence M.
Cornyn. The destruction of this institution of learning was not
only not a military necessity, but was in disobedience of the
orders of General Grenville M. Dodge, in command of this
expedition. In his official report, on page 250 of Volume XXIII,
Part I, <hi rend="italics">Official Reports</hi>, he says: “They were guilty of but
one disobedience of orders, in burning some houses between
Town Creek and Tuscumbia, on discovery of which I issued
orders to shoot any man detected in the act.” This officer, now,
in 1914, a resident of Council Bluffs, Iowa, in a personal
communication to the writer says, “It was a matter of great
regret that my troops exceeded their authority and destroyed
these buildings.”</p>
          <p>A bill was introduced in Congress in 1904 by Hon. William
Richardson to reimburse the trustees of La Grange Military
Academy for the loss sustained by the destruction of this
property during the Civil War. To replace at this period the
library of four thousand volumes belonging to the institution,
together with the chemical and physical apparatus, furniture,
buildings, etc., would require at the lowest estimate one hundred
thousand dollars. Upon the introduction of this bill the matter was
referred to the Court of Claims. Over the door of that court
might well be written the quotation from Dante, “Who enters
here leaves Hope behind.”</p>
          <pb id="wyeth166" n="166"/>
          <p>My native section of the South still feels the need of such
a college as La Grange, and I have never given up the hope
that some day some great-souled, far-seeing philanthropist
would rebuild and perpetuate this institution.</p>
          <p>I published, in 1907, <hi rend="italics">The History of La Grange Military
Academy and the Cadet Corps</hi>. Of the one hundred and
seventy-nine cadets, with the exception of three lads who to the
end of the war were still too young to enter the service, all
became soldiers of the Confederacy. Of this number twenty-three
were killed in battle, and twenty-six died in the service from
wounds or diseases incident to exposure, a total death-rate in the
war of nearly twenty-eight per cent. Of those who survived many
suffered from wounds or acquired diseases which carried them,
soon after the close of hostilities, to untimely graves, while some
who still live are suffering from those injuries which have
handicapped them in their struggle for the support of themselves
and families. True to their convictions of duty, they were worthy
sons of the land they loved. The story of their war experiences
would fill a volume of thrilling narrative, and were it possible I
would honor these pages with the roster of their names and the
record of their heroism.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref22" n="22" rend="sc" target="note22">1</ref> There were four, however, to whom I

In 1904, forty-three years after we had disbanded, twenty-eight survivors of
the Corps held a reunion in the Old Brick Church at La Grange. No other
building had been spared. The college campus was a dense tangle of briers and
saplings. From the mound and debris where my room had been,

chum, and had the distinction of heading our class in
mathematics. He enlisted as a private in Company D, Forty-second
Alabama Infantry, and was in the assault on Fort Robinet at
Corinth, October 4, 1862. One hundred yards in front of this fort
was a dense abatis, and while working their way through this
tangle the command suffered great loss from the direct fire in
front and from two enfilading batteries. The survivors rushed
across the open space and leaped into the ditch, where they
were met with a shower of hand-grenades, some of which they
picked up and hurled back into the fort, where they exploded. As
they clambered out of the ditch and up to the parapet they
received a volley which killed a comrade, who in falling threw
his arms about Jim, and he and the dead man rolled back into the
ditch. Regaining his footing and clearing the angle of a bastion,
just as he recognized a small group of Confederates within the
fort he emptied his gun at a Federal soldier, the muzzle almost
touching his breast. As this man fell their reserve line fired a
volley, and of the fourteen assailants who still survived all but
McKinstry were killed. He received a Minié ball through the
upper part of one arm, another through the shoulder, which
fortunately did not penetrate the lung, while a third passed
through the muscles of the thigh. Tumbling again into the ditch,
he ran along this and hid under some debris until nightfall, when
he made his escape. On the forced march in the retreat to
Tupelo, for two days and nights, this lad of seventeen, with three
painful wounds, lay on the <sic corr="bottom">botton</sic> of a wagon-bed jolting over
rough country roads. A photograph of the dead bodies of these
men, taken where they fell, may be seen in the <hi rend="italics">Photographic

army occupied the country, but with the aid of the faithful
negroes he was concealed until he was convalescent. Armed
with a shotgun, he surprised and captured an officer who was
inspecting his outposts, appropriated his horse and equipment,

kept the small weapon ready for use. One day while on picket
duty he had dismounted and was sitting at the root of a tree,
engaged in the pleasant perusal of a communication from his
sweetheart. He glanced often down the road in the direction
from which the enemy would be likely to come, and was
satisfied that none was approaching. The cracking of a dead
twig immediately in the rear attracted his attention, and, turning
suddenly in that direction, he found himself covered with a
six-shooter in the hands of a Federal who had stealthily crept up
behind him. He was told to stand up, unbuckle his pistol-belt, let
it drop to the ground, and walk off a few steps, which orders he
obeyed. He was then told to mount his horse and ride alongside
as a prisoner of war. He had not lost sight of an opportunity to
use the Derringer, and the two had not proceeded a quarter of a
mile before Fred, getting the weapon out unobserved, had it
cocked, and, turning quickly, presented it within three feet of the
body of his captor, telling him to throw up his hands. Fred
immediately made himself possessor of the four pistols, and
marched the chagrined Yankee triumphantly into his own
headquarters.</p>
          <p>My first and only year at college ended in December, 1861. In
that period our state had seceded, the Southern Confederacy
was organized, with the capital at Montgomery, war was
formally declared, and the battle of Bull Run had been fought.
Then came a lull, which every one knew was the hush before
the storm. The war-fever was spreading on both sides of the
line. In the South it ran high. On my way home every village
seemed ablaze with bunting. On every plantation, home, and
farm-house the “Bonnie Blue Flag” was flying. Three
companies of infantry and one of cavalry had already gone from
our county. With
<pb id="wyeth170" n="170"/>
these were one or two boys of my age (sixteen), and I
wanted to enlist. As I was small of stature, my parents argued
that I should wait another year and work on the farm. My
father, though well beyond the military age, enlisted and went
to the front and left me as the man of the family. When the
farming season opened in 1862, I plowed, planted, and cultivated
without assistance ten acres in corn. Incidentally I learned that
farming is not an easy way of earning a livelihood, and that there
are few hotter places on earth than a waist-high field of corn
in the Tennessee River bottoms about “laying-by” time, early
in July. I missed only one work-day, and this was on the 8th of
June.</p>
          <p>The fortunes of war were going against the Confederacy in
the West. Shiloh had followed Fort Donelson, and all of Alabama
north of the Tennessee was now occupied by the Union army,
and their gunboats had reached Florence. Above this point that
great obstacle to through navigation of this noble river, the
“Mussel Shoals,” prevented their going. The upper Tennessee is
landlocked, and the Confederates had made way with all the
steamboats above the Shoals. In this emergency the Federal
commander at Huntsville improvised a small gunboat with steam
motorpower, protected it with an armor of cotton bales, placed on
board two six-pounder Parrott guns and a crew of some sixty
men of the Tenth Ohio Infantry, and sent it on its way to take
possession of the upper Tennessee.</p>
          <p>It was such a slow tub that at Guntersville we knew it was
coming six hours before it hove in sight. A man on horseback
who saw it start had brought the news. Our local humorist, the
genial sheriff, said of it after the excitement of its advent had
subsided, that “up-stream it could
<pb id="wyeth171" n="171"/>
run all day under the shade of a leaning sycamore, while going
the other way the current went by it so fast it made your head
swim.”</p>
          <p>On this eventful 8th of June, while I was following a mule and
a turning-plow up and down the long rows of growing corn, with
thoughts about as far removed from Cincinnatus or Israel
Putnam or glory as one pole is from the other, a lad from the
village came to give me the exciting information that the gunboat
was coming, and everybody who could shoot a gun was rallying
to defend the town. As soon as I could unhitch my mule, we
rode toward home, and when near enough, not wishing to alarm
my mother, I slipped in through a back window, got my
double-barreled shotgun and ammunition, and was just making my exit
through the same opening when I heard a familiar voice say,
“Hadn't you better go out through the door?” I saluted my
commanding officer, my mother, and hurried out as directed. The
truth is, if I hadn't come in of my own accord she would have
sent for me and handed me the gun at the gate and made me go.
Some twenty of us, old men and boys, reached the river-landing
in time to see the United States gunboat <hi rend="italics">Tennessee</hi> pass at a
snail's pace, closely hugging the northern bank of the stream, and
taking no more notice of our presence than if we hadn't been
“bushwhackers” aching to fill anybody who had on blue clothes
full of buckshot!</p>
          <p>After a hurried conference we rode as fast as our mounts
could carry us to a point a few miles above Guntersville, where,
at the low stage of water which then prevailed, the channel was
near enough to the southern bank to bring the craft in reach of
our shotguns. Arriving there, we dismounted some two hundred
yards back in the woods, and,
<pb id="wyeth172" n="172"/>
to give my mule a chance to graze, I tied one end of a long
plow-line around his neck and the other to an ash sapling. Our
company advanced, and we ranged ourselves along the bank,
entirely concealed in the thick growth of cane. As the
queer-looking boat came puffing toward us, the crew, seemingly
without any thought of danger, were seated here and there on
top of the bulwarks, evidently enjoying the scenery and sunshine.
It seemed as if our captain <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">pro tem</foreign></hi> would never say “Fire!” but
when he did and we turned loose our fusillade of twenty
double-barreled shotguns and rifles, the blue coats disappeared into the
hold, as Artemus Ward would have said, “unanimously.”</p>
          <p>In another minute they opened on us with their long-range rifles,
and I heard the singing whiz of a swarm of Minié balls for the
first time. Then the six-pounder joined in with shrapnel, at which
by common consent we rose from our recumbent posture and ran
for our horses, followed, or rather passed, by the screaming
shells, which clipped an occasional branch from a tree-top, but
flew too far above our heads to be very dangerous. That I did not
equal the speed of the negro who testified in a shooting case was
not my fault. Being under oath, he was advised by the attorney to
be cautious and exact in his statement. When asked if he had
heard the bullet whiz, he answered, quietly, “Yes, sah, I heered it
twice.” “You don't mean to say you heard the bullet twice, do
you?” inquired the lawyer. “Oh yes, sah, I done heered it twice.
Fust time I heered it when it whizzed by me, an' den, sah, I
heered it ag'n when I whizzed by it!”</p>
          <p>By the time we reached our animals they were in a wild state
of fright, and all that could break loose had stampeded. My mule
had evidently tried to break away with the others
<pb id="wyeth173" n="173"/>
and had run as far as the tether would permit, and had then
gone into training as a circus performer by circling the sapling
turn after turn in a gradually decreasing arc, until, when I
reached him, his head was lashed so close to the tree no one but
an expert could have told where the mule ended and the bark
began. To add to the perplexity of the situation, I had lost my
knife; and, as I could not get at the knot in the rope to untie it,
expecting every minute to see the Yankees land on our side and
come swarming up the bank in pursuit, I spent a seeming
eternity, along with some earnest language and much muscular
energy, in compelling this proverbially obstinate animal to do as
some of our great jurists do at times—reverse himself. As soon
as this process had been carried far enough to slacken the rope
and expose the knot, I untied it, mounted, and rode off in a long
stern chase to catch up with the company.</p>
          <p>A mile or so back in the depth of the forest we rallied, called
the roll, and found all present or accounted for but one. As this
one was the enthusiast who had summoned me from the plow to
defend our <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">lares et penates</foreign></hi>, and as I had seen him leading the
retreat, having thrown his gun away and run out from under his
hat, I assured my comrades he had not been killed, also that
while I was unwinding my mule he had asked me to go back
with him to help find his gun, a request which the exigencies of
the moment forced me to decline. None had been killed or
wounded by bullets. Some few had passed through the sharp
cane-blades with such rapidity or had ridden too close to a
swinging limb and bore the marks of the campaign on their faces
and heads. At Short Creek the company halted, dismounted, and
washed its face preparatory to the triumphal entry into
Guntersville.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth174" n="174"/>
          <p>The deeds of prowess which were narrated as we rode toward
town would fill several pages. When we blazed away with our
sudden shower of buckshot the unsuspecting crew, who were
airing themselves and viewing the scenery from every point of
vantage, must have thought Gabriel's trumpet would sound next.
The sheriff said: “Boys, talk about action! Them Yankees went
out o' sight quicker' n a didapper duck.” It was really a rapid act,
and none stood on the order of his going. Some jumped into the
hold, some rolled or slid off, and some turned back somersaults;
and it looked for a few moments as if we had killed everybody on
board. The fact that the machinery didn't stop, together with the
rifle volley which flashed out of the port-holes and the swarm of
Miniés which came singing through and over the cane, began to
undeceive us, and when the cannon boomed we knew we hadn't
disabled all. We compromised on half. Cæsar returning from
Gaul never aroused greater excitement at Rome (in proportion to
population) than did this partisan troop as it rode by twos through
the main street of Guntersville and disbanded in front of Kinzler's
grocery. It was a great day. I really thought so then. I have
laughed at it a thousand times since. If I think of it on my dying
day I shall smile, and it will be worth it. I have often wondered
what my hero Francis Marion would have said of our quixotic
performance. For one I am glad he can never know it.</p>
          <p>The truth remains that the boat was so much farther out in the
stream than we had estimated that our short-range guns did no
harm. Years after the war I corresponded with the surgeon who
was on board. One buckshot just did bury itself in the
shoulder-blade of a young chap who didn't glide out of sight
as quick as he wished he had. This
<pb id="wyeth175" n="175"/>
was the only casualty, and the victim never went to bed with it.
The doctor confided that our volley was “like a bolt out of the
blue sky,<corr>”</corr> and caused a temporary panic on board, which,
however, didn't last as long as the bushwhackers on the bank
would have preferred. The pilot made for the other shore at
once, and with our retreat the “Battle of Law's Landing” passed
into history. I might add that it had a good deal to do with the
military careers of two of this immortal band.</p>
          <p>One of these, the Paul Revere who came riding at full speed to
summon me and others to glory, who never fired his gun or
raised himself from the prone position on the ground until an
exploding shrapnel furnished the impetus, and who, hatless and
gunless, led the movement to the rear, never again heard the
music of the battle-line. He was seized with a muscular
contraction which drew one leg into a knot and held it there until
the war was over, whereupon it straightway healed, and he was
restored to usefulness. He suffered the fate of the shirker, as the
village girls not only refused to speak to him, but sent him
knitting-needles and bits of unfinished sewing and all sorts of gentle hints
as to how a young man who didn't go into the army should
occupy his time. It was a pressure no man could resist and
survive in the respect of his neighbors. Soon after the war the
youth went away to lose himself in the all-absorbing West.</p>
          <p>To the other it furnished a good excuse for regular enlistment.
There was a clever native woman spy who lived on the north
side of the river, who kept the Union commander well informed
of all that happened in our section during the war; and we were
notified promptly that the name of every guerrilla or
bushwhacker who fired at the gunboat was
<pb id="wyeth176" n="176"/>
known, and that when captured we would be hanged. The
argument that it was just a little bit better to be shot fighting than
to be kept in a state of “suspense” prevailed, and, as my father
had been discharged on account of sickness and physical
inability and was now at home, my way was open.</p>

WITH MORGAN'S CAVALRY—THE CHRISTMAS RAID—1862-1863</head>
          <p>IN August of 1862 a detachment of Morgan's cavalry,
commanded by General Basil W. Duke, passed through our
village and left in our care Lieutenant Frank Brady, who had
been wounded a few days before in a skirmish near Huntsville.
Bragg's strategic move through Cumberland Gap and across the
upper Tennessee into Kentucky had caused the withdrawal of the
Union forces from Alabama and Tennessee. The battles of
Richmond and Perryville in Kentucky were indecisive and
resulted in the retirement of the Confederate army to the vicinity
of Murfreesborough in middle Tennessee. When Lieutenant
Brady had sufficiently recovered to rejoin his command I went
with him to“see the army.” A ride of three or four days brought us
to Alexandria, Tennessee, where Morgan's division was
encamped. Here we learned that orders had been received to
make a hurried dash into Kentucky, to destroy the Louisville&amp;
Nashville Railroad, and break up the communications of the
Federal army with the North. As I was too young for enlistment, I
joined Quirk's Scouts as an “independent,” and took my place in
that company.</p>
          <p>The expedition, with three days' cooked rations, started north
from Alexandria on December 22, 1862. The command was
divided into two brigades. The First, under
Brigadier-General Basil W. Duke, was made up of the
<pb id="wyeth178" n="178"/>
Second, Third, and Eighth Kentucky Cavalry, and Palmer's
battery of four pieces, two of which were twelve-pounder
howitzers and two six-pounder guns. The Ninth, Tenth, and
Eleventh Kentucky and the Fourteenth Tennessee, to which was
attached a small company of artillery including two mountain
howitzers and one three-inch Parrott gun, formed the Second
Brigade, in command of Colonel W. C. P. Breckinridge.</p>
          <p>There was also a company of picked men, about fifty in
number, known as Quirk's Scouts, made up chiefly of the
remnants of Morgan's original squadron, which acted throughout
the expedition as the advance-guard.</p>
          <p>The entire command, including the artillerists, numbered thirty-nine
hundred, of whom four hundred were at this time unarmed.
The command was generally well mounted and the animals in
good condition. While the artillery was an impediment to a rapid
dash into the enemy's country, it was essential to the
accomplishment of the objects of the expedition, since by this
time all of the railroad bridges, tunnels, and important depots of
supplies along the route to be traversed were protected by forts
and stockades, the reduction of which was impossible without
artillery.</p>
          <p>“Morgan's men,” mostly young fellows from eighteen to thirty-five
years old, were a fine lot, and there were no better fighters
in the world. They idolized their leader, who at the close of this,
his most successful expedition, reached the zenith of his career.
This command, as well as practically all of our Western mounted
troops, fell short of their full efficiency in the absence of that
strict discipline without which no men ever make the best of
soldiers. They were in the main well armed. While it is true that
four hundred of the command were without guns, these did
<pb id="wyeth179" n="179"/>
effective service as horse-holders until the rich captures made at
Elizabethtown and Muldraugh's Hill furnished them with the very best of
modern firearms. The entire command was practically without
sabres. The majority of the companies, which had been in
service for a year or more, had one or two Colt's army pistols
for each man; a smaller portion had cavalry carbines captured
from the enemy, while some were armed with double-barreled
shotguns, a weapon which at that period was capable of doing
excellent service in the close-range fighting to which cavalry
was accustomed. The greater part of the troops, however, carried
long-barreled rifles, some Enfields and some of Austrian and Belgian make,
weapons well adapted to fighting on foot, but clumsy to carry on
horseback. As Morgan's men, and in fact all of the Confederate
cavalry, did most of their fighting on foot, this long gun was an
advantage rather than otherwise. Each man was expected to
carry two horseshoes, a dozen nails, all the ammunition he might
need, one blanket, and an oil-cloth or overcoat. There was
nothing on wheels but the artillery.</p>
          <p>Late in the day we crossed the Cumberland River at Sand
Shoals, and camped in the woods at dark about six miles north of
Carthage, Tennessee. By daylight of the 23d we were in the
saddle, at eleven stopping an hour to feed and rest, and then on
until dark toward Tompkinsville, Kentucky. No enemy was
encountered until at dusk on December 24th when the
advance-guard entered the suburbs of Glasgow, the county-seat of
Barren County, Kentucky. As they reached one corner of the
public square several companies of the Second Michigan
Cavalry, with no idea that Morgan's men were in that part of the
world, rode into sight just across the square, and both sides fired
<pb id="wyeth180" n="180"/>
simultaneously and at close range.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref26" n="26" rend="sc" target="note26">1</ref> One Federal was killed and
two wounded, and a Confederate captain and one soldier were
mortally and one lieutenant slightly wounded. Twenty
Michiganders were captured, among them the adjutant of the
regiment, whose saddle, a beautifully padded and brass-mounted
McClellan tree, carried me for many a day thereafter. A number
of the prisoners had Christmas turkeys strapped to their
saddles—but man only proposes. In three short winter days,
over bad roads and through a rough and hilly country, we had
made ninety miles, and the artillery was up.</p>
          <p>As we marched out of Glasgow early Christmas morning on
the Mumfordsville turnpike Quirk's Scouts were well in advance,
and about ten o'clock we were joined by General Morgan, who
rode with us until noon. He was in appearance the ideal of the
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">beau sabreur</foreign></hi>, with light-blue or gray eyes and a strikingly
handsome face partly concealed by a brownish or sandy
mustache and imperial.</p>
          <p>In the early afternoon, as we approached a small settlement
known as Bear Wallow, our vidette came tearing back at full
speed, shouting as he drew near, “Yankees thick as hell up the
road!” We were ordered to load and cap our guns, and then rode
briskly forward to a rise, and there, some four or five hundred
yards in front, in line of battle which extended on either side of
and across the pike, were some two hundred mounted men in
blue. <ref targOrder="U" id="ref27" n="27" rend="sc" target="note27">2</ref> There was another company which we did not see then, but
saw later, to our sorrow, for they were in ambush on the side of
the road along which our Irish captain was to lead us. When we
<note id="note26" n="26" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref26">1 Company C, Captain Darrow in command, supported by Companies L, M, and
H, Second Michigan Cavalry, page 148, <hi rend="italics">Official Records</hi>, vol. xx.</note>

Fifth Indiana Cavalry under Colonel Isaac P. Grey.</note>
<pb id="wyeth181" n="181"/>
were about two hundred yards from the Federal line, and
protected by a depression in the road which for the moment hid
us from view, we dismounted and advanced on foot toward the
enemy. As we reached the top of the rise in a lane which had a
high worm-fence on either side, the Federals gave us a lively
volley, which we returned from the fence-corners. With my long
Austrian rifle I took a dead rest through a crack in the fence at
an officer who was recklessly riding up and down in front of us,
but missed him. While we were thus engaged with the troops in
front of us another detachment (Company C, Fifth Indiana),
which was in ambush in a hollow to our right, charged up
unexpectedly to within a few yards of the road abreast of and in
the rear of our position, and fired into us and into the
horse-holders at practically muzzle range.</p>
          <p>The sudden appearance of those troops and the fusillade from
the flank and rear as well as from the front stampeded the
horses and horse-holders, all of whom disappeared down the
pike, leaving Captain Quirk and his fifty men with no means of
escape except by climbing the westerly fence and running for a
dense thicket of black-jacks or heavy undergrowth of bushes,
some two hundred yards across an open field. Several of our
men had been wounded—none seriously, however—but no one
was killed on our side. Half a dozen of our company took shelter
in a small farm-house which stood within fifty yards of where
the fight began, and these were made prisoners. I happened to
climb over the same panel of fence with our captain, whose face
was a sight with blood from two bullet-wounds of the scalp. He
was not in a happy frame of mind, for he was swearing like a
trooper at the horse-holders for running away. The Yankees
peppered away at us as we scampered in quick time across the
<pb id="wyeth182" n="182"/>
space which lay between us and the thicket into which we dived
and disappeared from view.</p>
          <p>At this juncture the leading regiment of our main column
which had caught our runaway horses came up, and we
remounted and joined in the pursuit, Tom Quirk, as usual, out in
front, where at close quarters he killed a Federal trooper with his
pistol. Those who escaped fled in the direction of Cave City. <ref targOrder="U" id="ref28" n="28" rend="sc" target="note28">1</ref></p>
          <p>On the further march to Green River, which was crossed
before dark, we captured a huge sutler's wagon which the
stampeded owner had abandoned. Its contents were
unceremoniously appropriated, even to a box of women's shoes,
which the men gallantly distributed to the houses on the line of
march. That night we camped in the woods between
Hammondsville and Upton Station, on the Louisville&amp; Nashville
Railroad. All in all, it was the liveliest Christmas I had ever had.</p>
          <p>In the early morning of December 26th, while a light, drizzly
rain was falling, we struck the railroad at Uptons, capturing a
number of Union soldiers who were guarding the depot and this
section of the track. Here we were again joined by General
Morgan, and I witnessed a very interesting incident. Attached to
the General's staff was a telegraph operator, a quick-witted
young man about twenty-five years old named Ellsworth, better
known by the nickname of “Lightning.” On a former occasion
having tapped a wire and interposed his instrument—which,
being a pocket affair, did not always give the most perfect
<note id="note28" n="28" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref28">1 Colonel Grey, page 151, vol. xx, <hi rend="italics">Official Records</hi>, reports the Confederate
loss as “nine killed and, as near as I can ascertain, twenty-two wounded and five
prisoners.” The last item is correct, but none was killed and only two wounded. His
own loss he reports as “one killed and two captured.”</note>
<pb id="wyeth183" n="183"/>
satisfaction—its wobbling and uncertain tick aroused the
suspicion of the operator he was calling.</p>
          <p>“Who are you, and what's the matter with your office?” came
over the wire, and quick as a flash Ellsworth disarmed suspicion
by answering “O. K. Lightning,” which in the language of
telegraphy meant, “Go ahead; storm and lightning here
interfering.” This restored confidence at the other end, and
Ellsworth got not only the information he and his general
wanted, but also his nickname.</p>
          <p>At Uptons one of the men climbed a telegraph-pole, fastened
two strands of wire to the line on each side of the insulation, and
to these Ellsworth attached his instrument. Seated on a cross-tie
within a few feet of General Morgan, I heard him dictate
messages to be sent to General Boyle (who, I think, was military
governor of Kentucky), in Louisville, and to other Federal
commanders in that state, making inquiries as to the disposition
of the Union forces, and at the same time telling some awful
stories in regard to the large size of his own command and of its
movements. Among other answers received was one that a train
bearing some artillery and ammunition had left Elizabethtown on
its way to Mumfordsville. Morgan immediately ordered Quirk to
take his company and be ready to obstruct the track as soon as
the train should pass the point indicated. Unfortunately, the wary
engineer saw us in time to reverse his engine and escape with
the train before we could get behind him. The two pieces of
artillery were on a freight-car in plain view, and the few shots
we fired at the engineer were poor consolation for missing a
valuable capture.</p>
          <p>Heavy cannonading was now heard in the direction of Bacon
Creek Bridge stockade, which, after a gallant resistance, was
reduced, its garrison captured, and the bridge
<pb id="wyeth184" n="184"/>
destroyed. We took up our march toward toward Nolin, the next
station north of Uptons, where there was another bridge guarded
by a stockade. This garrison surrendered to General Duke, and
the bridge was also burned. We bivouacked that night a few
miles from Elizabethtown, which place, garrisoned by eight
companies of the Ninety-first Illinois Regiment, we captured
after a slight resistance on the next day, the number of prisoners
being six hundred and fifty-two men and officers.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref29" n="29" rend="sc" target="note29">1</ref> A number of
brick warehouses near the railroad station had been loopholed
and otherwise strengthened, and to make a direct assault upon
such a stronghold would have been folly. Morgan made a rapid
disposition of his forces, completely surrounding the town,
brought up his artillery, and after a number of shells and solid
shot had knocked great holes in the houses the garrison
surrendered. That night we slept in feather beds, the only
experience of this kind during the raid.</p>
          <p>While parleying for a surrender the colonel of this Union
regiment marched his men several times over the exposed
crest of a hill, then out of sight and around again, until I was
convinced he had several thousand in his command. Morgan was
too old a soldier, however, to be fooled by this ruse.</p>
          <p>On the 28th we reached the two great trestles on the
Louisville&amp; Nashville Railroad at Muldraugh's Hill, the
destruction of which was the most important object of the
expedition. They were each from sixty to seventy-five feet
high and about seven hundred feet in length, and constructed
entirely of wooden beams, or “bents,” superimposed one upon
another until the required height was
<note id="note29" n="29" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref29">1 <hi rend="italics">Official Records</hi>, vol. lxx, part 1, page 156. The garrisons captured at Bacon
Creek, Nolin, and Uptons belonged to this regiment.</note>
<pb id="wyeth185" n="185"/>
reached. They were deemed of such importance that two strong
stockades or forts had been built, and were then garrisoned by
the Seventy-first Indiana and Seventy-eighth Illinois regiments of
infantry. Morgan assailed both strongholds at the same time, the
artillery doing most of the execution, and in less than two hours
the two garrisons of seven hundred men were prisoners.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref30" n="30" rend="sc" target="note30">1</ref> This
was the second time that Morgan had captured the Indiana
regiment, and he directed Ellsworth to telegraph Governor
Morton of the Hoosier State, thanking him for again sending the
regiment down, and suggesting that the next time he could send
the oil-cloths and overcoats without the men, as he was tired of
paroling them. They were armed with new Enfield rifles, one of
the most effective weapons of that day.</p>
          <p>When we reached the stockade, from which some of the
enemy had escaped, we were ordered to scour the woods for
fugitives. About two or three hundred yards from the fort I came
upon a stripling, who, hearing some one approaching, bobbed up
from behind the trunk of a fallen tree and held up one hand in
token of surrender. As no one else was near, I took his gun—a
beautiful new Enfield rifle—and accouterments. He seemed
about my age, and I noticed tears running down over his
“peach-down cheeks.” His crying quickly aroused my sympathy, and I
tried to reassure him by saying: “Don't be afraid; nobody's going to harm you;
you'll be paroled right away and can go home.” At this he sobbed
out: “I've got a good mother at home, and if I ever get back I'll
never leave her again.” By this time my own feelings were
getting the better of me, and when he mentioned his mother the
thought of my own so overcame me that I could not keep the
tears out of my eyes as I said to him:
<note id="note30" n="30" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref30">1 <hi rend="italics">Official Records</hi>, vol. lxx, part 1, page 156.</note>
<pb id="wyeth186" n="186"/>
“I have a good mother, too, and don't you cry any more.” All this
occurred as we were walking side by side back to the stockade,
my war-spirit no little dampened and the pride of my capture
about lost in the sympathy for the captive.</p>
          <p>After burning the trestles, which made the most magnificent
bonfire I ever saw, the command moved to Rolling Fork River,
the greater portion of the troops crossing that night and
proceeding toward Bardstown.</p>
          <p>A detachment of five hundred men was sent under Colonel
Cluke to destroy the railroad bridge over Rolling Fork, but before
the stockade could be battered down a sharp rear-guard action
with a strong body of infantry, cavalry, and artillery, three
thousand strong, under Colonel John M. Harlan, later General,
and still later a Justice of the Supreme Court of the United States,
compelled his withdrawal. When Harlan's men came up with us
Quirk's company had been left as rear-guard, and took part in a
sharp engagement which occurred about ten o'clock on the
morning of December 29th. General Basil W. Duke, having
recrossed from the north side of the river, took command of
Cluke's regiment and Quirk's Scouts, which now formed the
entire rear-guard, and led an attack which was so vigorous that,
although he had but a handful of men, Colonel Harlan hesitated to
press his great advantage.</p>
          <p>At this crisis Duke was wounded while with our company. A
fragment of a well-aimed shrapnel struck him on the head and
stunned him. The same shell killed two of our horses. It made an
awful noise as it exploded. Quirk and others of the scouts hurried
to the fallen man, placed him astride the pommel of the saddle in
which our captain was seated, and, with the captain's arm around
the limp
<pb id="wyeth187" n="187"/>
body, the faithful animal was guided into the swollen stream.
Quirk and Duke were both small in stature, and the captain's
horse, a powerful bay, carried his double load safely across.
Another vicious shell burst in the water as we were floundering
across and splattered us. General Duke, being unconscious, was
the only man who wasn't scared.</p>
          <p>Had the Federal commander pushed his advantage in this
crisis, we must have lost heavily. As it was, we did not lose a
man, as our other wounded rode away on their horses. Colonel
Harlan reports his loss as three killed and one wounded. He
explained his cautious advance by saying, “Morgan had a larger
force than I.”</p>
          <p>Safely over the river, a carriage was impressed, filled with soft
bedding, and in this our wounded general was placed and carried
along with the command.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref31" n="31" rend="sc" target="note31">1</ref></p>
          <p>Our company was now ordered to ride through the command
and take the lead, which we did, reaching Bardstown at dusk,
where we found shelter in a livery stable and a sound sleep on a
corn-pile. Before leaving, between daylight and sunrise,
December 30th, I witnessed the looting of one of the largest
general stores in Bardstown. The proprietor had refused to
accept Confederate money for his goods, locked his store, and
left town. The men who had crowded in through the doors they
had battered down found great difficulty in making their way out
with their plunder through a surging crowd that pressed to get in
before everything was gone. I was amused at one trooper, who
induced others to let him out by holding an ax in front of him,
cutting edge forward, one arm clasping a bundle of at least a
dozen pairs of shoes and other plunder,
<note id="note31" n="31" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref31">1 General Basil W. Duke still survives at this date, 1914.</note>
<pb id="wyeth188" n="188"/>
while on his head was a pyramid of eight or ten soft hats, one on
top of the other, just as they had come out of the packing-box.
Within a short half-hour nothing but the shelves and counters
were left, for in the riot of an uncontrolled desire to plunder these
men took piles of stuff they could not carry away or use.</p>
          <p>It was still clear, and yet colder than we had thus far
experienced, as we marched in the direction of Springfield. Our
spirits were high, for up to this time we had had a picnic, and as
we passed a home of the Trappist brotherhood some ten miles up
the road Lieutenant Frank Brady entertained us by singing “Lorena,”
a war-time poem which had been set to music and was
then very popular. He told us that the author of the poem was an
inmate of this Trappist home. If this were true and the self-imprisoned
brother heard the sweet voice of the cavalier as he
sang, “The years creep slowly by, Lorena,” what sad and tender
memories it must have awakened!</p>
          <p>I recall two verses:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>The years creep slowly by, Lorena;</l>
            <l>The snow is on the grass again;</l>
            <l>The sun's low down the sky, Lorena;</l>
            <l>The frost is where the flowers have been.</l>
          </lg>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>But the heart beats on as warmly now</l>
            <l>As when the summer days were nigh:</l>
            <l>The sun can never dip so low</l>
            <l>Adown affection's cloudless sky.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>I may not be doing the author strict justice in quoting from
memory. There was one other line that told of the past being “in
the eternal past,” upon which our tenor dwelt feelingly as he sang
it. All of which, no doubt, will provoke a smile from the pupils of
Debussy, Wagner, <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">et id omne</foreign></hi>;
<pb id="wyeth189" n="189"/>
yet I would rather hear my debonair comrade of “The
Scouts” sing that war-time song again as we began our ride of
thirty-two miles through a blizzard than listen to the so-called
music of the “immortals” at our beautiful Metropolitan Opera
House.</p>
          <p>By midday the clouds had gathered and a chilling rain set in,
which, as the thermometer fell, turned into sleet. Reaching
Springfield in the gloom of the evening (December 30th), our
company was ordered to keep on to the suburbs of Lebanon,
some nine miles farther, and there to drive in the pickets and
build fires for as long a line on that side of town as possible, in
order to give the enemy the impression that we were up in force
and were only awaiting for daylight to attack. We piled fence-rails
and made fires until late at night, while Morgan was leading
his men south along a narrow and not much used country road,
with Lebanon some two miles to the left. Having completed our
work, we caught up with the command, and acted as rear-guard
throughout the remainder of that awful night. What with the
bitter, penetrating cold, the fatigue, the overwhelming desire to
sleep, so difficult to overcome, and, under the conditions we
were experiencing, so fatal if yielded to, the numerous halts to
get the artillery out of bad places, the impenetrable darkness, and
the inevitable confusion which attends the moving of troops and
artillery along a narrow country road, we put in a night of such
misery and anxiety and suffering that no man who
experienced it could ever forget.</p>
          <p>Toward morning it became our chief duty to keep one another
awake. All through the night the sleet pelted us unmercifully and
covered our coats and oil-cloths with a sheet of ice. Time and
again we dismounted and, holding
<pb id="wyeth190" n="190"/>
on to the stirrup leather, trudged on through the slush
and ice to keep from freezing.</p>
          <p>Daylight found us several miles south of Lebanon and the
strong Federal command concentrated there to catch us, but we
kept on without halting, for another heavy column was reported
moving out from Mumfordsville and Glasgow to intercept us at
Columbia or Burkesville before we could recross the Cumberland
River.</p>
          <p>About midday (December 31st) we stopped for an hour to feed
and rest, and then rode on to Campbellville, where we arrived at
dark, having been thirty-six hours in the saddle since leaving
Bardstown. Here we rested eight hours, and early on New-Year's
day, 1863, left for Columbia, which we reached late in the
afternoon, and then on throughout the whole bitter-cold night
without stopping, until we passed through Burkesville on the
morning of January 2d, where we recrossed the Cumberland and
were safe from pursuit or interception. Since leaving Bardstown
we had, with the exception of nine hours, been seventy-two hours
in the saddle. I doubt if any troops in the entire history of the war
ever passed through a more trying ordeal than Morgan's cavalry
on this expedition. Of it General Basil W. Duke writes: “It is
common to hear men who served in Morgan's command through
all its career of trial and hardship refer to this night march around
Lebanon as the most trying scene of their entire experience.”</p>
          <p>It was not so much the bitter cold which bothered us
as the slow going of the artillery. As long as we could
stick to the turnpikes we moved swiftly. It was when
driven to the ill-kept dirt roads that our troubles began,
and in the pitch-darkness of a stormy winter's night, with
the most severe blizzard raging that that section had ever
<pb id="wyeth191" n="191"/>
known, they multiplied. For the entire night in the ride around
Lebanon we made only seven miles. Climbing Muldraugh's Hill,
we not only double-teamed the guns, but long lines of men on
foot pushed and pulled to help the weary horses. Every piece
was brought out safely over the Cumberland. We now took it
leisurely to Livingston, and then to Liberty, Tennessee, where on
January 6, 1863, we resumed our place on the right wing of Bragg's
army.</p>
          <p>This was Morgan's most successful enterprise. He had
destroyed the Louisville&amp; Nashville Railroad from
Mumfordsville to Shepherdsville, within eighteen miles of
Louisville, captured 1,877 prisoners, destroyed a vast amount of
United <sic corr="States">State</sic> property, and had lost only 2 men killed, 24
wounded, and 64 missing. His command returned well armed as a
result of its captures, and better mounted than when it set out.
The country along the line of march had been stripped of its
horses. Every man in my company led out an extra mount.</p>
          <p>Moreover, Morgan had demonstrated again that genius of
leadership which divined the plans and movements of the enemy
in time to elude him. He had still further won the devotion of the
men who followed his fortunes and who believed in him implicitly.
I wonder now that after having succeeded in the object of his
expedition, which culminated with the destruction of the
Muldraugh's Hill trestles, he did not turn on Harlan and capture or
destroy him, which he could easily have done. He could then at
leisure have retraced his steps to Tennessee.</p>
          <p>All things considered, we had moved with great celerity.
Despite the hindrance of artillery, the shortness of the winter
days, and the rough roads in the hilly country before we reached
Glasgow, the two all-night marches around
<pb id="wyeth192" n="192"/>
Lebanon and from Columbia to Burkesville, we had marched two
hundred and seventy-one miles and fought ten engagements. On
Christmas Day we marched thirty miles, notwithstanding an
hour's delay in the fight at Bear Wallow, and the next day made
twenty-five miles, besides capturing the garrison at Uptons, the
stockades at Bacon Creek and Nolin, and destroying the two
bridges there.</p>
          <p>In our absence the great battle of Murfreesboro had been
fought. The Confederates had captured some thirty pieces of
artillery and had lost four; and, although Rosecrans was finally
victorious in that Bragg retreated a day's march to Tullahoma, he
had hammered his opponent so hard that it took him from January
1st to June 24th before he was again ready to advance. In this
enforced delay Morgan's destruction of the Louisville&amp; Nashville
Railroad was an important factor.</p>
          <p>I have made no attempt to narrate the many acts of personal
bravery which took place on this exciting expedition, but there
were two occurrences of such an extraordinary character that I
must find place for them. The first of these encounters took place
about ten o'clock on the morning of December 31st, as the
rear-guard was crossing Salt River, some five or six miles south of
Lebanon. Captain Alexander Tribble, Lieutenant George B.
Eastin, and a private soldier had been sent on a detour to New
Market, four or five miles from the line of march, to secure a
supply of shoes which were reported stored at that point. As
they were returning to overtake the command they were set upon
and pursued by a squad of Federal cavalry. Being well mounted,
the three kept a safe distance ahead of their pursuers. Glancing
backward in a long, straight stretch of road, they observed as the
chase proceeded that all but
<pb id="wyeth193" n="193"/>
three of the enemy had checked up, and they determined at the
first favorable place to ride to one side and await their
approach and attack them.</p>
          <p>The place selected was the ford at Salt River. At this point
Eastin checked his horse and turned sharply to the right,
concealing himself under the bank. Tribble continued into the
middle of the stream, which here was about fifty yards wide,
and stopped his horse where the water was about two feet
deep. For reasons satisfactory to himself the private soldier kept
on, leaving the two officers to confront the three Federals, who
were now in sight coming at full speed toward the river and
strung out from fifty to one hundred yards apart. The leading
Federal turned out to be Colonel Dennis J. Halisey, of the Sixth
Kentucky Cavalry. As he came near Eastin the latter fired at
him with his six-shooter, which fire Halisey returned. Both
missed; and, as Eastin now had the drop on his adversary,
Halisey threw up his hands in token of surrender. As Eastin
approached him, having lowered his weapon, Halisey fired,
again missing, whereupon Eastin shot Halisey through the head,
killing him instantly, his body falling from his horse into the river.</p>
          <p>While this combat was taking place the next in order of the
Federals had closed with Captain Tribble. These two opened
fire without effect, when Tribble spurred his horse alongside of
his adversary, threw his arms around him, and dragged him with
himself from the saddle into the river. Luckily, Tribble fell on top
and strangled his enemy into surrender. At this moment the third
Union trooper came on the scene, only to throw up his hands
and surrender to the two Confederates.</p>
          <p>The second incident illustrates another phase of our war
<pb id="wyeth194" n="194"/>
and almost justifies the term “Civil,” which some writers apply
to it.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref32" n="32" rend="sc" target="note32">1</ref> Five of our men on one of the numerous side expeditions,
or scouts, came unexpectedly face to face and within a few
yards of about the same number of Federal cavalry, just as each
party reached the crest of a sharp rise or hill in the road. The
surprise was mutual, the situation serious. The men were
experienced enough to know that on such equal terms neither
would surrender to the other without a hand-to-hand fight or
killing. With wonderful presence of mind the Union officer at the
head of his squad said, “Don't raise your guns,” and the lieutenant
of the other side quickly responded, “Don't raise yours,” and
they rode past one another, saluting, and went their respective
ways. It reads like a romance, but it is true. It is not a bit more
seemingly improbable than an incident in which I took part in
another campaign later on, and which I shall describe elsewhere.</p>
          <p>Our war was full of pathos, and the tragedy of it makes the
chivalric and pathetic side stand out in bolder relief. There is a
man still living (1914) in Chattanooga, Tennessee, a man of affairs,
who captured his own brother, who was seated by the fireside
holding his mother's hand. The two armies were near each other,
and each of the sons had obtained leave for the night to pass into
the intervening neutral zone to see his mother. The one who
came last saw through a crack the other seated by the fire,
opened the door quickly, gun in hand, and cried: “Throw up your
hands; you're my prisoner!” The trio chatted till late, and then
<note id="note32" n="32" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref32">1 This occurrence was detailed to me by Hugh Garvin of our command. He was
a true soldier, always where he ought to have been, and entirely reliable in every
respect. After the war he became a physician at Cave City, Kentucky, and died
there a few years ago, beloved and respected by all.</note>
<pb id="wyeth195" n="195"/>
the prisoner went with his captor into the Union lines. It was
largely a family affair. When I was captured I was guarded the
first night by men from a company in the Tenth Illinois Infantry,
of which my first cousin, Thomas Smith, of Morgan County, was
captain.</p>
          <p>In February, leading my “captured” horse, I started on the long
ride to my home. It rained almost incessantly for two days and
nights, until every stream became a torrent, and some of them
difficult and not altogether safe, especially while trying to cross
with two animals. When I reached Paint Rock River it had
overflowed its banks; and, the Tennessee being full, the
back-water had flooded the lowlands, until where I had to cross it was
over a mile from shore to shore. The hospitable citizen who gave
me shelter for the night informed me that the ferryman who lived
on the far side had tied up his boat and quit, as the general
overflow had put an end to all travel.</p>
          <p>One of the great advantages of being raised in the backwoods
is that every boy and man learns of necessity the use of tools and
gets in the habit of overcoming difficulties. My good host said I
could stay with him till the river fell. He thought in four or five
days the road might be open. Early next morning another traveler
on horseback came on the scene. He and I formed a partnership,
borrowed an ax and an auger, cut three good ash logs of proper
length, pinned them together into a fairly respectable raft, and
with one pole and a bit of plank for a paddle we started on a
voyage of discovery. It was half a mile to the river proper, and
the rails of the corduroy road-bed had floated and made
navigation difficult, but we were yet in dead-water and could take
our time.</p>
          <p>When we arrived at the river's edge we found the current
<pb id="wyeth196" n="196"/>
booming swiftly toward the Tennessee, several miles farther on.
Away on the other side, a half-mile across, we could see the
coveted ferryboat where the retiring ferryman had tied it when he
suspended operations. The opening of the roadway on that side
was narrow—not over twenty feet—and if in crossing we failed
to hit it exactly right we would have to continue our journey
indefinitely down-stream and take our chances of finding a
landing-place somewhere down on the Tennessee; so we poled our raft
through the still water far enough up-stream to give us good
leeway, paddled across the swift current, and hit the opening in
great style. I heard of one colored brother who indiscreetly
inquired of another, “What wuz de price o' dem new britches what
you got on?” and the reply was<sic corr=",">.</sic> “How'd I know. De shopkeeper
wasn't dar.” My partner and I never asked the price of this
ferriage. We took the boat, pulled back for our three horses,
ferried ourselves across, and went our way rejoicing. That night I
reported as present and accounted for to my anxious mother and
father, and they sat up to a late hour listening to my story of how I
had “seen the army.”</p>

FOURTH ALABAMA CAVALRY</head>
          <p>MY brief partisan-ranger service as a “bushwhacker,” and the
trying and exciting experience as an “independent” with
Morgan's cavalry, in 1862 and early in 1863, only whetted the
desire to engage regularly in the active business of the war. In
February I had asked Captain Tom Quirk at Liberty, Tennessee,
where “the Scouts” were stationed after the Christmas raid was
over, if I might not join his company. Evidently, Lieutenant Frank
Brady, who felt responsible for my leaving home and going on
the great ride through Kentucky, had talked my case over with
the captain and had advised him not to let me enlist, as I was
under age, and he thought I ought to report to my parents. Quirk
frankly told me he would like to keep me with his company, but
on account of my size and age he didn't think it would be best,
and asked me to go home, talk it over with my parents, and, later
on, if they consented and I still cared to come to him, he would
take me.</p>
          <p>I was greatly disappointed at this, for I had fallen in love with
my Kentucky comrades, especially with the Scouts, for they
were as gallant a lot of horsemen as ever sat in the saddle. They
had volunteered early in the war, and with John H. Morgan and
Basil W. Duke had done some wonderful work and won undying
fame as “Morgan's old squadron.” When I joined them at
Alexandria and asked to be
<pb id="wyeth198" n="198"/>
allowed to go on the raid they never bothered about asking
me what my full name was. Captain Quirk hailed me as “Little
Johnny,” and after that I never had any other name while with
Morgan's men.</p>
          <p>After the final consultation with my parents the conclusion
was that I had better join one of the cavalry companies
from my native county already in service in a famous regiment,
the Fourth Alabama, known also as “Russell's regiment.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref33" n="33" rend="sc" target="note33">1</ref> So
early in April I was regularly enrolled as a private in Company I,
joining the command then doing outpost duty near Eagleville, on
the turnpike leading north from Shelbyville, Tennessee, to Triune
and Nashville. Russell's Fourth Alabama was justly ranked as one
of the best cavalry regiments in the service. In its organization a
valuable military lesson may be learned—namely, the
sandwiching of raw and untrained soldiers between true and tried
veterans. The negroes had a saying that “It takes an old dog to
teach a pup how to fight.” Among the first troops to go to the
front from Alabama were four mounted companies, and these
were fortunate enough to be included in a battalion of cavalry
under Lieutenant-Colonel Nathan Bedford Forrest. Anybody who
knows anything about the Civil War knows what that meant. He
led them, and they followed “close up” at Sacramento and at Fort
Henry.</p>
          <p>At Fort Donelson, when everybody else was whipped and
cowed and wanted to surrender, Forrest told the commanding
officers not to include him and his men in the cartel, as he had no
notion of surrendering. Napoleon said that the supreme test of
courage was at four o'clock in the morning.
<note id="note33" n="33" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref33">1 In distinction from another regiment under General Roddy, which is
sometimes mentioned in the reports as the Fourth Alabama Cavalry.</note>
<pb id="wyeth199" n="199"/>
Near this hour on that cold, cheerless, and desolate February
morning the grim fighter roused his tired and sleepy troopers
from under their snow-covered blankets, called them about him,
and said: “Men, they are going to surrender this fort and this
army at daybreak. I am going out. The way is open. Get on
your horses.” They rode safely away without seeing one
solitary Federal soldier. Every man surrendered there, who
could have walked four miles between four and six o'clock A.M.,
could have come away and left General Grant the empty
triumph of a “last year's bird's nest.”</p>
          <p>These same men were with him at Shiloh, where they rode
squarely in among Sherman's infantry, and for at least once
during our four years' war men on foot were jabbing bayonets at
men on horseback. When their twelve months' enlistment had
expired they re-enlisted “for the war,” and to these four old
companies as a nucleus were added
six new companies of mounted troops, all from Alabama,
and the new regiment was christened Russell's Fourth Alabama
in honor of the brave, grim doctor who laid aside the spatula and
scalpel for the sword and six-shooter.</p>
          <p>Most of these recent volunteers made excellent soldiers, and
with the example and prestige of the “old Forresters” they
became a splendid body of fighters. Within two months of their
organization two of the new companies, under the leadership of
the daring Captain Frank Gurley, rode over and captured a
section of artillery at Lexington, Tennessee, the orderly sergeant
of one company being blown bodily from his horse at the
cannon's mouth. They captured in addition the redoubtable
Colonel Robert G. Ingersoll and troops of the Eleventh Illinois,
Second
<pb id="wyeth200" n="200"/>
West Tennessee, and Fifth Ohio Cavalry, and were bulletined by
General Forrest for “exceptional gallantry” on this and other
occasions. One of the proudest moments of my life as a soldier
was when, at Anderson's Cross Roads, on October 2, 1863, as a
brigade which had been sent to the front to beat off a train-guard
came back beaten and demoralized, General Wheeler galloped
up to our commander and said, “Colonel Russell, you will have
to go in with the Fourth Alabama.” Our grim old colonel came
nearer smiling than I ever saw him as he saluted and gave the
order, “Cap your guns, men!” We made short work of it.</p>
          <p>The men and horses were in generally good condition when I
joined the company, although the equipment was far from
sufficient. An official inspection had just been made, and the
report of March 6, 1863, shows that out of seven hundred men
present for duty in this regiment four hundred were as yet without
arms.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref34" n="34" rend="sc" target="note34">1</ref> Nothing could better demonstrate the difficulties with
which the South was contending. The four old companies were
splendidly equipped with guns and army pistols which they had
captured. The others carried long muzzle-loading Austrian or
Belgian rifles, a clumsy weapon for mounted men. Some had
double-barreled shotguns, a very effective weapon at close
quarters—seventy-five yards or less. Army pistols were scarce,
and no sabres were carried. I furnished myself with a captured
Burnside carbine, for which I paid fifty dollars, and an army
six-shooter, and as far as my mount was concerned there was not
in all the seven hundred a horse more beautiful, intelligent, or
swifter of foot than my thoroughbred Fanny. The hard
campaign with Morgan had left her in the best of condition for
service.</p>

          <pb id="wyeth201" n="201"/>
          <p>The only tent in our regiment belonged to Colonel Russell. The
rest of us lived out of doors, with the dome of heaven for our
covering. When night came on we slept on the ground, wherever
we happened to be, provided we were not on picket or doing
guard duty. When it rained, if in bivouac we leaned two rails or
poles against a tree or a fence-panel, laid an oil-cloth over these,
spread another oil-cloth on leaves or bushes, then a saddle-blanket;
and then, with our saddles for pillows, two of us went to
bed with an extra blanket for cover. When the rainfall was
extraordinarily heavy, in cloudburst fashion, as occasionally
happened, there was nothing to do but sit or stand up and take it
good humoredly when we could, or the other way when patience
and patriotism succumbed for the time being to the suffering
which cold and loss of sleep entailed.</p>
          <p>I recall one night, when a young deluge was let down on us,
with several inches of water on the ground, I placed two flat rails
across the angle of a worm-fence, and, protected by a
waterproof blanket, slept the sleep of the weary, unmindful of the
heavy downpour. When day broke, as far as one could see the
top of the fence on both sides of the pike was occupied by
troopers in every possible attitude of discomfort. We didn't mind
so much the rains of summer-time; but the winter rains, the sleet,
the snow, and the biting wind made us think of home and wish
“the cruel war was over.” One great misfortune was that most of
the men did not have oil-cloths or blankets enough to protect
them properly, and now, as I look back on all this physical
discomfort and misery, to which add short rations of food—and
most of the time the little we got was bad—I marvel that our
army stood up as long as it did. The truth is the men were in dead
earnest to win out for the Southern Confederacy.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth202" n="202"/>
          <p>We had what by courtesy was called a commissary, took with
grateful appreciation all it offered, and made up the deficit by
foraging. Now, foraging is a science and an art which can only
be acquired by experience. I messed with the captain and the
first lieutenant of my company. Our utensils and housekeeping outfit consisted
of a small frying-pan, a skillet, and one canteen which held three
pints. We fried our bacon or other meat in one and mixed the
meal dough and cooked it into bread in the other. At meal-time we
drank in regular order from the canteen. Custom required that the
last drinker should dry off the canteen's mouth before passing it.
The nearest approach to a napkin was a handkerchief, and when
this had not been recently laundered the palm of the hand
sufficed.</p>
          <p>Buttermilk was the one great luxury of the mess, and as I was
so youthful and small, and in appearance so generally suggestive
of helplessness and hunger, the captain and the lieutenant detailed
me with great regularity to scour the surrounding territory for this
essential. As a rule I rarely came in with an empty canteen. The
Confederate cavalry subsisted chiefly on corn—as roasting-ears
when green or half ripe, and parched, or as hominy, when ripe.
Corn-bread was the great standby. Wheat flour we rarely saw,
and we used to say the infantry got it all. Coffee and tea were
unknown, and sugar was as scarce as flour.</p>
          <p>Dr. Will Fennell was the captain of Company I, and it was
chiefly on his account that I had joined it. He had studied
medicine, and was just commencing practice when the war broke
out. He volunteered as assistant surgeon in a regiment in the
Army of Northern Virginia. At the battle of Seven Pines, as the
wounded were not coming in fast enough to suit him, he had
borrowed a gun and gone into the fight just
<pb id="wyeth203" n="203"/>
in time to be severely wounded. During his convalescence at
home he amused himself by drumming up a company of
volunteers for the cavalry service, and, having been made
captain, he gave up his place as surgeon. He was a fine type of
man, sober, fearless, reliable, and withal just a little bit too
quick-tempered. He and the second lieutenant, Sam Browning, would
have come to blows on one occasion if we privates had not by
expostulation and interference prevented it. Captain Fennell
ordered Browning to perform some duty. The latter resented the
tone and bearing of his superior, saying, “Captain Fennell, you
wouldn't dare to speak to me that way if you didn't have those
bars on your collar.” Off went the captain's coat, and as he was
squaring for action he remarked, “Lieutenant, the bars are off.” It
was a matter of great regret to me that on account of ill health he
was compelled to leave the service.</p>
          <p>Between the Federal picket-line and ours, extending the fifteen
or twenty miles of front along which the cavalry of either army
was strung out, was a strip of country about four miles in width
known as the neutral zone. An important part of the duty to
which I was assigned was to make frequent excursions across
this zone to obtain all possible information from the citizens living
near the Union lines, especially from those who had access to
their encampments. Practically all residents of this section of
middle Tennessee were intensely Southern in sympathy.</p>
          <p>About half a mile north of Little Harpeth River, where the pike
to Triune crosses, east of the road some four hundred yards stood
a substantial brick farm-house. A carriageway led from the gate
on the pike straight to the front yard through a beautiful field then
green with clover. From a rise of ground in the turnpike, two
hundred yards
<pb id="wyeth204" n="204"/>
farther north of this gate, could be seen the Federal videttes as
they sat on their horses. I visited at this house a number of times
and made the acquaintance of the family. They were in good
circumstances. The Federals being so near, naturally they also
found their way there frequently. It was only half a mile from
their outpost, and fully three miles to ours. The male members of
the household were away in our army. The mother and the two
young girls, about fourteen and sixteen years old, were all of the
family I can recall.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref35" n="35" rend="sc" target="note35">1</ref> The oldest girl told me that Colonel
Brownlow, of the First Tennessee Union Cavalry, or some of his
officers rode out nearly every afternoon. They were polite enough
“to keep on the good side of the Yankees,” and equally loyal to
me; for she gave me all the Northern newspapers she could
obtain from them, and any other information. I usually started on
these excursions before daylight, and on Fanny it did not take long
to go three or four miles on a good Tennessee pike. The Louisville
<hi rend="italics">Journal</hi> I remember as one of the important papers we were
glad to get from that side of the line.</p>
          <p>Realizing that this could not go on indefinitely without discovery,
I took every precaution to prevent surprise. On the morning of my
last visit I had with me two very reliable men, and when we
reached the big gate I left it open and told them to ride to the rise
in the road in sight of the pickets, and if the Yankees charged
them to yell a warning to me, save themselves by a run for camp,
and I would escape by a back way across the fields. The one
embarrassing feature of a run down the pike was the river,
<note id="note35" n="35" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref35">1 The younger of these daughters was still living in this house in 1907, wife of
a Mr. Wommack, who, I think, is a preacher. He wrote me that the elder one,

<pb id="wyeth205" n="205"/>
half a mile away, which, while not wide, was deep enough to
stop the full speed of a horse or cause him to fall if not checked
up. With a good start, however, this could be crossed before the
pursuers were close enough to shoot with accuracy, and it would
impede them as well.</p>
          <p>When about two-thirds of the way from the gate to the house, I
was startled to see my little friend standing in the hall and well
back from the door, where she could not be seen from the
outside, waving her hand, and evidently signaling me to turn back,
as there was danger. I wheeled at once and rode at full speed to
rejoin my two comrades. As I neared them they threw up their
guns and shouted to me: “Here they come!” I exclaimed
quickly, “Don't shoot!” and in another instant I was on the rise
where they were stationed and could see coming toward us, but
as yet about four hundred yards away, a squadron of from fifteen
to twenty Union troopers. Naturally, our first thought was to run
full tilt for camp, but the river just in our rear made that a
dangerous experiment, to be avoided if possible; and so we
concluded to try to “bluff them off,” and the three of us lined up
across the pike, lowered our guns, and sat stock-still. They came
on in a walk until they had reached a slight elevation about three
hundred yards from us, where they halted in a line that stretched
the full width of the roadway.</p>
          <p>I saw one of them raise his field-glasses, and while he still held
them to his eyes every second trooper turned back and
disappeared behind the hill. They evidently suspected us of trying
to lead them into an ambuscade; so we waved our hats and,
shouting, “Come on, boys!” turned and rode leisurely away,
keeping our eyes on them until we were out of sight below the
crest of the hill. As yet they had not
<pb id="wyeth206" n="206"/>
budged, but as soon as we could no longer be seen we put the
spurs to our horses and went at full speed toward the river,
across which we floundered without accident and made our way
safely to our lines. Had they rushed us from the start our situation
would have been precarious in the extreme. I need scarcely add
that this was my last visit to this house.</p>
          <p>Scouting and picket duty, foraging for one's self and horse, and
attending drills on alternate days made a busy life of it. Our rule
was four consecutive hours on post, and at night it was at times
almost impossible to stay awake, especially toward morning, when
stationed at some lonesome spot where not a sound could be
heard except the hoot or screech of the owls, the cry of a
whippoorwill, or the chirp of the grasshoppers or katydids. It was
against orders to dismount, but I remember on one occasion the
only way I could keep from going to sleep was to mount and
dismount for minutes at a time, and to repeat this performance
until fully aroused.</p>
          <p>Just at daylight on May 5, 1863, the outpost picket fired his gun,
and, closely pursued by six Federal cavalrymen, came at full
speed to the reserve. Lieutenant John Gibson, officer of the guard,
followed by a man named Julian, mounted at once and raced in
the direction of the enemy, who now faced about and started as
fast as their horses could carry them back toward Triune. A
dozen of us threw our saddles on and joined in the chase. One of
the Yankee horses went down, and a comrade checked his horse, took
the unseated man up behind him, and tried to escape. The double
weight told on the animal, and, seeing they were being overhauled,
the two dismounted, knelt in the road, and fired their carbines at
Gibson, now two hundred yards
<pb id="wyeth207" n="207"/>
in advance of Julian, who was about the same distance ahead of
the others of the reserve. One of the balls struck the big sorrel
just above the eye and crashed into his brain, killing him instantly.
As he was going at a full run, some idea of the jolt the plucky
lieutenant received when he struck the hard road-bed may be
imagined. Stunned as he was, he staggered to his feet, revolver
in hand, and advanced on the two desperate Federals, who,
seeing Julian approaching and the guard right up, surrendered to
Gibson. The other four made good their escape.</p>
          <p>Had these men been caught two weeks later they would in all
likelihood have fared badly, for an important incident occurred at
this time which embittered the Fourth Alabama against the First
Tennessee (Union). A corn-detail sent into the neutral zone was
set upon by a scouting party of the enemy and fled after two of
the detail had been wounded. The citizens who owned the corn
testified that Brownlow's troopers had ruthlessly put both the
wounded men to death as they were lying helpless on the ground.
The evidence was so convincing that reprisals were determined
upon. I happened to be one of the detachment sent out on this
expedition, and we had gone ahead of the corn-detail to guard it
from attack. The Federals had evidently come out during the
night, and were lying in wait for the corn-carriers, and in this way
they were not discovered by us. As soon as the firing began we
raced in that direction and drove the assailants away. In their
precipitate retreat one was thrown from his horse and escaped
into the dense cedar brakes or thickets which are numerous in
this section and can only be traversed by a man on foot. As
Fanny was the fastest animal in our scouting party, I happened to
get ahead and capture the horse and outfit. Within a week two of
this
<pb id="wyeth208" n="208"/>
command were caught and shot. The men comprising this
regiment were almost wholly from the mountain country of east
Tennessee, where the people were about equally divided in their
political affiliations. They were a hardy lot, and neither they nor
the men from the mountain region just over the line in northern
Alabama took the trouble to refer their grievances to the proper
authorities for settlement, as the following dispatch may testify:</p>

came as a patient and remained in my private hospital for several

enough under the influence of the anesthetic, as I was proceeding
to operate on him, to lose control of his tongue. He then said, “Dr.
Wyeth, this isn't the first time you and I have seen each other,”
and to quiet him I said: “That's all right, Captain. Just keep quiet
and go to sleep.” But the spell was on him, the control was gone,
and the memory cells of those awful experiences came into
action as he continued: “Yes; I know it's all right, and I trust you
with my life; but there was a

time, when you were in Russell's regiment and I was in
Brownlow's, when we wouldn't have been talking to each other

assure him as emphatically as I was able that old scores were
forgotten and forgiven and that his vote of confidence had
touched me deeply.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref37" n="37" rend="sc" target="note37">1</ref></p>

COVERING THE RETREAT FROM TULLAHOMA—THE
27TH OF JUNE, 1863</head>
          <p>FROM about June 20, 1863, the increased activity of the
Union cavalry gave every indication of the long-looked-for
general advance of Rosecrans's army. There was hardly a day
that we were not in collision with their videttes, and on June
27th we retired to Shelbyville, where we arrived about two
o'clock in the afternoon, just in time to take part in the opening of
one of the liveliest experiences which fell to my lot. On the way
back my horse cast a front shoe; and as the farrier and forge had
gone ahead, the shoe could not be replaced at once. The hard
macadamized road caused a split in Fanny's hoof, which soon
became so tender that she hobbled in on three legs. For the last
mile I led her on foot. When I reached the battle-line which was
forming, on account of my lame horse I was ordered back to the
wagon-train, which was still in sight. Here I found a man
belonging to my company who had a fairly good horse. He
readily consented to take charge of Fanny with the wagons, so I
transferred my saddle to my new mount and hurried back to the
company just in time to go out on the skirmish-line.</p>
          <p>Some of our cavalry which had been handled roughly at
Hoover's Gap were coming in at a lively pace; and although the
sun was now shining, it had rained hard for an hour or
<pb id="wyeth211" n="211"/>
two in the forenoon, and these flying troopers, all bespattered
with mud, presented a rather demoralized appearance which
afforded us no little merriment at their expense. The pursuers
checked up when they came in sight of our line of battle and
formed theirs in full view, a half-mile in our front. I had scarcely
reached my place with the skirmishers when their long line
began to advance. We were some two hundred yards in front of
our main line, and the videttes deployed at intervals of about one
hundred yards. When the Federal skirmisher, who was coming
directly toward me, was about eighty yards off I thought it was
about time to try to stop him, and, taking as steady an aim as was
possible from the back of a restless horse, I fired. Instead of
returning the shot from his saddle he dismounted, and, holding on
to the bridle, rested the barrel of his gun against a tree.</p>
          <p>We were in an open wooded bit of ground, and, fortunately for
me, there were other trees than the one he was using. Some
twenty feet to my right was an oak of good size, and when I
realized I had missed him and he was taking such deliberate aim
at me I put the spurs to my horse and tried to get my body behind
it. As the horse jumped the Yankee's gun went off, and when I
was within two or three feet of the tree I saw the bark fly as the
bullet struck the trunk and glanced off. Either it or a good-sized
piece of bark struck me on the left side of the abdomen, and for
the moment I was sure it had gone through me, for my left leg
became immediately numb. My gun being empty, I had let it drop
to the sling over my shoulder to which it was attached for safety
and glanced quickly at the place where I had been struck. As
there was no bleeding, I was reassured at once that the ball had
not penetrated.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth212" n="212"/>
          <p>All this happened within a few seconds, and by this time my
antagonist, doubtless thinking he had disabled me, had remounted
and was coming right at me. As he came on at full speed I arose
on tiptoe in the stirrups and shot at him four times with my army
pistol; but my horse was rearing and behaving so badly that I
failed to stop him. Incidentally he was popping away at me with
his pistol at the same time. As I fired the fourth shot he was so
close I could have thrown the pistol and hit him with it. At the flash
of this shot he reeled in his saddle, fell or leaned over on the other
side from me, pulled the bridle on that side, turned, and, to my great
relief, urged his horse at full speed toward his comrades, who
were advancing in line of battle and were now not over two
hundred yards away. I followed him some fifty yards as he still
clung to the saddle, gave him a parting shot, and then turned back
to where I belonged.</p>
          <p>This horseback duel had taken place in plain view of the
regiment and excited no little interest, for as it ended a wild
cheer went up from our line of battle, and I only then realized
how foolish I had been. This conviction was emphasized by the
remark of a comrade who had gone out with Forrest early in the
war and knew what soldiering really was. Fearing I was in
danger, he had started to my assistance, and as I rode up to him
on my way back he said, “John, you are the damnedest fool I
ever saw.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref38" n="38" rend="sc" target="note38">1</ref></p>
          <p>I had scarcely taken my place with my company when the
enemy's bugles sounded the charge, and their whole line came on
at a gallop. We gave them a volley; but I doubt if this would have
stopped them if General Wheeler had not
<note id="note38" n="38" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref38">1 Dr. 
C. A. (Meck) Robinson, of Huntsville, one of the bravest and best

posted a battery, which at this juncture opened on them. As they
broke under this unexpected development—for the guns had
been masked—we charged and drove them in considerable
disorder on their reserves, which were constantly coming on the
field. At this advance I recall hearing a ball strike the chest of
one of our men which sounded as if some one had slapped him
with the palm of the hand. It went through one lung and passed
out below the shoulder-blade.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref39" n="39" rend="sc" target="note39">1</ref></p>
          <p>For the entire afternoon this kind of fighting was going on, with
charge and countercharge, with no material advantage to either
side, until late in the day near sundown. I did not know it then,
but General Wheeler told me years after the war that when the
fight began the road was jammed with loaded wagons filing
slowly toward and over the narrow bridge across Duck River,
two miles in our rear, and that his fighting was to hold the enemy
off and save as much of the train as possible.</p>
          <p>Had the Federal commander been less cautious he could have
run over us, battery and all, in the first hour of the fight, as he did
later when the sun was setting, and taken us with the train,
which was now safe. As the bridge was clear, General Wheeler
withdrew the artillery and all the troops except our regiment,
which he left in line across the pike with orders to stand our
ground as long as possible. As the battery disappeared the Union
commander ordered a general advance, and as we sat on our
horses, ranged along the crest of a gentle rise, I witnessed one
of the most magnificent cavalry charges made during the war.
For a mile at least the open country in our front was in plain
view, and
<note id="note39" n="39" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref39">1 This man and another young soldier (Polk Wright) from Huntsville, who was
shot here through one lung, also recovered.</note>
<pb id="wyeth214" n="214"/>
it was blue with thousands of Federal soldiers, for Stanley's corps
was coming on the field, ten thousand in all, as the official reports
show. Had we been wise our small band would have scattered at
once into the woods to the east and saved itself, instead of
waiting to be ridden over. But we had our orders to wait until they
were within easy range, fire, and then “<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">sauve qui peut.</foreign></hi>” The
Seventh Pennsylvania came on in front, in columns of fours, in
gallant style, and just behind galloped the Fourth United States
regulars. As they came within four hundred yards of us they
spread right and left into line, opening like a fan. It was a glorious
sight, and the thunder of their horses' hoofs was the only sound.
Not a word of command, not a huzza from them, or a yell of
defiance from us do I recall. The truth is, there was no defiance
in us, only the courage born of despair, for we knew we were
doomed. I lived an age in those few minutes, and every incident
of the wonderful picture flashes on the screen of memory so
vividly, so distinctly, that I can almost believe I am again a lad
just turned eighteen and witnessing that scene anew. And clearer
than all else there stands in relief the form and face of one of the
bravest men that lived, who in this crisis gave me the assurance of a
friendship which I have ever valued as one of the priceless
treasures of my life.</p>
          <p>I had known John Gibson only a few months; he was an
officer in another company than mine, and yet we were already
like brothers. There is not only “a divinity that shapes our ends”;
there is a divine, a mysterious influence which shapes our
friendships, and that influence had brought us together. He was
our colonel's most trusted scout, venturesome without being
foolhardy, cool and self-possessed in the moment of peril, and so
tenacious of purpose

that when sent out for information he never came in
empty-handed. I had been close to him already on two exciting
occasions, the one when Brownlow's men killed his horse near
Rover, the other when our two wounded men were murdered
near Eagleville, for he was in charge of the scout that day.</p>
          <p>In the emergency that was at hand now, while the double blue
line, with their drawn sabres gleaming high above their heads and
bearing down on us at a gallop, was still two or three hundred
yards away, Gibson galloped to my side and said, “Johnny, when
we break I'll be with you,” and, pointing back in the direction we
were to retreat, he said, “Bear off to the left yonder,” and then he
went to his place. Gibson's quick eye had seen what would
probably have escaped me, as I was comparatively new in the
business of war. Our position was very nearly opposite the
extreme left of the advancing line, and a sharp run in the
direction he had indicated gave us a chance to get out of the
heavier rush of the charge, and possibly to dodge it altogether.</p>
          <p>With our guns at cock, and sighting along the barrel, waiting for
the word, they were now so near that we could distinctly see
their features; then some one shouted “Fire!” and as our volley
blazed in their faces we wheeled our horses and started on the
race for life. By the time we turned about not more than fifty
yards separated pursuers and pursued. Obeying my friend's
injunction, I bore off to the left at the best speed my horse could
go, and within the first hundred yards of our flight Gibson, on his
big, blue roan, six-shooter in hand, was at my side. Very near
us—so near, in fact, that they called to us to stop and
surrender—were a dozen or more Federal troopers, who had in
all probability
<pb id="wyeth216" n="216"/>
noticed that we were trying to run around the end of their
line, while looming up before us was a rail-fence which seemed
very high. As it was evident that I could never clear it, I said:
“Lieutenant, I'll never get over on this horse. Go on and save
yourself.” His quick reply was: “I'll knock the top rails off, and
you follow.” And as he spoke his splendid horse went over like a
bird, never touching a rail. I was now not more than three lengths
behind him as he pulled up, turned in his saddle and shot at the
man who was nearest to me with his sabre raised for the
finishing-stroke. To avoid this danger I dodged to take the next panel,
which my horse struck at full speed, and he, his rider, and a dozen
or more fence-rails went down in a heap together. My last
recollection of Gibson was when his pistol flashed. He saw the
disaster that had overtaken me, and he told me afterward he was
sure I had been killed. He so reported, and my parents had the
great distress of finding me named among those who were dead.
have no clear remembrance of what took place after I struck the
ground. When I “came to” my horse was a few yards away
nibbling at some grass, and not another living thing was in sight.
Far off, a mile or more in the direction of Shelbyville, guns were
popping and men were shouting and yelling; and the sun had gone
down. I got on my feet, caught my horse, and led him into a near-by
clump of cedars to be sure of a hiding-place. My gun and
pistol were empty. I at once reloaded them. It soon grew dark
enough to venture out, and, still bearing off to the east, I crossed a
road and came upon a farm-house, the occupants of which gave
me directions to find my way to the river. The bridge at
Shelbyville was now in the hands of the enemy. The next one
was eight or ten miles to the east,
<pb id="wyeth217" n="217"/>
and my only hope was to hurry on and reach it before they
could. Following a southeasterly course, guided by the stars,
across fields and through long stretches of woodland, I came
about midnight into a well-used road near a house. There was
no light within, but as I rode up to the front gate I recognized the
outline of a horse hitched to the fence.</p>
          <p>I was quite certain it did not belong to a Federal soldier, for the
reason that one lone trooper would not venture this far afield and
be away from his horse. In feeling over the saddle—for it was
so dark I could not see clearly—I struck a wooden canteen.
Then I knew the owner was a Confederate, and I hallooed. A
man came to the door, and when he heard my story he said
there was another soldier in the house on his way to the bridge,
which was two miles off; so we rode on together.</p>
          <p>When within some two hundred yards of the bridge we were
startled by a loud shout which formed itself into “Halt! Who
comes there?” and I answered, “Friend.” The sentinel replied,
“What command?” Fearing he might be a Federal picket, I
hedged by shouting, “Who are you?” At this there came the most
pleasing blasphemy that has ever grated on my Presbyterian
ears, “Eighth Texas, by God!” Then I answered, “Fourth
Alabama.” “How many?” “Two.” “One of you come up on foot.”
One of us went up on foot, and we were safe at last. A half-mile
on the south side of Duck River two worn-out Confederates on
two worn-out horses rode into a clump of trees, dismounted,
unsaddled, tethered, and when they opened their eyes the sun
had been up an hour or more. The 27th of June, 1863, was for one
of the two a day never to be forgotten. Neither of us had eaten
anything since noon of the day before, and our forage-sacks
were empty. The army had passed along
<pb id="wyeth218" n="218"/>
this road on its retreat, and the locusts never stripped Egypt any
cleaner than the hungry Confederates did the ground they
passed over. Our horses could get an occasional tuft of grass
or a bunch of leaves, but their riders could not graze or browse.</p>
          <p>We followed a road leading south to Tullahoma. The wagon-trains
had evidently gone by this route, and how they ever got
through was a wonder. The June rains had been pouring down for
the last week and were to keep on pouring for another. Once or
twice every day or night the heavens opened and soaked the earth
and us; then the hot sun would do its best to dry us by a process
akin to steaming; then another shower, and so on. For thirteen
days in this retreat we were wet at least once every day.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref40" n="40" rend="sc" target="note40">1</ref> The
rawhide upon our saddle-trees softened, slipped, rotted, and stank
to such an extent that it was our practice whenever a halt was
made to strip our horses, turn our saddles under side up, and dry
them and our blankets. When we reached Elk River, some days
later (July 2d), and took advantage of the first opportunity for a
wash (no real soldier ever bathed), in trying to get my cotton shirt
off it came hopelessly to pieces. How aptly the song in “The
Pirates of Penzance” applies to the experiences of war:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>Taking one consideration with another,</l>
            <l>A (soldier's) life is not a happy one.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>As we were riding along we noticed lying in the muddy road a
knuckle of ham-bone several inches in length. That portion
sticking out of the mud had been picked so clean it seemed
hardly worth while to investigate the hidden portion, and we
passed on. The sight of something which
<note id="note40" n="40" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref40">1 To any who may think this an exaggeration or a lapse of memory I refer to
the <hi rend="italics">Official Records</hi> of this campaign for daily weather reports.</note>
<pb id="wyeth219" n="219"/>
might be eaten, however, started our salivary and gastric
machinery into action, so we stopped our horses, and one said he
thought he would go back and see if anything had been left
on the under side. I was that one; and when I scraped the mud
off as cautiously as I could and showed it to my comrade, even
the periosteum had disappeared. As a last resort we tightened
our cartridge-box belts and rode on.</p>
          <p>The Federal cavalry reached the outposts in front of Tullahoma
almost as soon as we did, for I scarcely had time to assure my
comrades that I wasn't dead when we had a collision with them.
There we lost the gallant Stearns of the Fourth Tennessee, one
of the best colonels of cavalry the Civil War developed. As every
one in the company thought I had been killed, my reappearance
afforded an opportunity for congratulations in which I heartily
joined. I looked up Gibson at once, and his outburst was: “Lord
God Almighty— Johnny!” It was irreverent, but not meant
to be so, and I give the words just as the brave lieutenant spoke
them. My mother and my father had started for the front when
they read the news of the bad luck which had befallen, but went
back when I reappeared.</p>
          <p>There is not in all the history of our great war a more heroic
record than that of General Joseph Wheeler, and with the
means at hand he never fought a better fight, or achieved a
greater success, or showed more generalship or more
desperate personal bravery than here at Shelbyville.</p>

force of about ten thousand men, which came up late in the
afternoon of the 27th of June, the following Union regiments

          <p>With their superior numbers and equipment the Federals could
have run over us at any time after three o'clock, captured us and
the enormous wagon-train floundering slowly along in the muddy
roads between Shelbyville and Tullahoma. It was nearly sundown
when the last wagon was over the river. Wheeler at no time on
that day had more than three thousand effective men under his
command, and his principal losses were caused by his recrossing
to the north side after he and his men were safely over, as he
was
<pb id="wyeth221" n="221"/>
informed that Forrest had come up and was being surrounded.
In an article entitled “General Wheeler's Leap,” published in
<hi rend="italics">Harper's Weekly</hi> for June 18, 1898, the following description is
given:</p>
          <p>“General Wheeler, who had safely crossed the river, was in
the act of firing the bridge when a member of General Forrest's
staff reported to him that Forrest, with two brigades, was within
two miles of Shelbyville and advancing rapidly to cross. Realizing
the danger which threatened Forrest, Wheeler, notwithstanding
the Federals were in strong force in the suburbs of Shelbyville
and advancing into town, taking with him two pieces of artillery
and five hundred men of Martin's division, with this officer,
hastily recrossed the north side in order to hold the bridge and
save Forrest from disaster.</p>
          <p>“The guns were hastily thrown into position, but the charges
had scarcely been rammed home when the Union troops came in
full sweep down the main street. When within a few paces of the
muzzle of the guns they were discharged, inflicting, however,
insignificant loss. With their small force of five hundred men
Generals Wheeler and Martin stood up as best they could under
the pressure of this charge. They held their ground manfully as
the cavalry rode through and over them, sabring the cannoneers
from the guns, of which they took possession, and then passed on
and secured the bridge, leaving the two Confederate generals and
their troops well in the rear. The bridge had become blocked by
one of the caissons, which had been overturned, and now,
thinking they had them in a trap, the Union forces formed a line
of battle parallel with the bank of Duck River and across the
entrance to the bridge.</p>
          <p>“The idea of surrendering himself and his command had
<pb id="wyeth222" n="222"/>
not entered the mind of General Wheeler. As Poniatowski had
done at the Elster, he now shouted to his men that they must cut
their way through and attempt to escape by swimming the river.
With General Martin by his side, sabres in hand, they led the
charge, which, made in such desperate mood, parted the
Federals in their front as they rode through. Without a moment's
hesitation, and without considering the distance from the top of
the river-bank, which was here precipitous, to the water-level,
these gallant soldiers followed their invincible leader and plunged
at full speed sheer fifteen feet down into the sweeping current.</p>
          <p>“They struck the water with such velocity that horses and
riders disappeared, some of them to rise no more. The Union
troopers rushed to the water's edge and fired at the men and
animals struggling in the river, killing or wounding and drowning a
number. Holding to his horse's mane, General Wheeler took the
precaution to shield himself as much as possible behind the body
of the animal, and, although fired at repeatedly, he escaped injury
and safely reached the opposite shore. Some forty or fifty were
said to have perished in this desperate attempt. ‘Fighting Joe
Wheeler’ never did a more heroic and generous deed than when
he risked all to save Forrest from disaster. Many years after the
war the hero of this story gave me the facts as above stated.”</p>

TULLAHOMA TO ALEXANDRIA—ELK RIVER</head>
          <p>THERE was to be no great battle at Tullahoma, where behind
formidable intrenchments Bragg's army had for months been
sheltered, and upon which Rosecrans was now advancing.
When we arrived the wagon-trains had had a four days' start
along the awful roads to Chattanooga. The artillery went next,
then the long lines of infantry floundered through the mud, and
last of all we brought up the rear. Nothing so depresses an
army as a retreat; no duty is so harrowing and demoralizing as
that of fighting rear-guard actions day after day. South of
Tullahoma, with the regular instalment of rain, we stood off the
aggressive Union cavalry until we cleared the half-barren post-oak
and black-jack plateau, from the summit of which we
descended to cross Elk River on a planked-over railroad-bridge,
and at dark on July 1st found ourselves posted to
oppose the enemy at the crossing of this river known as
Morris's Ford.</p>
          <p>On our side of the river at this crossing there was an open
hillside which sloped gradually upward from the river-bank for
about four hundred yards. It was an old, turned-out field,
barren of trees or bushes and fully exposed to the fire of artillery
and small arms from the opposite shore, which commanded the
slope for this distance. Straight up this hillside the road
ascended from the ford. The only protection east of the
roadway on the south side was a narrow
<pb id="wyeth224" n="224"/>
fringe of bushes and small trees which grew immediately upon
the edge of the bank, just back of which was a worm-fence half
fallen to pieces from age and neglect. West of the road, as it
led up from the crossing, was a fairly dense thicket of scrub
timber about half an acre in extent. Through this undergrowth
there ran obliquely from the hillside eastward to the river a
sinuous wash-out some four or five feet in depth which
afforded admirable protection to a limited number
of sharp-shooters.</p>
          <p>From this gully the entrance to the ford from the opposite
side was in plain view, and not over eighty yards distant. Upon
the opposite or northern shore of Elk River, which was here not
more than two hundred feet wide, there was a low bottom
heavily timbered and with a dense undergrowth of small bushes
which extended back some two hundred yards from the stream.
A fringe of tall, rank weeds lined the river-bank. The roadway
coming from the north and leading into the stream was an
ordinary Southern country highway, and so narrow that not
more than four men could ride abreast. Moreover, as a result of
the heavy rains,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref41" n="41" rend="sc" target="note41">1</ref> the river was so full that in midstream it was
swimming for the horses for probably half of its width.</p>
          <p>On the morning of July 2, 1863, we were up early and were
congratulating ourselves on having a short rest. It was clear, and
as soon as the sun rose we turned our saddles bottom side up
to dry, and while some of the men were busy getting breakfast
a number of us went down to
<note id="note41" n="41" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref41"><p>1 <hi rend="italics">Official Records</hi>, series I, vol. xxiii, part 1, p. 620.</p><p>(a) June 26th: “Rained nearly all day.”—Major-General David S.

<pb id="wyeth225" n="225"/>
the river to indulge in the luxury of a swim. As we were finishing
our simple breakfast of corn-bread and bacon the videttes left
half a mile from the ford on the north side of the stream fired at a
squadron of the Fourth Ohio Cavalry, which chased them into the
river. As soon as the guns were heard we were ordered to rush
to the ford and hold the enemy back. Some of us (sixteen in all)
were fortunate enough to reach the small thicket near the
crossing, where we ensconced in the gully described before.
Others lay down behind the worm-fence, with nothing but that
and the light fringe of bushes for protection. We had barely
reached our places when the Federals opened on us with a heavy
fire of small arms and two pieces of artillery.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref42" n="42" rend="sc" target="note42">1</ref> This fire raked the
bivouac on the open hillside behind us, stampeded the horses, and
drove the entire command—except the small number who had
already succeeded in sheltering themselves close along the
bank—back over the crest of the hill fully a half-mile away. As
we had no artillery, our position was not to be envied. To try to
escape exposed us at close range to the fire from small arms, and
to grape and canister for fully four hundred yards of open hillside.
Realizing that we were in for it, we prepared for rapid loading by
laying our cartridges and caps in rows on the ground and
concentrated our fire on the narrow roadway which led into the
stream from the other side.</p>
          <p>After having driven everybody else away, the enemy gave their
undivided attention to us, and for nearly three hours <ref targOrder="U" id="ref43" n="43" rend="sc" target="note43">2</ref> there was
the liveliest firing I ever heard. They were so near we could
distinctly hear every command given in an ordinary tone of voice.
Those of our men who were lying

<pb id="wyeth226" n="226"/>
behind the old fence suffered severely, and a number were killed
or wounded (we could hear their groans), and long before the
fight was over no resistance was offered anywhere except by
our small squad of sixteen men. Captain Stokes of the Federal
battery reported that he “advanced his section within thirty yards
of the crossing”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref44" n="44" rend="sc" target="note44">1</ref> and opened on us “with canister.” Finally they
tried volley-firing, concentrating all their small arms and both
cannon loaded with grape or canister on our thicket, an area not
larger than half an acre. Our fire must have been effective, for
we kept their two guns and them back in the undergrowth, where
they could not aim with accuracy. Our heads alone were
exposed, and after the first volley we ducked into the gully to
avoid the others, for we distinctly heard the guns being loaded
and knew about when they were going to pull the lanyards. The
missiles crashed in showers through the bushes or plowed up the
dirt over us, but we were unhurt. They seemed coming thick
enough to mow the saplings down, and but for the gully we would
all have been killed.</p>
          <p>The thick hedge or fringe of high weeds along the northern
bank, where the soil was rich, which was not present on our side
where the river cut into the hill, gave us a great advantage. At
one time we observed a movement of the top of these weeds,
which indicated that some one was crawling down to near the
water's edge; and Frank Cotton, Jasper Matheny, and I trained
our guns on that point. As soon as the blue uniform was seen we
fired together, and nothing more came from that quarter.</p>
          <p>While this fight was in progress there occurred an incident that
may well challenge credulity. For pickets of the two armies
posted on opposite sides of narrow streams
<note id="note44" n="44" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref44">1 <hi rend="italcs">Official Records</hi>, vol. xxiii, part 1, p. 579.</note>
<pb id="wyeth227" n="227"/>
to converse and at times to barter during the suspension of active
hostilities was not uncommon, but to call a truce while the
desperate defense of an important crossing was going on was
certainly a novel procedure, yet this occurred here. I credit the
Union officer responsible for it with motives of generous
admiration for a handful of men who were putting up a desperate
and determined fight. In a lull longer than usual which followed
one of their volleys a voice from their side said, “Hello, boys!
Let's hold up awhile and talk it over.” We could scarcely believe
our senses, and Frank Cotton replied, “What do you want?” The
Federal answered, “To stop firing,” and we said, “All right.”</p>
          <p>It is difficult to estimate time accurately under circumstances
of great excitement. I am positive that several minutes elapsed,
during which time we and they talked as if in ordinary
conversation. I recall clearly that one of our squad asked in a
joking way if tobacco was not scarce on their side, and got the
retort, “Not any scarcer than coffee is over there.”</p>
          <p>The truce ended abruptly when the Union officer said, “Look
out; we will have to open fire again,” and we soon understood the
reason. Being informed of our situation, General Wheeler had
hurried back two Parrott guns, which at this moment were
unlimbering on the crest of the ridge behind us where we could
not see them, but in plain view of the Federals. The roar of these
guns, the whizzing of the shells as they passed not far above our
heads, and their explosion in the timber across the river was the
most welcome sound I ever heard, for the Yankees scampered
away as fast as our men had earlier in the day. Then when all
was clear we ventured out and rejoined our company, to
<pb id="wyeth228" n="228"/>
be publicly commended by our good colonel for what we really
couldn't help doing.</p>
          <p>Wishing to make this extraordinary experience a matter of
record, several years after the war I secured the following
statement in writing from Mr. Jasper N. Matheny, a worthy
farmer who in 1913 was still living in Marshall County, Alabama,
and who was one of this detachment. I wrote him as follows:
“Kindly let me know if you were with this detachment on that
day (July 2, 1863), and, if so, whether or not you recall the fact
that in a temporary lull in the firing, by mutual consent, the firing
on both sides ceased for several minutes, during which time we
talked to each other in practically an ordinary tone of voice.” In
reply he says:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <text>
              <body>
                <div1 type="letter">
                  <p>I distinctly recall the fact concerning which you write. During the truce we
exposed ourselves to view by standing up in the gully in which we had been
hidden, and no one shot at us, nor did we again fire. I am under the impression
that at least five or ten minutes elapsed before the conversation was interrupted
by a Federal, presumably an officer, who gave us warning that the firing would
be resumed. We again concealed ourselves, but were almost immediately
rescued from our precarious position by a Confederate battery, which from the
hill in our rear opened upon the Federals across the stream and drove them
precipitately from our front. </p>

          <p>In looking over the <hi rend="italics">Official Records</hi> I find a further
corroboration in the report of Lieutenant-Colonel Oliver P. Robie,
of the Fourth Ohio Cavalry, who commanded the advance, dated
“July 8, 1863, near Winchester” (<hi rend="italics">Official Records</hi>, vol. xxiii, part 1,
p. 575): “On the morning of the 2d [July] we came upon a small
squad of rebels, to whom we gave chase as far as the river,
when, finding the river too deep to ford quickly, and the enemy in
considerable force on the opposite side, in obedience to orders I
retired a short distance
<pb id="wyeth229" n="229"/>
and dismounted my men and advanced into the thicket skirting
the bank on the right of the road, <hi rend="italics">where we remained within
speaking distance</hi> of the enemy for nearly three hours, during
which time the firing was very brisk.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref45" n="45" rend="sc" target="note45">1</ref> At 11 A.M. the enemy
opened fire upon us with shell and canister, and, fearing a
stampede of my horses, I returned and mounted my men and
retired about a fourth of a mile and formed a line.”</p>
          <p>Colonel Eli Long, commanding a Union brigade at this date, a
gallant officer who never failed to distinguish himself, was in
command in this fight. Six days thereafter, on July 8, 1863, he
officially reported as follows: “July 2d. Returned to Hillsborough,
thence taking the Winchester road. When within a mile of
Morris's Ford on Elk River my advance discovered a squad of
rebel cavalry and gave chase, the remainder of their regiment
(Fourth Ohio Volunteer Cavalry) moving up briskly. Pursued
them to the river, and drove them into the stream, when sharp
musketry-firing was opened on the advance from the woods on
the opposite shore, and replied to by my men, who found the
water too deep to ford readily. The enemy proved to be in
considerable force, and additional companies were moved up to
support the advance. One officer (Captain Adae) and one man
of the Fourth Ohio were here wounded; and, the firing becoming
more heavy, I dismounted the remaining company of the Fourth
and sent them forward as skirmishers on the front and left. I
then dismounted a part of the Third Ohio and deployed them in
the woods on our right. The numbers of the enemy were
augmented by reinforcements from their rear, and they occupied
a quite strong position, so that it was found difficult to dislodge
<note id="note45" n="45" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref45">1 Italics not in the original.</note>
<pb id="wyeth230" n="230"/>
them until two pieces of Captain Stokes's battery were brought
forward by order of General Turchin and opened upon them. This
silenced their fire for a while, but meantime they were
reinforced by a brigade of infantry and two pieces of artillery,
the latter of which opened upon us a fierce fire with six and
twelve pounder shells and canister. My main command (twelve
companies altogether) was now forced back from the woods.
Sharp firing was now kept up on both sides for some time, the
rebel infantry retiring toward Decherd, with the two pieces of
artillery. . . . My entire loss during the day was one officer and ten
men wounded. Two of the latter were mortally wounded, and
died during the afternoon.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref46" n="46" rend="sc" target="note46">1</ref></p>
          <p>General Long was in error in regard to the presence of any
infantry on our side. After their artillery opened and drove the
fragments of our brigade (parts of the Fifty-first and Fourth
Alabama regiments) there was not a Confederate soldier in
firing distance <hi rend="italics">except our squad of sixteen men</hi>. Protected as
we were, and commanding at close range the narrow roadway
which led into the river, our position was impregnable.</p>
          <p>We had scarcely reached our horses when Lieutenant Gibson
was ordered to take a scouting party of eight men to investigate
a report that the enemy were crossing at an obscure ford about a
mile and a half below or west of our position, and I went along.
After going about a mile we left the high ground and were soon in
the thickly wooded land of the river-bottom following a narrow,
winding, and little-used road which had been made through a
dense thicket of small saplings into which one could not see fifty
feet on either side. Gibson rode ahead, and we followed in 
<note id="note46" n="46" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref46">1 <hi rend="italics">Official Records</hi>, vol. xxiii, part 1, p. 558</note>
<pb id="wyeth231" n="231"/>
close double file. George Morris and Will Fackler were in front,
and I was just behind Morris, when suddenly we were fired on
from ambush. One bullet struck Morris at the outer edge of his
left eye, cutting a trench along the side of his temple. The
direction of the shots was from in front, but no one saw the flash
or smoke. Gibson ordered us back one hundred yards, where a
turn in the roadway took us out of range. We could now
distinctly hear the shouting and tumult of the Federals, who were
swimming their horses across the river.</p>
          <p>Gibson ordered me and two others to dismount and advance
cautiously through the thicket in order to find out something of
their strength. I had not gone a hundred yards through the dense
undergrowth when a gun was fired and a bullet came through the
saplings alarmingly near. I fell flat on the ground for safety and
peered through the bushes in the direction from which it came,
but saw no one. I then crawled forward some thirty or forty
yards farther, when a second shot rang out, and the missile came
my way. I could still see no one, and was in about as unhappy a
frame of mind as was possible, when Gibson called us back; and
we ran to our horses, mounted, and hurried back to report that
the enemy was over and advancing in force. As we reached the
upland a vidette was posted with orders to fire as soon as the
Yankee cavalry came in sight. Within five minutes of the time
we reached the command our picket came dashing in with a
large body of Federals at his heels.</p>
          <p>A mile or more back from the river we formed in line of battle
and skirmished heavily and continuously, gradually retiring until
nearly dark. By this time General Wheeler had assembled a
division of cavalry and lined them in a field in which the wheat
had just been cut and shocked.
<pb id="wyeth232" n="232"/>
The enemy's cavalry were now in full view, and it seemed as if
we were to have a regular cavalry battle in this great open
space. We advanced in echelon, firing by regiments as we came
into line. It was a very beautiful sight; but the two lines of battle
were not sufficiently near each other to do effective work. I
afterward learned that we were manœuvering to lead them into
a trap, but the Federal commander (Long) was too smart to be
caught, and withdrew his forces for the night.</p>
          <p>We left the Federals going into camp, and with a light line of
pickets to watch them through the night our main column trudged
on in the retreat southward until twelve o'clock, when we rested
until daylight, only to resume the weary, disheartening march up
the Cumberland Mountains, across this broad plateau, in rainy
weather and along muddy roads, until we reached Bridgeport,
Alabama, late one night. Here the Memphis&amp; Charleston
Railroad bridge over the Tennessee had been floored for the
passage of troops. There was no side protection, but the floor
was sufficiently wide for ordinary safety if one would keep
between the rails. To prevent accident we were ordered to
dismount and lead our horses single file; but I was so worn out I
rode my horse all the way over. The rear-guard burned the
bridge.</p>
          <p>Little of interest occurred for the next few days; and, worn out
with the constant marching and fighting, loss of sleep, and daily
rains which kept us wet and chilled, we proceeded at leisure
down Big Will's Valley to a recruiting-camp near Alexandria,
Alabama.</p>
          <p>I recall but one moment of merriment in all this trying
experience, and this was due to a wholly unexpected reply our
orderly sergeant received to an impertinent question he was wont
to put to any lone and unprotected straggler.
<pb id="wyeth233" n="233"/>
Sam Russell, whose experience of several years as conductor of
a freight-train on the Memphis&amp; Charleston Railroad had
afforded a fairly good training for the hardships of a campaign,
was not only a good soldier, but a great wag and “bluffer.” On
this particular occasion we were sitting by the roadside upon the
top rails of a worm-fence, giving our horses and ourselves a rest,
while another cavalry command was passing. Trailing behind the
last regiment came the inevitable stragglers, and at the very last
there jogged by on a raw-boned, flea-bitten gray nag one of the
most forlorn-looking specimens of a soldier I had ever seen. The
roads were so sloppy and the horse so bespattered with mud that
the natural color was only recognizable on a limited area behind
the saddle.</p>
          <p>The cavalryman had covered himself as well as he could with a
homespun, copperas-dyed blanket which was water-soaked. The
blanket reached to within about a foot of his shoe-tops, and from
his ankles up the skin was bare, for his trousers had crawled
upward to parts unknown. He wore a Confederate wool hat,
which may originally have been gray, but sun and rain and time
had changed it to a dirty ash color. The stiffening had long been
washed out, and the brim flopped up and down with the
movements of the horse. He looked neither to the right nor to the
left as he passed and paid no attention to the remarks about
himself or his horse until Sergeant Russell's voice rang out in an
extra loud and insulting tone: “Hello, Mister! Are you a married
man or a dog?”</p>
          <p>The pitcher had gone to the well one time too often; for this
cavalier, the moment he heard the insulting query, reined his
horse and, carrying his right hand back in the direction of the
six-shooter which he was keeping dry under
<pb id="wyeth234" n="234"/>
his blanket, faced the sergeant and said in a voice which could be
heard beyond our company limit: “I'm a dog, G--  d--  you! What
are you?” And Sam, abashed, red in the face, and crestfallen,
stood convicted; for we all knew he, too, was a bachelor. The
roar of laughter which swept along the line was like a ray of
sunshine on a cold, gray winter's day. We cheered the stranger,
gave him a vote of thanks, and proffered an escort, which he
gracefully declined. Henceforth this question was erased from
the sergeant's catechism.</p>
          <p>From Trenton I made a two days' ride over the mountains to
my home to get the horse I had brought out of Kentucky in 1862,
rested there three days, and then said good-by to my parents for
two years and to the dear old home and faithful “black mammy”
for ever. The Federals burned our village in 1864 and took mammy
and her children to Nashville, where they all died in an epidemic
of smallpox. The policy of devastation was carried out over
practically all of northern Alabama; Bridgeport, Stevenson,
Bellefont, Scottsboro, Larkinsville, Woodville, Camden, Vienna,
and a number of other prosperous villages were burned, and
<hi rend="italics">there are no official reports of these transactions</hi>.</p>
          <p>At Alexandria we were comfortably stationed for the rest of
July and until the last week in August. There was plenty of
growing corn in this section, ripe enough to make good
roasting-ears for the troopers and to be fed green to the horses. We
bivouacked in a piece of wooded land which had been part of one
of Jackson's old battle-grounds in the Creek War. There were
still traces of the trenches and breastworks which had sheltered
him when driven by these warlike Indians, who later took refuge
and fortified themselves
<pb id="wyeth235" n="235"/>
in the Horseshoe Bend of the Tallapoosa near by, where
they were exterminated.</p>
          <p>We had little to do but feed and curry our horses, do camp
duty, and drill two hours a day. One of those drill days, at least, I
remember was excessively hot, and few places can get hotter
than an open field from which the grain has been cut, with a
midday sun overhead in mid-August and in middle Alabama! The
full regiment was in line, and we had been doing all sorts of
stunts—advancing and firing by companies, in echelon, skirmish
drill, flanking drill, etc.—until men and horses were superheated,
restless, and half mad at any and every thing, and thinking that
nothing on earth was worth while at that particular moment but a
drink of cool water and the shade of a tree. Dividing two of these
hot stubble-fields was the wreckage of a half-rotted, tumble-down,
old worm-fence, not over six rails high at any place, and these so
rickety that if our horses' hoofs struck them they would break
and fly in pieces.</p>
          <p>Colonel Russell ordered a charge, with this fence as the
imaginary line of the enemy. As he rode along our front, with his
long auburn beard and his gray uniform frock-coat buttoned up to
the chin—and this was one of several of his eccentricities, for it
never grew hot enough to make him unbutton his coat—we
privates thought he was the hottest-looking thing we had ever
seen on horseback. The “enemy” was three hundred yards in
front; the bugle sounded “trot,” then “gallop,” then “charge.”
Yelling like Comanches, we rode over the fence, briers and all,
acquiring so much momentum that no private could stop his horse
until he reached that tree in camp to which his mount was
habitually tethered.</p>
          <p>The officers came in later, at a walk. There was some small
talk about having us lined up in front of the colonel's
<pb id="wyeth236" n="236"/>
tent, but we all held out that our horses were crazy for water and
had run away, and couldn't be stopped until they reached camp.
The brave old colonel (who quit medicine and surgery to command
a cavalry brigade) forgave us.</p>
          <p>The unconquerable spirit in that man never gave up. When
Forrest surrendered at Gainesville he rode away to the West,
crossed over into Mexico, and settled at Cordova, where he
resumed the practice of medicine, accumulated a large fortune,
and died only a few years ago. He sent me, only a little while
before he died, the picture reproduced in my <hi rend="italics">Life of Forrest</hi>, and
with it a characteristic letter wondering how I could “live in a
land governed by Yankees!” In this letter he said: “The
Confederate army was not whipped; it simply wore itself out
whipping the Yankees.”</p>

CHICKAMAUGA, WHERE THE INDEPENDENCE OF
THE SOUTHERN CONFEDERACY WAS WON AND
LOST—THE REAL CRISIS OF THE CIVIL WAR</head>
          <p>LATE in August we saddled up for the march to Chattanooga.
Two nights before we were to start my horse, tethered with a
rope, got it tangled under one of his pasterns and was thrown
lame. For three days of the march I walked and led my mount:
they were long and tiresome days. Fortunately, the command
moved leisurely, to save the horses—about twenty miles a day. By
starting off at three or four in the morning I would be passed by
the column about noon, and would catch up when they
bivouacked for the night, usually long after dark. On the third day
I made a temporary exchange with a trooper who was content to
keep my disabled mount with the wagons, and secured in this
way a first-class horse which I rode all through the Chickamauga
campaign.</p>
          <p>It was on this march that an attempt was made to collect all
the carbines and most modern and effective guns in the regiment
and give them to the two flanking companies. I had bought my
Burnside carbine with fifty dollars given me by my married sister,
and I resented the order to turn it in for a long and heavy
Austrian rifle. It so happened that a dear friend was ordnance
officer, and when the inspection was made he allowed me to
retain my carbine.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth238" n="238"/>
          <p>We reached Lafayette, Georgia, September 1st, and
were assigned to active duty at once, to watch the gaps in
Lookout Mountain, through which we were daily
expecting the advancing columns of Rosecrans's army to
descend into Georgia. Two of his three corps were already
south of the Tennessee and were climbing the mountains.
The other was in sight of Chattanooga.</p>
          <p>My first duty was with four other men to picket a defile
through which one of the roads across Lookout Mountain
led into the Chickamauga Valley. Our orders were to
remain there until driven in by the enemy. As we started
out with two days' rations, and as it was six days before the
enemy appeared, we were soon left to our own resources
for subsistence. The Confederate cavalry was used to that.
Near our post there were two small farm-houses about half
a mile apart. In one, a double cabin of hewn logs, there
lived three ladies—a widowed mother, a married and an
unmarried daughter. The husband of the daughter was
away in our army, and these women unaided had cultivated
a small field of several acres in corn. As it was all they had
to live on, we took what we needed from another farm
owned by an able-bodied man who had managed to stay at
home. Within two weeks the battle of Chickamauga had
been fought, in part over this very ground, and the next
day I rode by this spot. Where the field of corn which we
would not touch had stood there was not a stalk left, not
even a fence-rail. The trodden ground was checkered with
the charred embers of camp-fires where the tents of the
Federal infantry had stood in rows, and nothing but the
chimneys remained to tell where stood the log house
which had sheltered those three lone women.</p>

          <p>DESCRIPTION OF MAP
<lb/>
The battle of Chickarnauga was fought on the 18th, 19th,
20th, and 21st of September, 1863. The stream from which it took its
name is a sluggish, crooked creek running in a general direction a little
east of north toward the Tennessee River. The original battle-lines, facing east 
and west, extended from Wheeler's position on the extreme Confederate left to
where Forrest, at the other end, opened the fight, about eight miles.
There was a dam at Lee and Gordon's mill, and above, or south of this, for about
a half-mile the back-water was too deep to be forded or
waded. Some two miles farther south at Glass's mill there was another dam. There
were several bridges; one at Lee and Gordon's (not shown on the map), Alexander's,
Reed's, and at the Ringgold road-crossing, and a number of fords used for cross-cut
or wood-roads. With the exception of the two deep-water stretches of about a
half-mile each, this creek was not a formidable obstacle to the aggressive Confederates. 
When they opened the battle on the right on Friday afternoon, they captured all the
bridges in short order, and over these and by the fords went the
artillery. Most of the troops waded where it was not more than waist-deep. Here
and there, as indicated, were small fields or cleared patches; but in general the
ground which near the creek was fairly level, gradually rising to a rolling or hilly
formation to the west, was covered with a forest of post-oak, black-jack and
pine-trees, with an occasional dense cedar-brake, and practically everywhere a heavy
undergrowth of bushes so thick that in some places an enemy could not be seen until
the opposing lines were within a few yards of each other. All day of Saturday
and until near noon on Sunday the Federals, shielded by the deep-water stretches
on their right wing, held on to the creek. From Lee and Gordon's northward the
Confederates held the stream, driving the Union line back to the La Fayette,
Rossville, and Chattanooga road, which, as shown, runs due north and south. Along
this highway the hard fighting of Saturday and early Sunday took place.
<lb/>
The possession of the creek was of great value in supplying the men and animals
with water. It had not rained for several weeks, and the few wells or springs of a
sparsely settled region were very low or dry. A hot southern sun shone for the
four days of battle from a sky with no intervening clouds except those made by
smoke and dust. The Union lines were supplied from Crawfish Spring on their
far right wing, and the stretch of creek still held as far down as Lee and Gordon's.
The smoke was at times very dense; but the dust was most distressing. On those
sections of the field most stubbornly contested the tramping of men and horses
back and forth repeatedly over the same ground pulverized the dry crust of the
whitish soil and raised such a thick cloud of dust that at times it hid from view
the almost stifled combatants.
<lb/>
For days after the battle the leaves on the undergrowth and on the lower limbs
of the trees were still white. The arrow is pointing north toward Chattanooga.
North and south the map represents a little over ten miles of ground. Note
especially Missionary Ridge and the gaps at McFarland's and at Rossville.
Through these Bragg permitted Thomas to escape. The great disaster to the
Union line occurred near noon on Sunday where Hood's name appears. The
entire right wing and center of the Federal battle-line fled the field and
disappeared in panic through the woods, pouring through McFarland's gap
and over the Ridge, and taking along in the stampede to Chattanooga the
Commander in Chief, General Rosecrans, and Generals McCook and Crittenden,
commanding two of the three corps of the Union army. Honorable Charles A.
Dana, Assistant Secretary of War, took a leading part in this part of the engagement.
<lb/>
Note that part of the field marked “Forrest's Second Position,” and that from this
point the several roads into Chattanooga were open and in possession of the
Confederates at 4 o'clock P.M. Sunday, September 20th. At this hour there was
no organized resistance to the victorious Confederates save that by Thomas.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth239" n="239"/>
          <p>By September 12th a corps of Union infantry under General
McCook and a strong body of cavalry under General
Stanley came over Lookout Mountain to Alpine, Georgia,
and drove our pickets back. Then two other divisions of
infantry advanced through the gaps in Pigeon Mountain,
and we took part in an effort to capture these commands,
which at that moment were widely separated; but owing to
the lack of co-operation on the part of the Confederate
generals the movement failed, and the Federals were at
last permitted to concentrate their forces on the field of
Chickamauga.</p>
          <p>In this movement to capture McCook's corps it was my
good fortune to pass safely through a very unusual
experience. Starting in the afternoon from Lafayette, our
division marched all night in the direction of Alpine.
Toward morning a staff-officer stationed on the side of the
road as we filed by repeated to each company the order to
cease talking and to make as little noise as possible. At
four we were halted, and word came from the front down
the line, repeated from regiment to regiment, that “a
volunteer was wanted at the head of the column who would
go where he was ordered.” My curiosity was aroused, and
I said to Lieutenant Jack Weatherly, my messmate, that I
would go with him and see what was wanted. It was very
dark, and there was no little difficulty in riding through the
command, which packed the narrow country road. The
general in command asked me if I was “willing to go inside
the enemy's lines,” and I replied, “If it was necessary I
would try to do what was required, provided I could wear
my uniform, but that I wouldn't go as a spy.” To this he
said: “All right. I want you to carry a message to some
troops that have passed around their flank, and are now
coming up in their rear. It is important that they be headed off
<pb id="wyeth240" n="240"/>
and ordered to return by the route they traveled. To reach them
in time you will have to pass through the Federal lines.”</p>
          <p>He gave me some general directions as to about where I
ought to find this detachment at daylight, and turned me over to a
guide, a farmer who lived near by, who agreed to accompany me
to where the road turned off that I must follow. As the mission
promised to be more than ordinarily risky, I stripped my horse
and self of everything not absolutely necessary, and with the
exception of a small New Testament which my mother had
handed me as I left home for the war, with the injunction that I
should read at least one chapter every day, and my trusted army
six-shooter, I turned over all my personal belongings to Jack. The
incongruity of associating a Testament and a six-shooter did not
occur to my mind then as it has since. While this was going on
some one fastened on an extra surcingle to make my saddle
more secure.</p>
          <p>As our good colonel, whose interest in this enterprise was
evidently aroused, rode along with Jack, the guide, and myself for
a short distance, he said: “If you get through all right, I'll see that
you get as long a furlough as you want”; and then he and
Lieutenant Weatherly said “Good luck!” and turned back. About
a quarter of a mile farther on the farmer and I came to where
the roads forked. I followed my guide a few yards along the one
to the right, which I was to take. He told me it was about half a
mile down that road to where the Federal pickets were stationed.
He had seen them there between sundown and dark. After
getting from him what information I could as to the character of
the road ahead of me, I went on alone. It was now between four
and five o'clock and very dark.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth241" n="241"/>
          <p>Having become accustomed to the darkness, I could make out the
opening of the roadway a few yards ahead chiefly because it was
accentuated by the blackness of the forest on either side. This was in
my favor, as was the fact that the road was sandy and soft and my
horse's hoof-beats at a fast walk were scarcely audible. The only
sound that I did hear—and it is indelibly registered in the memory cells
occupied by this experience—was the weird note of one of the small
screech-owls which are common in this section, the cry of which no
one is apt to forget who hears it for the first time. I had heard them
hundreds of times, but never under just such surroundings.</p>
          <p>It goes without saying that I appreciated the dangers which this
mission involved, but the most astonishing feature of the psychology
of this moment was that I found myself in a condition of mind in
which the value of life became a secondary consideration. It had
never come to me before; it never has since. In that brief period the
stars were not far away, for I had eliminated self. The one absorbing
thought which took possession of me was that my mother would be
proud of me for trying to do my duty. I did not intend to be stopped,
and with a swift, game, and powerful horse the chances were in my
favor. Riding into their lines would disarm suspicion, and if I could
get by the outpost without alarm the rest would be easy. I had made up
my mind that I would ride by or over anything or anybody who got in
the way, and when hailed would say, as I galloped by, that I was a
courier with important despatches.</p>
          <p>When I had gone about the distance which should bring me near
the pickets, as indicated by the guide, I took my pistol from the
holster, cocked it, and with the finger inside the guard held it ready
for instant use. Catching a short
<pb id="wyeth242" n="242"/>
hold on the bridle, I leaned well down on my horse's neck and
urged him into a slow canter. He had not gone more than two
hundred yards at this gait when he suddenly raised his head and
seemed about to shy, and then not twenty feet ahead I recognized
the dark figures of two men as they vanished from the open
roadway into the dark bushes to my left. They must have spoken
or challenged, and I doubtless replied; but the moment I saw
them I gave my horse the spurs, and he bounded over or by them,
and on the wings of the wind in another instant he and his rider
were lost from their view. It is more than probable that my lucky
escape was due to lack of vigilance on the part of the pickets.
My horse made little or no sound in the deep, soft sand. Once
past them, if they fired they endangered their own men.</p>
          <p>Another interesting feature of the psychology of this incident is
that, while every detail up to this moment is distinctly and
indelibly registered, I have never been clear as to what occurred
for the next few minutes. The next thing I remember is that as
the day dawned I was racing along, and saw from the top of a
hill off in the valley below, probably a mile away, what looked
like a heavy fog. As it had not rained for several weeks and the
roads were very dusty, I realized that it was not fog, but a cloud
of dust made by moving troops.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref47" n="47" rend="sc" target="note47">1</ref> Coming in plain sight, I was
overjoyed to find that they were our troops, and to the officer in
command I delivered my message.</p>
          <note id="note47" n="47" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref47">1 A drought prevailed for nearly two months at this time in 1863. While we
were on picket, early in September, the Federal corps crossing Lookout
Mountain raised such clouds of dust that fifteen miles away their line of march
could be made out. So thick was the dust on the battle-field at Chickamauga that
at times it enveloped and bid the troops like a fog, and the forest trees far
removed from the roads were white with the dust that settled on the leaves. See
the official reports immediately after the battle.</note>
          <pb id="wyeth243" n="243"/>
          <p>When I got back to the regiment our colonel was as good as
his word, and told me I was free to go home; but we knew a
great battle was impending, and I stayed to see it.</p>
          <p>I must relate a very extraordinary experience which has an
association with this night ride. In November, 1912, forty-nine
years after it was made, I happened to be in Chattanooga, and,
wandering along one of the hill streets at an hour so early that
very few people were stirring, I saw following me at a short
distance another early riser. Feeling in a conversational mood, I
slackened my pace, and as he came up I remarked, “Fine
town,” to which he courteously responded with real
Chattanooga pride, “Yes, indeed!” “Native?” I asked. “No sir;
born in Madison County, Alabama.” Then I continued: “We
came near being twins. I'm from Marshall.” He inquired my
name, and I replied: “You don't know of me, but you must know
of my father, Judge Louis Wyeth.” As yet we had scarcely
looked at each other; but when he heard my father's name he
turned quickly toward me and stopped so suddenly that I did the
same. In a voice that betrayed evident feeling he said: “Then
you are Dr. Wyeth from New York; John A. Wyeth, Company
I, Fourth Alabama Cavalry. My God! I haven't seen you since
that night in 1863 when you volunteered to go into the Yankee
lines for General Wheeler”—and he continued with some details
which for the time being had escaped my memory. My
accidental acquaintance turned out to be Mr. G. G. Lilly, of
Chattanooga, a well-known citizen and a gallant soldier of our
regiment to the end of the war. I did not suppose until then that
there was living a human being who knew anything personally
about this incident.</p>
          <p>The hot weather, the scarcity of water, and the dusty
<pb id="wyeth244" n="244"/>
roads were very trying to the columns of infantry that were being
rapidly concentrated near Lafayette, Georgia. In one of the divisions
that passed my post I noticed the men were barefoot, their shoes
swung across the barrels of their guns. The road here was sandy and
soft, and they were saving their footgear for rougher going. They
would march fifteen minutes or so and rest five, lying flat on the
ground. In one of the Texas regiments I recognized a young lad, “part
Cherokee,” with whom I had gone to school in Alabama.</p>
          <p>For ten days before the battle we were almost constantly in touch
with the enemy's cavalry, and on September 17th we had a lively
skirmish in McLenmore's Cove near Catlett's Gap, which for a while
seemed to be the precursor of a general engagement, but none in our
company were hurt. Part of this action took place in a stretch of open
farm-land with half a dozen houses in sight. Both sides were using
artillery, and, naturally, the shells produced great consternation
among the home people. One of the houses centrally located had a
cellar for refuge, and toward it every man, woman, and child in the
neighborhood was running to disappear within like bees darting into
a hive at the sudden approach of a shower.</p>
          <p>On the late afternoon of September 18th, when the great battle of
Chickamauga opened, we were posted on the extreme left of the
Confederate line, about two miles from Crawfish Spring, in contact with
Mitchell's and Crook's divisions of the Union cavalry. On the 19th
the far-away thunder of artillery told the story of the hard fighting that
was going on where the infantry were at work. We spent the day
skirmishing and sharp-shooting with their cavalry advance, chiefly in
observation. For protection we made defenses of rails and logs, and,
until the ruse was discovered,
<pb id="wyeth245" n="245"/>
amused ourselves by placing a hat on a ramrod and slowly
elevating it, as if some one were peering over the rails to shoot.
Meanwhile our best long-range rifle-shots, with their guns thrust
through cracks and well protected, trained their sights on the trees
and stumps from behind which the Federals were firing. No sooner
would the hat rise high enough to be seen than their blue arms and
shoulders would be exposed to our fire. Just in front of our position
was a small field of corn, and, as we needed some for our horses and
ourselves—for parched corn was our chief provender at this time—when
there was a lull in the firing several of us crawled on our hands and
knees, trailing our forage-sacks, and reached the corn rows without
being seen. The watchful enemy, observing the tops of the stalks in
commotion, turned loose on us so effectively that the corn detail
suspended operations until night-time.</p>
          <p>Early on Sunday, September 20th, some of the Federal long-range
guns began to land bullets in our bivouac, and one or two horses were
hit. The firing came from a log cabin about four hundred yards across
a field which was now grown up with a rich crop of high ragweed.
Some ten of us volunteered to drive them out or capture them, and I
was placed in command of the detachment. In order to get into the
field of weeds through which it was necessary to crawl to keep out of
sight, we made a slight detour and came up behind a dense copse of
bushes, where we loosened a lower rail and crawled through the fence
without being seen. As it was not safe to try to rush the cabin from the
front, we made our way cautiously to the back of the barns or stables
of a farm-house two or three hundred yards from the nest of the
sharp-shooters in the log cabin. It was still very early, for as I came to the
open back door of the farm-house
<pb id="wyeth246" n="246"/>
I saw a lady and two children at the breakfast-table.
When she saw me she started up and, recognizing my gray
jacket, in evident alarm exclaimed, “The Yankee pickets are in
the road by our front gate.” To my inquiry of how many there
were and how long they had been there she said a company of
cavalry came the day before and left some of their men on
picket. I crept along the wall of the house, peeped cautiously
around the comer, but saw no one, and told her she must have
been mistaken. She assured me she had seen them since
daylight. I then signaled the others to come up, and as we
reached the road we found plenty of fresh tracks made since
the dew had fallen. There was no mistaking these footprints, for
they were made by the square-toed regulation shoe of the
United States army.</p>
          <p>We now quickly formed in a line about ten feet apart and ran
through the woods toward the cabin, taking it on the flank and
rear. Not a word was spoken as we rushed ahead with our guns
cocked and ready. I expected every moment to see gun-smoke
jet out of the cracks in the cabin; but when we reached it it was
empty. A fresh fire was burning, and we found some blankets,
cooking-utensils—among these a coffee-pot, for which we had
little use—and a small sack of salt and other plunder, which the
Federals had hurriedly abandoned. General Martin, who was
watching us through his field-glasses, met us half-way across
the field as we were returning, and upon my report ordered the
ever-reliable Lieutenant John Gibson to ride out with some
twenty men and see what was up. He came back within an hour
with information which caused General Wheeler to move his
whole command some two miles or more in great haste to
Glass's Mill on the Chickamauga, about a mile from Crawfish
Spring.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth247" n="247"/>
          <p>We had hardly reached this spot when we struck a big body of their
cavalry, and a lively fight was precipitated. One of our batteries went
immediately into action just in front of our position, and we were
posted to guard it. The Federal guns about five hundred yards away
soon got the range and threw a lot of shrapnel, which kept us on the
anxious seat for fully an hour, for they frequently burst up in front of
us, and the fragments came whirring down our way. One piece about
two inches long struck the ground right by my horse, and I
dismounted and picked it up and sent it home to my mother as a
souvenir. Had we been fifty yards farther back we would have been
fully protected behind the crest of the ridge on which we were formed.
After what seemed an interminable time we were ordered back this
far, and a detail was made to parch corn. Here two flour-biscuits and a
small piece of bacon were issued to each man. For the three days of
this battle no other ration than this was given to our command—we
were subsisting on parched corn. After about two hours of fighting
the Eighth Texas got on the flank of the Federals and gave them a wild
chase in the direction of Lee&amp; Gordon's Mill, in which we all joined.</p>
          <p>In this engagement a lot of prisoners were captured, and several of
our dead and wounded were brought in on the horses, as we carried no
stretchers and an ambulance was unknown. I saw one body held
across the lap and legs of one of the Texas troopers, the limp arms and
legs dangling nearly to the ground. I was told it was his brother, who
had been instantly killed. That and another scene I witnessed at
Glass's Mill still remain vividly in mind. A captured Union cavalry
officer who had been shot through the bones of one foot came in
limping along with the other dismounted
<pb id="wyeth248" n="248"/>
captives. I was standing close by when a ranger who had been
one of the captors said to him, “I want your boots.” The officer
had on a magnificent pair of Wellingtons, and, as it was useless
to say no, he sat down and held up the sound foot while the
Texan pulled that boot off and tried it on. As it was a fit, he
motioned for the other. When the wounded man asked him if he
wouldn't split it so it could be pulled off without hurting, the
ranger simply pulled it off <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">vi 
et armis</foreign></hi>, remarking, “You reckon
I'm going to spoil that boot?” It was a pretty rough experience,
and my sympathies were with the unfortunate prisoner. Earlier in
the war this incident would not have been possible, but men had
become callous and indifferent, and then the necessities of the
Southern troops, half starved and poorly clad as they were,
justified to some extent the wholesale appropriation of all the
belongings of their prisoners.</p>
          <p>The dead on the field were practically all stripped before
burial, leaving only a single undergarment on. Right after the
Chickamauga battle I was detailed to gather up guns and other
wreckage on the field, and the dead Federals were scattered
everywhere, in some places very thick. I counted seven who had
fallen in one pile, and I recall but one that had not been stripped
of all outer clothing; yet not one of all these dead men but had
some covering left for the sake of modesty.</p>
          <p>This cavalry fight at Glass's Mill and near Crawfish Spring
ended about the time that Longstreet broke through the Union
left wing and sent Crittenden's and McCook's corps flying
toward Thomas and Chattanooga, and it may be that knowledge
of this disaster had reached the Federal cavalry in our front and
hastened their departure. Certain it is that, try as hard as we
could, we never caught up
<pb id="wyeth249" n="249"/>
with them any more that day. Had General Wheeler been
promptly informed of the Confederate success, we could have
been immeasurably more useful by going from Glass's Mill
straight to Crawfish Spring, and on by the direct road into the
immediate rear of the flying Union infantry, for they were
disorganized, and we could have added to the rout and captured
thousands whom our infantry could not overhaul. Instead of
doing this we moved along the easterly bank of the
Chickamauga, and, although we ran our horses all the way, we
lost valuable time before we dismounted to advance on foot at
Lee&amp; Gordon's Mill.</p>
          <p>When the order was given to “dismount to fight” we were
called off in “eights” instead of “fours,” as usual, and when we
were told that no more men could be spared to hold the horses
we were convinced that a desperate situation was at hand. It so
happened that number eight fell to me, and I made Nat Scott—a
boy younger than I whom my parents had lately sent from home
to bring me some much-needed articles of clothing—take my
place as horse-holder. Nat asked for a gun and a place with us
in the battle, but I insisted that he take my place with the horses.</p>
          <p>As we fell in line for the advance, and were loading and
capping our guns, a member of my company, pale and trembling,
left the line and walked up to the captain. I heard him say,
“Captain, I can't go in.” Captain James L. Smith, who had
succeeded Dr. Fennell in command of Company I, replied, more
in pity than contempt, “My God, then go back to the horses!” I
have often thought that it took more courage to confess
cowardice than it did to go into battle. I had seen shirking in
many forms, but this was the first and only instance I ever saw
or heard of in which a soldier in the presence of his comrades
handed his
<pb id="wyeth250" n="250"/>
gun to his captain and owned up that he couldn't face the music.
There was a man in my company, sober, kindly disposed, and
well behaved, who in one way and another dodged out of every
fight the company was in and was captured late in 1863, only
because his horse didn't start soon enough and couldn't run fast
enough to get him on this final occasion out of the danger-zone in
time. This was the man I found with the wagon-train in the rear
of the line at Shelbyville who jumped at the chance to exchange
his sound horse for my crippled mount. I never learned by what
route or under what pretext he found his way to the rear. If he
didn't “live to fight another day,” he lived, and is still, at a very
advanced age, a successful farmer in my native state.</p>
          <p>I have narrated elsewhere the incident of the lad who remained
flattened out as close to the ground as his anatomy could be
applied while all the others were standing or kneeling and shooting
at the enemy, and who, when the retreat began, found his feet so
quickly that he forgot his gun, and, like Ben Adhem's name, led all
the rest. This was his first and only appearance on the field of
Mars. It became the practice to station reliable men, usually
sergeants or corporals, in the rear of the advancing or forming line
to prevent shirking. At times some man would take advantage of a
tree or stump, and, being out of sight for a moment, would fall
down and remain there unobserved, or “break like a steer”—to use a
homely phrase—and run for dear life, as did a bully of our county at
Shiloh. This man, I was told by a comrade who didn't run, died
from the effect of this stampede; in fact, dropped dead,
presumably of heart disease, while running.</p>
          <p>Forrest had a standing order to shoot any man who ran,
<pb id="wyeth251" n="251"/>
and himself set the example on more than one occasion. The late
Colonel Alfred H. Belo, who commanded a North Carolina
regiment in Lee's army, and who ultimately died from the effect
of various wounds received in the service, told me that at
Gettysburg, just as they were about to open fire, a soldier was
seen to take advantage of a stump for a few minutes, seeing
which an officer shouted to his sergeant, “Stay by that man and
bring him on.” One of the most rampant fire-eaters of the exciting
period just before the war became an ultra-conservative when
hostilities were declared, and finally was conscripted. He reached
at dark the regiment to which he had been assigned. At daylight
next morning the Federal cavalry stampeded this regiment. The
raw recruit led the charge to the rear, and, having a good start,
never stopped until he reached home, where he remained
unmolested until the war was ended.</p>
          <p>As we began the advance our regiment was the extreme left of
our line, and when we struck the Chickamauga we waded the
stream just below the Lee&amp; Gordon mill-dam. Hoping to get over
dry, a number of us started to run across the dam; but an officer
shouted: “Get off! They're going to rake you with grapeshot,” and
we leaped into the water like so many bullfrogs. Where I waded
it was not quite waist-deep. We learned in a few minutes that we
could have gone over on the dam dry-shod and in perfect safety.
Down near the water's edge we reformed our line, and as we
climbed the bank to the crest of the ridge in our front every one
was alert and at great tension, for we had no thought but that the
ridge above was lined with Federals who would give us a volley
at any moment. I know that never in my life have I been so
apprehensive of danger as on this occasion, and I never saw such
determination
<pb id="wyeth252" n="252"/>
in our men as was in evidence here. I do not believe they
could have been stopped by any ordinary force or resistance. I
was profoundly impressed with this idea by a remark made by
the man next to me as we clambered up the hill. He said,
“Johnnie, we've got to whip 'em right now!” When we reached
the crest and peered over I could hardly believe my eyes. There
was not a Yankee in sight.</p>
          <p>Pushing on, our company came to a small patch of an acre or
two of sorghum sugar-cane, and as we passed through we cut the
stalks in short sections and filled our haversacks and pockets,
eating it as we advanced. There were everywhere the evidences
of a hurried retreat. The ground was strewn with abandoned
property. Suddenly coming upon an ambulance in which some
musicians had piled their instruments as they joined in the flight, I
saw the mouth of a big brass horn sticking out over the tail-board,
and my first impression was that we had run into a masked
battery. We kept on in vain pursuit for several hours, and then the
horse-holders came up, and we mounted and rode to Crawfish
Spring, where the enemy had established their headquarters at
first. Here we captured their camp and hospitals, and a lot of
prisoners, mostly wounded. It was now dark, and I fed my horse,
crammed my haversack with Yankee hardtack (a great and rare
luxury for us), filled a fine tin canteen just acquired with water
from that glorious spring—one of the most beautiful in the world—
and ate real crackers and drank water until I fell asleep.</p>
          <p>When I awoke the sun was shining in my face. My trousers—
the only pair I had—soaked in wading the creek, had held the dust
we raised as we marched over that much-trodden field. They
were now dry and as stiff as if they had been starched, and very
uncomfortable. I was about to
<pb id="wyeth253" n="253"/>
wash them and their owner in the spring branch when a courier
came with the news that a lot of wagons and some Union troops
had been cut off the evening before and had taken refuge in
Chattanooga Valley. Thither we rode as fast as our horses could
carry us. It was not much of a fight, for we outnumbered them
and rode over them just as they had done with us at Shelbyville.
In the pursuit one of their wounded fell from his horse right
underfoot, and two of our men and the surgeon of our regiment
stopped and dragged the poor fellow to the side of the road; for
the dust was so thick that it was at times with difficulty that we
could see the road-bed, and he would probably have been trodden
to death. Dr. Steger told me afterward that this plucky and
unfortunate soldier, whose wound was evidently
mortal, refused to be treated, and swore at him, saying, “No
damned rebel doctor shall touch me.” We captured here,
according to the official records, ninety wagons full of plunder,
some four hundred prisoners, and scattered the remainder among
the bluffs of Lookout Mountain.</p>
          <p>General Wheeler reported eighteen stand of colors taken by us
in all our fighting in this great battle, which began on September
18th and ended with this engagement on
Monday the 21st. Under date of October 30, 1863, he reports:
“The results of the operations of the cavalry under my command
during the battle of Chickamauga were, first, guarding the left
flank of the army for twenty days preceding the battle of
Chickamauga, during which time it continually
observed and skirmished with the enemy, repelling and
developing all his diversions. During the battle we fought the
enemy vigorously and successfully, killing and
wounding large numbers, and capturing two thousand prisoners,
one hundred wagons and teams, a large amount of
<pb id="wyeth254" n="254"/>
other property, and eighteen stand of colors, all of which were
turned over to the proper authorities.”
<ref targOrder="U" id="ref48" n="48" rend="sc" target="note48">1</ref></p>
          <p>We were now ordered to return to the battle-field to pick up
arms and other abandoned property, as well as stragglers. During
the night most of the Confederate dead had been gathered in long
trenches and buried; but the Union dead were still lying where
they fell. For its effect on the survivors it was the policy of the
victor to hide his own losses and let those of the other side be
seen. On our part of the field, cannon, guns, swords, sabres,
drums, brass horns, wagons, caissons, hats, cartridge and cap
boxes, coats, canteens, and all the impedimenta of a great and
well-equipped army were scattered through the woods. Beneath
brush-piles or fallen tree-tops or from behind logs we were never
surprised to find one or more frightened and dejected soldiers in
blue, who would emerge with a hand raised in token of surrender.
At the “Little School House” (now a well-marked historical spot,
where so many regimental monuments are clustered) I counted
sixteen dead Federals in an area so small that half of this number
were touching one another, and as I entered the door a voice
from one corner said, “You won't shoot a wounded man, will
you?” Rarely have I been more shocked, and I exclaimed in reply:
“My God! You can't think that of us!”</p>
          <p>Both of his legs were broken, and he had dragged himself or
had been carried in there for shelter from the bullets. We sent at
once for our surgeon to take charge of him and went on with our
work. In a dense thicket near here I came upon a soldier in blue
sitting upright against the trunk of a tree, one hand on his gun,
which rested across his thighs, the other tightly grasping the brim
of his hat, which was
<note id="note48" n="48" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref48">1 
<hi rend="italics">Official Records</hi>, vol. xxx, part 2, p. 522.</note>
<pb id="wyeth255" n="255"/>
drawn well down on one side of his face, as if shielding his eyes
from the sun. I had no idea that a dead man would be sitting
upright, but such was the case. He was stiff and stark. From
under the knee of one leg a pool of clotted blood told the story.
A minié ball had cut his popliteal artery or vein, and I reasoned
that as he grew faint he sought the tree, leaned back against it,
held on faithfully to his gun with one hand, with the other pulled
the brim of his hat down to shade his eyes, then fainted from
loss of blood and died.</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">The arena swims around him; he is gone—</q>
          <p>and when, years after this awful day, I saw in Rome that
marvelous work of art, “The Dying Gladiator,” this scene came
back to me. He was the only dead Union soldier I saw on that
field of slaughter whose outer clothes had not been removed;
and yet not one but had a single garment left on to cover his
nakedness. The Confederate army was compelled to take the
clothes of the dead to cover the living, for it was in sore straits.</p>
          <p>In places where the woods had caught on fire or where men
had been killed (or possibly only wounded) near a house which
had been burned, their charred bodies told the awful story. As
much of the legs and thighs as were not burned off were drawn
tightly against the abdomen, as were the stumps of the blackened
arms against the chest. The one object in all this nightmare of
horror which touched me most deeply of all was the calm and
beautiful expression on the smooth and beardless face of a
slender lad who had been shot through the brain. Happily for him,
he must have died instantly. Some comrade had stopped long
enough to straighten him out and fold his hands across his breast.
<pb id="wyeth256" n="256"/>
Here he was to be laid in a trench with other dead comrades,
two or three deep, with just enough earth over them to keep off
the hogs and buzzards. I could not help thinking
that he, too, must have a mother who, like my own, was
praying that her boy might come back to her; and this one could
never come. I have asked myself the question a
thousand times as I look back on my own life, Why cannot
men with hearts in them and with heads on them settle
their foolish differences in some other way than by shooting
holes through one another?</p>
          <p>Farther on I came to one of the field hospitals where the
surgeons were busy with the wounded, stretched out on their
blankets under the trees. One poor fellow was walking up and
down holding the freshly amputated stump of his forearm with
the remaining hand. His jaws were firmly set, and his face wore
the hard, fixed expression of pain, yet he made no complaint. In
fact, I do not think I heard a groan or a cry in all that experience.
Some fragments of arms and legs lying around completed the
gruesome picture.</p>
          <p>The battle of Chickamauga marked what history must record
as the “High Tide of the Southern Confederacy,” and ended one
of the great campaigns of the Civil War, a campaign than which
none ever offered so many brilliant opportunities to win undying
glory as were given to the Confederate commander. He failed in
every particular. The courage, the heroism, the self-sacrifice of
the soldiers who made up his great army were in vain. Fully
informed of every movement of his over-confident opponent, and
with time to make his preparations either for battle or retreat, he
hesitated with a vacillation which lost to him the confidence of his
subordinates and finally the respect of his adversary, for in the
latter days of the campaign General
<pb id="wyeth257" n="257"/>
Rosecrans threw caution to the winds, scattered his advancing
columns in difficult mountain-passes far removed from one
another, and invited a destruction which a competent antagonist
would readily have accomplished. With Duck River in front and
strongly fortified at Tullahoma, the unchecked strategy of
Rosecrans forced him out with no fighting except by our cavalry.
Then came the actions at Elk River and Cumberland Mountain,
both strong defensive positions, and finally at the great
Tennessee River, fifth in size in the United States, at which not a
gun was fired. It is not surprising the Union general thought the
Army of Tennessee was a disorganized and dispirited mob, that
it was scampering away among the hills of northern Georgia.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, Bragg, behind the great bulwark of Lookout
Mountain, had halted at last and concentrated his veterans into
an army as efficient as any the world ever saw. They proved it
on one of the bloodiest fields in history. Rosecrans's pursuing
army was recklessly divided into three great corps, descending to
the valley through mountain defiles so widely separated that each
column could have been destroyed without hope of aid from the
other. On September 10th Crittenden's corps was in Chattanooga,
McCook's at Summerville, Georgia, forty miles to the south; and
Thomas in McLamore's Cove, half-way between the two, and
practically Bragg's whole army was in front of Thomas. The
Confederate commander allowed them all to escape and to
concentrate, and then assaulted them on ground of their own
selection. Moreover, in the hour of victory he failed to take
advantage of the one great and glorious opportunity to establish
the Southern Confederacy. In the four years of our war there
may have been other occasions where independence was
possible, but surely none
<pb id="wyeth258" n="258"/>
like this. From 4 to 7 P.M. on Sunday, the 20th of September,
1863, General Braxton Bragg had the entire Union army in his
grasp and its destruction assured. No one who was on that field
and witnessed the utter demoralization of at least one-half of the
Federal line of battle <hi rend="italics">and the isolation of the 
other half</hi>, and
who is capable of an unprejudiced analysis of the records, can
doubt this assertion.</p>
          <p>There was present on that field a wise man, a close and
critical observer. He had been especially selected by President
Lincoln and Edwin M. Stanton, Secretary of War, because he
was wise and critical. He was their agent at the front, a kind of
“inspector” of the Union generals. Withal he was a bitter partisan
and about as prejudiced against the South and its cause as it was
possible for a human being to become, yet this is what Charles
A. Dana, Assistant Secretary of War, wrote:</p>
          <p>“I had not slept much for two nights, and dismounted about
noon and lay down and went to sleep. I was awakened by the
most infernal noise I ever heard. Never, in any battle I had
witnessed, was there such a discharge of cannon and musketry.
The first thing I saw was General Rosecrans crossing himself; he
was a very devout Catholic. ‘Hello!’ I said to myself, ‘if the
general is crossing himself we are in a desperate situation.’ I was
on my horse in a moment. I had no sooner looked around toward
the part where all this din came from than I saw our lines break
and melt away like leaves before the wind. Then the
headquarters around me disappeared. The graybacks came
through with a rush, and soon the musketballs and cannon-shot
began to reach the place where we stood. The whole right of the
army had apparently been routed. We drew back for greater
safety into the woods,
<pb id="wyeth259" n="259"/>
and then I came upon Captain Horace Porter and Captain
Drouillard, aide-de-camp to General Rosecrans, halting fugitives.
They would halt a few, get them in some sort of order, and then
there would come a few rounds of cannon-shot and the men
would break and run.</p>
          <p>“I attempted to make my way in the woods to Sheridan's
division, but when I reached the place where it had been I found
it had been swept from the field. Then I made my way over
Missionary Ridge and rode to Chattanooga, twelve or fifteen
miles away. The whole road was filled with flying soldiers; here
and there were pieces of artillery, caissons, and baggage-wagons.
Everything was in the greatest disorder. When I
reached Chattanooga, a little before four o'clock, I found
Rosecrans there. In the helter-skelter to the rear he had escaped
by the Rossville road. He was expecting every moment that the
enemy would arrive before the town, and was doing all he could
to prepare to resist their entrance. Soon after I arrived the two
corps commanders, McCook and Crittenden, both came to
Chattanooga. Having been swept bodily off the battle-field, and
having made my way into Chattanooga through a panic-stricken
rabble, I telegraphed Mr. Stanton, ‘Chickamauga is as fatal a
name in our history as Bull Run.’ ”</p>
          <p>If this is not a pen picture and a true picture of a battle-field
panic, one has never been made. That it was not confined to
McCook's and Crittenden's corps alone there is overwhelming
evidence. Despite the claims so often made to the contrary, it is
now known that Thomas, after holding on so tenaciously, at last
gave way in such confusion that any kind of organized pursuit
would have overwhelmed and captured him and the remnant of
his command.</p>
          <p>There was never written a more exhaustive, unprejudiced,
<pb id="wyeth260" n="260"/>
or a fairer book than Colonel Archibald Gracie's <hi rend="italics">The Truth
about Chickamauga</hi>. Trained as a soldier, he spent several
years in the study of this battle, months at a time on the
field walking over the ground, measuring the distances, and
analyzing the various movements, and determining the different
positions of the troops. It has been criticized as too
favorable to the Federal side, but in my opinion unfairly
so. I have gone over his book carefully and spent hours
in consultation with him over a subject of great personal
interest to us both, and I am convinced that, no matter
whom it may hurt or what illusions of this great battle it
may dispel, those looking for cold facts will find them here.

It is to be greatly deplored that this gentleman died untimely
from the frightful exposure he suffered when the
<hi rend="italics">Titanic</hi> went down. Gracie says, 
“One Confederate division
which had successfully stormed the precipitous heights
and driven the Federals from their final position picked up
four thousand five hundred guns thrown away by the fleeing
enemy.” Fifteen thousand stand of arms in all were
gathered up, to say nothing of eight thousand prisoners and
thirty-six pieces of artillery.</p>
          <p>General John Beatty, a gallant Union brigade commander,
writes in his memoirs of the withdrawal of this part of the army
under Thomas after it reached Rossville:</p>
          <p>“At this hour of the night (eleven to twelve o'clock) the army
is simply a mob. There appears to be neither organization nor
discipline. The various commands are mixed up in what appears
to be inextricable confusion. Were a division of the enemy to
pounce down upon us between this and morning, I fear the Army
of the Cumberland would be blotted out.”</p>

          <p>General John G. Spears, commanding a brigade in Granger's
corps, was posted by order of General Rosecrans to halt all
fugitive officers and soldiers coming from the battle-field into
Chattanooga. He says in his report: “The
whole night was spent in executing said orders, and by next
morning I had halted and encamped of the different corps and
divisions between eight thousand and twelve thousand men and
officers.”</p>
          <p>The facts now known to all are these: Just before noon on
Sunday, September 20th, Longstreet had broken through the
Federal right wing. The Union line was composed of
McCook's corps on the right, Crittenden's corps in the center,
Thomas's on the left and nearest to their base at Chattanooga.
Rosecrans, commander-in-chief, and corps commanders McCook
and Crittenden, fled with their panic-stricken
men as fast as their horses would carry them to get behind the
breastworks at Chattanooga, some twelve miles to the rear.</p>
          <p>Thomas <ref targOrder="U" id="ref50" n="50" rend="sc" target="note50">1</ref> alone was
 holding fast. Driven back with the

been said and written about the attitude toward the South of this
man, who, in my opinion, saved the cause of the Union in this great
crisis, that the following letter in the possession of Professor W. S. Drewry, of
Richmond, Virginia, which I have his permission to use, may not be without
interest. Professor Drewry is the author of the <hi rend="italics">Southampton 
Insurrection</hi>, a most
carefully prepared and thrilling narrative of those horrible murders, and it is a
startling coincidence, as stated in this book in the chapter on 
“Slavery,” 
that Nat
Turner and his gang of murderers came within a few moments of 
killing George H.
Thomas and his mother, who, trying to escape in a one-horse buggy, 
were being
overhauled by the mounted negroes, and only saved their
lives by leaping from the vehicle and concealing themselves in the dense thickets.
Well may the believers say, “God moves in a mysterious way, 
His wonders to
perform.” The letter before me is signed by (Miss) Fannie C. 
Thomas, sister of
the general, and is dated Newsom P. O., Southampton, Va.,
November 2, 1900: “With regard to the visit of General Thomas, I have to say he
arrived at the home [the Thomas homestead in Southampton, Va.) the
fifteenth of December, 1860, and remained until the eighth of January, 1861, I
believe. While here he said he should side with the South, and my sister
says tell you the last word he said to her at parting was he 
should be back in March. 
He had much of his army baggage sent here and left it, wishing
it to be stored in the house, implying he would return for it, and it would
be ready for his use; He also brought his servants and left them in my sister's
care until such time as he and his wife might require the services of the cook,
whom Mrs. Thomas wished to retain. The above are facts.”</note>

rest by the desperate onslaught of the Confederates, this lion at
bay gathered about him the remnant of his corps and as many of
the fugitives as had rallied to the roar of his guns, and behind
hurriedly constructed barricades of brush and rails and logs and
earth stretched along the crests of Horseshoe Ridge and
Snodgrass Hill for a time checked the Confederate advance. All
else was in rout and wild disorder, and could offer no resistance
to organized and determined pursuit. The road to Chattanooga
was wide open to the victorious legions, and the woods were no
more impenetrable than were the forests on the great
battle-ground, through which and over which for three days they
had tramped and fought. There were five thousand soldiers, as
brave as ever followed the Bonnie Blue Flag, who had just come
fresh on the field and in sight and who had not yet fired a gun.
And Forrest was there on the far Confederate right with his
unbeaten troopers straining at the leash and eager to “run them
into the river.” This man who in his crude, unlettered, and
immortal style had said, “The time to whip the enemy is when
they're running,” was on hand to lead the way; to ignore Thomas
and his desperate fighters; to let them have and hold Horseshoe
and Snodgrass ridges ten miles in the rear of Chattanooga, with
this fortress and McCook's and Crittenden's fugitives in
possession of the Confederates!</p>
          <p>Thomas was short of ammunition, and his men, brave
fighters as they were, were worn down with fatigue, for they
had fought two days, spent nearly all of one night in a long

march, changing position from the Union right to the extreme
left, and the second night in felling trees and building breastworks
and barricades. Thus completely cut off from Chattanooga, there
was no possible alternative but surrender. Forrest and his
mounted men were at hand in sight of the town; the five
thousand fresh infantry and the rest of the victorious army,
certainly no more fatigued than the retreating fugitives of
McCook and Crittenden, could have followed on their heels and
gone with them into Chattanooga; and as if to emphasize the
opportunity, when the sun went down behind Lookout Mountain
the moon made night almost as clear as day! With the capture of
the armies of the Cumberland and the Tennessee, Burnside at
Knoxville was cut off from help and possible escape, even as
later he was pent up in that city. Armed resistance to the
Confederate Army of the West would no longer have existed;
Tennessee and Kentucky were ours again, and the way wide
open to the Ohio and beyond!</p>
          <p>The greatest soldier of the war had foreseen this possibility.
General Longstreet narrates that when he was bidding good-by
to General Lee upon starting to reinforce Bragg prior to this
battle, Lee enjoined him, when he should win the expected
victory, to push on to the Ohio at once, as this would relieve him
of the great pressure in his front. The official returns, as
carefully prepared by Longstreet, show that the contending
armies were practically equal in numbers in this bloody battle, the
Confederates having in the fight of September 20th 59,242, and
the Federals 60,867. He says: “Official reports show that on both
sides the casualties in killed, wounded, and missing embraced the
enormous proportion of practically thirty-three per cent.
<pb id="wyeth264" n="264"/>
of the troops actually engaged.” As the Confederates lost no
prisoners, all of their losses were killed or wounded. Of his own
command he lost in two hours nearly forty-four per cent., while
on the Union side a score of regiments lost forty-nine per cent.
The Tenth Tennessee suffered a loss of sixty-eight per cent.</p>
          <p>Strange as it may seem, there have been found writers who
claim Chickamauga as a Union victory, since, although the
Confederates held the field, the result of the fighting assured the
holding of Chattanooga by the Federals! The Confederates
evacuated Chattanooga on September 9th, and Crittenden
occupied this stronghold on the 10th. As the Union army, badly
beaten at Chickamauga, was able to hold it after that defeat, it
goes without saying that they could have held it equally well
without fighting this battle.</p>

SEQUATCHIE VALLEY—CAPTURE OF THE GREAT
WAGON-TRAIN—A PRISONER OF WAR</head>
          <p>MY furlough was indefinitely postponed. The Federals had
escaped into Chattanooga and were penned in behind
fortifications they had made impregnable. Their only source of
supply was by wagon through Sequatchie Valley and over
Walden's Ridge. Every cavalryman whose horse had stood the
strain of the last three weeks was called to volunteer for a
movement to the enemy's rear to break up his communications
and starve him to surrender. We started September 27th, and in
order to save the animals for the hard work which was to come
we moved by easy marches to Cottonport on the upper
Tennessee, where the river was shallow enough to ford. The
country through which we passed had been stripped of almost
everything which man or horse could eat.</p>
          <p>I often wonder now how our poor animals lived through the
privation and punishment of this expedition. We scattered in
small companies and turned off on side-roads and byways
looking for forage and food. The old men and women and
children, all that were left at home, had been preyed upon by
friend and foe alike until they had learned to hide away the little
that was left. My company came on to a dilapidated lone cabin,
in the garden of which were half a dozen rows of cabbage-stalks
from which the heads
<pb id="wyeth266" n="266"/>
had long been cut. We broke ranks and made a rush for them,
pulled the stalks up, root and all, and devoured them. In another
patch we found some small pumpkins which had been
overlooked or considered not worth gathering, but everything
was grist to a hungry Confederate, and we roasted and ate them
with parched corn, and that was all we had for several days, until
we struck the great wagon-train on October 2d.</p>
          <p>In one of our side-excursions in search of anything we might
devour we had an experience which illustrated the truth of the
proverb that he “who laughs last, laughs best.” A member of my
company had failed to take proper care of his horse, and the
animal's back became so sore the saddle could no longer be
endured. We were now among the “loyal East-Tennesseeans”
(Tories, we called them then), and as we came unexpectedly (to
him) upon a native pacing along the lonely highway on a
good-looking bay mare, Jim Jester proposed a swap. The old man
demurred, but the exigencies of war, emphasized by a drawn
six-shooter, prevailed; and Jim, with an expression of triumph over a
Tory and pride in a fine mount, paced up and down through the
company, showing off her fine points, and boasting as if the rest
of us were on foot.</p>
          <p>Two days later, after we had toiled up the steep, long ascent
of Walden's Ridge and stopped on the summit for a breathing-spell,
Jim's purchase suddenly began to shiver and groan and,
before her rider could dismount, was seized with a violent
convulsion, evidently epileptic in character. Staggering this way
and that, buck-jumping and snorting, spraddling all four legs to
keep from sinking to the ground, with her frightened and
crestfallen owner yelling “Whoa!” and trying to find a chance to
jump off without disaster,
<pb id="wyeth267" n="267"/>
the distressed animal and its demoralized rider made one of the
most comical scenes I ever witnessed. Jim's embarrassment
was not lessened by the jeering remarks of his
comrades, such as, “Jump off and grab a root!” “Light and come
in!” “Hit her on the hairy side!” etc. The poor creature at last
went down, and Jim rolled off unscathed. We carried his outfit
while he tramped on foot into Sequatchie Valley, where early
the next morning we captured the great wagon-train and mounted
our pedestrian on a mule branded on the left hip “U.S.” The old
Tory had laughed last, for, barring the sore back, he had much
the best of the bargain.</p>
          <p>We reached the Tennessee at Cottonport at dark. Early
next morning volunteers with long-range rifles were called for to
cover the crossing. By the time it was light enough to see, quite
a number of us were peeping from behind trees along the bank
at our friends on the other side, the Fourth
Ohio Cavalry, whom we had last greeted at Morris's Ford on Elk
River. We both remembered that occasion. They weren't
expecting us this time, for they rode boldly down to
water their horses and themselves, but scampered to cover when
our rifles cracked and the bullets came whizzing near by. I got in
three fairly good shots, with the sight raised to four hundred
yards, and then they came back at us as was their habit. Then
our side brought up two Parrott guns, and when the shells began
to explode in the fringe of timber on the other bank the
“Buckeyes” retired, but not all of them. I stood directly behind
one of our guns as the artillerists were firing, as I had done once
before on the field of Chickamauga, and could distinctly see the
shrapnel as they sped on their way. I was never able to see one coming
toward me, even when the shells came at or over us, although I
have heard my comrades say they saw them.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth268" n="268"/>
          <p>As soon as everybody thought the Yankees had left the other
side, Colonel Russell and a crowd of officers and some of the
men gathered on the bank in an open space, and I came up
behind them. The firing had ceased for some minutes, and the
troops who were to cross first were mounting, when all
unexpectedly some impertinent Ohioan, who had lingered after
his companions had departed, concluded he would take a parting
shot at the bunch. His carbine rang out startlingly loud, the bullet
splattered in the water about seventy-five yards short,
ricocheted, and whizzed over our heads. I don't know whether
the colonel ducked or not—probably not—but despite the fact
that I was protected by a position behind the others I instinctively
dodged, and the movement seemed fairly general.</p>
          <p>The funny feature of the situation was that everybody present
wanted to get away, but no one was brave enough to run first.
We knew that the man who was bold enough to stay and shoot
once would shoot again as soon as he could load his gun.
Moreover, he had the range by raising his sight, for he could see
where the first bullet had fallen short. We all glanced toward the
colonel, hoping he might lead the way or tell us we might just as
well walk back a few yards and sit down behind a tree, or run,
but he did neither. A keen-eyed artillerist, who had a shell already
rammed home, came to the rescue, for he had seen the small
flash of blue smoke on the other bank, marked the tree by the
side of which it had puffed up, and came so near it after pulling
the lanyard that we didn't have to move. The great dramatist was
not far from right when he said, “What fools these mortals be!”</p>
          <p>That which we call courage is largely a cross between personal
<pb id="wyeth269" n="269"/>
vanity and family pride. The soldier who, advancing in line of
battle, stepped aside to let a frightened rabbit get through to the
rear came very near the truth when he shouted out: “Go it, Molly
Cotton-Tail, and go it fast! I'd be with you if it wasn't for my
family!” The only man I ever saw who had courage enough to
come out in the open and acknowledge he was a coward was the
one at Chickamauga, and that man after the war had pluck enough
to meet in a personal encounter another of about his size. This
ludicrous scene took place in the road that runs for several miles
along the edge of the alluvial bank of the Tennessee west of
Guntersville. The river was at a low stage, and the steep bank of
sand and mud sloped rather precipitously to the water's edge, forty
or fifty feet below. The only witness was my intimate friend, the
sheriff, who described the duel to me. He and one of the men on
horseback met the other, and the discussion of a small debt owed
by one led to an angry dispute, and finally to a challenge to “light
and fight.”</p>
          <p>Both combatants were more than ordinarily portly and short in
stature and, as it turned out, in wind. As neither party was
armed, it promised to be more amusing to my friend than
dangerous to either contestant; so he held the horses and acted
as umpire. He said that the two heavyweights exhibited
extraordinary agility in dismounting. With clenched fists and arms
flexed in the attitude of defense, they advanced cautiously
toward each other, “steppin' high,” as Jim expressed it in the
homely phrase of Honeycomb Cove, “as a Shanghai rooster walking
over frozen ground.” Without violating the proprieties which were
recognized as pertaining to an encounter between gentlemen, they
sparred for a few rounds, landing of necessity on the
<pb id="wyeth270" n="270"/>
most projecting portion of the abdominal wall some below the
belt.</p>
          <p>At the close of the third round, as the respiratory movements
had assumed a rapidity which made it difficult for the
umpire to count them, they clenched for a fall, and while swinging
to and fro in the effort to down each other they approached so
near the edge of the sand-bank that it caved in. Locked in a
frenzied grip, first one on top and then the other, after some
dozen or more revolutions they rolled into the river and
disappeared for a brief period from view. When they rose to the
surface they were no longer locked in each other's arms. As
each, half strangled and trying to breathe, was blowing the
water (“snortin', ” as Jim called it) out of his mouth and nose,
there was at least three feet of troubled river between them. With
barely strength enough left to reach the bank, and unable to stand,
they sat there in the mud, their lower extremities still submerged,
and, though glaring at each other, pacified by baptism and
pumping for breath. The umpire, holding his side as he described
the affair to me, closed the account by saying, “John, I thought in
my soul I'd die a-laughin' before I could call it a draw.”</p>
          <p>We forded the river on September 30th and moved out to the
foot of Walden's Ridge, which we climbed during a heavy
downpour of rain, the first we had experienced since leaving
Alexandria on August 27th. The trail over this great
mountain could not have been traveled by troops before, for we
came upon a small apple-orchard, the trees of which were
heavily laden with a small but very welcome fruit. Taking small
note of the shower that was coming down at the time, we rode
under the trees and from the saddle filled our forage-sacks.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth271" n="271"/>
          <p>We marched until midnight, bivouacked on the westerly crest
of the ridge until daylight, and reached Anderson's Cross Roads
in Sequatchie Valley early in the morning of October 2d. Our
advance, composed of a portion of two regiments, encountered
the leading wagons of a supply-train guarded by a detachment of
Union infantry, which they attacked; but they were driven back
in no little confusion. We were in line, in reserve, and the beaten
troopers passed through to our rear. One young lad was being
supported by a comrade on either side. He had been shot
through the lung, and was bleeding profusely from the mouth. He
was taken to Camp Morton a prisoner, and made a complete
recovery.</p>
          <p>It was here that General Wheeler paid us the compliment of
sending us in. Colonel Russell threw two companies on the right
flank of their line, which was lying down behind a fence. Seeing
they were flanked, they began to give way, and at this we
charged at full speed, rode over and captured the entire guard. I
do not think they fired more than one volley. Some of the
Federals ran into a field of sorghum-cane which had been blown
down and hid themselves beneath the tangle. When our horses
struck the tangle with their fore legs the crackling sounded not
unlike a bunch of firecrackers popping away, and every few
steps there would rise a frightened man in blue, holding up both
hands. One very badly scared fellow who had been not long out
of his native Deutschland shouted: “<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="de">Mein 
Gott!</foreign></hi> Don't choodt!”</p>
          <p>We didn't shoot for the very good reason that from noon to
near sundown we didn't see any but frightened teamsters, and
not over many of these; for when they heard the guns banging
and heard our yells as we came on galloping they abandoned
their teams and took to the woods and mountains.
<pb id="wyeth272" n="272"/>
Riding up to a single-room log cabin which appeared to be
empty, and shouting, “Come out!” we called forth two
fine-looking young chaps bearing Springfield rifles and full
equipment. They seemed content, but somewhat agitated. I made a hurried
exchange of pocket-knives with one of these prisoners. He was
the owner of a United States army knife, a clever invention
which had one good-sized blade, with a spoon and a fork attached. We
traded even. My “frog-sticker” was of Confederate make, and as the youth
went back under guard I rode on, not entirely satisfying my
conscience that I had not been guilty of a mean act. It was the
first and only time I ever robbed a prisoner—and I wish now I
hadn't done it. The exigencies of war, and the knowledge that he
would be paroled at once and returned to his Northern home
where knives were plentiful helped in a measure to direct my
moral vision once more toward the Westminster Confession.</p>
          <p>For fully ten miles on and on we went, overhauling more
wagons, mules, and plunder than I ever dreamed of seeing in one
day. At times for a quarter or maybe half a mile the road would
be clear. Then we would come upon a bunch of from ten to
fifteen, or maybe fifty or more wagons, jammed and tangled up in
inextricable confusion. In the scramble to get away one vehicle
would be upset or lose a wheel and block the road. First on one
side and then on the other a four or six mule team would wedge
itself, and back of this others in wild flight would pile on one
another and fall over.</p>
          <p>We had gone at as full speed as our horses could be urged for
at least eight miles, and had passed hundreds of wagons. Only the
men with the best mounts had held out; the rest were strung out
in the ruck, setting fire to the wagons, the
<pb id="wyeth273" n="273"/>
smoke of which was already filling the valley as far back as we
could see. Suddenly, while going at a full run, my horse went
down in a limp heap; and it took all I could do to disengage my
right leg, as the animal sprawled and rolled on that side. There
was no bleeding; and, while I had heard the bullets singing among
us as we rode at the train-guard, it did not occur to me that my
horse had been struck. I think it was a rupture of the heart or the
bursting of a large blood-vessel which proved so suddenly fatal.
In my dilemma nothing was left but to transfer my outfit to one
of the captured mules; so, selecting a large, fine-looking animal, I
was soon up and going still farther down the Sequatchie Valley
road toward Bridgeport. The sun was about two hours high when
we reached the end of this great train, probably the largest taken
during the Civil War.</p>
          <p>Not more than twenty men had come this far, and we had
turned back, firing the last wagons as we went. Near sundown
we came upon the rear of a line of cavalry formed across the
valley—and they had on blue uniforms! We didn't know what to
make of this unexpected visitation, and at first thought it must be
our own men; but when through their field-glasses they
recognized us we were quickly undeceived; for they sent a
squadron after us at full speed. Leaving the road, we galloped
across a field, the outer fence of which lay along the foot of
Walden's Ridge, up the steep sides of which we clambered
beyond pursuit. When I exchanged my dead horse for a mule I
had no idea that I would so soon try him out on a mountain-climbing
test; but now he easily outstripped the horses in the party. Two of
these, after we had reached a very great height, stumbled, fell over
backward, and, rolling and bounding like loosened boulders down
the precipitate mountainside, were
<pb id="wyeth274" n="274"/>
dashed to death hundreds of feet below. It was a harrowing and
unusual exhibition of “grand and lofty tumbling.”</p>
          <p>From our high elevation we could now distinctly see the Union
cavalry and other troops coming up the valley to reinforce them.
As far as the eye could reach the smoke was rising from the
burning train, and frequently loud explosions told that the fire had
reached cases of ammunition. The sun was going down, and we,
though distressed beyond measure at our predicament, felt we
had done a great day's work.</p>
          <p>We were in the immediate rear of the Union army in
Chattanooga, and cut off from our command by a superior force
of cavalry which was pursuing our own men. Nothing was left us
now but to abandon our animals, break up into squads of two or
three, and try to slip through Rosecrans's lines and recross the
Tennessee. We knew that the chances of success were slim. My
fine saddle and bridle, captured from the adjutant of the Second
Michigan Cavalry in Kentucky on Christmas Eve, 1862, was
deposited in a hollow tree, together with two extra horseshoes
and all my outfit except an oil-cloth. The last glimpse I had of
my newly acquired mule he was nibbling at the sparse, tough
blades of grass which the western slope of Walden's Ridge
afforded.</p>
          <p>In our party were two sturdy young fellows, members of my
company, both older than I by one or two years. They stood well
in every way, and I cast my lot with them. In the run I had the
misfortune to lose my carbine, but still retained my army pistol
and its cartridges. One of my comrades still had his gun, the other
had also lost his in the wild scramble through the thick
underbrush. Our camping outfit was my oil-cloth and a blanket
each for the
<pb id="wyeth275" n="275"/>
other two. Having been driven from the train so precipitately, we
had failed to secure any food-supplies from the rich capture, nor
had we filled with water the one canteen in our kit. We were
hungry, of course, and thirsty beyond expression; but darkness
had come on, we could not see to walk, so we huddled together
to keep warm, and spent a very cold and unhappy night. Our
craving for water was intensified in the numerous intervals of
waking by hearing the water pouring over a mill-dam in the
valley, and with the first streak of dawn we lost no time in finding
it. No shipwrecked mariner could have appreciated a drink more
than we did this refreshing supply from the race.</p>
          <p>Seeing a well-worn path, I followed it in search of a house and
something to eat, requesting my comrades to follow. I soon came
to a log cabin with an open door, and as I reached the gate I
could see opposite this another door which opened on a back
porch. There was no platform or piazza in front, both doors were
wide open, yet no one seemed to be stirring. As I opened the gate
its wooden hinges creaked, and almost instantly a woman
appeared in the door. Recognizing my gray jacket, she said,
quickly: “You're a rebel, and you'd better go away. There's a
Union soldier on the back porch!” As she began this greeting I
knew I was not a welcome guest, and before she finished I had
my pistol out and ready, and none too soon, for as I reached the
front door, which she cleared when she saw what might happen,
a man in Federal uniform stepped into the rear doorway just
opposite and started toward the chimney, where, leaning against
the jamb, I saw his gun. He was wise enough to see the odds
were in my favor, and when I told him to stop he did so, raising
his right hand in token of surrender. I took possession of his
Springfield rifle, a beautiful weapon, one of the best all-round
<pb id="wyeth276" n="276"/>
army guns of our war. He was one of the infantry
guarding the train when we attacked it the day before, had
escaped into the woods, and at dark was lucky enough to seek shelter
under a roof that welcomed a blue uniform.</p>
          <p>My two comrades came up at this juncture, and to the one who had
lost his gun in the stampede up the mountain I turned over the new
equipment. The woman with none too good a grace gave us one
small pone of corn-bread, which she said was all she had to
spare. I thanked her, and, telling my Yankee friend that he was
free to go where he pleased and that the Federals were now in
possession of the valley road, we went back to the mill-race,
made a fair divide, and enjoyed
our breakfast of corn-bread and branch water, filled our one
canteen, and then proceeded on the tramp in the direction of the
Tennessee River. Now and then we got glimpses of the valley
road along which the Union cavalry was marching in its pursuit of
Wheeler's riders, and to keep clear we took our course about half-way
up the steep side of the mountain. Being horsemen, we were
unaccustomed to walking, and the rough going over boulders, logs,
loose stones, and brush told on us heavily. By noon the canteen
was emptied, and the sun, which was now over on our slope of
the ridge, was as much too hot for comfort as the night had been
too cold. Seeing below us a corn-patch, we ventured down, found
a spring, and after laying in an essential supply of water
we pulled several ears of corn and started back
up the slope. As we were clambering over the fence
the people who lived in the cabin near the spring spied us and
yelled something which we did not stop to analyze. Our
sentiments came very near expression in the remark of the
colored woman who went with her “old man” to see the great
curiosity of a later period, the “X-ray.” When
<pb id="wyeth277" n="277"/>
she looked through the fluorescope and saw through his
coat and shirt not only the bones in her husband's chest, but
objects beyond, she laid the instrument aside and sought the door,
saying: “Efram, I'm gwine home; 'tain't no place for a lady!”</p>
          <p>One bit of luck in our chapter of misfortunes was the
possession of a box of matches. Early in the captured train we
came across a lot of lucifer matches, the first, I think, I had ever
seen. We made effective use of them in setting
fire to the wagons as we rode along. Every teamster carried at
the tail-board or hind gate of his wagon a feed-trough, and among
other provender some fodder or hay, and all we had to do was to
strike one of these red-headed matches and as it flared up stick it
in among this combustible material, and the job was done. When
we were driven off I happened to have in my pocket the
remnants of one of these boxes, and now it came in well, for we
made a fire and parched our corn and had luncheon. Moreover,
we rested, pulled off our boots or shoes to cool our feet, which
were beginning to blister, then trudged on wearily and painfully
a few miles farther until dark. Then, wishing we were at the
Tennessee or anywhere else than where we were
excepting Hades, we fell asleep from exhaustion. When we
awoke it was October 4th, a date I wish I could forget.</p>
          <p>As we ate what was left of our parched corn and emptied the
canteen, a council of war was held. We were a unit on one point:
we couldn't continue along the rough slope of the mountain; and I
saw with more regret than surprise that my two companions had
about lost heart. They voted to go down to the valley road and
surrender as the easiest way out of our seemingly hopeless
dilemma. Their argument was not without force, for prisoners of
war were
<pb id="wyeth278" n="278"/>
being exchanged then, and, without all this suffering from fatigue
and hunger and the danger of missing our way through the Federal
lines, in the immediate rear of which we were, we might, by
surrendering, be exchanged and so safely back with the regiment
in a few weeks. I prevailed on them to try the top of the ridge,
which was one of the highest of the ranges in that part of
Tennessee, with a rock escarpment along its western slope from
one to two hundred feet high. It was a hard pull to the base of
this magnificent cliff, which we found so precipitous that no one
could scale it without a ladder. We staggered along over the
stony debris which had been eroded by the wear and tear of
frosts and time, until in sheer despair and weakness my
companions threw their guns and accouterments away, saying
they were too weak to carry them any longer. Farther on we
came to a deep fissure in the escarpment, and up this we
clambered, helping one another in the hardest places, and at last
found ourselves on the plateau, where we were glad to sit down
on the trunk of a fallen tree and rest.</p>
          <p>The prospect was far from reassuring. For forty-eight hours
we had eaten nothing but a small bit of corn-bread and some
parched corn, and not much of that. We were too much
exhausted to retrace our steps to the valley; to follow the ridge to
where the river cuts through it in sight of Chattanooga was
impossible, for there was neither water nor food on the route; and
as we estimated the distance we were still some thirty miles
from the Tennessee. As far as we could see there was not a sign
of human habitation, nothing but an unbroken vista of sparsely
timbered, half-barren mountain plateau. While we were getting
what comfort we might out of these somber reflections we saw,
as if he had come up out of the earth, coming so directly
<pb id="wyeth279" n="279"/>
toward us that he must of necessity pass very near, a man on
foot—a Federal soldier, for he had on a full blue uniform. He had
not seen us, so we simply slid backward off the log and peered
over at the passing stranger. As he came nearer I saw he was
unarmed, and it would have been a simple matter to have taken
him in with my six-shooter. We were, however, as desirous of
not being seen as he could be; and he went on his way in blissful
ignorance of the fact that six Confederate eyes were taking his
measure only a few yards away. He was evidently a deserter
from Rosecrans's army trying to make his way back to his home
through the woods across these desolate mountains. Poor fellow,
he was in more danger than we, for if caught he would be shot in
short order, and the chances were heavily against him, for he had
many weary miles to tramp before he could cross the Ohio. Even
then he would not be safe. Our own situation did not admit of
argument, and as our only hope of getting out at all lay in the
direction of food and water, we struck out in desperation straight
across the plateau.</p>
          <p>Between three and four in the afternoon we spied a break in
the timber ahead, which as we came nearer proved to be a small
clearing around which was the wreckage of a half-rotten rail-fence
The inclosure, which contained several good-sized apple-trees,
was uncultivated. When we reached the trees we
discovered plenty of leaves but not one solitary apple, and in the
sandy ground beneath we read the reason. There were footprints
without number, and fresh, and <hi rend="italics">square-toed shoes had made
them</hi>, and we knew these shoes were worn by Union soldiers.
We listened eagerly and could hear nothing, but, as children
playing “hide and seek” might say, we were “getting warm.” A
ravine at the corner of the inclosure indicated the presence
<pb id="wyeth280" n="280"/>
of the spring, which must be somewhere near; for no one could
ever have lived there without this source of a supply of water.</p>
          <p>We found it, refreshed ourselves, and started up the narrow
path which we supposed would take us to the home of the people
who used this spring. This trail led up a sharp rise, and just as I
reached the top I almost collided with two Federal soldiers, who,
climbing up the other side, reached the crest as I did. I ducked
down instantly, and, getting my pistol out as I turned, ran back and
passed comrades, saying, “Run boys! Here are the Yankees!” One
of these answered, “It's no use; we might as well surrender now”;
and, as the two men in blue were right on them, they gave up. At
this I turned about and noticed that the man in front was an officer
and had, so far as I could see, no other weapon than his sword. The
equipment of his companion, who was directly behind him in the
path, I could not make out.</p>
          <p>Taking a dead aim at the officer, who, pluckily advancing,
was not ten steps from the muzzle of my pistol, I was just in the
act of firing when Frank Erwin jumped between him and me and,
running toward me with both hands raised, cried, appealingly: “For
God's sake, John, don't shoot him! If you do, we'll all be
murdered.” With this I threw my six-shooter on the ground and was
a prisoner. The humiliation and wretchedness of this moment I
shall not attempt to describe; but I render my captor the compliment
due a brave soldier.</p>
          <p>We were practically in the bivouac of a company of cavalry.
We were placed under guard in a wagon, and carried by sundown
back into Sequatchie Valley, and turned over to the Tenth Illinois
Infantry. Three fine young fellows
<pb id="wyeth281" n="281"/>
were detailed to take charge of us, and for safe-keeping the
adjutant of this regiment (I think he was called Captain Lusk)
directed that we be guarded inside of an old unused stable. The
stench was so disagreeable that I said to the officer, “The smell
in here is so bad, couldn't you let us sleep out in the lot?” and his
quick retort was, “Young man, Jesus Christ was born in a stable,
and you might afford to spend a night in one.”</p>
          <p>When dark came the corporal of the guard said, “Boys, if
you'll give us your word of honor you won't try to escape you
may come out here and lay around the fire with us,” and we did.
These were fine fellows, and I found out that my first cousin,
Thomas Smith, of Jacksonville, Illinois, was captain of this
company. He was, however, absent on account of an illness
from which he died. Richmond Walcott was the lieutenant in
command, and was very courteous to me. We had not as yet
tasted food, and when I remarked to young McEvers that we
hadn't had anything for a long time he said they were on
half-rations by reason of our destruction of their train, but that he
would see what could be done. He disappeared for a while, and
came back with two big army crackers (hardtack) for each of us
and a jar of strained honey. In 1868, while visiting my relatives
there, I called on this young man at his home in Jacksonville to
pay my respects. On October 5th we started by wagon for
Stevenson, Alabama, where we spent several days in a
stockade. Our route lay through miles of burned wagons and
fully a thousand dead mules, for when General Wheeler saw he
could not escape with these animals he ordered them killed. As
our wagon was passing near where I had captured the Union
soldier I happened to see him, sitting by the roadside. The
recognition was mutual,
<pb id="wyeth282" n="282"/>
and he greeted me cordially with, “Hello, Johnny! They've got
<hi rend="italics">you</hi> this time,” and I told him it looked that 
way. The term Johnny,
an abbreviation of “Johnny Reb,” was often used by Union
soldiers in greeting a Confederate.</p>
          <p>From Stevenson we were carried by train to Nashville, and
there confined in the state penitentiary for two days. I slept in a
cold, damp cell along with deserters, “bounty-jumpers,” and a
crowd of criminals, many of whom had a ball and chain dangling
at their ankles. In this prison I contracted a cold, which
developed into a severe pneumonia, the initial chill of which came
on three days later, when I arrived in Camp Morton. The troops
which chased us into the mountains on October 2d belonged to a
brigade of cavalry under Colonel E. M. McCook,
<ref targOrder="U" id="ref51" n="51" rend="sc" target="note51">1</ref> who was just
too late to save the great train he was sent to protect. They had
come up from Bridgeport by a road parallel with the one down
which we were advancing in the destruction of their wagons.
When they heard the wagons loaded with ammunition exploding
they came through a gap in the intervening ridge and formed their
line of battle facing up the valley, cutting our detachment
hopelessly off from our main column.</p>
          <p>Russell's Fourth Alabama regiment, unaided, captured this
immense train. General Wheeler reported: “The number of
wagons was variously estimated from eight hundred to fifteen
hundred. The quartermaster in charge of the train stated that
there were eight hundred six-mule wagons besides a great
number of sutler's wagons. The train was guarded by a brigade
of cavalry in front and a brigade of cavalry in the rear, and on
the flank where we attacked were stationed two regiments of
infantry.” General
<note id="note51" n="51" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref51">1 
<hi rend="italics">Official Records</hi>, vol. xxx, part 1, p. 675.</note>
<pb id="wyeth283" n="283"/>
Rosecrans, commander-in-chief of the Union army, in a
despatch to Major-General Burnside, dated October 5, 1863,
referring to this train, says: “Your failure to close your troops
down to our left has cost five hundred wagons loaded with
essentials, and Heaven only knows where the mischief will end.”
From my own observation, I am of the opinion that five hundred
would not be very far from correct. We missed one bunch of
about thirty wagons which had turned off in a narrow and not
much used roadway, and were already partly toward the summit
of Walden's Ridge. One of these was reported to have been the
paymaster's wagon, loaded with greenbacks enough to pay off
the army in Chattanooga. As to the truth of this I cannot testify.
We lost two men killed in my company and eight or ten captured.</p>
          <p>With the exception of our detachment of about twenty men
(and not more than this number rode on until the last wagon was
taken), which was hopelessly cut off from escape by the
interposition of McCook's brigade, our losses would have been
insignificant had it not been for the unfortunate discovery of a
sutler's wagon loaded to the guards with brandied peaches. The
driver and owner had fled at our approach, and, having sought
safety by climbing up the steep side of Walden's Ridge, along the
foot of which the road lay, was in all likelihood a helpless and
hopeless witness of the plundering of his merchandise. The rich
harvest this sutler had expected to reap when he arrived in the
beleaguered fortress of Chattanooga was not to be garnered.
Man only proposes; the disposition is elsewhere.</p>
          <p>The brandy must have been very strong or our men unusually
susceptible to intoxication, for quite a number became so drunk
from eating these peaches that they fell
<pb id="wyeth284" n="284"/>
from their horses and were made prisoners while asleep on the
roadside. One officer on General Wheeler's staff suffered an
impairment of co-ordination to such an extent that in a sabre duel
with a Federal trooper the Union <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">sabreur</foreign></hi> 
dealt him a right cut
which not only unhorsed him, but cut his upper lip clear across
just beneath the nose, leaving it and the attached mustache to
droop an inch below the normal position. He joined our squad of
prisoners at Stevenson, and was about the most dilapidated
member of the group.</p>
          <p>Of my personal experiences on this exciting day, beyond the
loss of my horse a brief interview with our general was the most
interesting. We had whipped everything in sight, captured the
train-guard or scattered it into the woods, and I had kept on
overtaking wagon after wagon for fully eight miles without
stopping for a minute to hunt for something to eat. At last, seeing
a big box of cheese and some crackers in one of the wagons, I
dismounted, threw the bridle over a standard, clambered in, cut
off a large chunk of the cheese, filled my pockets with crackers,
and was just in the act of remounting my captured mule when
General Wheeler galloped up, sword in hand, and said to me,
“Get in your saddle and go on after the enemy.” As he and I were
the only Confederates in sight just then, I said, “All right,
General. Have some cheese,” and the private and the
major-general rode on side by side down the Sequatchie Valley road
“after the enemy” and munching cheese and crackers.</p>
          <p>Fully thirty years after the war I gave a dinner in New York
to a number of friends in honor of my old commander, and in
introducing him I told this story as above given, seemingly to
his enjoyment at the remembrance of it. My
<pb id="wyeth285" n="285"/>
military career practically ended on October 4, 1863. Had I
thought for an instant that there would be no further exchange of
prisoners, or that for sixteen weary months there was in store for
me the anguish of enforced idleness and the suffering from cold,
hunger, and vermin, to say nothing of the cruel indifference of
our keepers, I would not have surrendered as long as I could
have stood on my feet. It was a lucky thing for the officer to
whom I yielded, for I could and would have killed him,
notwithstanding the intervention of my comrades. It is all now of
the long ago, and “all's well that ends well”; but it was a sad
awakening from my soldier dream of glory.</p>

PRISON LIFE IN CAMP MORTON—HOMEWARD BOUND—
JOHN JONES</head>
          <p>IT was about the middle of October, 1863, and late at night
when we arrived in the prison inclosure at Camp Morton, in the
suburbs of Indianapolis. No provision had been made for “fresh
fish”—the term of welcome applied to every new batch of
prisoners—and we slept, or tried to sleep, through the cold night in
the open air upon the ground. This was a fitting introduction to the
indifference and brutality of the authorities who had succeeded
the noble, generous, and beloved Colonel Owen as commander of
this prison, to whose memory we ex-Confederates in later years
in grateful recognition placed a memorial bust in the capitol at
Indianapolis. Toward morning I was seized with a chill which
lasted for several hours and ushered in a severe attack of
pneumonia, from the effects of which I did not recover for many
years.</p>
          <p>As soon as it was day a fellow-prisoner, the Rev. J. G. Wilson,
formerly President of the Huntsville (Alabama) Female College,
requested an officer in charge to send me to a hospital, or at least
put me under shelter. He was told there was no room, but was
promised that the first vacancy would be held for me. This
occurred, as the hospital steward afterward informed me, at 2 P.M.,
and an hour later I was in the dead man's bed.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth287" n="287"/>
          <p>I found myself in kind hands and under the skilful care of Dr.
Charles J. Kipp, whom in later years I was to know intimately.
Little did he or I think as I lay there day after day, a lad of
eighteen years, hovering between life and death, that in 1902 I
should, as President of the American Medical Association, entertain
him, a delegate from the state of New Jersey, as the honored guest
of myself and my family. In 1911 this noble man died; and, as it was
impossible for me to attend the funeral, I sent a floral tribute and a note
saying, “From an old Confederate soldier who owes a lasting debt of
gratitude to this great and good surgeon of the Union army.” I
was told the minister read this for his text, and from it preached
the funeral sermon.</p>
          <p>During my prison life, broken in health by exposure and lack of
sufficient food, I spent several months in the hospitals at Camp
Morton, and I bear witness to the conscientious attention and
kindly treatment accorded to myself and comrades by the
physicians, nurses, and hospital authorities.</p>
          <p>It is none the less true that in 1863, and to the middle of 1864,
the facilities for treating the sick were wholly inadequate, and
many deaths were doubtless due to this failure to provide the
necessary quarters. Later wooden pavilions with plastered walls
and ceilings were erected, and by the fall of 1864 these were
increased to a capacity equal to all ordinary requirements.</p>
          <p>The hospital in which I found myself was composed of two
square army tents merged into one pavilion, on either
side of which cots were placed—I think sixteen beds in all. The
heat furnished was from a single stove which was situated near
the center of the aisle. The floor was of plank, elevated slightly
above the ground.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth288" n="288"/>
          <p>Since I had no clothes except the light suit I wore when
captured, and was without an overcoat or a blanket, my good
friend Dr. Wilson notified my relatives living at Jacksonville,
Illinois, of my serious illness and great needs. A sister of my
mother came at once to the prison and provided me with
everything I needed, gave me twenty dollars in greenbacks, and
left an order at headquarters for all I might require. In about
three weeks I was declared convalescent and sent back to the
cold, cheerless barracks in which no method of heating had been
installed. Within a fortnight I was taken ill with measles and sent
to the hospital for contagious diseases, where I remained for
many weeks.</p>
          <p>Camp Morton, a military prison, was in 1863 a plot of ground
formerly used as a fair-ground, in shape a parallelogram,
containing then about twenty acres of land and inclosed by a
plank wall some twenty feet high. In 1864 the prison wall was
moved out on one side, taking in some ten acres more. It was
bisected by a little rivulet which the prisoners christened “the
Potomac.” The barracks were situated on either side of this
branch. They had been erected as cattle-sheds and stables for
fair-ground purposes, were about twenty feet wide, ten feet to
the eaves, fifteen to the middle of the roof, and about eighty feet
long. The sides were of weather-boards ten to twelve inches
wide, set on end, and leaving numerous cracks through which the
rain and snow beat in upon us. I have often seen our top blankets
white with snow when we were hustled out for morning roll-call.</p>
          <p>The roof was of shingles and water-tight. Along the comb an
open space about a foot wide extended the entire length of the
shed. The earth served as a floor, which in wet weather
became a quagmire near the two end doors.
<pb id="wyeth289" n="289"/>
Along each side of this shelter, extending seven feet toward the
center, were constructed four tiers of bunks, the lowest about one
foot from the ground, the second three feet above this, the third
three feet above the second, while the fourth was on a level with
the eaves. Upon these long shelves, not partitioned off, the
prisoners slept or lay down, heads to the wall and feet toward the
center of the passageway. About two feet of space was allotted
to each man, making about three hundred and twenty men housed
in each shed. As we had little or no straw for bedding, and as
each man was allowed only one blanket, there was scant comfort
to be had in our bunks until our miseries were forgotten in sleep.
The scarcity of blankets forced us to huddle together in cold
weather three in a group or more, with one blanket between us
and the planks, and the other two for covering. The custom was
to take turns in occupying the warm middle place.</p>
          <p>The only attempt at heating these sheds was by means of four
stoves placed at equal distances along the passageway, and these
were not installed until late in the winter of 1863. Even then only
the stronger men who could push or fight their way to the fire and
had muscle enough to maintain their place enjoyed the luxury of
artificial warmth. Up to Christmas of 1864 I do not believe I had
felt the heat from a stove, as I was unable to hold my own in the
miserable crowd which hovered about the fire until the guards
drove them to their bunks at dark. Among men the great number
of whom had never been in a cold climate the suffering was
intense, when with such surroundings the mercury was near zero.
The records show that it was twenty degrees below zero at
Indianapolis on New Year's day, 1864, and that it remained below
for thirty-six hours. One
<pb id="wyeth290" n="290"/>
man sleeping near my bunk was frozen to death, and many
perished from disease brought on by exposure, added to their
condition of emaciation from lack of food.</p>
          <p>During the very coldest spells the prisoners were in the habit of
sleeping in larger squads or groups, since the cold could be better
combated by combining blankets and body heat. The top blanket
would be moistened to make it more impermeable and prevent the
radiation of body warmth. Lots were drawn for places, and woe to
the unfortunate end men. The squad of from five to seven slept
“spoon fashion.” No one was allowed to rest on his back, since this
took up too much room from the middle of the blankets. The
narrower the bulk to be covered the thicker the covering. At
intervals all through these intensely cold nights above the shivering
groans of the unhappy prisoners could be heard the orders of the
end men, “Now, boys, spoon!” and they would all flop over on the
other side, to the gratification of one end man and the disgust of
the other, whose back by the change was once more exposed to
the cold. No one can imagine how long those days and nights of
winter seemed unless he has gone through such an experience.</p>
          <p>Relatives living in the North and my good friends the
Breckinridges in Kentucky supplied me generously with books,
and many an hour of those days of desolation was utilized in
reading, and especially in studying French. Some one sent a
Fasquelle's French grammar, and I almost “learned it by heart.”
There were among the prisoners a goodly number of Louisiana
creoles, whose mother tongue was French, and from some of
these I took lessons in conversation.</p>
          <p>During my term of imprisonment I had a good opportunity
<pb id="wyeth291" n="291"/>
to make a careful study of the Bible, which I read through
three times while there. I remember some thoughtful friend sent
me a book, which no doubt she supposed would fit into the
loneliness of a prisoner in his cell. It was entitled <hi rend="italics">Salad for the
Solitary</hi>. She would have smiled to see the hopeless efforts I
was making to be “solitary” in our over-packed cattle-shed.</p>
          <p>When the bugle sounded, between daylight and sunrise, we
gladly tumbled out for roll-call, for we were tired of the hard
planks. Our toilet, which in winter consisted of putting on our
hats, was soon over, and we were in line to answer to our
names. In the <hi rend="italics">Medical and Surgical History of the Rebellion</hi>,
issued from the office of the Surgeon-General of the United
States Army (Medical Volume, Part III), is the report of an
official inspection of these quarters in Camp Morton, made in
July, 1864. They are described as “nine dilapidated barracks.”
“There were also two hundred and ten tents in use. The quarters
were much crowded. This condition continued until September,
1864.”</p>
          <p>At no period was the ration issued sufficient to satisfy hunger.
During the first few months of my prison life I was allowed to
purchase certain articles from the prison sutler. Tickets which
were worthless elsewhere were issued by this man to the
prisoners in return for greenbacks placed to their credit at
headquarters. Although the prices paid were extortionately high,
we never ceased to regret the order which closed this source of
supply. I was reduced to such straits that at one time I gladly paid
fifteen cents for a single ear of corn, and I know from personal
observation that many of my comrades suffered acutely from
starvation. Day after day it was easy to notice the progress of
emaciation, until the men became so weak that when

attacked with an illness which a well-nourished man would
readily have resisted they succumbed. One feature of this
miserable process of starvation by degrees, sadder by far than
death itself, was the moral degradation to which many of the
prisoners sank. Men who had borne reputations for honesty and
soldierly conduct not only practised stealing from their comrades,
but fed like hogs upon the refuse material thrown into the swill-tubs
from the hospital kitchen. I was one of a committee whose
duty it was to forcibly prevent these men from making brutes of
themselves and bringing shame unjustly upon their comrades by
such unmanly practices.</p>
          <p>In the <hi rend="italics">Century Magazine</hi> for September, 1891, Dr. Charles J.
Kipp, who was surgeon in charge, says: “I know that the refuse
material of the swill-barrels of the hospital was often carried
away by the prisoners. I reported this fact to the officers, and
was assured by them that the men who did this had either sold
their rations or lost them through gambling.”</p>
          <p>The sad truth is that the poor fellows were hungry, and did not
have the moral courage to abstain from eating this kitchen
refuse. In punishment, upon one occasion, we dipped a chronic
offender head foremost as far as his shoulders in the swill and
exacted from him a promise that he would never repeat the
offense. All the rats which could be trapped were eaten, and to
my knowledge one fat dog was captured by my messmates,
cooked, and eaten. I was invited to partake; and, although the
scent of the cooking meat was tempting, I could not so far
overcome my repugnance to this animal as an article of diet as to
taste it. The only way to obtain a bit of extra bread was by
barter with tobacco.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth293" n="293"/>
          <p>In the last months of my prison life tobacco became the
medium of exchange. Those of us who had money at
headquarters received sutler's tickets in exchange, and with
these we bought small plugs of black tobacco, which we traded
for bits of bread and other food with those who would part with a
small part of their ration for a chew of tobacco or a smoke. The
unit of currency was a “chaw” of tobacco, cut about one inch
square and a quarter of an inch thick. A loaf of bread, about
three and a half inches wide and deep by seven inches long, was
known as a “duffer,” and a cracker as “hardtack.” The oil and
marrow of beef bones, which were carefully split into fine
particles and boiled, formed a prison luxury called “bone butter.”
The entire ration for one day was not enough for a single meal.
As soon as bread was issued the more improvident devoured
their loaves without waiting for anything else. When the wagon
was late a crowd would gather as near the gate as they dared to
approach and shout “Bread! Bread!” in a distressing chorus. The
small piece of meat would be eaten at once, and after this, with
the exception of a pint of soup issued to each man at sundown,
nothing was received until the next day. The more sensible men
restrained their appetites until the entire ration was received, and
then divided it in two portions, for a morning and an afternoon
meal. There were seven men in my mess, and the piece of meat
for this squad was divided into as many portions, so equally
distributed that each member expressed himself as entirely
satisfied before lots were drawn. To avoid any suspicion of
partiality one member turned his back, and as the chief touched
one portion and cried, “Who gets this?” the arbiter would call the
name of the person to whom it was to be allotted. There was no
appeal from this decision.
<pb id="wyeth294" n="294"/>
When vegetables were issued with the meat there was no soup
at sundown.</p>
          <p>For the first three months of my imprisonment I was almost
all of the time in the hospital, ill with pneumonia and measles and
the prostration which followed. Early in 1864 the “retaliatory
order” from the office of the Secretary of War at Washington
was carried into effect; and our ration, already insufficient, was
still further reduced. Although I could command all the money I
wanted, I could not use it to purchase food from the outside.
Moreover, we had no way of letting those ready and willing to
send us food know of our want. Every line written was scanned,
and any suggestion of lack of food or maltreatment caused the
destruction of the letter. For a short time I was detailed as
“camp messenger” at the prison headquarters, and while there I
witnessed the method of “going through the mail” by the
inspectors, who did not hesitate to appropriate their contents in
the shape of prison-made trinkets inclosed to friends. A ring
which I had bought from a prisoner and sent as a souvenir to my
uncle, an officer in the Union service, was never received by
him.</p>
          <p>Naturally, men in such wretched surroundings were on the
alert to escape, and some took desperate, often fatal, chances to
regain their liberty. The wall of twenty feet, smooth on the inside,
was so high, the sentinels so close together, and the approach so
well lighted that an attempt to scale the parapet was virtually
inviting death. The sentinels were on a walk-way so well
concealed that only their heads and shoulders could be seen. At
night strong reflectors were so placed that while the prison yard
was as light as day the sentinels were invisible, and all beyond
seemed doubly dark. A ditch sixteen feet wide and ten feet
deep
<pb id="wyeth295" n="295"/>
had been dug just inside the wall. In one dash for the fence two
prisoners were killed and several captured. The survivors were
disciplined by being tied with their backs to trees all through the
remainder of the night. I saw them released the next morning in
a most pitiable condition of exhaustion. On another occasion
between thirty and forty prisoners made a rush for the fence at
dark. Ladders hastily constructed by splicing bits of plank taken
from the berths were used to scale the fence. Armed with
stones, pieces of wood, and bottles filled with water, they
overturned an outhouse into the ditch, crossed on this, placed
their ladders against the wall, and attacked the guards, all of
whom ran away. No one was killed, and the entire body of men
succeeded in getting over the fence, although several were
recaptured the next day.</p>
          <p>A number of tunnels were projected, but only one was
successful, and four or five men escaped. The night following, a
prisoner, foolishly hoping the outlet had not been discovered,
essayed the same route, and as he stuck his head out the
heartless guard standing at the hole, without giving the
unfortunate man a chance to surrender, placed a gun against his
head and blew his brains out.</p>
          <p>I was interested in two tunnels, one of which had to be
abandoned on account of filling with water soon after it was
started. In the other a shaft eight feet deep was sunk in the
corner of a tent, and from the bottom of this in the direction of
the fence, some sixty yards away, the tunnel was projected. One
man would work in the tunnel, cutting the loose earth or sand and
gravel with a case-knife, and putting it into a sack, which was
drawn back into the tent, and the contents concealed under a
blanket until sundown. At dusk, after tucking the last few inches
of the
<pb id="wyeth296" n="296"/>
legs of our trousers into the tops of our socks, we would fill up
from above with as much loose dirt as we could carry without
attracting too much notice, and then stroll unconcernedly in
the direction of “the Potomac.” Reaching the middle of one of the
various planks or small bridges across this stream, the trousers
leg on one side and then on the other would be pulled out of the
sock and the gravel and sand allowed to drop into the water,
where it disappeared. When very near completion this tunnel
also was discovered, to our great disappointment.</p>
          <p>Of the cruel indignities to which the prisoners were subjected I
witnessed only a small proportion. I saw Corporal Augustus Baker,
a man whose heartless conduct toward us entitles him to painful
notoriety, shoot a prisoner for leaving the ranks after roll-call
was ended but before “Break ranks” was commanded. The man
was too eager to warm himself at a fire only a few feet distant
from the line. It was a bitter cold morning; the poor fellow had no
overcoat or blanket with which to cover himself, and he
ventured to the fire. Baker drew his pistol, saying with an oath,
“I'll show you how to leave ranks before you are dismissed!” and
deliberately shot him down. The wound was not fatal, but the
intent was murderous. The commanding officer testified after the
war that he had never known of this shooting.</p>
          <p>On April 16, 1864, one guard, at a single shot, the minié ball
passing through the bodies of both, killed James Beattie
and Michael Healy, who were walking in front of him on
garbage detail outside the prison quarters. I was with one of
these men as he was dying, and heard him solemnly assert in
the presence of death that they had made no attempt to escape,
had disobeyed no order, and that he and his comrade had been
deliberately murdered.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth297" n="297"/>
          <p>On various occasions I saw prisoners beaten with sticks for no
other provocation than that they would not move quickly to get
out of the way or cease talking when the patrol was passing. At
one time I saw an officer with a stick of firewood knock two
men down, leaving them unconscious. To discourage all efforts
at escape an order was enforced that a prisoner when obliged to
go to the sink at night should not wear a coat. Two men from my
barracks one intensely cold night infringed upon this rule, were
detected, and compelled to mark time in the deep snow for so
long that one of them was frost-bitten and parts of both feet
were lost from gangrene. He died from exhaustion on the train
on which we were being carried to Baltimore in February, 1865.</p>
          <p>Another constant source of unhappiness and discomfort was
from vermin. Try as one would, it seemed impossible to avoid
them. Finally the nuisance became so unbearable that the
Vigilance Committee in our barracks forced a general inspection
and cleaning-up. Men were compelled to strip, their hair was
closely cropped, and their apparel dipped in a caldron of scalding
water. It is not pleasant to think, much less to write, of such
disgusting conditions, but I feel that the repulsive side of war
should be given along with the heroic, which is always
emphasized. I saw in one of these crusades a forlorn wretch
standing as naked as when he made his advent into the world
trying to thaw out his wardrobe, which had frozen stiff as it
came out of the boiling water. We were not long in discovering
that the law of gravitation applied to vermin as well as to other
ponderable matter, and that the berths of the top row were less
infested; so those of our committee and the cleaner set quietly
organized a syndicate and bought out the top bunks.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth298" n="298"/>
          <p>Our efforts at exclusiveness naturally excited comment,
and not infrequently we were referred to as the “top-bunk
aristocracy.” United States Senator Pasco, now living at
Monticello, Florida, was among our select group of top-bunkers.</p>
          <p>To half a dozen prisoners who could command the means the
privilege was accorded in 1864 of having constructed at their
private expense a small one-room shanty and of living in it. I was
invited to join the group, and I would have gladly done so had it
not involved the desertion of my two comrades who in cold
weather were largely dependent on my extra blankets. My uncle,
Mr. David A. Smith, of Jacksonville, Illinois, who as a young man
had practised law in the same circuit with Mr. Lincoln and was
intimately acquainted with him, secured from the President a
parole and desired me to come and live with him and continue my
studies at the University of Illinois. As the acceptance of this
parole until the war was over would carry the implication of
desertion in case an exchange of prisoners took place, I felt
bound to decline the generous offer. My uncle then endeavored
to have the parole modified so that I might remain until
exchanged, but Mr. Stanton would not consent to this. It was a
great temptation, but the last words my mother and father had
said to me were, “Don't forget that, although you are only a boy
and all we have, we would rather have you come home in a
coffin than dishonored.”</p>
          <p>History records few instances of the considerate treatment of
prisoners of war. In the late conflict with Russia the conduct of
Japan stands out as an exception. In our war both sides were
grievously at fault. We of the Southern side cannot wholly
excuse Andersonville, albeit we have much in extenuation. I saw
this prison-pen two months
<pb id="wyeth299" n="299"/>
before the surrender, and no good reason could be advanced for
not providing better shelter for the inmates. The material was at
hand in the great pine forests in sight, and the prisoners should
have been made to protect themselves. The failure to do this
was due to that indifference which characterized the
management of nearly all the prison-pens on both sides. The
fault was naturally with the one man who was actually in charge.</p>
          <p>When in 1891 my article in the <hi rend="italics">Century Magazine</hi> excited so
much discussion, the commandant of this prison who was in
charge during my imprisonment testified that he had never heard
of Corporal Baker shooting a prisoner. I stood within a few yards
of Baker and witnessed the whole cruel proceeding. There were
other witnesses. Yet the man who should have been held
responsible and whose duty it was to protect prisoners never
knew of it until he read my article twenty-seven years after it
occurred.</p>
          <p>The “retaliation act” of the United States government, reducing
in 1864 the ration of the prisoner of war, was one of the most
cruel acts of this unhappy period. This authorized starvation
caused the death of thousands by lowering their resistance to the
diseases incident to exposure. The Confederates did not have the
proper food in quality or quantity to give to their prisoners. The
records show that the prisoners at Andersonville were getting the
ration issued to the Confederate soldier in the field. In the winter
of 1864-65 the Confederate commissary-general reported that
“the Army of Northern Virginia was living literally from hand to
mouth.” Beef sold at six dollars a pound, and flour at one
thousand dollars a barrel. At one time, pleading with his
government for food, Lee said that for three days his men
had been in line of
<pb id="wyeth300" n="300"/>
battle and had not tasted meat. These are truths of record.</p>
          <p>At the North there was no such excuse. Their granaries were full,
and the world was open to them. The Union prisoners at
Andersonville were in general unaccustomed to coarse corn
meal, and this, with the conditions due to a hot
climate and the malarial mosquito and other insects which
spread disease, will account for the difference in the ratio
of mortality. The official records of the United States
government show that of every thousand Federal prisoners
held in captivity by the Confederacy one hundred and fifty-three
died. At Camp Morton the records show that one
hundred and forty-six of every thousand died. At
Andersonville three hundred and thirty-three of every thousand
Union prisoners perished. At Elmira, New York, two hundred
and forty-five of every thousand Confederates died
(War Department Records).</p>
          <p>The Confederates had no quinine to check the ravages of
malaria. They appealed directly to Washington for a supply for
use at Andersonville, and offered to have it conveyed by the
agents of the United States government under proper escort and
distributed by them to the prisoners. The United States
government refused to accede to this humane request. Later the
Confederates offered to turn over these prisoners without
exchange if the Washington authorities would send a fleet of
vessels to some convenient point on the coast to receive them.
Several months elapsed before these ships were sent, and in the
period of delay several thousand more deaths occurred. Well may
the New England historian Rhodes conclude, “We of the North
cannot afford to throw stones at our brethren of the South on
the question of the treatment of prisoners.”</p>
          <pb id="wyeth301" n="301"/>
          <p>In the final analysis it is evident that the real cause of all the
suffering and death which the retention of soldiers in prison-camps
entailed during the Civil War is traceable to the war
policy of the United States government, which in 1863 refused
all further exchange of prisoners. This was a part of General
Grant's policy of attrition. When forced to declare the real reason
of it he said: “It is hard on our men held in Southern prisons not
to exchange them; but it is humanity to those left in the ranks to
fight our battles. If we commence a system of exchange we will
have to fight on until the whole South is exterminated. If we hold
those caught they amount to no more than dead men.”</p>
          <p>In the last week of February, 1865, I was included in a list of
five hundred convalescents too feeble to fight to be sent to
Richmond for exchange. While in active service in the field I had
never missed a single day from duty. The pneumonia contracted
in the cold, damp cell in the Nashville penitentiary was followed
by measles, and then by a dysentery which left me in a very low
condition. The good doctor took pity on me and kept me on light
hospital duty, and not only had me placed on the list for
exchange, but, to my great gratification, included the name of an
able-bodied friend who had shown me great kindness during my
long illness and who was detailed as an orderly to look after the
wants of the invalid prisoners in transit.</p>
          <p>There have been few happier moments in my life than when
we marched out of the prison-yard, the outside of which I had
not seen for sixteen months. At the station in Indianapolis we
were placed in (freight) box-cars, the floors of which were
covered with straw, and started for Baltimore. The weather was
cold, the rivers we crossed
<pb id="wyeth302" n="302"/>
were frozen over, and the country covered with snow. The only
fire on our train was in the locomotive, but the deep bed of straw
kept us fairly warm. Two armed guards sat one at each of the
side-doors, which were kept partly open for ventilation. Through
these limited apertures, as we passed the various stations, I
noticed with no little astonishment the crowd of able-bodied men
in citizen dress. It was plain that the North had enough at home
for another army when it might be needed. About midnight, as we
were nearing Cumberland, Maryland, rounding a short curve, our
engine collided with that of another train. I was sound asleep and
did not hear the crash, but felt myself sliding along the floor with
a pile of men in the loose straw in which we were lying side by
side as thick as we could be placed. No one in our car was
seriously hurt. After daylight one dead man was removed. He
was the frost-bitten prisoner already mentioned, and I think his
death was due to exhaustion as much as to accident. We were
on the edge of a high bank or bluff, and just below on one side
was the Potomac River solidly frozen over.</p>
          <p>From the station in Baltimore we were marched to the wharf
and placed in the hold of a large transport. As we came to one
of the crossings where a number of persons were halted to let us
file by I noticed standing at the curb,
within a few feet of where I was walking in the street, a woman
whose dress of mourning struck me as being in harmony
with the sad yet beautiful expression of her face. It was
the first womanly face I had seen in many and many a day, and
as I passed gazing into her eyes, in a voice so full of tenderness
and sympathy that it brought the tears to my own she said, “God
bless you, my child.” With a mother's intuition she had read my
thoughts, and as I
<pb id="wyeth303" n="303"/>
trudged on with that throng of prisoners, thinking of my own
mother, whom I hoped soon to see, I could not rid myself of the
sad thought that I had passed in the shadow of a mother's grief
for her boy who would not come again. Were I an artist, how I
would love to paint that portrait!</p>
          <p>And what strange things come about! Forty-five years
later the University of Maryland did me the very great
honor of conferring on me the degree of LL.D., and I went
to Baltimore to attend the graduating exercises. My train
was twenty minutes late, and when I met the provost at
the Opera House he greeted me with: “Dr. Wyeth, we were
afraid something had happened. The audience is waiting a
little impatiently for your address.” As this was the first
intimation I had received that I was expected to say a word,
the shock I experienced may be imagined. When we came
on the stage, and I faced that array of thousands—for the
vast amphitheater, aisles, and foyer were packed with loyal
Marylanders—I was racking my brain for something that
might appeal to their sympathy. In that critical moment
there flashed into my mind the memory of the voice and the
sad face that greeted me long ago, and when the great welcome
those dear people gave me was hushed I tried to tell
them how much I appreciated it, and then with all the pathos
with which I was able to invest it I told the simple story
that was enacted in that far-away February morning in 1865.
It touched every heart, and I knew I was at home.</p>
          <p>At Fortress Monroe, in sight of the spars of the <hi rend="italics">Cumberland</hi>,
which still projected above the water where the <hi rend="italics">Merrimac</hi> had
sent her hull to the bottom, we were transferred to a side-wheeler
and landed at Aikens Landing on the James River, some
twelve or fifteen miles by land from Richmond. When we came
in sight of our fortifications
<pb id="wyeth304" n="304"/>
and were turned over to the Confederate agent, those who had
life enough to run broke for the works, but were stopped and led
single file along a zigzag path to avoid the line of torpedoes.
Several miles from the city we received a generous ration of
corn-pone. At dark, worn out by the long walk of ten hours, we
straggled into the capital of the Confederacy. The signs of
dissolution were in the air. My companion and I wandered into a
hospital and were allowed to spread our blankets on the floor
between two of a long row of cots in one of the wards. At daylight
we took up our beds and walked. In a small shop I saw a single cold
baked sweet-potato, and, as two years had elapsed since I had
tasted so great a luxury, I gave five dollars for it, and the same for
half a pound of butter. There was no use for anything smaller than
five dollars; and, as my jacket was padded with Confederate money I
had bought with “chaws” of tobacco in prison, I had only to make
a hole in the lining to draw on the bank.</p>
          <p>In the shadow of the Washington statue in the Capitol grounds,
my friend and I ate a rare breakfast of corn-bread and sweet-potato
and butter. Our paroles carried with them a sick-leave of
thirty days, and at dark on March 1, 1865, we climbed to the top
of a dilapidated box-car, which, like four others, inside and out
was packed and jammed with invalid, semi-invalid, and wounded
soldiers sighing for their homes. As long as we could sit on the
runway plank in the middle of the car-roof we felt fairly safe; but,
as the two brakemen were giving a continuous performance of
running back and forth to put on or loosen the brakes, we spent
most of the night holding on to this plank to keep from spilling off
as we rocked and bumped along at a six-miles-an-hour rate. It took
us eighteen hours to reach Danville, a run of about
<pb id="wyeth305" n="305"/>
one hundred and ten miles. During most of the night a
cold, drizzly rainfall made it unnecessary to be on the lookout for
the shower of sparks which the wheezing, dilapidated old 
wood-burning locomotive was ejecting and which fell on us as
scorching cinders.</p>
          <p>At Danville we sat down to a table and ate a real dinner for
the first time in nearly two years. The bill was thirty dollars for
two; but, as we had hot corn-bread and sorghum molasses for
dessert, we were content.</p>
          <p>Our next transfer point was Salisbury, North Carolina, and here
I made a lucky strike. Among the books I had read and laughed
over in our home library was one entitled <hi rend="italics">Major Jones's
Courtship</hi>. It so happened that the author of this book was
commissary and general factotum of transportation here, and
when I told him how much his work was prized at home, and in a
general and quite fair way for an acquaintance just forming
showed familiarity with it by appropriate quotations, my friend
and I were forwarded without unnecessary delay, plus two days'
rations.</p>
          <p>The railroad gave out near the South Carolina line—and nearly
everything else except the kindness of heart and the courage of
the women and the few cripples and old men who lived in the
swath of desolation cut by General Sherman, who said war was
hell and realized his definition. My friend and I trudged along on
foot day after day, making anywhere from ten to twenty miles a
day, eating what those noble people gave us, and sleeping on their
porches or in the empty corn-cribs or stables. We were too fresh
from Camp Morton to venture into the beds of civilization. The
chief article of diet all along this route was “lye-hominy,” and with
it we fared very well. The weather was getting warmer, and after
a number of days we reached Washington,
<pb id="wyeth306" n="306"/>
in Wilkes County, and again found railroad transportation.</p>
          <p>The latest news I had from my parents was that our home had
been burned, and that they and my two sisters had
found refuge in Lee County, Georgia, near Wooten Station,
on the Macon&amp; Southwestern Railroad. At Macon we
slept, or tried to sleep, on shuck pallets arranged in the basement
of the town-hall for transient Confederate soldiers. There were
more reasons than one for sitting up—swarms of them—
and one excellent reason for sitting still, since the place was
so dark that he who ventured forth never knew over whom he would
fall at the next step. Somewhere in the long period of darkness there
occurred a ludicrous incident which caused a great deal of
merriment to forty-eight of the fifty unfortunate mortals who were
wishing it were day. One veteran, who had scratched himself into a
frenzy, couldn't hold in any longer, and, being convinced at two o'clock
in the morning that the President of the Southern Confederacy was
responsible for all our woes, growled out savagely, “G-- d-- Jeff
Davis, anyhow!” While I did not approve of the language or
condone the sentiment, far from getting angry over the explosion
of disloyalty, I thought it something to laugh at. There was
present, however, down toward the far end of the room, a man
who took a different view, for he shouted, “I can whip any d--
traitor who curses President Davis!” Although neither could see
the other, each started in the general direction of his unknown
antagonist, and, of course, fell over the man and the pallet next to
him. In the general confusion which ensued forty-eight of us, who
were grateful for anything that promised merriment, voted the
fight a draw and laughed the other two into good-humor. At the
peep of day my bunk-mate
<pb id="wyeth307" n="307"/>
and I sought the station and boarded the first train for
Wooten Station, where we arrived in the afternoon.</p>
          <p>We drove the three miles to the plantation, and surprised my
mother and the home folks, who had not heard from me for a
long time. It was to me the one never-to-be-forgotten
home-coming.</p>
          <p>Without consultation with the new arrivals a wash-tub of hot
water, soap, towels, and two complete changes of clothing were
provided in one of the outhouses from which we emerged
wearing misfit suits belonging to my father and my sister's
husband. While this remote corner of Georgia had been drawn on
heavily for supplies, it was so far removed from the scene of
hostilities that there remained a plentiful supply of all the
necessaries of life, and these my companion and I enjoyed to the
fullest.</p>
          <p>By the time my furlough expired the war was practically over,
although we had not yet heard of Lee's surrender nor of Lincoln's
assassination. Deeming it my duty to report to my regiment,
supposed to be in front of Wilson in middle Alabama, I started
thither, reaching Macon, Georgia, on the 20th, just as Wilson's
riders came into the outskirts of the city. Seeing a company of
Georgia State troops in line near the railroad-station, I joined
them. We were told to march into the breastworks. We had not
proceeded far when we were halted by an officer, who said he
had orders from General Howell Cobb to surrender Macon and
its garrison to the Federal commander. I remarked to the militia
officer in charge of the company to which I had attached myself
that I did not consider that General Cobb had any authority over
me, as I belonged to General Forrest's corps, adding that I had
just come out of a Northern Prison and would rather die than go
back, and intended to
<pb id="wyeth308" n="308"/>
try to escape. He was a plucky young man, and he said at once,
“If it's as bad as that I'll go with you.” The Union cavalry by this
time were galloping toward us, and stray shots were heard as he
and I ran across the street in front of the Brown House, then the
leading hotel in Macon, and dodged into the Southwestern
Railroad station. Through this we hastened at our best speed and
ran out along the track across the open stretch to the palmetto
thickets in the Ocmulgee bottoms. We were not the only
fugitives, and as we sped across the open space for four or five
hundred yards there was a scattering fusillade. I did not hear any
bullets whizzing our way, and doubt very much whether any of
the shots were aimed at us.</p>
          <p>It was now getting quite dark, and we continued along the edge
of the brake, bearing south. About ten o'clock we approached a
camp-fire, and, crawling toward it, came near enough to
recognize Federals around it. Passing around them, we came to
the track of the Southwestern Railroad and continued down that
to a point twelve miles beyond Macon, where we slept the rest of
the night. At daylight we continued to follow the track, and about
noon my comrade and I saw a man walking toward us. As he
came near I noticed he was young, not more than twenty-five, and
dressed in citizen's clothes. His face, neck, and hands were
tanned very brown, and when I greeted him and he replied I
detected at once his Northern accent and suspected he was an
escaping prisoner from Andersonville, which camp was located
on this road a few miles farther south. I warned him he was our
prisoner, and he broke down, crying, “For God's sake, don't take
me back to that place!” The young officer and I were deeply
touched by his plea, and we felt that we would not be doing an
act of
<pb id="wyeth309" n="309"/>
disloyalty by paroling this young fellow and letting him go on to
his comrades in Macon, which place we told him he could reach
by dark if he kept up a stiff pace. We took him to a house, wrote
out a parole, which he swore to and signed, and we copied. I
gave him twenty dollars in Confederate money and a small piece
of corn-bread. I wrote out and gave him the name and address of
a relation in Illinois, to whom I requested him to write when he
arrived at his home in Connecticut. He was the most grateful
human being, I think, I ever saw. At Fort Valley we caught a
train which had ventured that far toward Macon, and our walking
ended. I reached the plantation next day. The war was over, and
my career as a solider had ended.</p>

            <head>JOHN JONES</head>
            <p>An experience of my prison life proved to me the truth of
the maxim that “misery makes strange bedfellows.” The misery
of Camp Morton brought me in contact with a man for whom I
formed a deep and lasting friendship, and yet one whose identity
was never revealed. I have no doubt that my small stature,
boyish appearance, and generally pitiable condition appealed to
his sympathy. I had been seriously ill with pneumonia,
complicated with an attack of measles, and was just
convalescent enough to be discharged from the hospital and sent
back to one of the cold, uncomfortable, and desolate cattle-sheds
in which we were partially sheltered, and which only by military
courtesy were called barracks. I was the “small boy” of the
prison yard, as I had been of the regiment, and I remember how
long it seemed to me before I “grew up.” On one occasion a
good-hearted lady in a surprised way asked me if I was a soldier,
<pb id="wyeth310" n="310"/>
and when I told her I was she said, “Well, you ought to be at
home with your mother.”</p>
            <p>I was alone, walking up and down the inclosure not only for
exercise but to keep warm, when a fellow-prisoner whom I had
never before observed fell in by my side, and, with the very
truthful remark, “You look hungry,” handed me two warm
biscuits which he took out of his coat pocket. As I hadn't seen a
biscuit in a very long while, my expression must have told him that
I was not only gratified but surprised; and when I asked him
where he got them he said, “I'm head cook in the hospital
kitchen.” My new acquaintance was fully ten years my senior, of
ordinary height, well built, and of erect, military carriage. Despite
our miserable and unclean surroundings he was noticeably neat in
appearance. Handsome of face, he possessed that to me always
attractive and comparatively rare combination dark-blue eyes and
a fair complexion with very black hair, eyebrows, and mustache.
There was that indefinable something about his expression
which told one that despite the quiet dignity which was in
evidence as he spoke it would be best not to tread on his toes
unless by accident. He told me his name was John Jones and that
his home was in northern Arkansas. He was too resourceful to
spend a cold and hungry winter in an overcrowded prison-shed
and had found a soft berth in the hospital kitchen, which he
retained as long as he stayed in Camp Morton.</p>
            <p>Had I been a younger brother he could not have shown a
greater solicitude or have watched over me with more tender
care. In the hours which did not demand his presence at his
duties we would walk together, or when I was laid up, which was
much of the time, he would sit with me and wait on me,
seemingly without a thought for himself. When,
<pb id="wyeth311" n="311"/>
in February, 1865, five hundred “hopeless invalids” were called
off for parole to be sent South, and I was of the number, he and I
asked that he be included as a hospital nurse to wait on the more
helpless invalids; and we came away together. From Richmond
he accompanied me to the refugee home of my parents in
southwest Georgia. Much of this wearisome journey was made
on foot, and the spring rains made the walking bad and the
streams deep, and through these my devoted comrade waded
with me astride his back, as if I were a child to be kept from a
wetting. The joy of our arrival in the home of cleanliness and
peace and plenty is mentioned elsewhere. After resting and
recuperating some two or three weeks, he told me he intended to
make his way across the Mississippi to visit his home, from
which he had not heard for several years.</p>
            <p>As we were parting he said: “When the time comes, if I reach
home safely, I will write you my real name and tell you why I
have been under an assumed name for the last three years. I can
tell you this much, that you may know there was nothing of
dishonor in what I did. Soon after the Union army occupied our
section of northern Arkansas one of their officers was guilty of a
gross insult to one of my sisters, and I shot him dead. I was
outlawed, of course, and escaped to the South and volunteered
under the name by which you knew me in prison.”</p>
            <p>From some point in Mississippi he wrote that he was having
great difficulty in getting across the river, which had overflowed
the lowlands and was twelve miles wide. He declared that he
would try to make his way across, and that he was just starting
to make the attempt alone in a small canoe. That was the last
from my faithful comrade and friend. To pick one's way
through a maze of tree-tops and
<pb id="wyeth312" n="312"/>
driftwood, through ten miles of dead water without a channel or
landmark to steer by, was a hopeless task; and I have never
doubted, since after the reconstruction period he failed to write or
visit me, that he perished in the daring venture.</p>

AFTER THE WAR</head>
          <p>WHEN the prison tunnel in which I was interested was near
completion, on the day before the attempt to escape was to be
made I removed the heel of one boot, and with my knife made a
cavity in the thick leather large enough to hold a ten and a five
dollar greenback bill, which my aunt who came to visit me while
I was in the hospital with pneumonia had given me. The bills
were folded or crumpled into the smallest possible bulk, which
for better protection was enveloped in a bit of letter-paper, and
the heel nailed again in place. When the attempt failed I had no
need of the money, and I allowed it to remain undisturbed until I
reached home some four months later. When the war ended a
month thereafter this was the sum total of current funds in our
immediate family.</p>
          <p>All the railroads in the South which could be operated were
taken over and run by the United States government, which gave
our family transportation to Decatur, Alabama, by train and
thence up the Tennessee by steamboat to where Guntersville
had been. With the exception of half a dozen dwellings, which
were spared because they sheltered the sick or wounded too
feeble to be removed, the village had disappeared. Nothing but
tumble-down walls and a mass of brick debris was left of our
home. The nearest shelter which could be obtained was in a log
house on Sand
<pb id="wyeth314" n="314"/>
Mountain, five miles from town, and in this my parents found a
temporary abode. We were not wholly unprepared for the scene
of desolation about us. As we came west on the train nothing but
lonesome-looking chimneys remained
of the villages and farm-houses. They were suggestive of
tombstones in a graveyard. Bridgeport, Stevenson, Bellefonte,
Scotsboro, Larkinsville, Woodville, Paint Rock—in fact, every town
in northern Alabama to and including Decatur (except Huntsville,
which, being used as headquarters, had been spared)—had been wiped
out by the war policy of starvation by fire. Farm-houses, gins,
fences, and cattle were gone. From a hilltop in the farming
district a few miles from New Market I counted the chimneys of
the houses of six different plantations which had been destroyed.
About the fireplaces of some of these, small huts of poles had
been erected for temporary shelter.</p>
          <p>Northern Alabama had paid dearly for the devotion of her
people to the cause of the South. Nowhere in the Confederacy
had such ruin been wrought, save in the path of desolation along
which the march to the sea was made, or perhaps in the valley
of Virginia, in obedience to the order to leave it so desolate that
“a crow flying over would have to carry its rations.” Our county of
Marshall had suffered in a double sense, being overrun for the last
year and a half of the war by bands of marauders who robbed the
defenseless people of the little the two armies had left. The story
of their forays would make a bloody record. The narration
of one tragedy which was enacted on a small island in the
Tennessee River may give an idea of the awful conditions which
prevailed. Buck Island was then almost wholly covered with
dense cane. Hither five men, non-combatants, had fled for a
hiding-place, and had taken with them the
<pb id="wyeth315" n="315"/>
few cattle which had escaped impressment. In the depths of the
cane-brake they had constructed a pole cabin for shelter. A
Confederate soldier named C. L. Hardcastle, 
<ref targOrder="U" id="ref52" n="52" rend="sc" target="note52">1</ref> wounded and on
furlough, a relation or friend and neighbor, slipping in to visit his
family, came to stay all night with the refugees. Toward morning
they were aroused from sleep to find their cabin surrounded and
themselves in the hands of the notorious Ben Harris and his band,
who had learned of their retreat and had come for their cattle.
Being a far-sighted man and well known to the Rodens and their
guest, Harris gave them five minutes for prayer, after which he
made them stand in a row along the riverbank, and, to make sure
of a clean job, with his six-shooter he put a bullet through the
hearts of five of the six and thought he had done the same with
the sixth man. This man was Hardcastle, who told me that as
Harris came down the line, placing the muzzle close to the left
side of the chest of each victim as he fired, he made up his mind
to drop quickly a little before he was shot, which he did, and the
ball missed a vital spot. Feigning death, he was dragged with the
other five bodies and thrown into the river, the current of which
washed them down-stream as they were sinking. Holding his
breath, he floated under some driftwood lodged against a fallen
tree and concealed himself behind a log. The bullet had struck a
rib and taken a superficial course. When the murderers walked
off to round up the cattle he crawled out and into the cane, and in
this way made this marvelous escape from death. I knew the
men who were killed.</p>
          <p>The war experiences of the home people were, however,
<note id="note52" n="52" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref52">1 
This man, a respected citizen, still survives (1914), at Margerum, 
in Jackson
County, Alabama. The details of this gruesome tragedy I had from him.</note>
<pb id="wyeth316" n="316"/>
not wholly tragic. There were occasional glimpses of the serio-comic
in which the comical features predominated. Our natures
are such that we love to turn away from sad things and forget
them by laughing when we may. One of these experiences was
Uncle Dan's retreat from Guntersville when the Union batteries
first shelled this unfortunate village. Another, as the sheriff related
it, was his narrow escape from the Fourth Ohio Cavalry when in
1862 it dashed into the town early one morning, to the surprise of
everybody; but I have yet to tell how two young lads belonging to
the same company surprised and captured themselves in the
streets of their native village in 1864.</p>
          <p>The two actors were playmates of mine who were old enough
to see service as “Home Guards” the last year or
two of the war. They told it on themselves to me, and it was
witnessed by several residents. During all of 1864 and the spring
of 1865 Marshall County was the scene of active hostilities, not
only between scouting parties of regular soldiers of the Union and
Confederate armies, but between bands of Tory marauders, who
paraded in Federal uniforms, and small squads of Confederate
Home Guards under partisan leaders. Some few of the Tories
had been Union men all along, but were wise enough to keep
discreetly quiet until the Federals occupied the country. Most of
them were poor whites who had dodged conscription by hiding
out in the mountains near their cabins when the Confederates
were in control, and came into view as soon as the Federals
appeared. Some few were deserters from our army, but all were
united now in their love of country by the cohesive strength of a
desire to plunder the helpless. As these men of the two sides had
known one another before the war, it may be imagined that what
is described as “feeling” ran
<pb id="wyeth317" n="317"/>
about as “high” between them as it could run. Toward the last it
was considered a waste of time to surrender, even if cornered
without hope of escape. The recognized practice was to sell out
as dearly as possible and keep shooting as long as a trigger could
be pulled.</p>
          <p>Ben Harris had led off in a practice of extermination which put
Cromwell to the blush. The conqueror of Ireland knocked only
every tenth prisoner on the head, but Captain Ben overlooked
none, and just to be sure that no detail was omitted he was his
own executioner. I have told of the six he stood up in a row and
shot on Buck Island, and there were others. When the Home
Guards caught up with the Tories, their former neighbors, and
any survived the immediate collision by throwing up their hands,
they were carried by what was known as “the Short Road to
Gadsden.” One hour was considered time enough for the guards
to make the seventy-two-mile trip to this particular Gadsden and
return.</p>
          <p>On the day in question Bent Adams, from a commanding
eminence, scanned the valley and saw hanging on the clothes-line
in his mother's yard something white, which signal meant “the
town is clear.” Had it been red or blue, Bent would have rested
content upon the distant heights. As it was, he rode into the
village, and, sitting on his horse (for in those perilous days nobody
dismounted in town), was conversing with his mother at the gate.
Tom Anderson, a member of Bent's squad, had from another hill
also read the signals, and he cautiously rode into the suburbs.
Having been successful as scouts, these two enterprising youths
had acquired and, as it was a frosty morning, were wearing each
a warm, very blue Yankee overcoat. As Tom's horse turned the
corner of Main Street, some three
<pb id="wyeth318" n="318"/>
hundred yards off, and he saw a lone Yankee or Tory—he wasn't
sure which—in the road ahead of him his first impulse was to turn
and run; but Bent was too quick for him and ran first. Neither of
these two men was a coward, but the circumstances fully justified
what Sheriff James Swiverly called “quick action” and the
practice of that discretion which ancient Falstaff declared to be
“the better part of valor.” Bent didn't know how many more
Yankees were coming round the corner following their leader,
and felt sure it was better to gain the other side of the Long
Bridge, a mile away, and find out there than to take the foolish risk
of allowing a whole squad to get right on him at full speed before
he started. Therefore he wheeled and ran as fast as his steed
could go.</p>
          <p>Seeing only one Yankee or Tory, and that one running away,
Tom changed his mind and tactics simultaneously, and, whipping
out his six-shooter, he stuck the spurs to his charger and began
pursuit. For half a mile down Main Street the two horsemen sped,
the women and children leaning out of the windows, not certain
whether it was a fight or a horse-race. Tom's mount was so
much superior to Bent's that by the time the latter was checking
up to make a safe turn around the corner at Cornwell's store to
get into the straight reach of roadway leading to the bridge the
pursuer was near enough to begin to empty his army pistol at the
fugitive, who, to avoid being hit, was now lying as flat on his
horse's neck as his anatomy could be applied. Having made the
turn with safety, Bent ventured to glance back, and, seeing only a
single pursuer who had already expended four of his six shots
without effect while his own battery was as yet intact, took his
pistol out of the holster and eased up on his speed, determined to
settle accounts at
<pb id="wyeth319" n="319"/>
close quarters. A few moments later, pulling the reins and
wheeling suddenly about, he was in the act of firing into Tom's
chest at close range when Thomas, recognizing his chum, yelled
out as loud and distinctly as he could shape the sentence, “Don't
shoot, Bent; it's me!” and Bent, not yet lowering his weapon,
replied: “Tom, you d-- fool! I've a great notion to blow your brains
out, anyhow.”</p>
          <p>A distressing feature of the situation in our section was that the
returning soldiers reached home too late to plant a crop; and, as
the fields were uncultivated in 1864, the country was destitute of
the simplest necessities of life. My father had built a small room
or shed, taking advantage of the fireplace and chimney of his
former office, and began to re-establish his law practice, coming
to town three days of each week. As the courts had not been
reopened, he had little or no law business, but he had many calls
for help to which he was sorrowfully unable to respond. In the
adjoining counties of Blount and De Kalb the same distressing
conditions prevailed, and finally he was told that one or two
persons had died of starvation. Within six hours he was on the
way north to procure supplies. At Nashville, Louisville, Cincinnati,
and elsewhere he told of the distress and suffering of our section,
and the generous people of those cities came nobly to the rescue.
Train-loads of commissary supplies and clothing were forwarded
by the Louisville&amp; Nashville Railroad without charge for
transportation. He established relief stations in each of the three
counties of Marshall, Blount, and De Kalb, and there was no
more starvation. The crops of 1866 came to the rescue, and the
days of hunger and extreme poverty in the Valley of the
Tennessee were of the past.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, I had found employment as superintendent
<pb id="wyeth320" n="320"/>
of a large cotton plantation in Franklin County, where at a salary
of fifty dollars a month I remained for eighteen months, living
happily as a member of a refined family and the trusted agent of a
generous and appreciative employer. I had hoped the active,
out-of-door life of a planter might enable me to rally from the effects
of the long illness in prison; but a cough, which followed
the complication of pneumonia with measles, still held on. Reluctantly
I resigned my position and sought a healthier environment in my
father's new home on the dry, elevated plateau of Sand Mountain, a
spur of the Appalachian Range. With a splendid saddle-horse and a
waterproof outfit that defied the most inclement weather I lived
out of doors for a year in the rare atmosphere of this salubrious
region, buying and selling cattle and produce. In 1867 I began
the study of medicine, matriculating in the Medical Department of
the University of Louisville for the session ending March, 1868,
and for the same period the following session, graduating
in 1869.</p>
          <p>In the four years which had elapsed since the soldiers of the
Confederacy had returned to their homes, laboring for
the support of their families and the rehabilitation of their
country, there was being attempted by the leaders of the radical
wing of the Republican party then in power the perpetration of
the most monstrous political crime in the records of history. The
infamy which is associated with
the partition of Poland sinks into insignificance when compared to
that which justly attaches to the effort to hold in subjection to an
alien negro race, but a few months before in bondage, the white
people of the South, the former owners of these freedmen.</p>
          <p>Keeping alive the bitterness which a long and bloody
<pb id="wyeth321" n="321"/>
civil war had engendered, under the adroit leadership of
Thaddeus Stevens, Ben Wade, and James G. Blaine, this
immortal triumvirate of “Wavers of the Bloody Shirt” so played
upon the fears and prejudices of the electorate of the North as to
maintain themselves in power for years and to secure in the
national Congress legislation favorable to their schemes.</p>
          <p>To the freed slaves the franchise was given without
restrictions. The only qualification was color and a certificate of
slavery. The best white people of the South were not allowed to
vote. My father was disfranchised, while Peyton, one of our
former slaves, who still lived with us, performing the same
service he had done before he was freed, announced himself as
a candidate for the legislature! A company of negro troops
garrisoned my native town where my parents and sisters were
living, and another was stationed in Tuscumbia, the county-seat
of Franklin, where I was working.</p>
          <p>Backed by these soldiers—for the Southern states were
partitioned off in military districts—elections were held, and the
state and county governments were handed over to a horde of
adventurers, the “carpet-baggers,” who, hailing from all quarters
of the earth where many of them had neither local habitation nor
name, swarmed into the country; to the “scalawags,” the
unrecognized and unprincipled “down and out” white natives; and
last, but not least, to the negroes, their easily handled tools,
stunned almost to irresponsibility by the suddenness of their
advancement and pitifully drunk with power. Small wonder that
for a while this combination ran riot with the South. The situation
was fitly described by the negro who said, “De bottom rail's on
top now.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref53" n="53" rend="sc" target="note53">1</ref></p>
          <note id="note53" n="53" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref53">1 It is 
gratifying to record that among the number who had seen actual service in
the Union army, and who in the spirit of adventure came into the South 
at this period, seeking political preferment, were a few who 
soon realized the injustice 
and impracticability of “Reconstruction” as formulated by 
the heartless conspiracy at Washington.  Abandoning the politics which 
favored negro supremacy, they identified themselves with the material 
development of the South. Captain Elliott, who came to my native village 
in command of the negro garrison, made his home there and died after many 
years, loved and respected by all. Lieutenant-Colonel H. C. Warmoth, of 
General McClernand's staff, who became Governor of Louisiana, is now one 
of the largest planters in that state and closely identified with its 
development.</note>
          <pb id="wyeth322" n="322"/>
          <p>At first the ex-Confederates were submissive and silent. They
looked on at the strange happenings with sadness and amazement,
and later with indignation, as they realized that the safety of their
wives and children was endangered. The awakening came when
the carpet-baggers and scalawags undertook to effect the
military organization of the freedmen in the various counties and
states. It was then that there sprang into existence, almost in a
single night, throughout the southern country that weird invisible
army whose weapon was Terror. The Ku-Klux Klan in its origin
was composed of the best citizens of the South, principally young
men, many of whom had grown up while the war was going on,
but led by the veteran soldiers of the Confederacy.</p>
          <p>The history of my own county will suffice to illustrate the
method of the Klan. The negroes were meeting at night in the
suburbs of Guntersville, where they were harangued and drilled
by a carpet-bagger who had had himself elected to some
profitable office. Within a fortnight an ex-lieutenant of my
company and an ex-captain of the Army of Northern Virginia,
without reproach both as soldiers and citizens, disguised with
masks and gowns, late at night, at the muzzle of a pistol arrested
this man, conducted him into the woods a mile from the village,
stripped him to the waist, and thrashed him with hickory switches
until he
<pb id="wyeth323" n="323"/>
begged for mercy. They then told him that if he was in the
county at sunset of the next day he would never get beyond its
limits alive. They didn't have to kill him, but they would have done
it had he not left, never to be heard of again. The leading negroes
were called to the doors of their cabins at dead of night by
mounted and masked men who in sepulchral tones told them that
the ghosts of the dead from the battle-fields were wandering
back to warn them to beware of strangers and stay at home on
election days. In extreme cases, in which danger of recognition
involved arrest and punishment (for Congress was quick to enact
rigid laws against the Klan), notice was sent to the Klan of an
adjoining county, and these rode over at night to carry out the
wishes of their brothers, who could establish thus readily the
essential alibi. Terrifying the negro until he withdrew from politics
was not the work of a month or of a year, but it went on with
grim determination and ultimate success. With the progress of
the movement the white interlopers read the writing on the wall,
fled the country, and the native whites of the South came again
into their own.</p>
          <p>This organization originated in 1866 in or near Pulaski, in Giles
County, Tennessee. Thence it spread, swift as a prairie-fire, over
the entire South. The head man, whose power was absolute and
whose orders had to be obeyed without regard to consequences,
was known as the Grand Wizard of the Invisible Empire.
Immediately under him were his ten Genii. There was a Grand
Dragon of the Realm and his eight Hydras, and other
mysterious subdivisions of authority. They had printed and
scattered over the country at night placards setting forth the
object of the Klan: “To protect the weak, the innocent, and the
<pb id="wyeth324" n="324"/>
defenseless from the indignities, wrongs, and outrages of the
lawless, the violent, and the brutal; to aid the oppressed, to relieve
suffering, and especially to help the widows and orphans of
Confederate soldiers.”</p>
          <p>A writer in the <hi rend="italics">American Encyclopedia</hi> said: 
“Its decrees
were far more potent and its power more dreaded than that of
the visible commonwealth, which it either dominated or
terrorized.” It is estimated that its membership numbered at one
period half a million. By 1869 its mission of scaring the negro
away from the influence of and political association
with the adventurers and carpet-baggers was accomplished,
and it was then disbanded and dispersed as quietly and
as mysteriously as it had come.</p>
          <p>Nothing could better illustrate the malice and brutality which
had free license in this unhappy period than the riveting of irons
upon the ankles of Jefferson Davis, ex-President of the
Confederate States. A man of noble character, his whole life as
soldier and statesmen above reproach, of delicate physique and
in ill health, securely locked in a double casemate in Fortress
Monroe, and so strongly guarded that escape (had he
contemplated it) was hopeless, was thrown to the floor and held
forcibly by soldiers under the orders of Charles A. Dana and
Nelson A. Miles, while iron anklets chained together were
riveted by blacksmiths on his legs. Read Mr. Dana's description
of the prison written to Secretary Stanton:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <text>
              <body>
                <div1 type="letter">
                  <p>The arrangements for the security of the prisoners seem to me as complete
as could be desired. Each one occupies the inner room of a casemate; the
window is heavily barred. A sentry stands within before each of the doors
leading into the outer room. Two other sentries stand outside of these doors.
An officer is also constantly on duty in the outer room, whose duty is to see
the prisoners every fifteen minutes. The outer door of all is locked on the
outside, and the key is kept exclusively
<pb id="wyeth325" n="325"/>
by the general officer of the guard. Two sentries are also stationed without
that door, and a strong line of sentries cuts off all access to the vicinity of the
casemates. Another line is stationed on the parapet overhead, and a third line is
posted across the moat on the counterscarps opposite the place of
confinement. The casemates on each side and between those occupied by the
prisoners (Jefferson Davis and Clement C. Clay) are used as guard-rooms, and
soldiers are always there. A lamp is constantly kept burning in each of the
rooms. . . . Before leaving Fortress Monroe on May 22d I made out for General
Miles the order. . . . “Brevet Major-General Miles is hereby authorized and
directed to place manacles and fetters upon the hands and feet of Jefferson
Davis and Clement C. Clay, Jr., whenever he may think it advisable in order to
render their imprisonment more secure. By order of the Secretary of War.</p>

                  <trailer>This order was General Miles's authority for placing fetters on Davis a day
or two later, when he found it necessary to change the inner doors of the
casemate, which were light wooden ones without locks. While these doors
were being changed for grated ones anklets were placed on Davis. They did not
prevent his walking, but did prevent any attempt to jump past the guard, and
they also prevented him from running. As soon as the doors were changed (it
required three days, I think) the anklets were removed.</trailer>

          <p>This equivocation does little credit to the head or heart of the
scholarly Assistant Secretary of War. His description above
given shows that changing a wooden door for a grated door was
no excuse for this brutal act. There were still two grated doors
heavily barred between the prisoner and the prison-yard; then
three lines of sentinels, and, above all, the inside of a great
fortress surrounded by a wide, deep moat, and soldiers and
guards everywhere.</p>
          <p>Nor were the irons removed because the new grated doors
were in place. They were removed on the protest of Dr.
Craven, the United States Army Surgeon called to attend the
sick prisoner. “You believe it, then, a medical necessity?” asked
General Miles. “I do, most earnestly,” replied the doctor; and
the manacles were then removed.</p>

position of the one and the record of gallantry as a soldier of

A MEDICAL STUDENT IN 1867—THREE YEARS IN
ARKANSAS—STEAMBOATING AND CONTRACTING</head>
          <p>THE medical department of the university I attended was in
1867 one of the oldest and deservedly best known of the medical
colleges in the United States. The course of study and the
standard of requirements then prevailing at this school may be
taken as typical of medical education in the United States at that
period. There was no preliminary or entrance examination. Any
white male who could read and write and who had mastered the
rudiments of English was eligible. Neither Latin nor Greek was
essential.</p>
          <p>The requirements for graduation were a satisfactory
examination at the end of two college terms of seven months
each. The division of subjects was: anatomy, physiology, surgery,
medicine, obstetrics, chemistry, and materia medica. Anatomy
was thoroughly taught, and the didactic course was
supplemented by dissecting-room work of a high class. While
material was not over-abundant, there not then being the same
liberal construction of the law relating to the disposition of the
unclaimed dead which now prevails, the activity of our
dissecting-room janitor kept us in a sufficient quantity of
cadavers. How he got them we did not know, and it probably
was just as well that no inquiry was instituted. His name was
Peter. Students inclined
<pb id="wyeth328" n="328"/>
to disrespect spoke of him as “old Pete,” but those who had been
brought up under the influence of the Westminster Confession
baptized him “St. Peter,” the rock upon which our anatomical
church was founded, and to whom it was said the keys of Cave
Hill Cemetery had been given. In physiology there were no
laboratory exercises; no practical demonstrations of the living
structures and of the functions of the normal organs.</p>
          <p>The teaching of surgery and medicine was almost wholly
didactic. When an operative clinic was given the students
witnessed it at such distance from the subject and with so many
interruptions of vision that it was impossible to follow closely the
details of technique, without which the lesson of a demonstration
is valueless. Not once in my two college years did I enter the ward
of a hospital or receive instruction by the bedside of a patient.</p>
          <p>This is not in the least a reflection upon our teachers, but upon
the system then in vogue. The greatest names in medicine in our
country had been or then were associated with this institution.
In the lectures on medicine we were told that the cause of
malarial and yellow fever was a miasm emanating from decaying
vegetable matter subjected to a temperature of from eighty to
ninety degrees Fahrenheit for about thirty days, and that those
who slept upon the ground floors of buildings suffered most,
while those who occupied the second, third, and higher floors
escaped the baneful effects in the direct ratio of their elevation.
The same comparison was used in the discourse upon yellow
fever, citing the fact that in the Louisville epidemic few, if any,
persons sleeping upon the upper floors of houses were affected.
Knowing as we do now that the mosquito is not
prone to fly high, that he infests the lower floors of houses,
<pb id="wyeth329" n="329"/>
seldom reaching the third or fourth floor, we can understand
readily the error in etiology on the part of our professor of
medicine. The teaching of obstetrics was entirely didactic. In
my two terms of study I examined only one gynecological case,
while in chemistry and materia medica the
instruction was in the lecture-room to the whole class instead of
with working sections in the laboratory, and
there was no course of study in microscopy or urinary analysis.</p>
          <p>I was graduated in the spring of 1869. I had been looking
forward to the day when I should receive my diploma
and start out on my career as a practising physician and
surgeon; but I can never forget the sinking feeling that came
over me when I unfolded this sacred document in the privacy
of my own room and realized how little I knew and how
incompetent I was to undertake the care of those in
the distress of sickness or accident. However, like Macbeth,
who was so far advanced in blood that it was as easy to go
ahead as to recede, I felt I might just as well do as my
predecessors had done and let the world take its chances.</p>
          <p>The possessor of a pair of doctor's saddle-bags, which held
two rows of medicine-bottles, diminutive apothecary scales for
weighing dosage, two forceps for extracting teeth,
and a small minor surgical operating set of instruments, and last,
but not least, a tin sign, I rented an office in my home town of
Guntersville, Alabama, and after dark one night in March, 1869,
I tacked my sign to “the outer wall.”
<ref targOrder="U" id="ref54" n="54" rend="sc" target="note54">1</ref> It
was the irony of fate that my first call was obstetrical. If there
was anything in the world I didn't want it was this kind of a
case; but I didn't have the courage to back out.
<note id="note54" n="54" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref54">1 
The rest of this quotation from “Macbeth” could not apply to my
practice. “The cry is still, They come!”</note>
<pb id="wyeth330" n="330"/>
I thanked God it was a normal labor, for I had nothing to do but
tie and cut the umbilical cord and tell the mother it was a boy. A
strapping young farmer with lobar pneumonia came next, and
he survived. For my first surgical operation I rode twenty-three
miles and back the same day. My preceptor, an ex-army
surgeon, gave the chloroform, and looked on as I dissected out
some sort of tumor from the shoulder-blade of an elderly lady,
whose resistance enabled us to register it as successful.</p>
          <p>As we were starting home the appreciative and grateful
husband told us he didn't have any money, but, pointing to his
apple orchard, then in bloom, said he had a “still,” and would
send us a barrel of apple-brandy in the fall. He kept his word,
and I realized twenty dollars for my share.</p>
          <p>Then came my Waterloo in a case of diabetes mellitus which
progressed rapidly to a fatal termination. I cannot describe my
feelings nor measure the depth of my depression and despair as
I watched this patient die. I was overwhelmed with the
conviction that I was unfit to take the grave responsibility of the
life and health and happiness of those who might be willing to
place themselves under my care. I needed a clinical and
laboratory training under teachers of experience, and I
determined to give up my practice until I could secure this
training. That night, two months after I had tacked it up, I took
my sign down and put it in my trunk, where it reposed for several
years.</p>
          <p>Three of these years were spent in Arkansas, whither I had
gone to earn the money needed to go to New York or Europe
for postgraduate study. Having learned that a railroad contractor
with whom I was acquainted was lootking for a superintendent
of one of his enterprises in Arkansas, I applied for the position,
and was employed at a salary of
<pb id="wyeth331" n="331"/>
seventy-five dollars a month, with the understanding that either of
us could cancel the engagement at the expiration of three months.
My destination was the head of navigation on Little Red River, a
tributary of White River. At Memphis I boarded a palatial side-wheel
steamboat engaged in this trade. The cuisine was
excellent, the rooms and beds were clean and comfortable.
There could not have been a more delightful mode of travel than
by the steamboats which plied the Mississippi and its tributaries at
that period.</p>
          <p>When we turned from the Mississippi into the mouth of White
River there was no sign of land. What the river-men call the
“June rise” was on. A winding sheet of water, margined by the
tree-tops of the impenetrable forests on either side, was the
channel, and up this for nearly fifty miles we steamed before the
first land was seen. Above this point the water was “in banks,”
and the crookedness of this stream was noticeable. In one of
these countless bends or loops the cutting of a canal seventy-five
feet long would shorten navigation by five miles.</p>
          <p>In carrying on our contract we had in use a stanch sternwheel
steamboat and a number of barges for towing stone from the
quarries to De Vall's Bluff, where the railroad bridge was being
built. On these frequent trips I spent practically all of my time in
the pilot-house, learning to steer the boat and making sketches of
the river in its various windings, studying the location of snags,
“sawyers,” and other hindrances to navigation, as well as noting
the course of the currents in different parts of the stream. In
three months I had learned how to handle the boat, even with the
heavy tow descending the White River, which, by reason of its
narrow and tortuous course, required more
<pb id="wyeth332" n="332"/>
than ordinary care in handling a boat with heavy barges lashed to
its side and in front, around these short bends, many of which
were complicated with the presence of snags or trunks of trees
which had fallen in from the banks and were partly submerged.
Later on my acquaintance with the river and practical knowledge
in handling a steamboat was of considerable value, as I became
the master of this boat and barges and stood my watch regularly
as a pilot, saving a monthly expenditure of one hundred and fifty
dollars, the salary then in vogue.</p>
          <p>We discovered and opened a magnificent sandstone quarry on
Upper White, in Independence County, about fifteen miles above
Jacksonport by land and twice this distance by the winding river.
This stone formation lies in strata varying from one foot to three
feet in thickness, and so true (or level) that not infrequently the
block could be squared to one of its undressed and untouched
surfaces. Much of it had, running in a general direction with the
seams, beautiful wavy tracings of red and yellow and blue, which
produced a striking effect on the finished product. One block I
quarried and transported the one hundred and
twenty miles by barge to Augusta, which was used in my jail
contract for the lintel over the main doorway of entrance, was
eighteen inches wide, two feet high, and ten feet in length. As it
was for a jail door, I was in doubt for a while whether to inscribe
on it the line from Dante, “Who enters here leaves hope behind,”
or the name of the builder and date. But <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">vanitas 
vanitatum!</foreign></hi>—when
I left Arkansas those who went to jail and could read saw over
that door in bold letters, “Wyeth—1872.”</p>
          <p>This busy life was enjoyable, and I found no little interest in the
association with my employees, who were of
<pb id="wyeth333" n="333"/>
several nationalities and at least two colors. For six days of each
week I had breakfast by lamplight in order to have every one up
and ready for work by the time it was light enough to see. We
took an hour from twelve to one for dinner and resting, and then
kept going until dark. I worked (manual labor) by the side of my
men, and learned not only to quarry and cut stone, but took a turn
nearly every day at the forge, and became sufficiently expert in
tempering the steel “chisels and points.” Barney, my good-natured
Irish blacksmith, used to give me the directions, “From a
cherry-red to a sky-blue, and then chill it,” which, being
interpreted means that the cutting-edge of the steel implement
after it is properly shaped on the anvil should be heated, not to a
white-heat, but to a bright red, like a half-ripe cherry, then held
just touching the cooling water until it assumes a sky-blue shade;
and at that moment immersed so it would hold that color. These
hardy, fine fellows never gave me any trouble or concern, excepting
when on rare occasions “inspiring bold John Barleycorn” did for them
what it did for Tam o' Shanter. I showed them every kindly
consideration, whether sick or well, but very occasionally when
alcoholism got the best of any I was compelled to be firm, or
maybe severe.</p>
          <p>One Sunday a wildly drunken stone-cutter tried to stab a
fellow-workman, who ran to me for help. His pursuer
would not listen to reason, but turned on me. As he raised his
hand to stab me I was fortunate enough to knock him senseless
with a piece of flooring-plank which lay convenient to hand.</p>
          <p>As good-luck would have it, we were isolated from drink, for it
was fifteen miles to Jacksonport, the nearest saloon town, and
during our busiest period in this quarry the river
<pb id="wyeth334" n="334"/>
was so low that the steamboats were not running. Usually
I walked to town on Saturday afternoon, much of the distance
along a trail through dense cane-brake, returning with the
weekly mail for all hands and reaching camp by dinner-time of
Sunday. The “Trail of the Lonesome Pine” was populous in
comparison with this path that I tracked so often on foot, with a
wall of cane on either side so thick one could not see a dozen
yards to right or left. There w just one lone settler's cabin on the
fifteen-mile trip.</p>
          <p>On one of these Saturday-afternoon trips to the post-office at
Jacksonport I concluded to go by the river route, the distance being
fully twice as great on account of the crooked stream. As the
water was too low for the steamboats, I started alone about noon in
a small skiff, and paddled steadily, hoping to reach town by
supper-time. Night came on, however, when I was some ten miles
from my destination, and, seeing a light on the shore, I landed, to find
myself in the camp of some loggers, and a very tough-looking lot of
fellows they were. Had I suspected who they were before I
reached the shore I would have kept well out in the stream and gone
on supperless without attracting their attention, for the men who
engaged in lumbering in those lonely outfits in the vast cypress-brakes
of the White River country right after the war belonged very
frequently to that reckless and roving class who had civil or
military histories that were better unwritten.</p>
          <p>Nothing was left, however, but to bluff it through; so
I tied my boat and walked up to the crowd near the fire, where
they were just commencing supper, greeted all hands in
hail-fellow-well-met fashion, and made myself at home.</p>
          <p>They gave me generously of the good, substantial food they
had—coffee and corn-bread and fish fried in bacon grease—
<pb id="wyeth335" n="335"/>
for, as at my camp twenty miles farther up the stream, this
beautiful Upper White River provided their main article of diet.
When I got ready to leave, the head man, who would not accept
the proffer of payment, told me that if I cared to stay all night
they could furnish me with a blanket. I thanked him, said “Good-by,”
got in my boat, and soon drifted out of sight into the black
night and the silence. With the exception of the occasional splash
of some fish leaping out of the water either in play or more
probably in the panic of trying to keep from being eaten by some
larger fellow, or the lonely screech of an owl, the deep,
impressive stillness of the river and the wilderness was
unbroken. As this section of Upper White was in my run as the
pilot of the <hi rend="italics">Converse</hi>, when the water was “in 
stage,”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref55" n="55" rend="sc" target="note55">1</ref> 
notwithstanding
the darkness, I knew it like a book. I had made drawings of
every bend and bar and snag, marked each place of danger,
even for night work, by the breaks or inequalities of the timber-lines
on either bank; for even in the darkest nights the tree-top
lines stand out a black, well-defined silhouette against the lighter
background of the sky. I felt very much at home, for this river
was to me as a friend, and the solitude was not unwelcome.
That exquisite line of Byron came to my mind then, as many a
time before and since—</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">Nor deem it solitude to be alone.</q>
          <p>I knew there were seven miles of slow water with a current of
about two miles an hour to the head of Music Shoals, three miles
above Jacksonport, and that when I reached the chutes I would
have all the excitement and exhilaration any one could wish for
in guiding my small craft over those
<note id="note55" n="55" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref55">1 Deep 
enough to carry the boat over the shoals.</note>
<pb id="wyeth336" n="336"/>
bars and swirls and falls; so I laid my oar across the skiff,
nestled down comfortably, and floated on dreamily with the
tide. Had I been sleepy I would not have yielded to the desire,
for I knew full well if I should happen to be asleep when my
skiff shot into the rapids I would get a ducking or a drowning,
either of which would be objectionable. I could keep awake, but
was unable to throw my memory cells out of commission, and,
naturally, my thoughts were of the river upon which I was
being borne and of this particular “reach.”
<ref targOrder="U" id="ref56" n="56" rend="sc" target="note56">1</ref> And then there
there flashed into my mind a ghastly picture registered
about a year previous, when, bowling along up-stream on my
swift steamboat the <hi rend="italics">Converse</hi>, as we swept round this bend I
saw from the pilothouse, perched on some object floating on
the surface, one of those huge, red-beaked, bare-necked, and
repulsive buzzards so common in this part of the South. It was
evidently carrion upon which he was feasting, and he was so
hungry and intent on gorging himself that he only flapped his
great wings and flew away when the prow of our boat was nearly
upon him. To my horror, as I leaned over the side of the pilot-house
above the hurricane-deck to see what kind of dead material it was, I
recognized the swollen body of a man.</p>
          <p>Just as this lugubrious picture was floating—as floated the dead
man—through my mind, I became conscious that another craft was
in the river; for coming behind me I distinctly heard the rhythmical
stroke of a paddle, such is used to propel the light shells or
dugouts from which the expert lumbermen in the overflow fell
with axes the giant cypress-trees, taking advantage of the high
water to
<note id="note56" n="56" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref56">1 Rivermen 
use many strange expressions. A straight piece of river is called a
“stretch.” A “reach” may be slightly curved. A 
“bend” is a bit of river
sweeping more or less abruptly around a “point” or tongue of 
land, etc., etc.</note>
<pb id="wyeth337" n="337"/>
get above the trumpet-like and faulty expansion of these queer
trees, which extends from ten to fifteen feet above the ground.
<ref targOrder="U" id="ref57" n="57" rend="sc" target="note57">1</ref> I
suppose the thought of the dead man had set me to speculating
on the possibility of danger, and now I began to wonder what any
one else but myself could be doing on this lonely stretch of river
at this hour of the night. Then, as I recognized a double stroke
with paddles and appreciated the fact that whatever it was it was
coming rapidly, I thought at once of the hard faces I had seen
around the loggers' camp-fire, and that possibly a brace of them
had judged that a man who sported a gold watch and chain was
really worth while. In any event, I made up my mind that I didn't
want company for any part of the remainder of my journey that
night, so I picked up my oar and quietly guided my boat close in
to shore, where, under the black shadow of a dense willow-tree
which leaned over the river, I was safely out of the possibility of
being seen. Without a sound save the almost noiseless stroke of
the paddles as they glided swiftly by, the invisible craft went on. I
gave them half an hour of leeway, and then drifted on with the
current. It was midnight when my skiff shot into the first or upper
rapid of Music Shoals, through which, at from six to eight miles
an hour and with equal rapidity through the other two, my light
craft glided into the still waters at the Jacksonport wharf.</p>
          <p>In these years immediately following the Civil War not only
was the river full of delicious fish—bass, buffalo-perch, blue
catfish, and other eatable varieties—but the woods
<note id="note57" n="57" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref57">1 These shells, 
usually made from the ash-tree, vary in length from twelve to
twenty feet. The smaller craft can bear only one man, and he must sit or kneel, or,
if very expert, stand in the center. Some of these lumbermen are so skilful that
they stand erect in their canoes, which are not anchored or tied, and fell these
giant trees.</note>
<pb id="wyeth338" n="338"/>
abounded in all sorts of wild birds and animals, which had
increased greatly during the four years they were free from being
hunted while the men were off in the army. I have never heard a
weirder sound than the howl of a pack of wolves—presumably
hungry—when they would venture at night near our camp. Deer
were so plentiful that any excursion into the brush of the uplands
or second bottoms would start up a herd of from six to a dozen. I
killed with my Colt army pistol on one occasion a fine buck as he
ran right through our camp. They seemed to avoid the lowlands
or cane-brakes, and for good reason: the cane grew so thick they
could not jump or run through it.</p>
          <p>It is difficult to imagine anything more suggestive of
helplessness and loneliness than one of these vast and seemingly
endless stretches of cane, with now and then an open slash full of
tall and stately cypress-trees, with their thousands of “knees,” or
dwarfed, stump-like roots, sticking up in the air from two to four
feet high. These cypress-knees were to me always suggestive
of the tombstones in a neglected graveyard.</p>
          <p>Near the mouth of Little Red River an accident to the
machinery compelled me to tie the <hi rend="italics">Converse</hi> to the bank for
an hour or two, until the engineer could repair the break. For at
least ten miles on either side stretched the practically
impenetrable wilderness of cane. Just where we happened to land
a small ravine, the outlet to a cypress-swamp, opened into White
River. As it was the dry season, this ravine offered an open trail
to the interior; so, taking my ever-ready six-shooter, I started out
alone on a tour of exploration. After going about a mile, with the
cane growing so dense to the very edge of the ravine on either
side that a man could not get through it at any point without
<pb id="wyeth339" n="339"/>
worming his way flat on the ground, it opened abruptly into a vast and
comparatively open forest of giant cypress-trees. Many of these
were over a hundred feet high, with not a limb to mar the beauty
and symmetry of their trunks until near the very top, where the
branches spread out not unlike an open parasol. A number of
eagles' nests were built in their tops, and the shrill screams of
these birds and the occasional flute-like notes of a heron perched
on one of the “knees” were the only sounds. Coming to a low
place where the ground was not yet thoroughly dried, I was
attracted by a print which had the toe-marks of a human foot.
As the heel was missing, I realized at once that it was the
new-made track of a big black bear—and then it suddenly
occurred to me that the engineer had had time to repair his
machinery and I had better hurry back to the boat. Not far from
this neighborhood I passed in the river an old native hunter who
had in his dugout three bears he had killed that morning.</p>
          <p>This overflow cane-brake land was considered worthless when
I lived in Arkansas (1869-1872), and on one occasion at a
public sale for taxes at Augusta I bought on a venture some eight
thousand acres in one body, the price ranging from twelve to
fifteen cents an acre. The land was the property of ex-President
Jefferson Davis and a Mr. Coxe, who, I believe, was his
brother-in-law. The law specified that if not redeemed within two
years the sheriff could make a perfect title to the buyer for taxes.
Three days before the expiration of the time the owners
redeemed their lands by paying double the amount I had paid for
the property. I was told in 1908, while on a brief visit to
Arkansas, that these lands had been sold in recent years at
twenty-five dollars an acre. When cane can be used for
<pb id="wyeth340" n="340"/>
making paper or for any commercial purpose the overflow lands
of the South will be of great value.</p>
          <p>From my perch up in the pilot-house of my steamboat I have
witnessed more than once the thrilling panorama of a burning
cane-brake. After a prolonged drought, when the leaves wither
and are as dry as paper, cane will burn almost as fiercely as the
grass on the Western prairies, though not nearly so rapidly. The
roar of the blaze and the million explosions of the joints is the
best imitation of the rifle-fire in a great battle I have ever heard.
It is simply deafening. This variety of cane has from six to
twenty cavities or joints, each of which is a short, closed cylinder
containing a certain quantity of moisture. As this becomes
heated it expands and “blows up the boiler,” as Jack, my old,
faithful engineer, expressed it.</p>
          <p>After a year and a half as superintendent I became associated
with my employer in a contract to erect some public
buildings for Woodruff County, which undertaking was carried
out successfully and to the entire satisfaction of all concerned.
The county authorities and the citizens were so desirous of
having these buildings completed at the earliest possible date that
they offered a bonus of one thousand dollars if they were turned
over for use three months ahead of the date specified in the
contract. A prolonged low stage of water in Upper White River
prevented our bringing out the last barge-load of stone essential to
the completion of the work. After a long and anxious wait a
telegram informed me that a four-foot rise was on its way down
from the Ozark Mountains, and I repaired to Jacksonport, an
important shipping-point thirty miles below the location of our
quarry, and there arranged with a New Orleans steamboat to
bring out my cargo. It was ten
<pb id="wyeth341" n="341"/>
o'clock of a bitter cold, sleety night in February when I started
on horseback overland to reach the quarry by daylight in order to
have the barge loaded and ready by noon, when the <hi rend="italics">Seminole</hi>
was due on the return trip, and this was my last and only chance.</p>
          <p>I have good reason to remember that ride. Next to the ride
around Lebanon with Morgan on the Christmas raid in the
blizzard which overwhelmed us in 1862, this was the coldest ride
I have had and the longest night I ever experienced. It was very
dark, alternately sleeting and snowing. I had to ferry over Black
River where it empties into White. The ferryman lived on the far
side; and, although in addition to hallooing with all my lung-power
I fired my pistol several times at his cabin, I had no response,
and I was compelled to go six miles farther up this stream to
where I knew the man who kept the ferry lived on my side. At
daylight I was at my destination, and was ready when the
friendly steamboat took me in tow. By the first of May, 1872, my
contract was finished, and I received the extra one thousand
dollars, which, with other earnings, enabled me to resume my
medical studies in New York City.</p>
          <p>I had lost three years out of my professional career, which
was a great loss, but I had gained in business experience and
profited by the larger view of life which my necessities had
forced upon me. I shall never cease to be appreciative of the
kindly consideration with which I was treated by the generous
people of Arkansas of every political shade and in every
condition of society. The wealthy citizens of Augusta proffered
and gave me financial aid in the prosecution of my work, and,
although during my sojourn the bitter and relentless political war
between the carpet-baggers and the native whites was going on,
the partisans
<pb id="wyeth342" n="342"/>
of both sides, realizing that mine was in the nature of a public
position, vied with one another in helping me. It may be that my
training as a pilot had suggested that the best water was near
the middle of the river, and then I have never forgotten that trite
quotation from the <hi rend="italics">Æneid</hi>, 
“<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">medio tutissimus ibis</foreign></hi>.” 
In any event, I
sailed safely between Scylla and Charybdis and furled my
canvas in the harbor of the metropolis, my future home. This is
all so far back in the past it would seem that it ought to be
forgotten or lost in the rush and confusion and worry of this
modern life that knows not peace; but the fascination of the river
holds me to this day, and I live it over in my dreams, awake as
well as asleep.</p>
          <p>On my way to the East I traveled three days by steamboat
from Little Rock on the Arkansas River up this—at that time—
shallow and difficult stream to Fort Smith, on the border of the
Indian Territory. Wishing to get a glimpse of this region, I took
the Overland stage to Muscogee, to which station the Missouri,
Kansas&amp; Texas Railroad had just been completed. The huge
Concord stage drawn by four horses left Fort Smith about eight
o'clock in the morning with eleven passengers inside. I was up in
the front with the driver. We were soon reeling off mile after
mile through the prairies of the Indian Nation, which at that
season of the year were richly carpeted with the flowers and
grass of the early summer. We changed horses every twelve or
fifteen miles, taking our meals at eating-stations kept by
“civilized” Indians, and about dark of the first day crossed a wide
stream where it emptied into the Arkansas. The darkness of
the night made no difference to our Jehu, for he and the
horses seemed to know every foot of the way.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth343" n="343"/>
          <p>About two o'clock in the morning we heard the rumble of
distant thunder, and in the course of half an hour or so we drove
into a terrific wind and rain storm accompanied by thunder and
lightning in regular wild Western fashion. The horses could not
face it, and bolted from the trail, turning so suddenly that only the
skill of the driver prevented the coach from being upset. The vivid
lightning and the crashing thunder added to their fright, and, in the
language of Little Breeches, they ran “hell-to-split” over the
prairie. The driver and I tugged at the reins with all our might, and
he put his weight on the brake; but for a while nothing could hold
them down. It was an exciting moment for one passenger. I
learned afterward that those inside had no idea of what was going
on with us and the team, as the curtains were fastened down and
most of the insiders were asleep. The Jehu shouted to me that the
situation was dangerous, as we had left the trail, and that at any
minute the horses might plunge into a sluice or gully and wreck
the stage. He begged me to clamber down to the double tree and
loosen the traces of the wheel-horses. I did not look favorably
upon such an undertaking, but nothing else seemed to be left to
save us from disaster; so I took the chances and finally unhitched
the traces. The two lead-horses were not powerful enough to run
with the whole load, and the driver soon pulled them to a stop.
We then rested quietly until the storm blew over, and the stars
came out as if nothing had happened.</p>
          <p>I recall vividly the myriads of fireflies which the rainfall
seemed to have moistened into life. The prairies sparkled with
their tiny flashlights until the flowers and blades of grass were
clearly outlined, while above through the rarefied atmosphere in
the aftermath of the storm the stars seemed
<pb id="wyeth344" n="344"/>
to be only just beyond our reach. This brilliant picture of heaven
and earth lasted until the dawn put out all these lesser lights, and
soon the whistle of the locomotive at the terminus told us we
were near Muscogee.</p>
          <p>We found it a city of tents. There was only one frame house,
the hotel, a one-story shanty built of undressed boards and
primitive in every particular. In June, 1909, thirty-seven years
later, I revisited this spot and found a rich and prosperous city of
about forty thousand inhabitants.</p>
          <p>And now, in closing this chapter of my life in hospitable
Arkansas, I venture to tell my catfish story. From the time of
Jonah to the present date men who narrate their fishing
experiences have run the risk of being elected to the Ananias
Society. I have incurred danger too often in my checkered career
and escaped too luckily to be deterred now from relating the
following incident, which is told exactly as it occurred. As
incredible as it may seem, I landed three catfish at one time with
a single hook and line. While engaged in building the county jail at
Augusta, and in towing the barges laden with the huge blocks of
sandstone from the quarry on Upper White River to De Vall's
Bluff, I relied largely for the meat diet of my employees on the
excellent fish which were then abundant. It was our custom to
stretch a stout trot-line across this stream, tying to this short lines,
each with a suitable hook attached, about three feet apart. The
hooks were baited properly at sundown, and early in the morning
the line was “run” and the fish were taken off by a man in a skiff.
On one of these hooks of rather large size I placed as a tempting
bait a small catfish about five inches long. That he might be
swallowed easily, the stiff side-fins were chopped off and the
hook was carried trough the tail.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth345" n="345"/>
          <p>In running the line next morning, a number of fish of ordinary
size were taken off, and as the big hook was approached I knew
by the way the line was being whipped about that a fish of
unusual size had been caught. When I came near enough I saw a
tremendous catfish fastened to this particular short line.
Projecting from its mouth there was at least six inches of the tail
of another fish of the same species. When I realized that the
small fish with which I had baited this hook was not altogether
more than five inches long, my surprise may be imagined.
Meanwhile, I slid the fingers of one hand beneath the gills of the
large fish and hauled it into the boat. I then noticed, projecting
through the abdominal wall of this fish, the point of the strong
lateral fin of the one whose tail was sticking out of the monster's
mouth.</p>
          <p>The mystery was then solved. There were three fish in this
peculiar combination. The little fellow with the hook had been
swallowed by the second fish, which was fully fourteen inches in
length. The third had swallowed the second, head foremost, for
about three-fourths of its length. It is a peculiarity of the anterior
lateral fins of this species of fish that they can be folded back flat
against the body, but when brought forward they are so hinged
that they stop abruptly at a right angle to the axis of the body.</p>
          <p>No doubt when the huge fish discovered it could not swim
away with its victim, an effort was made to disgorge, but in doing
this the powerful sharp lateral fins expanded and hopelessly
impaled him. To satisfy my curiosity I opened the stomach of the
second fish, and there, with the hook, I found the macerated
remains of the bait. Captain Joe Glover was in the boat with me
when the catch was made. Some twenty-five years later this
good friend, whom I had
<pb id="wyeth346" n="346"/>
not seen since our Arkansas days, was master of a steamboat in the
Tennessee River trade. When we met we naturally began to talk
over old times in the West, and he asked me if I had ever
ventured to relate our fish story. I replied that I had told it only to
some intimate friends who would take my word that it was true.
He then said: “You were wise to exercise discretion, for I lost my
reputation for veracity by telling of that experience exactly as it
occurred to a lot of drummers who were traveling with me. It
was a cold night, and we were sitting around the stove in the forward
cabin. When I finished they all got up and went out to get some
fresh air; and there, after a consultation, they baptized me as
‘Catfish Glover, the brother of Jonah and friend of Ananias’!”</p>

AT BELLEVUE MEDICAL COLLEGE—WORK IN THE

PROSECTOR TO THE CHAIR OF ANATOMY—BEGINNING
OF THE PRIZE ESSAYS IN SURGICAL ANATOMY AND
SURGERY—THE STUDY OF GREEK, GERMAN, AND
FRENCH—1872 TO 1878</head>
          <p>WHEN I arrived in New York City in October, 1872, I made a
careful survey of the three medical schools—<hi rend="italics">viz.</hi>, the College of
Physicians and Surgeons, at Twenty-third Street and Fourth
Avenue; University Medical College, at Twenty-sixth Street and
East River; and Bellevue Hospital Medical College, within the
inclosure of the great hospital, the name of which it bore. To my
great surprise and disappointment, there were no special courses
for graduates; and, as clinical experience and practical anatomy
were the chief attractions for me, I selected Bellevue College as
offering the best advantages, and matriculated there in November,
1872. Attending the lectures in only three branches—surgery,
medicine, and obstetrics—I graduated, taking the <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">ad 
eundem</foreign></hi>
degree in March, 1873. The rest of my time was devoted to the
clinics in surgery in the hospital and chiefly to dissecting. In order
to become adept with either hand I worked unremittingly with my
left hand until I became ambidextrous, and in all my active career
this has been of inestimable value.</p>
          <p>Not only every surgeon, but every human being should be
made ambidextrous. It is of vital importance to
<pb id="wyeth348" n="348"/>
remember this in the training of infants and children. The use of the
preferred member (usually the right) should be discouraged and
the opposite hand and arm encouraged until both are fully useful.
By no other method can the human brain be brought to its full
efficiency.</p>
          <p>While at Louisville I had devoted most of my time to the study
of practical anatomy, and now at Bellevue, with an inexhaustible
supply of material, I saw the opportunity for which I had longed.
The demonstrator of anatomy was Edward G. Janeway, and I
missed no chance to be of service to him, as he had no regular
assistant. The students, when he was over-busy or absent, soon
got into the habit of coming to me for demonstrations, especially
of the more complicated regions and organs. As the brain was
considered the most difficult of all, I devoted a great deal of
careful study to it. Among those who had gathered around the
table at which I was seated on the occasion of one of these
demonstrations I happened to notice a middle-aged gentleman of
distinguished appearance who seemed to be more than ordinarily
interested. As we were leaving the college he joined me, and
together we walked up Twenty-seventh Street to near Lexington
Avenue. He wanted to know where I came from and what plans
I had for the future; and I told him I had come to New York to
stay, and my main object at that time was to earn a living. He
stopped in front of a very handsome brick house, and in a way
which bespoke his sincerity as well as his kindness of heart said:
“This is my home. My wife and I live here. We will be glad to
have you live with us. You can pay for your board by tutoring me
as your private medical student.” I could not accept his generous
offer; but he was for three years my private pupil until he took
the degree of M.D. at Bellevue.
<pb id="wyeth349" n="349"/>
He was already a graduate in arts, divinity, and law. A minister in
the Presbyterian Church, he had been President of the University
at Fulton, Missouri. When the war broke out, because of his
strong Southern sympathy, he was arrested and given the
alternative of a residence on parole within the limits of New York
City or banishment to Europe or a prison. He chose the former.</p>
          <p>With no pulpit and no source of revenue, his great mind found
its activity in invention, and the well-known instrument to register
in type by telegraphy the quotations of stocks and bonds—“the
ticker,” now in universal use—was the result; and from this he
received an ample fortune. In later years he accepted the
presidency of the University of Missouri, and in the course of
time retired, and is now (1914), at a very advanced age, still in
the full possession of his faculties, residing in Washington City. I
was proud to be associated with this great and good man as his
teacher in medicine, and grateful for the affectionate friendship
he proved for me when I was a stranger in a strange land.
When my <hi rend="italics">Prize Essays on the Arteries</hi> was published, in 1879,
the volume was dedicated to “Samuel Spahr Laws, A.M., D.D.,
LL.D., M.D.”</p>
          <p>During the winter of 1872 and '73 I made a dissection of a
child of ten years, a dried preparation, arranged in the standing
posture, with the muscles, arteries, veins, and nerves stained in
appropriate colors. It fell under the eye of the professor of
anatomy, Alpheus B. Crosby, a genial, gifted gentleman and the
most popular lecturer at Bellevue. It led to an acquaintance and a
warm friendship, which continued to the day of his untimely death
in 1878. In 1874, a vacancy occurring, he appointed me as
prosector to the chair of anatomy. A year previous, within a
month
<pb id="wyeth350" n="350"/>
of my graduation at Bellevue, Dr. E. G. Janeway had offered me
and I had accepted the position of assistant demonstrator of
anatomy, and he and I made all the demonstrations and did all the
practical teachings of the dissecting-room for one session. A
year later Dr. Joseph D. Bryant was made an assistant
demonstrator, and, Dr. Janeway retiring from the active work, we
ran the dissecting-room and organized what was known as the
“faculty quiz,” although the faculty had nothing to do with it. Dr.
Bryan and I divided subjects equally and covered the entire range
of medicine and surgery. It was considered, and was, at least
numerically, the most successful quiz ever known up to that
period in New York. We had in one session ninety-six pupils, and
we were both fully appreciative of the handsome and much
needed revenue which our college association yielded.</p>
          <p>I began the study of pathology in 1875, under Dr. Janeway, in
his laboratory and as his assistant at autopsies in the morgue. I
believe this was the first laboratory established in New York. It
occupied a part of the old Wood Museum over the morgue. With
such a fascinating subject, and the new world which the
microscope revealed, it was a pleasure and a privilege to be
associated with this enthusiastic teacher. No one could be with
him as intimately as I was and not catch the contagion. In our set
every one was working under pressure. There were no loafers
or shirkers. The fault, if it were one, was overwork.
By way of illustration, I recall one very busy in July or
August when a great many bodies were being brought in dead
from sunstroke. We had made six examinations of the brain in
these cases—and sawing off the top of the skull in order to
examine and remove this organ
<pb id="wyeth351" n="351"/>
with the least possible injury is no light task, especially in
sunstroke weather. It was nearly dark, and I was tired, and Dr.
Janeway should have been, when the grim old keeper of the
morgue approached us and said, “ 'Nother sunstroke.” I couldn't
give in first, and he wouldn't, for he said quietly, after I had read
in his expression that there was no escape, “Wyeth, we might as
well take a look at it,” and I proceeded to saw off the top of
another cranium.</p>
          <p>The New York Pathological Society was the first scientific
organization I joined in New York City, and for many years I
rarely missed a meeting in that dingy basement of the old
College of Physicians and Surgeons at Twenty-third Street and
Fourth Avenue. It was a great privilege to be brought in contact
with the members of this society, for they taught me more than I
could have learned elsewhere. It was here that I first became
acquainted with the great and good Dr. Abraham Jacobi, and laid
the foundation of a lasting and affectionate friendship.</p>
          <p>As I had quit college at the end of my freshman year, and had
never studied Greek, feeling now the need of at least a
rudimentary knowledge of this language, I secured as instructor
Mr. Virginius Dabney, a graduate of the University of Virginia,
and will always be grateful to him for the patience he showed a
not too apt pupil. I had studied French, and could read it
satisfactorily. In the effort to learn to speak it, or at least to
understand it when spoken, I took table board with a Parisian
family resident in New York and remained with them for four
years. Meal-time was the only opportunity for this, as all my
other hours were occupied. Later with a tutor I undertook the
study of German, and devoted as much time as I could afford to
the grammar and in translations, and with a German family
<pb id="wyeth352" n="352"/>
repeated my French boarding-house experience of four years.
This training was of inestimable value to me when in 1881 I was
appointed visiting surgeon to Mt. Sinai Hospital, where very many
patients could speak no other language than German. For a
number of years I subscribed for and read consistently the
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">Gazette des Hôpitaux</foreign></hi> 
and <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="de">Centralblatt für 
Chirurgie</foreign></hi>, and
bought the leading books on surgery and pathology in the French
and German languages. To have access to all the dissecting
material I could use was of incalculable value, and I not only
utilized it for teaching purposes, but for scientific investigations.</p>
          <p>In one of his always instructive clinics in the great
amphitheater in Bellevue Hospital Professor Stephen Smith called
attention to the fact that in Syme's amputation at the ankle, as
practised, there frequently occurred a sloughing of the posterior
flap. In order to discover the cause of this I made a series of
dissections (eighty-seven in all) of the ankle-joint and its
blood-supply, which were embodied in an “Essay upon the Surgical
Anatomy of the Tibio-tarsal Region, with special regard to
Amputations at the Ankle-joint.” This essay received in 1876 the
annual prize of one hundred dollars offered by Professor James
R. Wood to the Alumni Association of the Bellevue Hospital
Medical College for “the best essay on any subject connected
with surgical pathology or operative surgery.” In this same period
I began my work upon the carotid arteries which led to an
important contribution to practical surgery—<hi rend="italics">viz., the ligation of
the external carotid artery.</hi></p>
          <p>In a lecture upon the surgery of the neck Professor Frank
Hamilton, one of the greatest surgeons of his day, author of a
work on fractures and dislocations, which was the leading book
on this subject during his lifetime, said
<pb id="wyeth353" n="353"/>
that the branches of this artery were so irregular in origin and
arrangement, and often so close together, that a ligature should
never be applied to it, and he added that it seemed to be an
exception to the general law of development of the arterial
system in man. His teaching, which was strictly in accordance
with the accepted methods of that time, was that the common
carotid should be tied for all lesions in the distribution of the
external branch. I heard this with great surprise, for if I had one
absolutely fixed conviction it was that there could be no
exceptions to the great law of development which, to my mind,
was part of the harmony of the universe. There might be here
and there abnormalities due to accident or to faulty arrangements
and malnutrition of the blastodermic cells; but these were of the
individual, and not general. I went away from the lecture saying,
“It can't be so, and I must prove it.” This was in 1875, and
between this date and 1878 I made one hundred and twenty-one
dissections of the human neck with especial regard to the origin
of the branches given off from this vessel. Careful measurements
with pointers and rule were made of the distance of every branch
from the bifurcation of the common trunk and from one another.
The demonstration was complete, that these vessels obeyed a
law as fixed as that of the other arteries, and that the external
branch could and <hi rend="italics">should be tied, and that the common trunk
should never be ligated on account of a lesion in the
distribution of the external carotid</hi>. Going further into the
literature of the surgery of the neck and tabulating all reported
cases up to that date, I showed that in the entire history the
external carotid had been tied only sixty-nine times, and the
death-rate in these cases was only four and one-half per cent.,
while in seven hundred and eighty-nine cases in which the
<pb id="wyeth354" n="354"/>
common trunk had been ligated the death-rate was forty-one
per cent.</p>
          <p>While at this work in this same region I extended my
investigations to the subclavian and innominate arteries, and
embodied the entire work in one essay which was offered in
competition for one of the two prizes to be given by the American
Medical Association at the meeting at Buffalo in 1878. The report
of the committee was as follows:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <text>
              <body>
                <div1 type="letter">
                  <p>Your committee to determine the merits of the prize essays would
respectfully report: That they have had three separate papers submitted to their
inspection. Two of these papers present subjects of very great interest and
show original research, but are too imperfect in the estimation of the committee
to command a prize. The remaining paper, in the judgment of your committee, is
fully up to the requirements. Indeed, the paper is so elaborate as to fill a large
space in the volumes of the Transactions of the Association. The paper should
be considered as <hi rend="italics">two</hi>, and not as <hi rend="italics">one</hi>. 
The analysis of seven hundred and
eighty-nine cases of operation on the carotid artery, and the careful and minute
measurements of the artery and its branches in one hundred and twenty-one
subjects, showing the range of variation and the percentage of the same,
followed by inferences, bold and original, naturally constitute a paper complete
in itself. Another one on the same plan, with reference to the innominate and
subclavian, being an analysis of three hundred cases, and the observation of
fifty-two subjects, is presented to us in such a manner that we may consider the
whole as one prize, or they may compete for both.</p>
                  <p>Your committee believe that both prizes should be awarded to the two
essays by one person. The motto is, “<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">Tempora

          <p>These essays were printed by the association and widely
distributed, and the demonstration accepted by surgical
writers and operators throughout the world. To the date
<pb id="wyeth355" n="355"/>
of publication of these essays there was not a work in surgery in
the English, French, or German languages which did not condemn
the operation I now insisted upon. Within five years from that
date the operation was so generally accepted that no other was
advised. The death-rate now is practically <hi rend="italics">nil</hi>.</p>
          <p>About the time the award was to be made I sailed for Europe,
and had no word of the success or failure of my work until two
or three weeks later, when, while in a public reading-room in
London, I happened to see a paragraph in the New York <hi rend="italics">Times</hi>
stating that both prizes had been awarded to me. This was my
first great triumph, for I knew I had overthrown an old procedure
based on a false hypothesis, and had established a new and safer
method. It has already saved many lives, and it will continue to do
so as long as time endures. The old operation cut off the direct
blood-supply and nutrition to one-half of the brain, interfering with
its function until a collateral circulation could be established; the
new one left the nutrition of this vital organ unimpaired. Although
the text-books on surgery gave credit to the author for several
years after the essays were published by the American Medical
Association, strange as it may appear, my name is no longer
associated with this operation.</p>
          <p>Dr. Henry B. Sands, Professor of Surgery in the College of
Physicians and Surgeons in New York City, then by common
consent our leading surgeon, to whom personally I was unknown,
with a generous appreciation which touched me deeply, called at
my office and spoke in terms of highest commendation of this
work. Every year as long as he lived he devoted one or two
lectures to this subject, and later did me the very great honor to
nominate me for the position
<pb id="wyeth356" n="356"/>
of visiting surgeon to Bellevue Hospital. I was greatly impressed
by this offer; and when he said that as professor of surgery he had
the privilege of a nomination to Bellevue Hospital in the service
allotted to his college, I replied that I would be very grateful for
the appointment, but as there were a number of ambitious and
competent young surgeons already connected with the college
who wanted this position, and as I was an outsider, I thought it
doubtful if the faculty would elect me. To this he answered in his
quick, direct way: “That's their business. It's my duty to nominate
the best man I know for the place, and if they don't choose to
elect him it will not be my fault.” I was defeated; but the
nomination, coming from such a man and in the way it did, was a
great compliment.</p>
          <p>Several months after the essays were made public, I
remember on one rainy night Dr. Herman Knapp, who had been
professor of ophthalmology—I think at Heidelberg—
and was now recognized as the head of this specialty in America,
called at my office, 44 West 27th Street, and as he walked in
pulled from beneath his raincoat a volume, and, opening it, said,
“I thought you would be pleased to see how your work is being
received in Germany,” adding, when I remonstrated with him for
coming out in such a storm, that the book had just come, and
he wanted me to see it. It was, if I remember correctly, Sattler
and Graefe's <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="de">Handbuch</foreign></hi> or 
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="de">Archiv für Ophthalmologie</foreign></hi>.
 I could
never be unmindful of such thoughtfulness and kindness from this
great and good man.</p>
          <p>Professor Lewis A. Sayre was in 1872, and for many years
thereafter, the leading orthopedic surgeon of America. I have
always credited him with being the founder of this specialty.
Mentally and physically he was a man of large
<pb id="wyeth357" n="357"/>
proportions and of convincing personality. In his lectures,
believing what he taught to be true, he threw into his subject an
earnestness and an enthusiasm which either carried conviction or
made you go away feeling profoundly sorry that it didn't. The
perspiration would stand in beads upon his fine, broad forehead,
and in those moments devoted to denunciation of any who dared
to oppose his theories his eyes would light up with the piercing
keenness of an eagle's, and, moving to and fro with surprising
agility in one so portly, he would pound with his powerful arm and
fist the table or railing, or patient, or anything that came in the
way. No student who loved a rare treat ever willingly missed a
lecture by this able, genial, warm-hearted, and eccentric surgeon.
I made his acquaintance soon after I came to New York, and he
was more than kind to me. Later he placed his two eldest sons as
private pupils with me, and went so far as to offer in return for
my work as his assistant a room and office in his beautiful Fifth
Avenue residence. His contributions to surgery are valuable and
lasting, and make him a benefactor of mankind. His enthusiasm
and devotion to science knew no bounds, which may possibly be
inferred from a personal experience which I
narrate, not without some misgiving as to its propriety.</p>
          <p>A celebrated negro minstrel, whose tall stature, slender
proportions, and unusually lengthy extremities were cleverly
exaggerated by a wonderful make-up, and who had long
entertained theater-goers by his grotesque performances, died
suddenly. He was a great favorite of mine, and I had observed a
very remarkable and unnatural mobility of the right arm, which
he could twist and bend in so many usually impossible
directions that it occurred to me he must have another
ball-and-socket joint in this member elsewhere than
<pb id="wyeth358" n="358"/>
at the shoulder. Very early one morning Dr. Sayre call at my
office, and in his usual earnest way said: “Wyeth, ---  --- died last
night. Fifteen years ago he consulted me in regard to his arm, and
I found an ununited fracture of the humerus communicating with
the elbow, and such free and abnormal motion in all directions that
I asked, and he promised me, that when he died I should have the
bones at the elbow. I want you to help me get them.”</p>
          <p>It was agreed that I should be introduced as an embalmer;
and, securing the outfit for injecting the arteries with
preservative fluids at the college, we arrived at the dead man's
home. With a face expressive of the most profound sympathy
and a voice trembling with emotion, he spoke to the family of his
departed friend and patient, telling them that the last time he had
treated him—he called him by his familiar name—he had exacted a
promise that should he die first the doctor would see that he was not
buried without being embalmed. He had called now to fulfil that
promise, and had brought to do the work the most experienced
embalmer in New York, and I was introduced. In
this case the artery selected was the right brachial near the
elbow, and when the operation was completed the lower four
inches of the humerus and as much of the ulna and radius below
the joint were reposing in the embalmer's inside pocket, and three
small sticks of kindling pine represented the absent bones.
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">Natura vacuum abhorret</foreign></hi>. 
There had been a transverse fracture
of the humerus just above the elbow, and the lower fragment had
broken in two in the middle. The interesting feature was that a
new joint had formed, practically a ball and socket, with a new
capsular ligament and <hi rend="italics">new cartilage on the broken ends of
the bones!</hi></p>
          <pb id="wyeth359" n="359"/>
          <p>The night following this interesting experience I had a dream
which developed into one of the most realistic and frightful
nightmares I have ever experienced. I had only a few evenings
before witnessed a performance by this actor, and on that
occasion he wore shoes several inches longer than his foot. As he
walked or danced the unfilled tips were made to flap loudly on the
floor. His white cotton jacket was too short by a foot, and the
baggy trousers stopped just below the knee, bringing into view his
long, thin shanks covered with black stockings. He wore a wig so
arranged that when, depicting fright, he touched a spring his hair
would stand on end, stiff and erect as broom-straws, and upon the
center of the top of his head reposed a diminutive Dunlap silk hat
which would have adorned and not been too large for an
organ-grinder's monkey.</p>
          <p>I dreamed that some one was coming up the stairway toward
the room in which I was sleeping. The steps were slow and
deliberate, and intended to be noiseless, but I recognized as each
foot touched the riser a peculiar flap of the shoe, and then I was
seized with the frightful conviction that the dead man was coming
for me. I tried to get up and go to the door, to be sure it was locked,
but could not move. I heard the key turn, and saw distinctly the slowly
widening crack of the opening door, through which appeared
the blackened face and hair on end and tiny stove-pipe hat,
and as I groaned for help he lifted one foot with the long
shoe just as I had seen him do at the theater when he
would place this member on Dan Bryant's shoulder, draw
him toward himself, and say triumphantly, “I got you now!”
As he said this to me the door flew open, and he jumped on
my chest and danced a double back step which ended by
his swinging the sole of that long shoe slowly and deliberately
<pb id="wyeth360" n="360"/>
over my mouth and nose, until, to save myself from
suffocation, I made one final, desperate effort to wake up, and
found myself rolling to the floor.</p>
          <p>Dreaming is to me a strange and inexplicable mental process.
Some of these images or impressions, which our will does not
conjure up and cannot control, and which appear to
be absolutely foreign to our waking brain-action, we fail
to register and they are forgotten, while others, as the one just
detailed, remain indelibly printed in our memory cells and come
back over and over again in our waking hours. It is the same with
the dream or delirium in disease. When at eighteen I was very ill
in prison with pneumonia I was told during convalescence that I
had been out of my head, which I knew already, for when I
became conscious I remembered vividly, as I still do, this wild,
disordered dream: I was on a train, the day was hot, the water
gave out, and after what seemed an interminable run we stopped
by the side of a high bluff from the side of which, at a point
inaccessible except by crawling along a gradually narrowing
ledge, so high that it was sure death to fall, a stream of cool,
crystal water was trickling. The ledge gave out before I could
reach the spring, and I was moaning over the disappointment and
evidently asking for water, when some one put a tin-cupful in my
hand and held my head up while I emptied it. Reason came back
with this, and that dream of delirium was indelibly registered. It
is as clear in my memory cells at this time (forty-nine years later)
as it was then.</p>
          <p>While on the subject of dreams I must commit myself to
another conviction—namely, that in our waking hours our brains
register impressions of which at the time we fail to be
conscious, and which become recognizable images or
<pb id="wyeth361" n="361"/>
pictures either while asleep or upon wakening after (probably a
restful and refreshing) slumber. I know this has been
my experience, and it has led me to accept the theory of the
subconscious mind. I first noticed this mental process when as a
youth I undertook to train my mind to be quick in memorizing. My
first long task was the third canto of “Childe Harold.” The
Spenserian measure, the evenly sustained beauty and rhythm,
and the deep feeling which pervades this (to me) most attractive
poem in our language, naturally led to its preference. I committed
to memory this canto of about nine hundred lines, and recited it
publicly on one or two occasions. While engaged in this task I
noticed that not infrequently when in the late afternoon
or evening I would read over some unlearned stanzas, which I
could not remember, I would awaken the next morning and could
recite them word for word. Incidentally, in experimenting I found
that from 10 to 12 A.M., just about the time that the breakfast
digestion process was finished, was the period when I could
memorize with greatest facility.</p>
          <p>Another interesting personal experience comes to my mind. In
1902 a boy was brought to me from Cuba with a condition of the
forearm which gave me a great deal of trouble to understand.
This case is given with others in another book as an original
contribution to surgery. For four or five days I thought over the
history of his injury and the resulting inability to rotate the radius
around the ulna—in other words, to turn his hand over. About
three in the morning I awoke with a perfectly clear conception
of the cause of the inability; and I removed it by operation that
morning. I was so afraid I would forget it if I fell asleep again
that I made a note of it at once.</p>
          <p>The study of anatomy, both human and comparative,
<pb id="wyeth362" n="362"/>
had for me a great fascination, so much so that at one time I
believe I would have devoted my life to it had I had an
independent income. And yet I recall with what horror I first
smelt and saw the inside of a dissecting-room. This soon gave
way; for I saw how wonderful was the structure of the human
body, and how essential to a satisfactory and successful
understanding and treatment of disease and injury was a
practical knowledge of each organ, or part, in relation to the
whole. But for the situation of Bellevue as a workshop, and the
associations which gave me free access to the morgue and one of
the largest dissecting-rooms in New York, I could never have
secured the material to use in successfully carrying out my
investigations. As it was, I had at one period, and for quite a
while, to resort to the “underground” method of investigation.</p>
          <p>Connected with the old morgue there was a large, square
room used for storing great stocks of the plain-plank coffins in
which the unclaimed dead were carried away to the potter's
field. From the center of the ceiling hung an unused gas-chandelier.
There were two windows, and the single door which
opened into the morgue. I arranged with the keeper to cover the
windows with thick cloth and stack the coffins in such a way that
a good-sized room was secured, to which entrance could be had
without being suspected, and in which I could work night and day
without being interrupted. With the help of my good friend the
keeper I used this cave with great satisfaction for two years, until
I had completed my work, and no one ever knew it beyond the
two most interested. These dissections were usually made after
ten o'clock, when my official duties were over and the college
had closed for the night.</p>
          <p>Not infrequently I became so interested in the subject
<pb id="wyeth363" n="363"/>
under investigation that I forgot about time or became so
tired or sleepy I simply had to quit. I rarely went to bed before
twelve or one o'clock, and sometimes later. On one occasion I
fell asleep and received such a shock when I awoke that I never
forgot it. Late one stormy night the keeper had gone home and I
was the only living thing left except the rats, which were often too
companionable, with coffins all about and anywhere from
twenty-five to fifty cadavers in reach. I was dissecting the right axilla
or armpit, the arm stretched out at a right angle to the body, and a
block beneath the shoulder-blades, which let the subject's head
drop backward. My arm was resting on the dead man's chest, and
as I fell asleep the weight of my head and upper portion of the
body rested on my arm and upon the ribs of the cadaver. These
being elastic, and the lungs the same, gradually and noiselessly the
residual air was pressed out of the lungs. When I awoke, startled at
the idea of falling asleep under such conditions, as I raised my
head I suddenly took the pressure from his chest. The elastic ribs
came back at once to their former position, and in doing this
created a vacuum in the lungs, into which the air rushed through
the subject's larynx, producing a wheezing or gurgling sound, just
as one does who inspires violently when half strangled after
drinking and getting a few drops of water in the windpipe.</p>
          <p>In the condition of mind which prevailed at that instant I
thought the man was not dead! The lugubrious part of this
experience did not end here. In my hurry I put on my overcoat,
for a winter snow-storm was raging, and without going into the
large room to light the gas-jet over the door of exit I turned out
my chandelier and found myself without matches and in thick
darkness. Nothing was left but
<pb id="wyeth364" n="364"/>
to grope my way through coffins and cadavers and along the wall
until I found the door-knob and went out into the storm. It was a
weird experience.</p>
          <p>In these years of strenuous labor I made one grave mistake,
and I bring it out here in the hope that it may serve as a warning
to other struggling and ambitious beginners. I worked too much
and took little or no recreation, and did not pay the strict attention
to sleep and diet which is essential. I doubt if I averaged six hours
in bed out of every twenty-four for the first six years of my
residence in New York. My one dissipation was the theater on
Saturday night, when the college was closed. If there was an hour
free from some duty I walked for exercise in the beautiful Central
Park. It never occurred to me to waste time at cards or billiards
or other games of amusement, and I had never contracted the use
of tobacco or alcohol.</p>
          <p>In fact, I do not think a physician should ever smoke or drink.
In 1876 I broke down with a serious illness, which was diagnosed
as perityphlitis, but which I now know was appendicitis. Dr.
Reginald Fitz had not opened the eyes of the profession to this
disease with his classical paper, nor had Dr. Simon Baruch, a
leader in medicine, yet laid mankind under never-ending obligation
by his recognition of and insistence upon the necessity of
immediate operation. The only operation in my case was the
insertion of an exploring needle through the abdominal wall deeply
into the indurated mass, a procedure more dangerous than
operation, and by no means painless. No suppuration was
discovered, and at the end of two weeks the abscess
discharged into the cæcum. Here followed a slow convalescence,
a phlebitis with permanent occlusion of the left popliteal vein, which
<pb id="wyeth365" n="365"/>
accident I have since observed on this, the opposite side to the
appendix, in a number of instances. I was incapacitated for
nearly twelve months by reason of this illness, and in 1877
resigned my connection with Bellevue Hospital Medical College.</p>

          <p>I VISITED Europe early in 1878 in order to study the methods of
teaching in the great medical centers there. I had been dreaming
of inaugurating a new system of medical education in America,
and had my plans made out. They will be given in that part of this
volume relating to the founding of the Polyclinic. The year before
going abroad I had made the acquaintance of Dr. J. Marion Sims.
He had laid the foundation of his great reputation in Montgomery,
Alabama, where he had known my father, who as a young man
was then a member of the state legislature. When I arrived in
Paris he was residing there, and I called to pay my respects and
was cordially received. The next morning he came to my hotel to
show me the <hi rend="italics">Medical Record</hi>, which he had just received and
which contained my “Prize Essays.” Had I been his own son he
could not have been more appreciative and encouraging in what
he said to me then; and from that day to the day this great pioneer
in surgery died I was bound to him by the ties of an affectionate
friendship. He gave me a most delightful dinner, at which I met
for the first time his youngest daughter,
<pb id="wyeth367" n="367"/>
named Florence Nightingale, for the noble woman whose life
of unselfish devotion to humanity naturally won for her the
admiration and respect of Marion Sims.</p>
          <p>There happened to be present at this dinner a member of the
suite or staff of the then Prince of Wales, Edward. He was a
renegade Irishman, and, as usual with the Irish who go eastward
from Erin, he was more English than the natives of Albion. He
entertained us with what his Prince did on Mondays and
Tuesdays and other days, and how he did it, seemingly oblivious
of the fact that all the rest of us were Americans who cared no
more for his princes and dukes and lords and ladies than we did
for the king of the Cannibal Islands—in fact, not so much.</p>
          <p>My Americanism may be prejudiced and narrow, but the idea
of preferment by inheritance and not by personal merit and
achievement has the same effect on me as a red rag is said to
have upon a certain male quadruped. Moreover, at school and
later I had learned something about the way the British had
treated our people during the Revolutionary War and in 1812:
how they had incited the Indians and Tories to massacre and
pillage; how at Fort Mims, near my own home, some three
hundred helpless women and children had been butchered without
mercy as late as 1813, while we were at war in protest against
England's outrageous and unlawful impressment of our people in
her service; how, encouraging the traffic in slaves, her rulers had
permitted, against the protest of the colonists, the importation of
African slaves and the establishment of slavery in America; how
they had shocked mankind by blowing the bodies of their
condemned subjects in India from the mouths of cannon; and
how, for commercial reasons, they had forced the opium trade
upon protesting, helpless China. All this
<pb id="wyeth368" n="368"/>
and a lot more, when the rhapsodist of Albion stopped long
enough to catch his breath, I recited, not giving him a chance to
get a word in edgewise until I had run the gamut of my indictment
of the “mother country.” Then some one asked some one else if
they had “ever seen a rabbit,” which was a signal to change the
conversation, and peace was declared.</p>
          <p>When I made my dinner-call upon the hostess and her
husband, I said: “Dr. Sims, I fear I presumed too far on the
hospitality of your home in what I said to your Irish-English guest;
but I lost control and boiled over.” He put a hand on either
shoulder as we were standing, his handsome face expressing not
only forgiveness but approbation as he replied: “Wyeth, I never
enjoyed a raking over the coals more than the one you gave that
conceited fellow. Had it not been at my own table I would have
done it myself.”</p>
          <p>When two years later in New York Dr. Sims passed through
the terrible ordeal of a double pleuro-pneumonia, I stayed for
fifteen nights by his bedside or lay upon a sofa in easy call of the
suffering patient. As is common with doctors, he was a bad
patient. I had been directed by Doctors Loomis and Janeway that
no morphine should be administered if it could possibly be
avoided. On one or two occasions, when he was suffering
intensely, a small quantity had been given with gratifying effect to
the patient. He insisted at one time that I should give him a
hypodermic. I remonstrated mildly, telling him his condition was
such that it was very dangerous to take it, and that I had positive
instructions not to give him any that night. He raised such a
clamor that at last I said: “Well, if you will have it, you must; but
you must relieve me of all responsibility.” He
<pb id="wyeth369" n="369"/>
answered: “All right; I'll do it.” Having anticipated such a demand,
I had already loaded a syringe with pure water, and took the
bottle of Magendie's solution, and went through the form of filling
it with the proper quantity.</p>
          <p>I stuck the needle into the patient's arm, injected the contents of
the syringe, put everything away, went back to my sofa, lay
down, and pretended to be asleep. He was quiet for five or ten
minutes, then became somewhat restless; and soon after I heard
him call, and walked around to the side of his bed. “How much
Magendie did you give me?” he whispered. “Six minims,” I
replied. Without taking his eyes from mine he pointed his finger at
me and said, quickly, “Wyeth, that's a lie, and you know it!” I am
sure it was one of those white lies which will never be recorded
against me, and I have every reason to know, after his
convalescence and recovery, he had entirely forgiven me.</p>
          <p>Marion Sims died on November 13, 1883. Early in 1882 he had
returned to Paris and revisited New York in August, 1883. In the
interval between August and the day of his death in November I
saw him frequently. A day or two before he died he came into
the parlor of his residence, complaining that his heart beat very
fast whenever he went up-stairs. I remarked that he was
unnecessarily apprehensive, since Loomis and all the
diagnosticians had excluded any organic heart lesion. He replied:
“It doesn't matter what they say; this heart trouble will kill me
yet.” He had intended to return to Europe on November 8th, and
had purchased tickets for himself and family on a steamer sailing
that day. He was, however, prevailed on to remain over to do an
important operation, which he did
<pb id="wyeth370" n="370"/>
on November 12th. He returned home about eleven on that night
and went to his bed. It was his custom to keep pieces of white
cardboard by his bedside and a lead-pencil convenient, so that at
any time in the night when a thought occurred to him that he
wished to record he could do so without making a light. He was
thus engaged when, in an instant, without an expression of pain,
his heart ceased to beat. Truly nature crowned his career with the
greatest of all possible blessings—a painless death.</p>
          <p>In that most fascinating book, <hi rend="italics">The Story of My Life</hi>, Dr. Sims
says that thirteen was always a lucky number with him. He was
born in 1813; on the 13th of the month he graduated from college;
he left his South Carolina home to practise in Alabama on the
13th; arrived in New York City on the 13th; and it was on
November 13, 1883, at fifteen minutes past three o'clock that he
died.</p>
          <p>It is safe to say that Marion Sims attained the highest position
ever achieved in the history of our profession. His reputation as a
surgeon was so world-wide that in any capital, in any country
within the domain of civilization, he could command at any time a
lucrative practice. In New York, London, Paris, Brussels, Berlin,
Vienna, Rome, Madrid, Lisbon, and St. Petersburg he found
himself everywhere sought after, not only by the patients he could
benefit, but by the leading members of his own profession,
who were anxious to pay tribute to his wonderful genius.</p>
          <p>From the brilliant triumph of that memorable clinic at La
Charité in 1862, Dr. Sims went forth to the professional conquest
of Europe. The journals of the day heralded his advent, and the
gates of the capitals of kingdoms were
<pb id="wyeth370a" n="370a"/>
<figure id="ill12" entity="wyeth370a"><p>STATUE OF DR. J. MARION SIMS, BRYANT PARK, NEW YORK </p></figure>
<pb id="wyeth371" n="371"/>
thrown open to his coming. From place to place he journeyed,
healing the afflicted and teaching others to heal. Kings of the
realm of science vied with one another to do him honor, kings
and rulers of nations were proud to confer upon him the highest
decorations in their power. Upon the base of the pedestal which
his statue in Bryant Park overlooks, the physicians of our time
and of all time may read with encouragement the epitome of his
life.</p>
          <p>Justly held as the father of gynecology, his genius knew none of
the limitations of specialization, and in my opinion his most
notable contribution to science is his paper on “The Careful
Aseptic Invasion of the Peritoneal Cavity, Not Only for the
Arrest of Hemorrhage, the Suture of Intestinal Wounds, and the
Cleansing of the Peritoneal Cavity, but for all Intra-peritoneal
Conditions,” read before the New York Academy of Medicine,
October 6, 1881. It marked the dawn of an era, and was the real
starting-point in the new surgery of the abdominal cavity.</p>
          <p>While in Paris in 1878 I submitted my scheme of a combined
three years' pregraduate and two years' postgraduate medical
school to Dr. Sims, and it met with his full approval. He said if he
were younger he would join with me in the effort to establish it.</p>
          <p>There was unveiled in Bryant Park, New York City, in 1894, a
statue in bronze of this immortal man. It stands erect and proud,
a life-like image of the great teacher, the spontaneous gift from
his brothers in the profession throughout the civilized world, and
from many of the unfortunate beings his genius and skill had
benefited. In brief yet comprehensive phraseology the inscription
tells the story of his career:</p>

          <div3 type="subchapter">
            <p>Marion Sims possessed a striking personality. Notwithstanding
his long and bitter struggle with poverty and for professional
recognition, and in his early days for health and life itself, time
had dealt gently with his form and face, whereon nature had set
in unmistakable lines the stamp of
<pb id="wyeth373" n="373"/>
greatness. Although he had rounded well the years allotted by the
Psalmist, his step was still quick and firm, his carriage erect,
dignified, and graceful. The frosts of age had not tinged the rich
abundance of his dark-brown hair, which fell straight back from
off the massive forehead, for the ever-active brain and the
deep-seated, searching eyes of brown asked always for the light. The
brows were arched and unusually heavy and prominent; the nose
beautifully proportioned and of Grecian type; the mouth well
shaped, lips usually compressed, which, with the prominent chin,
bespoke courage and firmness of purpose. His face was oval,
clean-shaven, and smooth, and the usual expression was of
almost womanly sweetness; yet it was quick to vary in harmony
with whatever emotion was predominant. Away from
preoccupation and in the home life, his expression and actions
were almost boyish. He never seemed to have forgotten that he
was once a boy, and he would throw himself into a household
frolic with all the abandon of his early days. He was courageous
to a degree; and, although he rarely lost control of his temper, yet
he was at times imperious and aggressive. When occasion
demanded he was a good fighter, and fought his enemies with
right good will; but he was quick to forgive. As was said of him
by a gifted orator, he possessed qualities ideal in the make-up of
a truly great surgeon—“the brain of an Apollo, the heart of a lion,
the eye of an eagle, and the hand of a woman.”</p>
            <p>If generosity be a fault, it was his besetting sin, and that was
all the sin of which I deemed him capable.</p>
            <p>Toward the higher and purer civilization the progress of man is
slow. As yet the shadows of barbarism linger about him. His
heroes are the destroyers, the Cæsars and Napoleons,
<pb id="wyeth374" n="374"/>
who covered the earth with ruin and buried beneath it
countless lives sacrificed upon the altar of personal ambition. But
the time must come when those whose genius and works give
life and health and happiness to the world will be first in the heart
of man. In this purer temple of fame, along with such names as
Jenner, Ephraim McDowell, Morton, Lister, Pasteur, Walter
Reed, Koch, Gorgas, Lazear, and Ricketts, generations yet
unborn shall read the name of Marion Sims.</p>
            <p>I had received in 1877 an appointment as visiting surgeon to St.
Elizabeth's Hospital, a small institution well managed by a society
of Sisters of Charity, and in 1882 I was made visiting surgeon to
Mt. Sinai Hospital, then on Lexington Avenue between Sixty-sixth
and Sixty-seventh streets, one of the largest, best-managed,
and most useful of the many great philanthropies of New York
City. The directors were all Hebrews, and, although liberal and
nonsectarian as to those admitted, naturally the great majority
of the patients were Jews, and many of these were the poorest of
poor immigrants newly arrived from Russia, Poland, and
Germany.</p>
            <p>My colleague at the Polyclinic, Dr. A. G. Gerster—a brilliant,
ambitious, and exceedingly competent lecturer and surgeon—and I
divided the surgical service at Mt. Sinai, and by our united efforts
added very much to the attractiveness of the clinics. During our
first term a salary was paid to the house surgeon, as it was
difficult to induce the better class of young men to serve in this
capacity for the full term. We took our Polyclinic students there
in great numbers, built up a large clientele, and the next year
there were a half-dozen eager applicants for every vacancy on
the interne staff. The number of visitors became so
<pb id="wyeth375" n="375"/>
large that the directors gave us a new and extra large
operating-room and met all our demands with their
wonted liberality.</p>
            <p>Fully one-half of these patients spoke the German language,
and I found the four years I had devoted to this great language
with a tutor and boarding with a family of educated Germans had
not been spent in vain. A large proportion of the Jews from
Poland and Russia spoke a mixed German, something of which I
“picked up.” In a suit for damages for injury in an elevator
accident I was subpœnaed, as I had treated the plaintiff in the
hospital. The jury could not understand his very broken English.
His German proved just as unsatisfactory; for there were two
intelligent native Germans on the jury who told the judge they
could not understand him. I asked permission to speak to him,
asked him to describe the accident in the mixed Mt. Sinai patois,
which he did. The judge then had me sworn in as interpreter, and
I translated his testimony to the jury in English and German, much
to the joy of the plaintiff, for he received a verdict. I had great
sympathy with these unfortunate people, for they were
submissive, patient, and very grateful, and, as far as I could judge,
law-abiding.</p>
            <p>In all my sixteen years' service in this hospital I recall but one
outlaw, and my experience with him was interesting enough to
justify narration. He came into the service with a fistulous
opening in the abdominal wall, which he stated had been caused
by falling against a sharp spike. During his convalescence the
patient next to him happened to be reading the <hi rend="italics">Police Gazette</hi>, in
which there was a picture of a burglar who had escaped from a
prison hospital, where he was being treated for a bullet-shot
wound received while
<pb id="wyeth376" n="376"/>
robbing a silk-store. Beneath the photograph was printed,
“Sheeny Mike, the Great Silk Burglar.” The patient looked over at
his nearest neighbor, handed him the <hi rend="italics">Gazette</hi>, and said, “This
fellow looks like you.” The answer was, “Yes, there is some
resemblance,” and he quietly returned the paper. In a few
minutes he sauntered to the bath-room in the rear of the ward,
from which a back stairway led to the street, and that was the
last the hospital knew of “Sheeny Mike.” Meanwhile the
newspapers mentioned the fact that he had escaped, and stated
that a reward of five thousand dollars was offered for his
apprehension.</p>
            <p>A month or two later I happened one afternoon to be in a
cross-town car going from the Desbrosses Street Ferry to
the Bowery, when Mike, well-dressed, as is usual with
gentlemen of leisure, boarded the car, recognized and took
his seat by me, and we conversed during a ride of several
blocks about his health and the operation at the hospital and
the weather, but never a word about the Boston silk business
or the five thousand dollars' reward. Had he run away when he
saw me I possibly might have followed him and caused his arrest;
but when he trusted me so implicitly I could not be unmindful of
his confidence. He was arrested later in Jacksonville, Florida, where,
according to the newspapers, he was running an extensive
merchandise business, and, I think, died in the penitentiary.</p>
            <p>I had some interesting experiences with several patients who
were beyond the law, and recall two who were arrested for
complicity in the great Northampton bank robbery. One of these
was found guilty, and made a daring escape from prison.</p>
            <p>With the success of the Polyclinic, and the intimate personal
acquaintance it brought with practising physicians from
<pb id="wyeth377" n="377"/>
all parts of the country, together with the practical experience
gained from the extensive surgical service at Mt. Sinai and
elsewhere, my private practice grew more and more
remunerative. I now gave up all medical cases and confined my
work entirely to the practice and teaching of surgery. In 1884 an
agent of the publishing firm of D. Appleton&amp; Co. called upon me
with a proposition to write a text-book on surgery for that firm;
but we failed to agree on terms. I was very desirous of writing
such a book, for much of the work I had already done was
directly in that line. I insisted on a new style of illustration in
colors which was more than ordinarily expensive, and told the
Appletons it was not worth while to bring out a new book unless
it could be made more attractive than any other book on surgery.</p>
            <p>The cost was thought to be too great, and for the time being the
matter rested there as far as they were concerned; but I went on
with the surgery without saying a word to any one, for I felt that I
would find a publisher. The next fall the Appleton agent came
back and said, “Well, what about the surgery?” I replied,
“Nothing, unless your firm will give me <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">carte 
blanche</foreign></hi> on
illustrations,” and, to my delight, he said: “All right; I am
authorized to close the contract now. Can you do it in a year?” I
said, “In less time, if you are in a hurry.” We signed the contract,
and then I told him the book was written, and I could give him the
manuscript as fast as he wanted it. As I had anticipated, the
beautiful illustrations in three colors, which had never before been
used in a text-book on this subject, proved very attractive. I was
to be at no expense and to receive ten per cent. of the gross
sales, which for the various editions amounted to between two
and three hundred thousand dollars.</p>
            <pb id="wyeth378" n="378"/>
            <p>The actual cash profits of authorship, especially in scientific
books, are rarely large; but the enhancement of professional
reputation is always a valuable asset, more gratifying
than the mere accumulation of money; and a successful book
always brings this reward. The large sale of this volume, together
with the prize essays, widely distributed through the American
Medical Association, widened the circle of personal as well as
professional acquaintanceship and added to my practice. I had
been, however, in 1885, and again in 1886, elected to the
presidency of the New York Pathological Society, and it was
about this period that the professorship of surgery in the great
medical college at New Orleans, which Dr. T. G. Richardson had
so long and successfully held, was offered to me. It was a great
temptation to go “back home,” but my heart was in the work of
building up the Polyclinic as a great postgraduate medical school.</p>
            <p>I wish I could impress upon every young member of our
profession the importance of pathology, for it is the foundation of
a successful career and practice. A true conception of this
subject combines the laboratory with the postmortem-room. As I
look back now I realize that practically every active member of
this society at the time of which I write was then or became later
famous in medicine. There was E. G. Janeway (I nicknamed him
“<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">ejus generis</foreign></hi>”), 
the indefatigable worker, close observer, conscientiously studying
his cases, and, when death occurred,
reaping the full benefit of his successes or failures in diagnosis
and treatment by a minute examination of the organs involved. He
became one of the greatest diagnosticians in medicine the
profession has ever known. To every beginner in medicine asking,
“How may I succeed?” I would say, “Study the career of Edward G.
Janeway and try to follow it.”</p>
            <pb id="wyeth379" n="379"/>
            <p>That I should admire and respect him was inevitable from our
close association; and for the watchful, brotherly care he gave me
through the long and weary months of a painful and desperate
illness I owe the grateful tribute of friendship. Abraham Jacobi,
the Nestor of American Medicine, as I write this page, full of
years and of honors well deserved, then as now and for ever
famous, was always in attendance. And there, too, was his gifted
wife, Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi, whose knowledge of pathology
was so thorough, whose range of the literature was so wide, and
whose criticism was so keen, fearless, and just that in our
discussions we felt it prudent to shun the field of speculation and
to walk strictly in the path of demonstrated facts. Of this group
also was my fellow-student at college and soon thereafter my
teacher in advanced pathology, William H. Welch, whose
transcendent genius for research has made him <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">facile 
princeps</foreign></hi>
among American pathologists. When my increasing labors
pressed me so for time that I could no longer work in his
laboratory, I equipped my own in my office, and two evenings of
each week this enthusiastic and generous friend came to help me
in the efforts to keep in touch with the latest developments in the
science in which he was master. Louis Elsberg and John H.
Ripley, both justly renowned, were among this group, as was L.
Emmet Holt, the eminent pediatrist of the present date.</p>
            <p>Soon after my return from Europe in 1878 the frightful
epidemic of yellow fever broke out in Memphis, causing panic
and flight for all who could escape, and anxiety, suffering, or
death for those who could not run away, or who, like the doctors
of that city, remained at their posts. Thinking it our duty to offer
our services to our own afflicted people, my old Confederate
comrade, Dr. William M. Polk,
<pb id="wyeth380" n="380"/>
and I telegraphed to Dr. John H. Erskine that we would go to
Memphis if he thought we could be made useful. To our great
relief, Dr. Erskine, who had been a medical director in the Army
of Tennessee, replied: “Don't come. You would be down with
fever in two weeks, and would add to our anxieties.” He died of
the fever in this epidemic.</p>

THE TENNESSEE&amp; COOSA—HOW I FINANCED A RAILROAD AND
SAVED A FORTUNE FOR A FRIEND—REVISIT MY ALMA MATER—
WRITE THE LIFE OF FORREST</head>
          <p>THERE is an old adage that a man who is “Jack of all trades is
good at none.” I had been brought up with the idea that a boy and
man should learn something of any and every trade, if it were
practicable, and by the time I went to college I was fairly expert
with the tools and implements, and at home with the handy
experiences which were part of the life of a pioneer agricultural
community. When in 1874 I tacked my sign to the door of 226
Fifth Avenue as a surgeon of the metropolis, in the center of rich
and fashionable New York City (for the old Fifth Avenue Hotel,
at Twenty-third and Twenty-fourth streets and Broadway, and
the famous Hotel Brunswick, at Twenty-sixth Street and Fifth
Avenue, were just across the street from my office), I had hoped
and believed that henceforth until I could sit down quietly as an
old man and write my “Occupations of a Retired Life” my lines
were cast for naught but surgery. I had been Jack of many
trades, and now I was trying to be good at least at one. I had
been farmer and woodsman, soldier for three years,
superintendent of a large cotton plantation, cattle-buyer, medical
student for two years, and pilot for the same length of time on a
steamboat in the White River country of Arkansas, contracted
for and built
<pb id="wyeth382" n="382"/>
public buildings for Woodruff County in that state, speculated in
lands, ran a telegraph office as operator, etc., and now it came
about that I had to interrupt the even tenor of my professional
career to finance and build a railroad. Like much more of what
has been written in these pages, it reads like romance, yet I have
learned that truth is stranger than fiction, and this is the plain story
of the Tennessee&amp; Coosa Railroad.</p>
          <p>My father had founded Guntersville, the county-seat of
Marshall County, Alabama, in 1848. He had dreamed of building
up there, at the south bend of the Tennessee, a great commercial
community. As part of his plan while a member of the state
legislature he had secured the charter of a railroad to connect the
navigable waters of the Tennessee and Coosa rivers, and
ultimately to make it a link in a great through railroad transit line.
It may not be out of place to tell here how very near he came to
the realization of his dream. When in later years the great through
system from Memphis, <hi rend="italics">via</hi> Atlanta, to the Atlantic Ocean at
Charleston and Savannah was being projected my father brought
his influence to bear to have that railroad run from Decatur to
Guntersville, and thence direct to Atlanta, cutting Chattanooga
entirely out. The conflict of interests between the two routes
became so sharp that at last the governors of the five states
through which the road was surveyed—Tennessee, Mississippi,
Alabama, Georgia, and South Carolina—appointed each three
commissioners to determine the route. When the fifteen
commissioners met they elected as chairman Mr. Sam Tate, of
Memphis. Seven voted for the Guntersville and seven for the
Chattanooga route, and Sam Tate's single vote decided in favor of
Chattanooga and made it the great railroad center of the middle
South. Had
<pb id="wyeth383" n="383"/>
he voted the other way our family would have been one of the
wealthiest in our state.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding this set-back, work on the Tennessee&amp; Coosa
Railroad, thirty-six miles in length, from Guntersville to Gadsden,
had been pushed, and when it was stopped in 1861 on account of
the Civil War it was well on to completion. The chief contractor
and builder of this road was Mr. Hugh Carlisle, a British subject
residing in Alabama, to whom my eldest sister had been married
in 1861. In settlement with the company this gentleman had
received as part payment a block of stock, which with other
purchases gave him control and ultimately entire ownership of this
franchise and property. This stock represented not only the very
considerable amount of money involved in construction, but a
claim to a large and valuable grant of public lands contiguous to
the road-bed, which were, however, subject to litigation for
forfeiture. In the effort to complete the work he had begun the
owner became financially embarrassed. The four years' war and
the ten years of plunder by the reconstruction carpet-bag
government after peace was declared had paralyzed all public
enterprises, and in this period so much of the work had been
destroyed by the elements that it was almost like building the road
anew. Before he was half-way through, his means had been
exhausted, and in a time of money stringency and panic he was
unable to borrow the amount needed to save him from utter
financial ruin. In his extremity he and my sister turned to me as
their last hope. With their distressing letter came a copy of the
sheriff's printed notice of sale under judgment, and I had to act
quickly, for I could not sit still and see those so near and dear to
me lose all they possessed without an effort to save them.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth384" n="384"/>
          <p>Unfortunately, I did not have the money required, and I knew
only one human being to whom I could turn for help. I went at
once to the late David J. Garth, one of the noblest of men, who,
successful in affairs, had then retired from business. I had had
the great good fortune to be employed as his family physician
soon after I came to New York, and we had already formed a
strong and lasting friendship. I laid the case before him, and
asked him to lend me the money needed. It was to me then a
very large sum. When he asked me what collateral I had to offer,
I told him none but his faith in my integrity and ability. To this
astonishing proposition he smilingly replied, “I reckon you'll have
to have it.” That afternoon, with a package of bonds under his
arm, he and I presented ourselves to Mr. Case, cashier of the
Second National Bank, then located at Twenty-third Street and
Fifth Avenue, and I took the train that night for Alabama with a
certified check to my order.</p>
          <p>For the first and, I may add, for the last time in my life, with
but one exception, I was now in debt, and the situation was not
agreeable. My father had impressed me early with the
importance of owing no man. On one occasion, having effected
an arrangement with the keeper of a candy-shop, whereby when
temporarily short of cash I could satisfy a craving for sweets and
pay the bill at my convenience, I offered father a share. As he
placed it in his mouth he asked me how much I had paid for it,
and when I replied I had bought it on credit he spat it out, handed
me back the remainder, and, after reproving me quite severely
for such reprehensible conduct he gave me the amount to cancel
my indebtedness; and from that day to this, with the exception of
borrowing this money to save a friend, I have owed no man.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth385" n="385"/>
          <p>When I arrived at Attalla, and went carefully into the matter of
the impending sale, I became convinced that certain
very radical changes were essential, and, determining upon
these, I made it a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">sine qua non</foreign></hi> 
that all the stock and complete
control of the entire property should be legally turned over to me
by transfer on the company's books. This being done, I satisfied
the judgment and became the owner of a railroad. I had heard the
story of the man who took an elephant as security for a loan,
and who ever after had a great deal more of elephant than he
wanted. During many a wakeful hour for the next twelvemonth
I gave that man my sympathy. I went at once to my dear
father, who was still president of this road, and said: “This
failure of the old company as at present organized has
naturally caused a want of confidence in its ability
to finance and build the railroad. A change is necessary. I want
you to resign and let me elect a new board, to include some New
York capitalists and men of influence in the place where we will
have to go for money.”</p>
          <p>He agreed with me heartily, called a meeting, resigned, and the
new board went into office at once. One year and two months
thereafter, in an office in Wall Street, after
paying off every indebtedness and returning to my good friend
the loan at the Second National Bank, I turned over all the
remainder to Mr. Carlisle. In the final settlement with the
purchaser, Major John W. Thomas, President of the Nashville,
Chattanooga&amp; St. Louis Railway Co., I secured
the transfer of the land claim to the former owner, my
sister's husband, the legality of whose title was ultimately
confirmed by the Supreme Court of the United
States. The property (not including the railroad and its
franchise) which was thus saved is now valued at, and is
<pb id="wyeth386" n="386"/>
well worth, a million dollars. The happiness it gave me to carry
this transaction to a satisfactory issue more than compensated
for the worry and anxiety and loss of time from my professional
work which it involved, for all of which I received no direct
compensation.</p>
          <p>It is said that revenge is sweet and that time will bring the
opportunity to all who wait. Many years after this incident was
closed my dear old friend Mr. Garth became
in his turn temporarily embarrassed in a large real-estate deal in
Westchester County. He naturally came to borrow from me, and
this time I smiled and said, “I reckon you'll have to have it.” He
lived to be very nearly ninety years old, and at his death, in 1912,
left an ample fortune. As a token of his love for me he added a
codicil to his will in favor of the Polyclinic Hospital.</p>
          <lb/>
          <p>In 1890 I attended the International Surgical Congress in
Berlin, and incidentally revisited Carlsbad, the most attractive
watering-place and “cure” I have ever seen. I recall little of the
congress as far as its scientific work was concerned, but can
never forget an incident in the vast dining-hall, where between
five hundred and a thousand surgeons were feasting. Professors
W. W. Keen, John B. Roberts, Robert F. Weir, and I were
seated together at one of the large tables, our neighbors being
seemingly from all the other nations of the civilized world. As the
bands played the various national airs the representatives of the
country in evidence would, as soon as the music ceased, show
their patriotic approval by hand-clapping or bravos or a series of
huzzas, none of which seemed to me sufficiently enthusiastic or
demonstrative. Keen was naturally anxious with the rest of our
four to get ahead of our
<pb id="wyeth387" n="387"/>
foreign brethren, and we agreed that when the “Star-spangled
Banner” was rendered, as the last strain floated away in the air
we would stand in our chairs and give them the rebel yell. Keen
and Weir had both served in the Union army during the War, and
heard that indescribable wild Comanche chorus which was the
vocal part of the Southern onslaught, and which, like</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>The war-note of Lochiel, which Albyn's hills</l>
            <l>Have heard, and heard, too, have her Saxon foes,</l>
          </lg>
          <p>fitted in effectively with the rolling kettle-drum sound of
thousands of rifles at work, and with the accompaniment of the
short, explosive booms of artillery. Roberts, who would have
heard it in war-times had he been old enough, said he would
follow. When the moment came the inspiring music had caught
the audience and they were ripe for our demonstration, for when
we stood up so conspicuously in our chairs, wildly waving our
napkins and yelling that awful yell, our neighbors climbed into
theirs, took up the chorus, and the whole throng went mad about
it and wouldn't stop until the “Star-spangled Banner” and the rebel
yell had received three encores. I felt as if the Southern
Confederacy had again saved the Union.</p>
          <p>In 1890 I made public my operations for the “Bloodless
Amputation at the Hip-joint,” which created quite a stir in the
surgical world. Nine years before the author of the principal
text-book in use in American colleges said that amputation at the hip
was “properly regarded as the greatest operation in surgery.” The
death-rate in the Civil War was ninety-three per cent., and in civil
practice after the War from forty to fifty of every hundred died.
The method introduced by me, and generally accepted by
surgeons the
<pb id="wyeth388" n="388"/>
world over, has reduced the mortality to between six and eight
per cent. I received a number of invitations to demonstrate the
operation publicly, and this was done in the amphitheater of the
Jefferson Medical College at Philadelphia in 1891, by Professor
W. W. Keen and myself, before the largest gathering I had
ever seen at a surgical clinic. In reporting this case this eminent
surgeon said, “It was reserved for an American surgeon to
devise what is undoubtedly the best method, and, in fact, that
which I think we can now call the only method of hemostasis in
amputation at the hip-joint.”</p>
          <p>In the <hi rend="italics">Annals of Surgery</hi> for September, 1895, Dr. John
F. Erdmann reports eighteen hip-joint amputations done
in seven of the leading hospitals in New York City within
ten years. Seven of these were done by my method, and
all recovered, while the death-rate in the remaining cases
by the other method was over seventy-two per cent. My
“Bloodless Amputation at the Shoulder-joint” had been
made public in 1889. In that year a colored woman came
to my clinic, her trouble being a malignant growth (sarcoma)
of the shoulder, requiring amputation at this joint. The
tumor was situated so near the joint that I was afraid she
would bleed to death or run great risk if I followed any of
the older methods of amputation. It then occurred to me
that I could use the cumulative pressure of a section of
elastic rubber tubing over the shoulder-blade and collarbone,
and occlude all the vessels going to and from the arm.
As the shoulder-joint would represent the end of a truncated
cone, when the bone was removed and the arm amputated,
the tube, if not held in place, would roll off in the direction
of least resistance. I then thought of transfixion with the
two mattress-needles to hold it in place. The arm was
<pb id="wyeth389" n="389"/>
emptied of blood by the Esmarch bandage, and, with the above
method carried out, the operation was practically bloodless, and
the patient recovered. While doing this the idea of disarticulation
at the hip came into my mind, and in a few months an Episcopal
minister from Alabama came to me with a sarcoma of the thigh,
requiring amputation at the hip, and the method worked perfectly.</p>
          <p>This discovery spread my reputation more than anything else I
had done, and yet in my opinion the good it has accomplished and
will accomplish in the years to come does not compare with the
ligation of the external carotid artery, an operation which my
prize essays established in 1878. I felt much gratification in the
fact that these innovations were made from the Polyclinic. The
operation was made public at the meeting of the American
Medical Association in Nashville in 1890, and in October of that
year I made the demonstration in the amphitheater in which I
heard my first lecture as a medical student. I went thither to
deliver by invitation an address on medical education before the
Mississippi Valley Medical Association, which met that year in
Louisville. I had not visited my <hi rend="italics">alma mater</hi> since my graduation,
twenty-one years before, and the reception given me in this
hospitable city was more than I had hoped for. I met on the
occasion of this visit the renowned Colonel Henry Watterson,
editor of the <hi rend="italics">Courier Journal</hi>, one of the most entertaining and
delightful gentlemen it has ever been my good fortune to know.
My old teacher, Professor David Yandell, held a reception at his
beautiful residence. The crowd soon filled the house and
overflowed into a large marquee in the grounds. I had not seen
the host since I was graduated in 1869, and several fellow-alumni
suggested that we play a trick on the dear old surgeon,
who, we might
<pb id="wyeth390" n="390"/>
have known, “was not born in the night-time.” I took my place in
the line filing up to shake hands, and if necessary be introduced,
the others in the conspiracy standing near enough to hear our
conversation. I did not give him my name as I took his hand, and
he said, “You have the advantage of me,” to which I replied,
“Professor, I am Jim Smith, one of your old pupils from Breathitt
County” (said to be the county in Kentucky where every one
makes and executes his own law). But we were hoist on our
own petard, for in an instant his handsome face lit up as he put
his arms around me and said, loud enough to shock everybody
about us: “No, you're not. By God, you're John!”</p>
          <p>Among the classmates who laughed loudest at the failure of
our ruse was Dr. Sam Manly, and I recalled to those present an
incident which occurred in 1869, in which he had deservedly met
discomfiture. We were calling on the professors to pay our
respects before leaving for our homes. The teacher in physiology,
one of the most scholarly and dignified members of the faculty, was
so very deaf he could not hear without using a trumpet—and this he
did not adjust for the ordinary exchange of civilities, such as saying
“good-by.” As we stood around the sideboard (for this was in
Kentucky), glass in hand to drink his health, Sam, intending to
excite our mirth and embarrass us at the expense of the dear old
deaf professor, and without any thought
of disrespect, said, “Here's at you, you bald-headed old
vacuum!” Before we could even smile at his impertinence,
the polite host replied, bowing and touching Sam's glass with his,
“The same to you, sir, the same to you!”</p>
          <p>The <hi rend="italics">Century Magazine</hi> published in 1891 the narrative of my
life as a prisoner of war, and it stirred up a hornet's nest
among the bloody-shirt politicians, who had no idea of
<pb id="wyeth391" n="391"/>
admitting that there was a moral to the legend of the shield which
had two sides. The article was written as an historical
contribution in the spirit of reconciliation, and it contained nothing
that I did not know to be true and susceptible of proof. At one
time feeling ran so high on this account that I had to forego an
address upon a scientific topic I had agreed to make at the
invitation of the Indiana State Medical Association at
Indianapolis. Happily, the facts as set forth were established and
accepted; and at a subsequent meeting of this association I was
their guest and was presented by its members with a beautiful
and valued memorial.</p>
          <p>There was published in <hi rend="italics">Harper's Magazine</hi>, 
in 1892, my article
on the “Struggle for Oregon,” written chiefly from the diary of
Nathaniel J. Wyeth, a cousin of my father's. In 1831-36 this brave
and enterprising man, foreseeing the future of the Oregon
country, the ownership of which was then in dispute, fitted out at
his own expense an expedition which he led across the continent,
having sent a ship-load of supplies around “the Horn.” This ship
was wrecked; a number of the men with him were killed by
Indians; others died or deserted; and he reached his destination
the sole survivor. He made the return trip with two Indian guides,
wintered in the Big Horn Mountains, and in the spring, in a boat
made of buffalo-hides, moving only by night through the vast
territory of the Blackfeet and Sioux Indians, reached civilization.
Nothing daunted, he organized a second expedition, which he
established where now stands the great city of Portland. He died
too early to see the realization of his great dream, but his was the
soul of the pioneer; he was of my father's family and kind, and I
felt I owed it to him to have history record that he was of that
brave and
<pb id="wyeth392" n="392"/>
enterprising few who opened the doors of the great Northwest
to his countrymen.</p>
          <p>At the Milwaukee meeting of the American Medical
Association in 1893 I was elected first vice-president. At one of
the sessions, after the reading of a paper on appendicitis by the
distinguished Professor Nicholas Senn, as I was not on the
printed programme for the discussion, the chairman did not call
upon me, much to my satisfaction, as I had arrived late and had
not heard the entire paper. There were many of my former
pupils and other friends present, and these began to
call for me by name. As I did not respond, a strapping big
fellow from Chicago, justly eminent in the domain of urology but less
so elsewhere, arose and held forth on appendicitis. It so happened
that I had taken a seat by a lady member, and when my Chicago
substitute finished and sat down she remarked to me “If that's the
best Dr. Wyeth can do, he'd better have kept still.” I replied, “I
think so, too.” However, I was not allowed to “sit still,” and when
I sat down after saying that I had unfortunately not heard the
paper and did not feel competent to discuss it, my new-found
friend and I became better acquainted.</p>
          <p>I began in 1895 my <hi rend="italics">Life of Lieutenant-General Nathan
Bedford Forrest</hi>. From the beginning of the war he had been my
hero, just as Marion was of the Revolution. I read with avidity of
his great exploits, his hand-to-hand combats at Monterey, his
refusal to surrender, and the escape of his
entire command at Fort Donelson, when all could have
marched away had they been as determined and fearless
as he; of Shiloh, where he rode in among Sherman's
infantry, who jabbed bayonets at him and his bold troopers
and shot him through and through as he sabered them right
<pb id="wyeth393" n="393"/>
and left; of his capture of everybody and everything at
Murfreesboro; the swarth of destruction he cut in Grant's
rear in west Tennessee during Christmas of 1862-63; and
the pursuit and capture of Straight's raiders, probably the
most wonderful feat of the Civil War.</p>
          <p>When I enlisted in his old regiment the men who had served
with him never ceased to sing his praise, and I watched closely
his marvelous career until the war was over. When I learned of
his great poverty in early life; of his many struggles to support his
widowed mother and a large family of children, of which he was
the eldest; that he was wholly uneducated; that he had enlisted in
the war as a private with a musket on his shoulder and had come
out of it as lieutenant-general, the second highest rank in the
Confederate army, I made a vow that, should he not be placed
right in history by the time I was fifty years old, I would
undertake to do it. It was now 1895, Forrest was dead, and had
not had justice done him, and I kept my promise. I bought an
extensive library of war literature, including every volume of the
official records of both the Union and Confederate armies, and
these I gleaned as I could find leisure from a very busy life.</p>
          <p>I hit upon a plan of gathering information which worked out
very satisfactorily. Along the left edge of a sheet of paper about
twenty inches square was printed in a two-inch column a
condensed sketch of Forrest and his operations. A full set of
these was mailed to every officer and private who had been with
him, whose name and address I could obtain, and to Union
officers as well. I requested all to fill in the blank spaces with
such facts as they were personally cognizant of. These were
filed away, and carefully scrutinized and tested by comparison
with and reference to the
<pb id="wyeth394" n="394"/>
official reports of both sides, made at the time and forwarded to
their respective departments. The volume was brought out in
1899, and rounded up a very busy period for the author. It so
happened that a new edition of my <hi rend="italics">Surgery</hi> was called for by the
Appletons, while the Harpers were hurrying the <hi rend="italics">Forrest</hi> into
print. Meanwhile, I was running my private hospital and practice
and attending to the exacting duties of senior professor of surgery
and manager of the Polyclinic. Like Sancho Panza, who
blessed the man who invented sleep, I blessed the discoverer of
the stenographer. For a while I kept three of these indispensable
agents at work, one with the <hi rend="italics">Surgery</hi>, another on the <hi rend="italics">Forrest</hi>,
and a third for miscellaneous correspondence; and, fortunately, I
brought both books out on time.</p>

THE AMERICAN MEDICAL ASSOCIATION—THE
MEDICAL SOCIETY OF THE STATE OF NEW
YORK—THE NEW YORK STATE MEDICAL
ASSOCIATION</head>
          <p>CERTAIN influential members of the Medical Society of the
State of New York, a society whose charter dated back almost
to colonial days, taking exception in 1880 to the code of ethics of
the American Medical Association—an organization of which each
state society was a component—brought about the secession of
the state from the national body. Thereupon other members,
equally influential but somewhat less numerous, believing that the
best interests of the profession and the public would be served by
keeping in affiliation with and helping to build up a stronger
organization throughout the United States, withdrew from the
society and formed themselves into the New York State Medical
Association.</p>
          <p>The two hostile camps created an unfortunate situation. The
regular medical profession, in its warfare against quackery and
ignorance and malpractice, needed to be a solid body with a
united front. For twenty years in the Empire State it was as a
divided house, and, although it did not fall, it was leaning over so
far that the enemies of progress in medical affairs smiled in their
sleeves at the tottering structure. The only redeeming feature of
this deplorable situation was that the doctors at variance were
acting from conviction
<pb id="wyeth396" n="396"/>
and had no axes to grind. It was the old, old story of the shield with
its two sides, and the difficulty was to induce the tilting knights of the
spatula and scalpel to study carefully the other side. There was not
a time in all this unhappy controversy over questions of ethics
when a compromise could not have been effected. The code of
ethics was a sort of medical family Bible, setting forth some very
strict rules of conduct, all of which even those who stood out for
them didn't always follow. There was a middle and a safe way,
and it fell to my lot to be of service in finding the path which led
to a united profession.</p>
          <p>I was intensely loyal to the American Medical Association.
From the beginning of my medical career I realized that it was
only by building up a national association, which would not only be
strong numerically, but by attracting to its membership the men of
attainment and influence, would be strong politically, that the
much-needed reforms could be effected. I had joined the state
association at the start, attended the meetings, taken part in the
scientific sessions, but had never held any office or taken any
part in its management. To my surprise, while this body was
holding its meeting in New York City in the fall of 1900, Dr. E.
Elliot Harris, prominent in its affairs, called on me with a proffer
for the nomination for the presidency. I saw at once the
opportunity to attempt to reunite the profession in the state, and I
told Harris that I would accept the office
if I could be assured by those influential in the organization that
they would help to bring about a compromise with the society,
which might result in a reunion with the members of both bodies
in the national association. They held a meeting, gave me this
assurance, and I was elected president.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth397" n="397"/>
          <p>Relying upon the integrity, loyalty, and the extraordinary ability
of Dr. Harris, I met him several times, and we finally formulated
a plan which we proceeded to carry out. Our first move was the
inauguration of an active campaign for increasing the membership
of the association, and in doing this we organized new bodies in
counties where none had existed. Meetings were held all over the
state, attractive papers were read by our most eminent men, and
a great many new members were obtained. In two counties we
won over to the association the regular society organizations.
When the movement was at its height I called on the leaders of
the society and found them ready to listen to our overtures. While
this was pending the profession throughout the United States,
having learned of what was being attempted in the Empire State,
showed their approval by electing me President of the American
Medical Association at the St. Paul meeting in June, 1901, and at
the request of the New York delegation the next annual meeting
of the national organization was held at Saratoga in 1902. To this
meeting all the members of the society were invited, and the
work of fraternization went bravely on. Among the prominent
physicians of the state who lent invaluable aid at this juncture was
my friend and former partner in the college quiz, Professor
Joseph D. Bryant. In order finally to complete the fusion certain
legal steps became necessary. Dr. Bryant, already prominent in
public as well as professional affairs, took charge, and with his
usual tact and skill carried the reunion to a successful conclusion.</p>
          <p>The American Medical Association has become the largest
and most powerful medical organization in the world. It
represents more than one hundred thousand practitioners in the
United States, has not only a working organization
<pb id="wyeth398" n="398"/>
in every state and territory, but in every congressional district
and in nearly every county. It publishes a weekly journal, which
has a wide circulation, and in addition possesses large means in
property and money. Its labors have resulted in the elevation of
the standard of requirements, not only for entering a medical
college, but for graduation and practice, and it has done much to
uncommercialize medical education by compelling every college
to come into the control of a recognized university. Coupled with
the honors received from my fellow-members of the profession
came, in 1902, an honorary degree of LL.D from the university of
my native state, and a vote of appreciation jointly
to Dr. J. Marion Sims and myself by its legislature.</p>

ITALY AND THE GREAT ST. BERNARD—THE BONAPARTE
TRAlL—MARENGO</head>
          <p>TO Naples in 1904 by way of the Azores and Gibraltar was one
of the most restful and enjoyable sea trips I have made. On the
fourteenth day out we landed in this dirtiest and most interesting
of European cities. Vesuvius, the most accessible of active
volcanoes, is an awe-inspiring demonstration of the tremendous
heat-energy which—like the rolled steel of a boiler—the earth's crust
is holding in. Now and then in some thin, weaker spot the shell
gives way, and the lava and other products of combustion boil up
from the depths. Where once was a level plain a huge truncated
cone now lifts its summit four thousand feet above the sea. No
one who stands upon the edge of that frightful hole in the ground
can ever forget it. It is so large in circumference that a forty-acre
field could be dropped flat into it, and so deep that the eye cannot
measure down to the red-hot lake of lava which is boiling and
hissing and smoking, and through which at frequent intervals
explosions occur which shake the mountain to its base and shoot
far above the crater vast quantities of pumice-stone and ashes. It
was one of these outbreaks in A.D. 79 that buried Herculaneum,
five or six miles from the crater, far beneath the outpouring lava,
and smothered Pompeii, still farther away, for ages under a
shower of ashes from thirty to forty feet deep.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth400" n="400"/>
          <p>A few years after my visit the streets and housetops of
Naples, ten miles distant, were so covered with ashes that the
roofs had to be swept from time to time to keep the accumulating
weight from crushing them in. These titanic eruptions or
explosions have been due, as I believe, to the sudden influx of
vast quantities of water through fissures communicating with the
bottom of the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
          <p>In going toward the crater on the cog-wheel railway I made at
least one very interesting observation. Near the top, running here
and there in the ashes and cinders or dust, I noticed a number of
small lizards not unlike those so common in northern Alabama.
As their habitat was fully three-quarters of a mile above the limit
of vegetation, I was wondering how they subsisted. When we
left the car and began the climb to the crater on foot or by the
chair-bearers I noticed lying in the warm ashes a number of
insects, lady-bugs, potato-bugs, and one or two larger insects
very much like our June-bugs of the South. Some were dead,
others still living; and one of these we caught and kept alive for
several days and brought home. These accounted for the
presence of the little salamanders who found here their prey, not
only easily caught, but more or less cooked.</p>
          <p>When the volcano fires one of its big charges the immense
volume of hot gases, etc., shooting upward a mile or more in
height creates a powerful suction into which the air around the
side and base of the mountain is drawn. These various insects
disporting themselves on the wing among the rich vegetation on
the lower mountainside are caught in the suction of this
mælstrom, and when partially asphyxiated, or killed by the gas or
heat, they fold their small wings and drop in the ashes, where
their coming is awaited by the lizards.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth401" n="401"/>
          <p>In the museum at Pompeii the most interesting exhibit
contained a number of crude surgical instruments, one of which
was of a shape to suggest the famous Sims speculum. Others
were so suggestive of torture that I was thankful that I practised
surgery in the age of anesthesias.</p>
          <p>In Naples I made note of two things which are not mentioned
in my books of travel. One was the absence of bits in the horses'
mouths. Attached to a strong headstall was a heavy band of
leather which went around the nose and lower jaw just above the
corners of the mouth. Fastened to this, and projecting about six
inches on either side, was an iron spike with a ring at the tip, and
the bridle-rein or driving-line was attached to this. It answered
every purpose, and is a humane substitute for the cruel metal bit
which we in America employ without mercy. The other was a
clever demonstration of the value of the conservation of energy.
On a two-wheeled cart, drawn by a diminutive donkey, led by a
diminutive youth, was arranged a stall, and snugly fitted into this
stood a huge, fine cow being hauled on the rounds to her patrons.
The water in the milk bought by a Neapolitan housewife is there
only <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">per vias naturales</foreign></hi>, 
for she stands by and watches the youth
as he transfers his energies from the donkey's head to the cow's
tail, and squats squarely behind to milk between the legs. This is
the millionaire's milk-wagon. The goats furnish the others.
Passing along one of the alleys, I followed one of these
milk-dealers playing away on his woodland reed and driving a small
flock of goats. When we overtook the procession it had halted, and
the goatherd and a woman were in a violent altercation over half
a glass of milk, she swearing she would never pay for the inch of
foam on top, and he calling the Virgin Mary to witness that that
foam was milk!</p>
          <pb id="wyeth402" n="402"/>
          <p>It was not until I had traveled for a month or two in Italy that I
understood why so many of her brown-tanned sons were willing
to exile themselves from such a beautiful country. They were
looking for work, for Italy is the land of holidays. The judgment
of the Americans in our party was that in Naples none but
foreigners went to bed at night. The natives slept all day and
twanged stringed instruments and sang melodious nocturnes and
other arias until dawn. In their charming language that verse in
the twentieth chapter of Exodus which reads, “Six days shalt thou
labor and do all thy work,” has found no place.</p>
          <p>From the early days of youth, when I read and read again in my
favorite Childe Harold:</p>
          <lg type="stanza">
            <l>Oh, Rome! my country, city of the soul;</l>
            <l>The orphans of the heart must turn to Thee,</l>
            <l>Lone Mother of dead Empires!</l>
          </lg>
          <p>I longed to see the Rome of Byron. When I came away the city
of the soul was a phantom city, a mirage, a nightmare. I saw and
still see that marvelous sculpture, “The Gladiator,” the eternal
protest of the human heart against the thousands “butchered to
make a Roman holiday.” I saw the wild beasts crouching and
springing on their helpless victims in the arena, while the vast
crowd of civilized savages looked down from the amphitheater of
the Coliseum, untouched by pity at the awful scene; I saw trailing
in chains in the dust of Cæsar's triumphal chariot the brave,
the noble, the vanquished but still unconquered Vincengetorix, and
then great Cæsar himself stabbed in the back by his trusted
friends! This was Rome's boasted civilization—the quintessence of
cruelty, the refinement of barbarism. Her history is written in blood.</p>
          <p>From Pisa, Rapallo, Milano, Venice, and the lakes we

<pb id="wyeth403" n="403"/>
wandered to Novara, a quaint and most attractive old city, so far
out of the beaten path of travel that few Americans discover it. I
would not have known of it but for my study of Bonaparte's
campaign, for this was one of his towns, and I had come to lead
an expedition of my own over the Alps by the Great St. Bernard
Pass, the route the First Consul followed when he came down in
the rear of the Austrians and fought the battle of Marengo.</p>
          <p>There was train-passage to Ivrea, at the mouth of the Valley of
Aosta, and up this valley to the village with the same name. At
Aosta the two routes from the Rhone Valley, one by the Little,
the other by the Great St. Bernard Pass, unite. Over the former
Hannibal came with his train of elephants in October, two
thousand years before Bonaparte marched down the other in
May, 1800. Half-way up the Alps we drove by wagon to the
hamlet of San Remy, where the road then ended, and there we
bivouacked for the night. The next day, with six mules and a
guide to lead each animal along the trail, our party reached the
Hospice just at dark.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref58" n="58" rend="sc" target="note58">1</ref></p>
          <p>On the way up, rounding one of the many short turns in the
wide path upon the precipitous point of a crag, standing out in
sharp outline against the sky, as fixed and as motionless as if cast
in bronze, was a mountain-goat or chamois, evidently on sentry
duty. Scattered among the boulders in the distance, his mates
were browsing on the scant Alpine vegetation. We snapped him
with our kodak before he leaped down and disappeared.</p>
          <note id="note58" n="58" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref58">1 
The Swiss government many years ago completed an excellent wagon-road 
from the Rhone Valley to the Hospice. The Italian government has gradually 
extended the wagon-road from Aosta northward, the terminal now being at St. 
Remy. At immense expense this government was building a magnificent 
wagon-road from St. Remy to the Hospice, which was to be open for 
conveyances in 1905. Both governments have planted in several places great 
mines of dynamite to make this route impassable if need be.</note>
          <pb id="wyeth404" n="404"/>
          <p>As we approached the highest point of the Great St. Bernard
we came upon a second custom-house, which belongs to the
Swiss government. The sun was just setting when we rounded a
bend in the trail and came suddenly upon the lake, which belongs
to the monastery, and across this beautiful body of clear water
appeared the great white Hospice, from which a pack of huge St.
Bernard dogs came bounding over the rocks, barking as deeply
and fiercely as if they intended to devour us rather than offer us
the welcome and rescue which legends say they are accustomed
to make. The myth of the St. Bernard dog with the little cask of
wine tied about his neck fades away like many others of its kind
when one gets close to the facts. In stormy weather now the
pious pilgrim on his or her way to the holy city can find shelter in
one of the numerous telephone booths along the route, and do
without the dogs by ringing up “Central.”</p>
          <p>Though the Hospice of the Brothers of St. Bernard is for many
days and all of the nights of the year a cold and cheerless place,
the welcome of these devout priests is none the less warm. They
greet you when you come, give you without charge shelter and
food, and take no note of your going. In the chapel of the
monastery there is an iron chest, or alms-box, of generous size, in
which those who accept their hospitality may of their own accord
and unseen drop their contributions to the support of this noble
charity; and while many of the poor who make this pilgrimage on
foot accept food and shelter as a charity, I cannot but believe that
practically all who pass this way and have means give enough to
make up for the shortcomings of the less fortunate. In any event,
from this or other sources the Hospice and the brothers are
supported, and they prosper and have prospered for hundreds
of years.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth405" n="405"/>
          <p>Sunk in the wall of this chapel is a tablet 
(<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="it">basso-relievo</foreign></hi>)
which represents the death-scene of Desaix, the real hero of
Marengo, who upon that memorable day saved Bonaparte from
seemingly irretrievable disaster and, falling in the moment of
victory with a bullet in his heart, made the Empire possible to
Napoleon.</p>
          <p>As one enters the Hospice one reads, in a most conspicuous
place, in bold, gilt letters on a slab of black marble, this
apotheosis: “<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">Napoleoni Primo 
Francorum Imperatori Semper
Augusto Republicoe Volescanoe Restauratori Semper Optimo
Egyptico Bis Italico Semper Invicto. In Monte Jovis et Sempronii

MDCCCIV.</foreign></hi>”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref59" n="59" rend="sc" target="note59">1</ref></p>
          <p>In a spacious room near by one of the priests showed us the
library and museum, in which among other subjects of interest are
numerous relics of the Temple of Jupiter, built upon this spot by
Julius and Augustus Cæsar, destined to stand as a pagan shelter
for wayfarers for a thousand years, and then to be razed and
replaced by a Christian Hospice, in which pilgrims to Rome and
other wanderers might rest, and from this room I learned the
history of Bernard de Menthon, later St. Bernard. Born in 923
A.D., son of a peer of France, educated for a worldly and
ambitious career, he was, by his parents, contracted in marriage
to a beautiful, wealthy, and accomplished daughter of a noble
family. Having determined to devote his life to the church, he fled
across the Alps in order to escape this marriage and hid himself
in Aosta. Here, in the ministration of his priesthood,
<note id="note59" n="59" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref59">1 I venture this clumsy translation: “The grateful Republic of Valais to Napoleon
the First, Ever Majestic Emperor of the French, Ever Most Excellent Rebuilder of
the Republic of Valais, Ever Unvanquished Conqueror
of Egypt and Twice of Italy, Ever to be borne in mind on the Mountain of Jupiter
and of Sempronius. December 11, 1804.”</note>
<pb id="wyeth406" n="406"/>
he became acquainted with the depredations of the robber
bands that infested the mountain-passes, exacting tribute from
rich pilgrims and practising cruel and often fatal torture upon
those too poor to secure their ransom. Against these the brave
and pious Bernard led a successful crusade, destroying the
Temple of Jupiter, erecting in its stead the Hospice, which to this
day bears his name. After his death at Novara, in 1007, in his
eighty-fourth year, he was buried there, then canonized; and in
1123 his body was exhumed and his bones and teeth divided
among various churches as venerable relics.</p>
          <p>All this and much more, not omitting a recital of the miracles
done either by the living or in the name of the dead and sainted
Bernard—of plague of grasshoppers stayed; of floods made to
recede; of storms abated, epidemics arrested; of the judgment of
fire visited upon the wicked; of devils cast out; of the deaf made
to hear, the dumb to speak, the lame made to walk; of one much
younger and yet as sonless as Sarah, for whom hope deferred
had made the heart sick, and for whom the holy man interceded,
not altogether in vain, although he was not spared to witness the
fruition of his work, for this Isaac came not into the world until
after the holy man had left it; and of other miracles, forty-six in
all, equally wonderful—until the hour was late, and the good
brothers, seeing we were tired and sleepy pilgrims, showed us
their best rooms, which they assured us the Prince of Wales had
once occupied, and in their clean and cold—oh, so cold!—beds
we slept the sleep of the just, undisturbed by dreams of miracles or
of princes and kings, of marching hosts, of cannon dragged in
hollowed trees, or of the barking of the St. Bernard dogs, until at
six o'clock our courier banged upon the door to announce that
breakfast
<pb id="wyeth407" n="407"/>
was ready, the carriage waiting to convey us to Martigny in
the Rhone Valley, and that it would take us seven hours to catch
the east-bound train for Zermatt.</p>
          <p>This excursion along the Bonaparte trail, and a study of the
grand Italian campaign which practically ended at Marengo,
dispelled more than one boyhood illusion. Reading Abbott's
<hi rend="italics">Napoleon</hi>, one is led to believe this crossing of the Alps with an
army was one of the most difficult and dangerous feats in human
history, scarcely possible to any except a Hannibal and a
Bonaparte! The truth is, there was not a single natural obstacle
which was not easily and safely overcome, and there was no
excuse for losing a man or a wheel if ordinary care was
exercised.</p>
          <p>From Martigny, on the banks of the Rhone in Switzerland
(which Napoleon used as his base of supplies), to Ivrea, in the
valley of Piedmont, is approximately ninety miles.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref60" n="60" rend="sc" target="note60">1</ref> To the
Hospice on the summit of the Great St. Bernard notch is thirty
miles, and for the greater part of the way there was then a good
wagon-road. For about six miles on either side of the notch, or
pass, there was a trail from four to six feet in width, in many
places too narrow for the passage of wagons, but under ordinary
precautions at the season when these troops marched over, late
in May, 1800, perfectly safe for the transportation of men and
materials of war. The ascent from Martigny along the valley of
the Dranse to Orsières is not more than one hundred feet to the
mile. Thence to Liddes, five miles farther up, the grade is nearly
three hundred feet to the mile, while from this point to the summit
of the Great St. Bernard it is a little over three hundred and forty
feet to the mile. As far as the
<note id="note60" n="60" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref60">1 Martigny is 1,560 feet above the level of the sea, and at its highest
point the Great St. Bernard pass is 8,108 feet.</note>
<pb id="wyeth408" n="408"/>
ascent was concerned this section gave the French army the
greatest difficulty. With all of this, however, Napoleon
had practically nothing to do, since Lannes, leading the
advance column, had passed over and into Italy before
Napoleon joined the army, and everything was in readiness for the
rapid passage of the main column. It was Gassendi, inspector of
ordnance, who conceived the idea of placing the cannon on sleds
and hollowed-out logs, which the men and animals dragged along
the narrower parts of the trail. The most precipitous part of the old
Napoleon trail is that which is still used and leads from the
Hospice to San Remy, about five miles away, the descent being
about six hundred feet to the mile. From San Remy to Aosta,
thirteen miles, it becomes more gradual and is not more than two
hundred and fifty feet to the mile, and in 1800 it was wide enough
for the transportation of wagons and artillery.</p>
          <p>As an example of the exaggerated accounts of this passage
the following is quoted: “During the summer this passage is not
much less difficult and dangerous. At about two hundred paces
below the convent is situated a lake, the depth of which is not
known, and which is scarcely ever thawed. The snow collects
there in heaps, and covers in such a manner the frozen surface
of these passages that travelers often slide under it without being
able to avoid it. This happened to the Consul more than once
while he was coming to join us.” The author describes in one
place how admirably Napoleon performed the remarkable feat of
sliding two hundred feet down the side of the mountain on the seat
of his trousers. Further he says: “The cold upon this mountain is
excessive, even in the middle of summer. No herb or green leaf
to offer a pleasing verdure. In summer as well as in winter many
people perish among these almost
<pb id="wyeth409" n="409"/>
inaccessible rocks. At the time we crossed them the chapel was
filled with dead bodies which the dogs had discovered under the
snow”!</p>
          <p>When I was there the lake was not only free from ice, but it
was as clear and transparent as any lake in the tropics. While the
sun was shining the weather was so excessively warm that
walking up the mountain brought up memories of Broadway in
June. The monks in the monastery keep a large herd of cows,
which in this season are driven to graze on the slopes within
sight. The sound of the bells of these cows could be heard all
through the night from the Hospice.</p>
          <p>Bourrienne, secretary to Bonaparte, says: “I never left him for
a moment during the ascent. We encountered no personal
danger and escaped with no other inconvenience than excessive
fatigue. The rapid descent greatly amused us.”</p>
          <p>Two thousand years earlier, Hannibal, with an army greater
than Napoleon's, with much cavalry and a transportation train of
elephants, in October (a season of the year so cold that he was
snowed in and could not move for three days) made the passage
of the Little St. Bernard, the route over which joins the
Bonaparte trail in the valley of Aosta. It is known that the armies
of Rome often traversed this route centuries before the rule of
Constantine, who as early as 339 A.D. expended much time and
treasure in improving it as a thoroughfare. One hundred years
later Attila led his horde of Magyars over this pass when he
descended to the gates of Rome. In 773 Bernard, uncle of
Charlemagne, marched his troops over into Italy, and in 1515
Francis I. passed this way with his army. Even in the Italian
campaigns of 1798 and 1799 the French and Austrian armies
<pb id="wyeth410" n="410"/>
used this trail, and it is an illustration of the methods employed
by Bonaparte to exaggerate the importance of his own
achievements, that at the same time he was following
Lannes over the Great St. Bernard Pass four of his lieutenants
were performing feats of the same character equal to if not more
difficult than his. Turreau, with five thousand men, passed over
the Alps by the Mont Cenis route, standing off and eluding a
guard of an equal number of Austrians who attempted to check
him at the head of the valley of the Dora Riparia; Chabran,
following the route of Hannibal, crossed the Little St. Bernard
with five thousand men, and made good his junction with
Napoleon at Aosta before the latter at Fort Bard met the only
opposition to his advance; Moncey, with fifteen thousand men,
passed over the St. Gotthard, while a fourth column under
Bethencourt forced its way over the Simplon, beating off at
Bellinzona ten thousand Austrians sent to check his descent into
Piedmont.</p>
          <p>The column under the First Consul, forty-five thousand strong,
was held at bay for four days by five hundred Austrians who
defended Fort Bard, a delay which subsequent events proved
unnecessary, and might have proved disastrous had an able
and energetic general been in command of the Austrian army,
for Melas was fully cognizant of the movements of the French
troops across the Alps. Unable to dislodge the Austrians, the
entire French army passed unmolested over a side-path across
Mont Albaredo, a spur of the Italian Alps which juts out and
almost closes the valley of the Dora Baltea at Fort Bard, while
the artillery and wagon-train passed at night along the highway
immediately below the fort, which is perched high up on the
precipice. Notwithstanding the much-vaunted precaution
<pb id="wyeth411" n="411"/>
of wrapping straw around the wagon-wheels, the Austrians had
full knowledge of this movement in the darkness, but from
their elevated position could not bring their guns to bear upon
the train. The fort did not surrender until June 1st, after the entire
French army had passed beyond and had captured Ivrea at the
mouth of the Piedmont Valley.</p>
          <p>Napoleon Bonaparte was not only a great soldier, but a great
politician, and above all an actor. His often expressed conviction
was that to hold and move the masses one must appeal to the
imagination. With wonderful tact he had emerged unscathed
from the dangers of the French Revolution to find himself in 1800
in the center of the world's stage, playing with consummate skill
the leading rôle in a great and tragic epoch. No one better than
he and perhaps his gifted brother Lucien realized that he was
now at the crisis of his career, and not the least important part of
the programme of empire was the concealment of his mistakes
and failures and the exaggeration of his successful
achievements. The press agent at Paris was almost as important
as the soldier in the field, and Lucien proved himself an adept.
The echoes of the marvelous campaign of 1796-97 were never
for a moment permitted to die out. The expedition to Egypt
appealed to the imagination. Its whole conception was a mistake;
its execution, as far as Napoleon was concerned, nothing but a
series of blunders, and yet so carefully concealed or skilfully
glossed over that the general-in-chief, who, without order from his
government and with entire disregard of every honorable
sentiment or soldierly regard for his comrades, had deserted and
slipped away from them at night, was hailed as the hero of the
hour at Paris and welcomed as a conqueror. In the light of the
facts, which now are open to all, it almost challenges belief.
<pb id="wyeth412" n="412"/>
The only brilliant incident of this Egyptian campaign was
Kléber's victory at Heliopolis, after Bonaparte's defeat at Acre
and the disastrous retreat across the desert. With thirteen
thousand men, the remnant of the troops left in Egypt, he
defeated Youssef Pasha with a greatly superior force and
practically destroyed his army. And surely his lucky star was
over him at Marengo. If any general ever deserved defeat
Napoleon Bonaparte deserved it at Marengo; and, what is
more, he got it. That victory was won by Desaix and
Kellermann, in spite of the blunders of their commander, who
permitted himself to be surprised, all of his artillery but six pieces
captured, and his army beaten and driven in panic from the field.</p>
          <p>On the 8th of June, six days before the battle, the French
cavalry captured an Austrian courier with despatches which told
of Massena's surrender at Genoa, and put Bonaparte in full
possession of his enemy's plans. He knew that Ott, who had
been conducting the siege of Genoa, had, soon after Massena's
surrender, started June 6th to join Melas and Zach at Alesandria.
Notwithstanding this information, instead of concentrating his
army, he had left twenty-three thousand of his best troops so far
away that they were practically unavailable in case of disaster.
Even on the 13th of June, the day before he was attacked by
Melas at Marengo, he had only the division of Victor on the field.
Lannes was three miles away with his corps, while Desaix was
at Novi, in the direction of Genoa.</p>
          <p>C. Petit, who was present, and who cannot be considered in
any other light than an ardent worshiper at the shrine of
Napoleon, says: “In short, at four o'clock in the afternoon, I have
no hesitation in saying that in the line of five miles or more there
did not stand six thousand infantry to
<pb id="wyeth413" n="413"/>
their colors, and only six pieces of cannon could be made use of.”
At this time Napoleon was only saved from destruction by the
timely arrival of the devoted Desaix, who, after a wonderfully
rapid and fatiguing march with his corps, came on the field, and
with the aid of the younger Kellermann, who still held his cavalry
in hand, catching the Austrians in an unguarded moment when
they deemed their victory so complete that nothing was left but to
gather up the flying Frenchmen as they could overtake them,
broke through the Austrian line by a desperate assault,
overwhelmed one wing of their army, capturing a large number
of prisoners, and causing a panic in the remainder which left
Napoleon master of the field in one of the most surprising
victories of his strange career. The Empire was possible after
Marengo.</p>
          <p>Desaix, falling with a bullet through his heart in the moment of
victory, was the last of the brilliant trio to whom, after
Bonaparte, France might have looked for military leadership.
Marceau had fallen at Coblenz, and Hoche had perished from
disease.</p>

MIND-READING OR THOUGHT-TRANSFERENCE—THE
VALUE OF SUGGESTION—CHRISTIAN SCIENCE—THE
MIRACLES AT LOURDES—A MORMON EPISODE AND
OTHER EXPERIENCES</head>
          <p>THE training of the physician teaches him to observe quickly and to
“read between the lines.” Consciously or unconsciously, a great
many patients try to deceive themselves, and would deceive the
doctor were he not capable of looking beyond the subjective
symptoms. A single objective symptom, something seen or felt, is
often of more value in arriving at a diagnosis than a whole history
of the aches and pains and sensations submitted by the sufferers.
Dr. S. Wier Mitchell once told me of an experience which
illustrates this point. Spending a vacation on the Riviera, he was
seated in a small park apart from the crowd; he had been pointed
out, and was approached by a well-dressed stranger. The man
wore a light overcoat which was unbuttoned, and as he came
near the doctor observed in an inside pocket a cigar-case, from
which projected the ends of a dozen cigars of a brand he smoked
himself and knew to be very strong. The man said: “Dr. Mitchell,
I have come all the way from America to consult you. I am a sick
man, and—” Here the doctor interrupted him, saying, “Sit down, sit
down, I believe you,” and, feeling his pulse at the wrist for a few
seconds, he continued: “Yes, you are a sick man; you are killing
yourself with tobacco. How
<pb id="wyeth415" n="415"/>
many cigars do you smoke in a day?” and to his confession that
he smoked Henry Clays or some other strong cigar almost
incessantly he added: “Give up tobacco, and you will be a well
man.” The patient was profoundly impressed with the doctor's
quick reading of his pulse, believed in him, and was cured.</p>
          <p>One of my own experiences is somewhat akin to this. Spending
the summer near New York, I made it the rule to be in my office
in the city at a certain hour on two days of each week. As I was
nearing my door I noticed a man a few feet ahead of me who
turned to ring my bell. He had on a long frock-coat which fitted
well and wore a soft felt hat. At first glance I took him to be
from the South; but as he was pulling at the bell-knob, he having
not yet seen me, I noticed on the rim of one ear a well-marked
epithelioma, a form of cancer which occurs only after frostbite. I
then placed him from the Northwest, for his coat and hat were
not of the East. As I came up the stoop just behind him I said,
“You want to see Dr. Wyeth?” He turned quickly and said,
“Yes.” I continued in an off-hand manner as I was getting my key
into the lock and not looking toward him. “About that cancer?”
He said, “Yes.” “From the Northwest?” “Yes.” “Nebraska or
Iowa?” “Why? Iowa!” “What regiment did you serve in during
the war?” (He had a small Grand Army button on the lapel of his
coat collar.) “I was major of the Thirteenth Iowa.” I said: “Well,
you're an old Yank, and I'm an old Reb, and it's time for
luncheon. There's nobody here but you and me and the cook.
We'll have some tea and bread and butter, and talk over
war-times.” By this time we were standing within the hallway, and he
said: “All right; but before we go any further I'd like to know
<pb id="wyeth416" n="416"/>
how much you will charge me for the operation?” I told him; and
then he exclaimed: “Well, my goodness! What kind
of a man are you, anyway? You never saw me before in your
life; you knew I was looking for you; knew what was the matter
with me; knew what state I was from; knew I was in the Union
army; and d--- me if you haven't named exactly the amount I
made up my mind to pay for the operation.”</p>
          <p>The only real guess I had to make was the last one, and I named
the sum usually charged for a minor surgical operation, which, in
all likelihood, the doctor who sent him to me told him I would
charge. Fifteen years later I had my last letter from him, asking
for a certificate of my findings in his case, as he wanted to take
out life insurance. There was nothing of “thought-transference” or
telepathy or “mind-reading” in all this; yet there is such a thing as
the conveyance to and registration upon one mind of an
impression or thought emanating from another mind. I have
demonstrated this by experiments so carefully guarded that there
is no doubt of the correctness of the fact. I explain it satisfactorily
to myself in this way: The nerve trunks and their terminal
branches (end-organs) in the superficial skin are capable of
conducting the electric waves or current from the surface to the
brain, and <hi rend="italics">vice versa</hi>, and, when a circuit of several persons is
made by holding hands, the current can be made to pass on and
on from one through the other until it comes back again to the
battery cells from which it was sent, thus completing the circuit.
The same nerves conduct the sensations of touch, heat, cold,
pain, etc., from the surface to the brain, where these senses
are registered and appreciated. They also convey impulses
from the brain (the battery) to the muscles.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth417" n="417"/>
          <p>Certain brains are capable of great powers of concentration—
that is, the individual possessing this quality of brain can eliminate
all thought of other things and think fixedly and clearly of just <hi rend="italics">one</hi>
thing. Certain other brains, and these are very rarely met with,
are capable of eliminating at least from their conscious mind for
the time being every process of thought or cerebration, leaving
the mind so blank and receptive that it may be compared to the
sensitive photographic plate upon which an impression may be
readily and quickly imprinted.</p>
          <p>I had read of this, but was desirous of testing it thoroughly
before accepting it. One Sunday evening a party of friends were
gathered at my house, and at my suggestion the following
experiment was made: Six of us joined hands, forming a circle
around a small table, one of the six being blindfolded. A card was
laid on the table, and upon this object the other five of the circuit
fixed their undivided attention. I was first blindfolded, but
registered no impression, and two others were tried with negative
results. The fourth person was a girl about sixteen years old, a
granddaughter of Dr. J. Marion Sims, very intelligent and
cultivated, mentally and physically sound, and, while not lacking in
the tenderness of femininity, rather leaning toward athletics and
the outdoor life. Some one placed the seven of hearts in the
center of the table, and as soon as our eyes and thought were
fixed intently on it, in a quick and startled tone she exclaimed:
“Oh! I see the seven of dia—no; it's hearts!”</p>
          <p>I was about as much startled as she seemed to be, and tried
other cards and then other objects, all of which she described. I
had used only a single large silk handkerchief, and, although it
completely obscured vision for me, I determined
<pb id="wyeth418" n="418"/>
to make assurance sure by wadding one large kerchief
for each eye and binding these down with a third broad napkin,
and this method I tested on myself. Vision was impossible; and
later, to satisfy the skeptical, I adopted other means of eliminating
all possibilities of self-deception or collusion. I carried on these
demonstrations or tests for some two years, and convinced every
one who witnessed them, as I did myself, that thought-transference
or the photographing of a visual impression from one brain
upon the sensitive plate or <hi rend="italics">subconscious mind</hi> (as I interpreted
it) of another was a fact. One of my most satisfactory
experiments was with the “sensitive” and myself. She, blindfolded
and standing behind me, would touch my forehead very lightly with
the tips of the fingers of both hands and describe accurately any
object upon which I could fix my attention. I would quietly take
my watch from the pocket, hold it so that my body intervened and
look steadily at the hour and the minute hands, and she would tell
me their relative positions correctly.</p>
          <p>I also observed that I could tell just when she would appreciate
the object I had in mind. From the watch I would turn to a series
of photographs, and she would indicate the one at which I was
looking. On one occasion she succeeded in recording the object in
mind with her fingers upon the forehead of a third person who in
turn had her fingers on my forehead. I might select a single word
from the page of a magazine, fix my mind on it, and she would
read it aloud. The experiments have been entirely discontinued
now for several years, and I do not know whether or not this
peculiar condition of mind persists. Many of the so-called
telepathic or spiritualistic phenomena may in this way be
accounted for, just as I shall explain
<pb id="wyeth419" n="419"/>
in the article on Right-Handedness why it is the mind occasionally
registers a double impression of a single visual image. When this
occurs the two halves of the brain are not working in unison; one
half (usually the left), a little more alert, catches the impression a
fraction of time ahead of the other—hence the confused image.
What we call training the mind is nothing more than drilling the
two halves of our brain to work thoroughly well together, not
unlike the two horses of a well-trained team. And yet I have had
otherwise sensible people tell me they were convinced that they
had lived before because at times things happened which they
had already seen!</p>
          <p>There is another queer phase of mind which probably every
practitioner of experience has observed. I can illustrate it by the
following case. A lady, the mother of several children, was
brought to me on account of a lameness. Six years before she
had been thrown from a carriage in a runaway accident, her knee
severely and painfully sprained and she mentally impressed or
shocked with the supposed gravity of the injury. After a few
weeks in bed she went about on crutches, and for six years would
not move from her chair without them. She had consulted doctors
at home and abroad, and resented the suggestion that she could
walk if she would. The joint was entirely normal, the muscles of
the extremity slightly atrophied from want of exercise, but still
able to support their part of the body and to be used. She was
high-strung and hysterically inclined. I told her husband that she
could get along without the crutches, but that we had to deal with
a mental condition which would require special treatment, and he
agreed to stand by me in anything I might undertake. After two
days devoted to a most tedious and painstaking
<pb id="wyeth420" n="420"/>
examination, with measurements all noted carefully, the lesion
was at last discovered, to her immense relief; and with a dramatic
climax, in which only the end could justify the means, I induced an
acute hysterical cataclysm with partial collapse, in which the cure
was dexterously effected; and I, the fraud triumphant, said in a
commanding tone to her husband: “Now, break her crutches! She
will never need them again!” And the leading-man played his rôle.
She was overjoyed at my discovery and the miraculous cure, was
on her feet at once, and in six days walked unaided to my office,
over a mile distant.</p>
          <p>The miracles at Lourdes, and those effected by the sight of or
touching sacred relics, and the cures by Christian Science, are of
the same order. Some mental shock or excitation seems
necessary to the dislodgment of a morbid impression and the
re-establishment of the normal process of cerebration. The condition
termed hypnotic is one of suspended consciousness, and under
certain conditions can be used to advantage. In the presence of
my class at the Polyclinic I removed a tumor two inches in
diameter from the shoulder-blade of a physician with no
anesthetic, general or local, and with no appreciation of pain. I told
him very convincingly that I would not hurt him in the least, that I
would deaden all sensation with cocaine. I injected three or four
drops of a weak solution in a line about an inch long, and in cutting
in the line my knife slipped and went fully a half inch away from
the injected area. As he did not wince, I slapped him on the back,
saying, “You feel no pain,” and went ahead with an extensive
dissection two inches in depth, making a wound at least six inches
in circumference. The patient, evidently hypnotized by suggestion,
assured me that at
<pb id="wyeth421" n="421"/>
no time was he conscious that I was cutting into his back.</p>
          <p>A New York wag said it was not until he had watched
New York society promenading past the “Flatiron Building”
on a gusty day that he had learned how “fearfully
and wonderfully women were made.” He had evidently
read Richardson's <hi rend="italics">Beyond the Mississippi</hi>, and presumed
I hadn't. That this description applies to certain mental
attributes as well as to anatomical make-up the following
incident may attest:</p>
          <p>Thirty years ago I received a letter from a doctor in Texas
informing me that a man and his wife, owning a ranch in that
state on which they had been living for several years, were
coming to consult me in regard to the man's illness. I found he
had an incurable disease of the liver. On one occasion when his
wife, my assistant, and I were treating him the door of his room
was suddenly opened by some one who did not knock, and a
woman, neatly dressed, her face expressing great determination
and excitement, started to walk in. Before she had made more
than a single step, the wife, who evidently recognized her, sprang
forward to meet her, caught her by the arm, and pushed her
toward the door. As she did this I heard her say, in a suppressed
tone, “Not now!” Of course my curiosity was aroused by this
strange procedure; but, as it was none of my affair, I should
never have referred to it had it ended there. I had, however,
scarcely seated myself in my office after returning from this visit
when some one was announced, and in walked the lady whose
face I had a glimpse of a few minutes before.</p>
          <p>She told me this story, and it was true: “The man you are
treating is my husband, whom I have for six years
<pb id="wyeth422" n="422"/>
mourned as dead. His name is  ---, and when he disappeared, as
we had reason to believe by suicide or foul play, he was manager
of the --- (mentioning the name of one of the leading metropolitan
dailies). This morning I came to the city to do some shopping, and
while at luncheon in a restaurant I was astonished to see enter
and seat themselves my husband and this woman, whom I have
known for years, and who also had been reported as having killed
herself. They did not recognize me, and when they went out I
followed them to their rooms, and when you came away I
followed you here.</p>
          <p>“Six years ago the business of my husband's paper called him
to St. Louis, where he was registered at the Planters' Hotel. A
day or two later his hat and coat were picked up at the wharf
there, his effects were left at the hotel, and the newspapers
published his disappearance and suicide in the Mississippi. From
that day until to-day I believed him dead. The woman with him is
the wife of another man. She and her husband lived in our village,
and, while my husband and I were acquainted with them, I had
not the slightest suspicion of an improper relation. I knew that she
had no children, and that she and her husband did not get on any
too well together. Soon after my husband was reported dead this
woman's shawl and hat were picked up on a pier on the East
River, and her husband received a despairing note, informing him
of her resolution to end her life.”</p>
          <p>I told the woman her husband could only live a few weeks,
and she then went to see him, and a reconciliation took place, not
only between the man and his wife, but between the two women.
He lived about the number of weeks I had guessed, and these
two women took turns day and
<pb id="wyeth423" n="423"/>
night nursing and watching over him with affectionate devotion.
When he was dying, and I left the room feeling very much like “a
looker-on in Vienna,” each was holding a hand and both were
crying. In apotheosis, in my mind's eye, I saw looking down
(or up) on this pathetic scene the smiling visages of Joseph Smith
and Brigham Young. And while borrowing from the storehouse of
Avon, why not write here those original words of the immortal
Dogberry: “God help us! it is a world to see!”</p>
          <p>In the list of tragedies another comes into mind, and it
is one I love to remember. A woman of about thirty, modestly
and fashionably dressed in black, whose handsome
face and bearing bespoke good breeding and proper bringing up,
without any sort of introduction, asked me to place her in a
training-school for nurses. From the appearance of
her hands, which were small and white, I inferred that she had
not been accustomed to work, and several costly rings
suggested that it was not absolutely necessary. Her accent was
of the South; and, while she was evidently desirous of
not revealing her identity, the fact that she had come to me for
aid or advice convinced me that she had lived among
my friends. I realized that she was in dead earnest, and there
was that indescribable something about her which
told me she was a good woman. I explained to her the hard life
she was planning and urged her not to go into it unless she was
ready to give up everything else and devote her entire time to it.
She had considered all this and was ready.</p>
          <p>A fortnight later I called by the hospital and saw her in the
uniform of a probationer, freshening up a bath-room
in which she had just finished bathing a patient. She seemed
happy, and the superintendent said she was an indefatigable
<pb id="wyeth424" n="424"/>
worker and gave promise of making an excellent
nurse. Meanwhile, she had told me her story. It was tragic and
pathetic, in that she was the innocent victim of the devotion of
another man than her husband, and the circumstances were such
that she was seemingly guilty and had been so judged in her
native village. I knew her husband and her people, and the man
who had paid for his infatuation with his life had been one of my
most brilliant pupils. He was the leading physician of his section,
and had married the most intimate friend of my fledgeling nurse.
His wife died after a long illness, through which her friend nursed
her day in and out. The village gossips thought she was too much
at the doctor's home, and that the doctor was more attentive and
demonstrative of his appreciation of another man's wife than
Mrs. Grundy's code of ethics prescribed.</p>
          <p>Her brother came under the spell of this gossip. A week or two
after the funeral the doctor, who had driven in his buggy to her
husband's home, asked her to go with him to the cemetery to
place some flowers on the new grave. As he drove back to her
gate, without a word of warning this brother shot the doctor dead
so instantly that he spoke not a word. The sister, horrified at the
deed, denounced her brother as a cowardly murderer. The law of
gossip cleared the murderer and divorced the wife and mother;
for the dead man's will was read in court, and he had left his
money to his wife's friend! That settled every doubt. She had lost
reputation, husband, children, friends. Nobody stood by her and
believed in her excepting her mother and the writer of these
memoirs, and he told her that if she was true to her high purpose
of showing by a life of devotion to duty that she was worthy of
the husband's love
<pb id="wyeth425" n="425"/>
which she had lost he would come back to her and bring her
babies with him.</p>
          <p>She made a great nurse, and when a town in New York was
panic-stricken by an epidemic of typhoid, she went there like a
“Sister Seraphine,” and labored for months and won a host of
friends. The news of all this found its way back to the village in
Texas; and presently she came into my office radiant over a letter
from her mother, saying he husband had consented to let her see
her children again. While she was on this visit to her own, one of
those ill winds which blows good to some came on in the shape of
another epidemic of typhoid, and she took charge. She wrote me:</p>
          <p>“I am working night and day, and my own people are believing
in me again. Those who would not speak to me when I came
back are taking me to their homes.” Within a year my wife and I
were invited to her <hi rend="italics">wedding</hi> to her <hi rend="italics">husband</hi>, and the two
children were bridesmaids; and some years later we were invited
to the wedding of one of the daughters by the happy parents and
asked to bring our children and stay a month!</p>
          <p>I could tire my readers with these queer recitals, but will add
here only the following two: Three lads grew to manhood in a
small Mississippi town; were schoolmates, playmates, and
friends. One of these came to man's estate with good habits,
steady purpose, and the promise of a useful career. The other
two drifted as idlers into dissipation and went rapidly on the
downward way.</p>
          <p>As Joseph Cook was closing his store late one night his two
acquaintances with drawn pistols robbed him and his safe,
pocketed all the cash, and then they told him they
were going to leave the country for good, and he must go
<pb id="wyeth426" n="426"/>
with them a few miles on the way to insure their getting a good
start. A mile or two from the village, arriving at a point where the
road led by a slash or shallow swamp, they conducted him through
this some two hundred yards from the roadway, where the water
was from three to four inches in depth, and where the swamp-grass
was tall enough to hide a dead man, and there they put five
thirty-eight-caliber bullets into his body. The next to the last shot
broke his lower jaw, and as he spun half around from the force of
the impact a fifth bullet went in at his backbone, cut the spinal cord
in two, and he dropped limp into the water. Fortunately (or
unfortunately), he fell on his back, his head resting on a tuft of
grass, which kept the water from strangling him to suffocation.
They stood over him for a few minutes, placed a hand on his chest
to be sure of their work (while he with wonderful resolution held
his breath), and then these conscienceless villains went to their
homes and went to bed!</p>
          <p>Only two of the wounds had done serious injury. The one
through the spine had produced complete paralysis below the
middle of the back, but people can live a long time with paralysis.
The wound of the jaw was bleeding profusely. It was August and
warm, and Cook was in his shirtsleeves when shot. Convinced
that he would not live till daylight, he took of the blood in his mouth
and with his finger-tip wrote on his shirt-front, “<hi rend="italics">Jim Smith shot me.</hi>”
When the news of the robbery and disappearance spread through
the village scouting parties followed the roads and scoured the
woods in all directions, and about nine o'clock of the next day
some one from the roadway heard groans off in the slash, and
took Cook out, still alive. A few months later his brother, Dr. Cook,
of Hattiesburg, Mississippi,

came with him to my hospital. The bullet lodged in the
mouth was removed, and, cutting away the bones, I extracted
some bits of lead from the spinal cord; but this had been
completely divided, and his cure was impossible. He died thirteen
months after he was shot. The murderers were immediately
arrested, and, unfortunately, were not lynched. The law of
Mississippi did not recognize as a murder a death unless it took
place within twelve months of the date of the act which caused it.
The maximum penalty was twenty years in the penitentiary, and
this worthy pair escaped within two years and were never
recaptured. But,</p>

          </lg>
          <p>The following extraordinary coincidence relates to the case of
the late Captain John M. Sloane, of Pontotoc, Mississippi. In 1890
I received a letter from Captain Sloane. At the battle of Chickamauga,
in September, 1863, a piece of shell or canister had torn
away his chin and a good part of the lower jaw, laying open
the larynx, or windpipe, and the œsophagus, or gullet,
and from that day he had lived on liquid or semi-liquid
nourishment, carried into the stomach through a tube
introduced into the fistulous opening of the gullet. From his
description and a photograph I was convinced nothing could be
done which would justify the expense of a trip to New York. As
a matter of curiosity, I wrote to a doctor friend for information.
Captain Sloane's record as a soldier and citizen was excellent, but
by reason of his mutilation he had had a hard time to make a
living. His wife had died; he was trying to support himself and an
invalid daughter by clerking in a grocery store, but was
<pb id="wyeth428" n="428"/>
really in distress. The doctor stated in answer to a further inquiry
that he believed the old soldier and the daughter could make a
living if they had a modest capital to establish a small grocery
business. I wrote to the mayor of Pontotoc that if the citizens
there would raise a certain sum I would raise as much from
friends in New York, and this was done, and the captain and his
daughter were very happy in their new venture.</p>
          <p>In 1896 there was to be a dedication of the Chickamauga
National Park, and all the surviving veterans of both armies who
took part in that battle were invited to a fraternal reunion. General
Wheeler had requested me to go there and locate the marker for
the shaft it was proposed to erect to show where our command
had operated, and I wrote to the captain at Pontotoc, who agreed
to meet me in Chattanooga at a time and place named. In the
enormous crowd and great confusion which prevailed, I failed to
find the old soldier, and with a doctor friend I drove in his buggy
to the battle-field, some ten miles away. At noon we reached
Crawfish Spring for luncheon. The doctor's wife had prepared a
generous basket, and as we were arranging its contents in a
shady nook close by the spring I observed two men in Federal
uniform who were seated near by. In the spirit of the occasion I
went up to them and said: “Boys, you look hungry. Won't you
come over here and share our luncheon with us?” Seeing we had
an abundance for all and meant what we said, they accepted.</p>
          <p>One of these men was a Mr. S. S. Rich, then of Moberly,
Missouri; the other was from Indiana, but his name escapes
me. Rich was originally from Kentucky, and had served in a
famous Union brigade from that state. Naturally, as we sat there
our thoughts and conversation turned back to
<pb id="wyeth429" n="429"/>
the thrilling scenes we had witnessed on those three great days in
September, 1863, during which this bloody battle had lasted. I had
fallen asleep the Sunday night after the battle closed right by this
spring within a few feet of where we now were, and was only
awakened by the hot sun shining in my face. I told them the story
of the dead man I found sitting up against a tree in a dense
thicket not far away and of my speaking to him, thinking he was
only wounded and alive. Then Mr. Rich remarked: “I saw the
most remarkable wound in this fight that I ever came across. In
one of our charges, passing over the line the Confederates had
occupied, I trod over a man whose jaw and throat were torn
away, and the blood and froth were flowing from the opening. He
seemed to be choking to death in his own blood, and I stopped,
caught him by the arm, and dragged him a few yards and left him
so that his head and neck hung down over the root of a tree, and
went on.” I asked him if he knew what troops composed this part
of the Confederate line, and he said: “Yes; we captured some of
Lowery's Mississippi regiment right there.”</p>
          <p>I had in my pocket a photograph of Captain Sloane and his
graphic description of where, when, and how he was wounded,
and in it he had stated that some one had dragged and placed him
so the blood would not strangle him as he lay helpless. As he
belonged to Lowery's regiment and received this very unusual
wound at that time and place, I knew I was talking to the Union
soldier who, even in the hurry and excitement of one of the
bloodiest battles in history, had been humane and thoughtful
enough to do a kindly act to a helpless enemy. I pulled out the
picture, showed it to him, and asked him to read the letter. When
he finished it he said: “My God! That's the man.” The Indiana
<pb id="wyeth430" n="430"/>
man remarked: “Why, that must be the man I saw in the
train coming down here. He was showing us how he took a drink
by placing a tube in the open place in his throat and pouring the
water into a funnel.”</p>
          <p>The brave old captain died a few years later. He and I had
never met. I had met the man, however, to whom he really owed
the prolongation of his life.</p>
          <p>After all, the world is not so large, as these various
experiences in my own life attest; and since it deals with that
sentiment of brotherhood which should prevail in our relations one
with another in my profession, I shall add this minor incident.</p>
          <p>As I was returning from one of my visits to my old home in
Alabama there boarded the train at Knoxville a
distinguished-looking gentleman who was given the section
adjoining mine. Seeing him reading a book on appendicitis
by Dr. George Fowler, of Brooklyn, I concluded he must
be a surgeon, and in the spirit of fellowship which permits
familiarity among doctors I said, “You are a doctor?” He
looked up rather rebukingly and replied: “You
are mistaken; I am not.” I continued, “Then you have
appendicitis.” In some surprise he said: “Well, yes; I have.” My
next remark was: “You are on the right track to get cured. The
author of that book is one of the best surgeons in the world, and
you can do no better than to go to him.” To this he said: “Thank
you. That may be true, but I'm going to another surgeon in New
York City, a Dr. John A. Wyeth.” At this I took a card from my
case and handed it to him, and he exclaimed, “This seems like
Providence!” It turned out lucky in more ways than one. Several
weeks after this Dr. Fowler came to dine with us, and in the
course of conversation he remarked: “Mrs. Wyeth, I have a good
<pb id="wyeth431" n="431"/>
story to tell you on the doctor. My cousin, who was coming North
on the Southern Railway, happened to be seated near him in the
Pullman car at Knoxville when, hearing my name, he pricked up
his ears and overheard a passenger who, he found out, was Dr.
Wyeth, trying to persuade another passenger who had
appendicitis to come to me for operation. My cousin said, ‘Cousin
George, isn't it rather unusual for such a thing as that to happen in
your profession?’ and I replied: ‘It isn't any too common; but it
can happen.’ ” I thought again of what a little world it is. It had not
occurred to me that my friend would ever know of this accidental
meeting nearly a thousand miles from New York.</p>

RIGHT-HANDEDNESS, OR DEXTRAL PREFERENCE IN
MAN—ALSO SOME SUGGESTIONS AS TO THE VALUE
OF ENFORCED AMBIDEXTERITY</head>
          <p>IN our village school in Alabama the boys and girls were
together. Before the village grew to be a town—when it was still
“the Settlement,” and there were not more than a couple of dozen
children big enough to go to school—we all sat together on the
benches in the one-room log cabin with its huge fireplace, its
single door, and one slit of a window, made by sawing out six feet
of two logs. Each day we took our places in the order in which
we arrived. When civilization began to overtake us our parents
built a new school-house out of planks. It was the first frame
house I had ever seen, and it was so large and fine-looking we
children used to gaze at it in wonder. There was room enough
inside to put four of the old log cabins under the new roof; so we
moved into it, tore the old thing down, and cut it up for firewood.
How natural it is to cut an old thing down and use it for firewood!
The new house had done away with the fireplace, for cast-iron
stoves were coming into fashion.</p>
          <p>The teacher no longer blew a horn or shouted to call us in, but
tapped a great big bell. One night two “big boys”—real smart
boys—played a trick on him. They climbed to the belfry and
greased the bell with tallow, and, as it
<pb id="wyeth433" n="433"/>
wouldn't ring the next morning, everybody was late at school. I
have often thought of how startled the good teacher must have
felt when he pulled the rope that time, and instead of the usual
reverberating clang there came to his ears from on high the dead,
cracked-pot sound of a tallowed bell! When the scholars found
out what had happened we all laughed; but it was a short laugh.
When the bell wouldn't ring nothing else was left but to look up
the old horn and blow the assembly. The Day of Judgment will
not be more solemn than this day was for the boys, who were
lined up presently to be catechized. Of course, the girls were not
under suspicion. They took their seats on their side of the
school-room and looked on with especial sympathy, each for the
boy she liked best<corr>.</corr></p>
          <p>The teacher, whose expression suggested the dark cloud which
rolls up as the advance-guard of a cyclone, took down from over
the blackboard a well-seasoned six-foot hickory withe and
remarked: “Boys, I have no means of knowing who greased the
bell. Some one or more of you are guilty, and unless the culprit
owns up I'm bound to get him, for I'm going to thrash all of you.”
Just as we were wishing we had put on two pairs of trousers and
padded our backs, two heroes stepped out of line and said they
did it and they were very sorry, and they looked it. Then the good
teacher replaced the hickory and told them if they would scrape
the tallow off and chop wood and build the fires for two weeks
he would let them off. The bell rang out the next morning as if
nothing had happened, and for a fortnight at least the
school-house was warm.</p>
          <p>Civilization also took our benches, upon which we had sat and
squirmed and slid so long that they were as smooth and as sleek
as ice, and <hi rend="italics">so</hi> comfortable, and gave us single
<pb id="wyeth434" n="434"/>
seats and desks, the boys ranged in long rows on one side and the
girls on the other. It seemed a long way across to where our
sweethearts sat, but somehow or other we managed to elude the
watchful eye of the teacher—there was never more than one—and
established a wireless system of communication which antedated
Marconi.</p>
          <p>But the time for real enjoyment was the half-hour allowed for
recess or play in the middle of the morning session. The
school-house was built on the backbone of a high ridge which
overlooked the village. At recess one side of the ridge was the
girl's playground; the other was for the boys. We were not
allowed on their side, and of course they could not overstep the
bounds of modesty and cross over to us. I wonder if our teacher
forgot that there was a summit to that ridge, a place where the two
sides came together, a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">medio tutissimus ibis</foreign></hi>, as Virgil puts it? If he
did, we didn't. The law of natural selection was more inexorable than
the law of gravitation; for all of us boys and girls alike gravitated
uphill and found a common playground and worlds of that glorious
fun and frolic which are the essence of existence in that period of
adolescence when Nature is asking the question, “What next?”
On top of this ridge, one day when I was twelve years old, I
came face to face with the question of ambidexterity.</p>
          <p>I had a sweetheart, and her name was “Mugg.” Can you
imagine in all the category of names one more suggestive of
ugliness—I am almost tempted to say of “Muggliness?” But
“Mugg” was only her nickname. It was short for Margaret, and she
was the prettiest girl in school—to me. On this eventful day, as
soon as we had rushed out of our prison-house and disappeared
from the teacher's vision in the thick foliage of our respective
hillsides, we
<pb id="wyeth435" n="435"/>
scrambled to our common playground in the summit woods. Our
play on this occasion was bending the tough young hickory
saplings down to near the ground and seating our sweethearts
and ourselves on them as “ridey-horses.” Mugg was so much
prettier than any other boy's sweetheart that I determined she
should have the biggest and the highest “ridey-horse” of all. I
had not then learned of the huge Trojan horse which brought
disaster to Ilium.</p>
          <p>There stood in our grove a slender, graceful, tight-bark hickory
sapling, toughest of all tough timber, bending but never breaking,
towering fully thirty feet to its topmost bifurcation. There was no
other like it, as there was no other girl like Mugg. I made up my
mind I would bend it to the ground and she should have it; and to
the top I climbed, twisted the terminal twigs around my hands and
wrists, and swung boldly out into space toward the ground. I had
struck the wrong hickory. Alas! had this been the only time!
Instead of swooping to the earth in a long, graceful curve, amid
the plaudits of an admiring throng, with an occasional glance at
Mugg and her approving smile, as I had anticipated, I bent that
obstinate sapling not more than three feet from the top in
fish-hook shape, and there I dangled, helpless and hopeless, almost as
much so as if I had had a noose about my neck and was hanging
from a gibbet. As the sense of failure and chagrin flashed over
me then I would gladly have exchanged for the <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">exitus lethalis</foreign></hi> of
the hangman. But this was not to be. I could not clamber back,
and the arc of the circle described by the bending tree-top had a
diameter beyond the swing of my wildly gyrating feet.</p>
          <p>I suggested with earnestness and feeling that half a dozen boys
climb up and add sufficient weight to bring
<pb id="wyeth436" n="436"/>
us all down in safety together; but the responses were negative.
One of my rivals thought I looked so much better where I was
than on the ground that I had better stay up there. Another
informed me—and the remark was entirely original, and from the
giggle which floated up to my height must have been considered
witty at their level—that if I would only let go the ground would
catch me. It did. On the way down, slashing through the limbs, I
struck one which, as in some of those confusing problems in
fractions, changed the numerator into the denominator and landed
me head foremost, with the <hi rend="italics">right</hi> hand thrust out to catch the
brunt of the fall—and here is where dextral preference comes in.</p>
          <p>Had I been ambidextrous—which is a paradox, for I could
scarcely have two right hands—I would have extended both
anterior extremities, and, dividing their combined resistance to
body weight and momentum, would have escaped a Colles's
fracture of the radius at the right wrist. Our home doctor called it
a sprain, and there was no reposition, or “setting.” The subsequent
pain and inconvenience were so severe and prolonged that I
acquired the habit of using the left hand and arm, and in the
course of years I became fairly ambidextrous. Appreciating the
value of ambidexterity in surgery, for several years while
studying and teaching anatomy, I worked almost wholly with the
left hand, until, in performing an operation, whichever member
was more convenient or useful I used without thought as to
whether it was right or left.</p>
          <p>Man is the only one-sided animal. A careful study of apes has
convinced me that they have no manual preference. I could
narrate many interesting experiences with those near-human
creatures which at least amused and instructed
<pb id="wyeth437" n="437"/>
me, and might you, but time and space forbid all but one.
This is it:</p>
          <p>To the Sixty-fourth Street Zoo, when my good friend, Mr.
Conkling, was curator, there was presented a very vicious,
imperious, and combative black monkey from (I think) Brazil. His
much-used tail was very long, fully as long as his body; and I
never saw any of the tribe which did so much business with that
part of its anatomy as this lively fellow. He was turned loose in
the big cage, in which there was already a general assortment of
different kinds of monkeys. Having never seen anything just like
the newcomer, the original tenants with agile unanimity sprang,
jumped, or clambered to the loftiest, most remote and inaccessible
portions of the cage, glanced downward, and
chattered away as if they, too, were on the tower of Babel.
The Brazilian, from his resting-place on the floor, was not long in
completing an inventory of stock before he began to have fun. He
chased, chewed, and spanked everything in that cage until it
looked as if he would die laughing, while the others, tired out and
scared half to death, were clinging to the bars at the roof and
panting like lizards in August. His final stunt was to carry the
smaller ones to the greatest height and drop them to the floor; and
then the keeper intervened and placed the black Amazonian all by
himself in another cage immediately adjoining.</p>
          <p>It took the others several days to recover from the panic, and
for a week or two whenever he approached the partition bars his
neighbors found much to interest them at the other end of their
abode.</p>
          <p>Time is said to bring its revenges, and Talleyrand (or some one
probably not so smart) is said to have said that “All things are
possible to those who wait”—and this without
<pb id="wyeth438" n="438"/>
reference to tips. At all events, in an unfortunate moment the long
black tail found itself projected between the bars and a good long
way within the general monkey cage next door, while he who
owned it slept. Now, monkeys have a language. There is no doubt
about this in my mind, for I have observed them closely and with
great interest. One major monkey who had suffered much, both in
body and spirit, at the hands and teeth of this interloper, stealthily
approached the sleeping Saul, grabbed the nethermost tip of the
infringing tail between his teeth, reinforced his grip with the clutch
of both hands, and pulled away vigorously until the butt-end of his
enemy was firmly jammed against the partition bars. <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">Verb sap!</foreign></hi>
The other monkeys fell on him in showers, and as many as could
took hold, and the denizen of the upper Amazon was theirs, or at
least a good long part of him. When his cries brought help, all the
hairs of his caudal extremity were off, and a half-dozen of his
distant cousins were chewing on all that was left down to the
bones. With his raw tail looking like an Essex Street show-window
sausage to which the mice had found access, he was the most
forlorn and dejected creature I have ever seen.</p>
          <p>I have never seen in any animal, even those which move about
wholly or in part on their posterior or inferior extremities, as the
kangaroo or the various members of the bird or fowl kingdom,
any demonstration of preference for one side more than the
other.</p>
          <p>The <hi rend="italics">genus homo</hi> is strongly one-sided and right-sided. There
are several hundred of these to one left-handed. What is the
reason? Is it custom, with the added influence of heredity, or is
there an anatomical cause? Let us begin at the beginning and try
to interpret the meaning or the
<pb id="wyeth439" n="439"/>
intent of the great Law. In the earliest recognizable formative
period of the human embryo, the cells are arranged in rows and
layers on each side of, and equal in number and size, and parallel
with a central perpendicular line—the line of fusion or union,
where the two halves, the right and the left—merge into the one
body. The cells which form the two halves or hemispheres of the
brain are balanced on the two sides, and traveling downward we
find the two eyes, the two fused halves of the nose, the cheeks,
ears, two halves of the tongue, the jaws, the thyroid bodies of the
neck, the bones, arms and legs, lungs, kidneys, and all the organs
in pairs, each balancing the other.</p>
          <p>May we not venture from this to opine that the purpose of
creation was the perfect balance of power and of function
between the two halves which were to fuse into a unit being?</p>
          <p>Studying still more closely the process of growth in the earlier
stages, we find further justification of this conclusion in the
development of the heart and the circulatory system.
Now, if the two halves of the body are to be equally efficient
they must of necessity be equally well nourished, and the blood is
the great conveyer and distributer of nutrition. In the embryo the
heart itself, made up of two halves, <hi rend="italics">hangs
like a plummet in the middle line,</hi> and springing from its base
are a right and a left aortic arch, the two curving downward in
beautiful symmetry to unite below in one common conduit or
aorta. Could this anatomical arrangement persist, is it not fair to
presume that each half of the brain and each upper extremity
would receive an equal share of nutrition, or a proportion so
nearly equal that one side would not declare itself superior to or
independent of the other? We know, however, that it does not
persist. Within
<pb id="wyeth440" n="440"/>
the first few months of intra-uterine development the heart is
gradually and permanently changed from a perpendicular to an
oblique position, and from its normal central place well over into
the left side of the chest. As this is occurring, one of the two
original aortic arches is thrown out of use and ultimately withers
up into a useless cord. The aortic arch which persists is twisted
semispirally on itself, with such disarrangement of the heart and
the great vessels passing upward to the brain and the upper
extremities that the right arm gets more blood than the left, while
the left half of the brain—that half from which emanate the motor
impulses to the right side of the body—receives a larger supply of
nutrition than its fellow. What has caused this disarrangement?</p>
          <p>Dividing the chest from the abdomen is a transverse, and in the
embryo a rectangular, partition known as the diaphragm. In
contact with the under, or abdominal, surface of this partition is
the spleen on the left, and its opposing or balancing organ, the
liver, on the other side. In the process of evolution under, in all
probability, changed conditions of ingestion demanding increase of
function, the liver has become enormously enlarged, until, instead
of being equal in size and weight with the spleen, it is from five to
seven times as large and heavy. In finding room for itself it has
encroached upon the right side of the chest, and has not only
taken up the room for, but has robbed this lung of one lobe. Not
satisfied with this act of vandalism, it has shoved the heart far
over to the left side and thrown the circulatory apparatus for the
upper part of the body out of plumb. No doubt the wag who said
the intruder should be divided into three parts because he was “all
gall” had a prevision of my theory of the <hi rend="italics">hepatic</hi> cause of dextral
<pb id="wyeth441" n="441"/>
preference in man. When I was making a study of this subject, in
1878 and 1879, I weighed the two halves of a number of brains
and found that in a very large proportion of cases the left half
was heavier than the right.</p>
          <p>The very much more extensive investigations of the Marylebone
Hospital in England confirm this fact. Bichat long ago concluded
that the specific gravity of the gray matter—the thought and motion
originating element of the brain—of the left half was greater than
that of the right. That the two halves are different is evident in
comparison with the brain of animals. In examining the brain of
the monkey I was struck with the perfect symmetry of the various
right and left convolutions, a condition which is not present in
the brain of man. The result of all this is that the two halves of
our brains are not always working actively in harmony to produce
the full complement of brain efficiency. In right-handed persons
the left half is in general more alert and active. In moments of
more or less complete or partial mental inertia, as not infrequently
occurs when the blood is flooding the digestive apparatus soon
after eating, certain visual impressions will be caught by the more
alert half—the left—before the right half gets the registration. The
complete mental impression can occur only then; and while only
an infinitesimal fraction of time may have transpired between the
partial and complete registration, there is a confused or double
image. This has led persons who are over-spiritually inclined or
superstitious to the supposition that they had witnessed the same
scene or occurrence under exactly the same conditions at some
other time, perhaps in some other existence. Had both halves of
the brain been acting together this could not have occurred.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth442" n="442"/>
          <p>The two halves of the brain may be compared to the two
horses of a team. If they are well matched and trained, they
move off and pull together smoothly and satisfactorily. If one
horse is drowsy or a laggard, the other gets away first, and his
fellow follows in a clumsy and jerky effort to catch up and pull his
share of the load. What we know as training the mind is intended
to develop these two halves of our brains into a well-trained and
alert working team. When in the course of my investigations this
simple, and to me satisfactory, explanation of a phenomenon that
I had often experienced came to me, I was overjoyed and was
under the impression that I had made a great discovery. I made it
known to the two leading professors of physiology in New York,
and they accepted it and congratulated me. Later, to my great
disappointment, I learned that an English investigator had
advanced the identical theory. <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">Sic transit gloria mundi.</foreign></hi></p>
          <p>That we often fail to use both sides of our brain is proved
beyond doubt by a number of cases of aphasia, or the loss of the
power of framing thoughts into words, in which cases on post-mortem
examination the disease has been actually located in the
speech center on the left side. Although the same convolution
and an identical gray matter was intact on the right side,
the patient could never learn to use that center.</p>
          <p>In my opinion ambidexterity should be made an important
feature of the training of a child. It should be begun at birth and
followed up persistently. Children of strong hereditary tendency
to use the right hand to the neglect of the left should be made
left-handed by compelling them to do with that hand all or most of the
things a single hand is usually required to do. It is very
advisable that they
<pb id="wyeth443" n="443"/>
practise writing with both hands, and speak and pronounce the
words as formed. They will then of necessity be exercising and
developing for use the speech and word center of the side from
which the motor and thought impulses are originating. It is
remarkable how thoroughly one may overcome habits of heredity
and become expert by the persistent use of a once discarded or
slightly used member. A friend who by inheritance and practice
was intensely right-handed had in his twentieth year his right arm
shot away at Chancellorsville. He learned to write as legibly and
rapidly with his left hand as he had written with the preferred
member, and became one of the most famous shotgun experts in
the South, loading and firing his gun without assistance.</p>
          <p>This experience, and my own and many others', proves that
notwithstanding the displacement of the heart the loss of the
balance of power between the two sides is not so great that it
cannot be overcome by persistent effort. I had very little trouble
in making my youngest boy decidedly left-handed. There was the
usual insistence and preference for the dextral member, and
heredity asserted itself, for as far back as we could trace his
ancestry on both sides there was not an exception to dextral
preference.</p>
          <p>It would be interesting to carry this theory into practice through
several generations in order to observe how much greater brain
efficiency might be developed. I prophesy that while the
Wyethian brain of the future may not set the Thames on fire, it
will easily surpass the Wyethian brain which is behind this feeble
effort.</p>

OF THE UNION LEAGUE CLUB, ETC.</head>
          <p>A MAN'S life may be likened to a ball of snow, which as a
boy he starts from the hilltop. With each turn it grows larger and
carries more weight; but the farther it goes the swifter it speeds,
until control is lost, and nothing can stop it until it reaches the
bottom. When a young man I read a novel entitled <hi rend="italics">The
Occupations of a Retired Life</hi>. It was the story of a man who
had made a success of his career in the metropolis, and at sixty
turned his back on the distractions of the city and the anxiety of
affairs and found repose</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">Far from the madding crowd's ignoble strife.</q>
          <p>I had fully determined that when I reached that age I should
give up my own and other people's anxieties and sorrows, as far
as was humanly possible, and find rest and diversion in travel and
in carrying out certain literary schemes of which I had long been
dreaming. In one of Uncle Remus's stories, the little listener,
brimming over with sympathy at the disaster which befell Bre'r
Possum, who suffered for the sins of Bre'r Rabbit, asks why it is
that the innocent should bear the burden of the guilty, and the
<pb id="wyeth445" n="445"/>
old philosopher replies: “Lor', chile; de rain falls on de jess and
de unjess dess de same, and tribberlation's waitin' right 'round de
corner for de best of us!”</p>
          <p>Just as the time came for me to quit work I looked round the
corner—and came face to face with the new Polyclinic. I have told
of the failure of my effort in 1878 and '79 to establish in New
York City an ideal Medical College with rigid requirements for
admission, a three-year pregraduate and a two-year postgraduate
course of study, and how in 1881 the postgraduate feature of this
plan resolved itself into the Polyclinic, and how from year to year
this prospered. It had now outgrown the facilities which had been
originally provided, and its trustees and medical staff realized the
demand and necessity for new and larger buildings, a greater
diversity in clinical material, and a more complete laboratory
equipment.</p>
          <p>It was at this juncture that an officer of New York City
connected with its charities informed me that an ambulance and
emergency service was badly needed for the West Side, and
asked me to take the matter of building a new hospital there and
of undertaking that service to our trustees for consideration. With
a unanimity which presaged success the trustees and medical
staff voted in favor of the undertaking. For more than twenty-five
years the physicians connected with this institution had labored
zealously for its development without remuneration, and had not
only donated all its earnings to the improvement of its facilities for
teaching, but from time to time had subscribed generously for this
purpose from their private means. The idea of combining with our
work as teachers this great humanitarian project aroused the
enthusiasm of this devoted body of professional men and fired
them and the trustees
<pb id="wyeth446" n="446"/>
with unremitting zeal for its accomplishment. It so happened
that I had won the esteem and friendship, and finally the
sympathy, of a man whose genius for affairs was only second to
his broad humanity and nobility of character. Several years
before he had at my request become a member of the board of
trustees, and as a trained business man had carefully informed
himself not only of the philanthropic character of our work and
the altruism of the medical staff, but—what was of very great
value at this juncture—he found out that he was connected with a
charity that was being conducted under business methods and
was capable under judicious management of being self-supporting.</p>
          <p>On the morning after one of our meetings he called at my
office and handed me a check for a large sum payable to myself.
It was enough to buy a great plot for a great hospital. He
expressed surprise when I told him I could not accept it. I said:
“Mr. Clyde, I appreciate what this generous gift means. It is your
vote of appreciation of the humanitarian side of our work, and of
confidence in me and in my ability to perpetuate the ideals
associated in your mind with the Polyclinic. I am not as positive
as I would like to be that I can do this, and I ask you to hold this
check until I can see my way more clearly.”</p>
          <p>I called a meeting of our medical board, told them of
possibilities of a realization of the new hospital and school building,
and asked them to consent to a plan of reorganization which
eliminated every suggestion of private interest and made of the
New York Polyclinic Medical School and Hospital a public
institution in its broadest sense, its scientific and medical affairs
entirely under the control of it professional staff, its property and
business management under the control of a board of trustees
composed of business
<pb id="wyeth447" n="447"/>
men responsible under the laws of the State of New York.
Encouraged by the vote adopting the recommendation, I secured
an option upon an ideal site in West Fiftieth Street, and two
months later I submitted the perfected reorganization to my good
friend. He does not know to this day what I read in the
expression of his noble face as I went over the details of what
our medical board had done. When I finished he said, “This is a
great work,” and as he spoke I knew my dream had come true.
Instead of buying high-priced and noisy corner property, I bought
twice as much in area for the same money in the middle of the
block, and determined to build high for light, air, and freedom
from noise and dust. All of this was an innovation in hospital
construction, but it has proved a great attraction and a benefit.</p>
          <p>The plans were drawn by the architect to meet the wants
which our combined experience of thirty years in the old building
suggested as desirable. Mr. William P. Clyde's indispensable aid
did not stop with his generous contribution of money, but at our
earnest solicitation he burdened himself with the presidency of
the trustees and became one of a building committee of three.
Until the new enterprise was successfully launched he filled
these offices in such a manner, and with such dignity and keen
observance of the business proprieties, as to win from all the
lasting esteem and gratitude which followed him to his retirement.</p>
          <p>While the preliminaries above narrated were going on there
came to the Polyclinic another stroke of great good fortune, and
to me the further evidences of the thoughtfulness and alertness
of my friends. We needed still more money. When was there a
time when a hospital did not need this great essential to
philanthropy? Will there ever
<pb id="wyeth448" n="448"/>
be a time when those who have it will have the good sense to
bestow it where it will bring the greatest return of good? My
telephone-bell rang one night at a late and unusual hour. I
recognized the voice of a dear friend and colleague, Dr. D.
Bryson Delavan. He said: “One of my former pupils has just left
my office. He came to tell me that a relative, a lady of means,
had expressed a willingness and desire to give a handsome sum of
money to some deserving philanthropy. I have asked him to get in
touch with you.” By a strange coincidence a letter from Dr. J. W.
Brannan, President of Bellevue and Allied Hospitals, brought me
the same information in the morning's mail. I lost no time in getting
in touch with the young practitioner, and went at once to Mr.
Clyde, and he and I called upon the lady in question.</p>
          <p>Mr. Clyde had been her father's friend, and she worshiped the
memory of her father, himself a leader among New York's great
and philanthropic business men. In this interview I met one of the
most remarkable women it has been my great good fortune to
know, that rare kind of woman whose hand and heart work
together in perfect unison. She listened to the history of the
Polyclinic, made her own analysis, and most generously joined
with Mr. Clyde in the noble purpose. With two such able and
appreciative friends and champions as Mrs. Helen Hartley Jenkins
and Mr. William P. Clyde the completion of the new building was
made certain, and the perpetuation of a great educational and
humanitarian enterprise assured. Many others contributed to this
consummation, and deserve and have grateful appreciation; but as
long as the scientific and practical training of physicians in this
great school may add to the blessings of mankind, and as long as
the thousands
<pb id="wyeth449" n="449"/>
upon thousands who find there the means of relief, these
two unselfish beings must be recorded as first among those who
made it possible.</p>
          <p>Self-reliance begets optimism, and this develops that quality of
hope which is said to spring “eternal in the human breast.” I have
always had an abiding faith in the ultimate triumph of a good
cause. The only real setback to this conviction was the failure to
establish the Southern Confederacy. For some no doubt excellent
and satisfactory reason Providence ruled otherwise; but, being
the son of a lawyer, in my heart of hearts I filed an exception.
Now, the Polyclinic Hospital with its ambulance service differs
from the Southern Confederacy in one important particular—<hi rend="italics">viz.</hi>, it
is established. The great hospital was built by optimism, and so
was the emergency service. We accepted the great responsibility
for the City of New York and agreed to open it at a certain date
in the near future—<hi rend="italics">and this when we had not a single
ambulance nor a hundred dollars toward the price of the
three we required, and these must be automobiles, too!</hi> But
my Presbyterian upbringing taught me that Faith might move a
mountain, especially when giant powder was mixed with it. My
dear father would have advised prayer without ceasing. My
Spartan mother would have added, “Some prayer, but don't forget
the powder.”</p>
          <p>Very soon after accepting the service, as I was coming out of
the Union League Club building in the late afternoon I overheard
a friend, whom I had known quite intimately for many years,
scolding the door-man for permitting his automobile to be sent
away without first notifying him. As chairman of the executive
committee of the club, desirous of keeping the peace and of
shielding as well as I
<pb id="wyeth450" n="450"/>
might a faithful servant, I made light of the oversight, and, going
up to my really good-natured and generous friend, I said: “Don't
worry over it, Costello. You can go home in my machine.” He
was placated enough to smile at this, and said: “I didn't know you
had an automobile.” I told him I had never been able to afford
that luxury, when he said: “Well, you deserve to have one, and
you ought to have it.” My reply was, “I don't care so much about
one for myself as for my hospital”; and then he said so quickly
that it nearly took my breath, “Do you really need an ambulance?”
Laying my hand over the region of the left fifth rib, I replied in an
affectation of emotion which he saw through: “Go slowly, my old
friend. I have heart disease.” He handed me a big check the next
afternoon, and I had <hi rend="italics">one</hi> ambulance. I needed two more.</p>
          <p>A week later my old war-time comrade and loyal friend, Dr.
William M. Polk (son of that General Leonidas Polk who gave his
life to the South at Kenesaw Mountain), telephoned me that a
patient of his wished to give a Packard automobile ambulance to
some hospital, and he had recommended the Polyclinic. This
machine came in good time, and with it a third, the gift of Mr.
Joseph Milbank, another of the many wealthy and thoughtfully
generous citizens of this great city, which with all of its rush and
strain for achievement and (as many assert) for money, is ever
ready with open hand and heart to help any cause known and
shown to be worthy. Three hundred and sixty thousand people
live within our ambulance district, and on one “field day” in 1913
we treated in the hospital forty-five accident cases.</p>
          <p>As a kind of postscript to the Polyclinic Hospital construction
<pb id="wyeth451" n="451"/>
I must add an experience which goes to confirm the
judgment of Robert Burns that</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">The best-laid schemes o' mice and men
<lb/>
Gang aft a-gley.</q>
          <p>If I have a soft spot in my heart for any particular race, it is for
the negro. “Mack,” the runaway slave my father bought, was my
first friend. He cared for me as a child as tenderly as he
afterward did for his own; and his wife, “Mammy Tildie,” was
next to our mother for my sisters and myself. No one who has
not lived in this affectionate relationship to the best of that race
can appreciate the feeling which prevailed. When I was planning
this great hospital I determined to have two small, neat wards set
apart for colored men and women, where they could be exclusive
and away from the possibility of wounded sensibilities by reason
of color and race prejudice. The very first patient admitted to the
new hospital was a negro lad, who came accompanied by his
father, who took the boy back home, refusing to let him go into a
colored ward. I wrote the father, saying how sorry I was; that I
was from the South and was naturally desirous of helping any
member of his race. He wrote in reply that he might have known
I was a Southerner, for nobody else but a man from that country
would come up North building “Jim Crow” wards in a hospital!</p>
          <p>In 1906 I was elected, without opposition, President of the New
York Academy of Medicine, to serve for two years, and re-elected
in 1908, four years in all. In the sixty-five years of the
Academy's history only five of its presidents had served for more
than one term, and to the date of my second term sixteen years
had elapsed since this extraordinary
<pb id="wyeth452" n="452"/>
honor had been conferred. The presidency of the New
York Academy of Medicine is, in my opinion, an office second
to none in importance in medical affairs in the United States.
While the great national organization, the American Medical
Association, covers a wider field and deals in large measure with
the most important scientific and technical problems in medicine
and in working with equal zeal for the advancement of the
profession and for the cause of humanity, it also deals largely
with public affairs, and with what we must of necessity term
“medical politics,” and in this respect occupies a field entirely
apart from the Academy which stands solely for medicine in its
scientific aspect.</p>
          <p>From the day of its foundation the Academy has
advanced steadily in its one fixed purpose—to become a center
for scientific medicine, from whose rostrum the great discoveries
which medical research is constantly making and the results of
world-wide experience in the prevention and treatment of disease
and injury may be first announced to its fellows and the
profession, and through these to the world at large. It is,
therefore, essential that the presiding officer should keep closely
in touch with all that is progressive in our science and art and
strive to give it expression through the Academy.</p>
          <p>The selection of men eminent in science not only in our own
country, but from all over the civilized world, and the assignment
of subjects for consideration in the various subdivisions of
medicine is no light task, and it is wholly left to the presiding
officer. In addition to the strictly medical programme for the
profession the Academy has instituted a regular series of free
public lectures, largely attended by the laity. In 1908 the limit of
membership was reached, and
<pb id="wyeth453" n="453"/>
there were so many applicants that the constitution was amended
in order to extend the list, and it became necessary to enlarge the
lecture-room and library facilities. A series of general meetings
was held, speeches were made, great enthusiasm prevailed, and
two hundred and twenty thousand dollars, the amount needed to
purchase all the additional property required, was raised, bringing
the actual value of the Academy's holdings to approximately
three-quarters of a million dollars, and assuring the early
completion of the new Academy. During my term of office the
number of bound volumes in the library was 84,820, and there
were 46,000 unbound publications. The weekly and monthly
periodicals, printed in every civilized language, numbered 1520.</p>
          <p>While serving my first term of two years in the presidency of
the Academy I was also elected President of the New York
Southern Society, a very popular and influential social
organization, made up of men who, coming from the Southern
states, have made New York City their home. Life in a great
city, where the struggle for existence and advancement is so
exacting of the hours of daylight, has necessitated the formation
of this and kindred societies, as the New England, made up of
Yankees or their descendants; the St. Andrew's, composed
exclusively of Scotchmen; the Virginia, Ohio, Pennsylvania,
Alabama, and many other such organizations, which hold
meetings at frequent intervals and spend the evenings in
delightful, friendly intercourse. It is like going home again to
attend these dinners and receptions, to meet old comrades in
arms, or college-mates, or their children, and hear the latest
news, or talk over old times. As the presiding officer of each of
these societies is usually invited formally as the guest of honor of
all the
<pb id="wyeth454" n="454"/>
others, any one who can live through these gastronomic and
speechmaking tests sees a very interesting side of metropolitan
life. I stood two years of it and enjoyed it, and give full credit for
the physical ability to stand it to the reserve digestive energy
stored up in my three years' experience in the Confederate army,
during which period there was such complete gastro-intestinal
repose. No one could pass through this particular experience and
not be impressed with the fact of how little of the real progressive
New York, the New York that is “doing things,” was born within
its limits.</p>
          <p>I recall one notable occasion when President Taft, who had
just been elected, was the guest of the North Carolina Society.
The president of this society was Walter H. Page, our present
ambassador to England. As president of the Southern Society, to
which the old North State Society belonged, I had the other place
of honor, and sat during the dinner and evening next to Mr. Taft.
As the presiding officer of the meeting was busy with his duties
for most of the evening, it gave me an excellent opportunity to
size up the President-elect of the United States, and I was very
favorably impressed with Mr. Taft. A number of persons came to
shake hands or speak to him in the course of the evening, and one
was an old college chum. Leaning over me, he whispered loud
enough for me to hear distinctly: “Bill! I guess this is the last time
I can call you ‘Bill’ ”—this was before the inauguration—“but it
has to go now before you get into the White House.” Before he
could get the balance of what he had in mind framed into words the
genial guest, holding on to his friend's hand, said: “Tom, the White House
won't make any difference to you; and when you come there, if
you dare to call me anything else than ‘Bill,’ I'll throw you
through a window.”</p>
          <pb id="wyeth455" n="455"/>
          <p>It is safe to say that no president ever tried harder to do his
duty without regard to his personal interest than did Mr. Taft. It is
just as safe to assert that none ever failed so signally to satisfy
anybody. In the olden days down South, when any one was
eminently successful and “swept the deck” in gambling on a
horse-race or a chicken-fight, or on Colonel W. R. W. Cobb being
elected to Congress, Uncle Dan, the negro oracle and
commentator of our county, was wont to say, “He hit 'em a-comin'
and a-gwine.” The converse was true of President Taft,
who missed everything both ways and ended his political career in
a mudslinging contest with an opponent who not only owned a
mill, but was ambidextrous besides. How much more dignified it
would have been to take bravely the stab of Brutus under the
dome of the Senate! It was the late Benjamin F. Butler, of
Massachusetts—and New Orleans—famous and infamous on one
side and the other of Mason and Dixon's line, who, after having
retired from one such contest so bespattered that his nearest
relative could not have recognized him, said, “Never again will I
throw mud with a man who owns a mill!”</p>
          <p>The only innovation I effected in the Southern Society was the
foundation of a charity fund which under subsequent able
administrations has grown to a very considerable sum. It was
while active in the interests of this delightful organization that I
made the acquaintance of a man from Virginia, then President of
Princeton University, who impressed me profoundly with the
belief in his great ability and prospective prominence. I was so
taken with this idea that I called on a very intimate friend, the
late William M. Laffan, Esq., whose ownership of the New
York <hi rend="italics">Sun</hi>, coupled with his wonderful ability as a writer and his
inflexibility
<pb id="wyeth456" n="456"/>
of purpose when he made up his mind that something
should be done, gave him, in my opinion, a very great influence in
public affairs. I asked him to dine with me and Woodrow
Wilson, and said to him, “I want you to meet a man
who is big enough to be the Democratic nominee for President.”
This was in 1907. With this in mind, and being nothing if not
practical, Laffan suggested that I invite Mr. Thomas F. Ryan,
another member of the Southern Society, whose successful
ventures in the world of finance had brought him into great
national prominence and made him a power in dictating the policy
of the Democratic party. Mr. Wilson stayed at our home for the
night, and it was to me a notable occasion, as I sat until one
o'clock a close listener to the conversation of these three men,
each <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">facile princeps</foreign></hi> in his sphere. At a late hour Elihu Root,
then Secretary of State, joined the party, and of course added to
its brilliancy. As far as Woodrow Wilson in his relation to national
affairs was concerned, “the pear was not yet ripe.” He did not
put it this way exactly, but his keen discernment told him the hour
had not yet struck, for I heard him say to William M. Laffan that
he was then so deeply interested in the affairs of Princeton
University that any suggestion of his entering the field of politics
was for the moment distasteful. His time was to come in 1912, and
I had the honor to be chairman of the medical department
of the campaign which resulted in his election.</p>
          <p>My membership in the Union League Club came about in
rather a queer way. Immediately after the war and during the
bitter years of the reconstruction period the politics of this strong
organization seemed to me to be so radical and so unjust in
sustaining the attitude of the “bloody-shirt-waving” wing of
the Republican party toward
<pb id="wyeth457" n="457"/>
the South that I could but feel a natural resentment. In the course
of time the best men of this party saw the injustice of the
reconstruction measures and repudiated them, and, with the long
years of peace and reconciliation, practically all feelings of
bitterness had disappeared. It so happened that I had a great
many intimate personal friends in this club; and J. Henry Harper,
Esq., of the well-known publishing firm of Harper&amp; Brothers,
asked me to let him nominate me for membership. This was
done. As the time for voting on my candidacy came near it
occurred to me that an ex-Confederate soldier, whose natural
leaning and training had been about as far away from what the
Union League Club represented as it could be, could never
possibly be elected unless it were under a misapprehension.</p>
          <p>To make this impossible I wrote to Mr. Frank Montague,
chairman of the committee on nominations, and to the president,
Mr. Cornelius N. Bliss, to the effect that I had been reared in the
South, and had served to the close of the war in the Confederate
army, had never voted anything but a Democratic ballot until Mr.
Bryan's heresies compelled me to vote for McKinley; that I had
more friends in the Union League Club than any other in New
York City; that it was the only club I wanted to be a member of,
but however much I desired this I could not afford to come in
under a misapprehension or with a political collar on. When my
friends got news of this letter, most of them thought it best to
withdraw my name, but Harry Harper said he would take the
chance if I would; and, as I had a leaning toward taking chances,
we stood pat. A friend who was present at the meeting of the
committee told me that the chairman read the letter aloud, and
remarked with a good deal of feeling that the Union League
<pb id="wyeth458" n="458"/>
Club needed in its membership a Confederate soldier who could
write such a letter, which sentiments the president indorsed, and I
was unanimously elected. This ended the Civil War for the Union
League and the new member.</p>
          <p>The most gratifying feature of this incident is that the members
of this club seem to have conspired to show me every possible
consideration, official and otherwise. As a token of their
confidence I was placed upon the executive committee and
chairman of this board in the management of the affairs of one of
the strongest social and political organizations in America, of
which nearly every President of the United States, from Lincoln
down, has been a member. It goes without saying that I felt
highly honored and fully appreciative of this great distinction.
When the people of the South and the North get together and
know one another they will forget that there was ever a Mason
and Dixon's line.</p>
          <p>When the Club gave Mr. Taft a brilliant reception in 1911, I was
made chairman of the committee of arrangements, and my first
assistant was General McCook, one of the famous “fighting
McCook” family of Ohio, at whom I had had the pleasure of
shooting more than once, and by whom I had more than once
been chased. On this occasion the General saluted me as his
superior in rank and asked, “What are the orders from the old
Rebel?” I said: “Fall in behind me, Yank—and it's not the first time,
either; for it was a McCook that captured me.” So, hand in hand,
we ancient foemen walked up to pay our respects to the
President of our United States.</p>

FOUNDING THE POLYCLINIC</head>
          <p>THE founding of the New York Polyclinic Medical School and
Hospital in 1881, which marked the introduction of systematic
postgraduate medical instruction in America, was, if not the chief,
at least an important factor in the great movement which, starting
at that period, has revolutionized and carried to a degree
approaching perfection the teaching and practice of medicine and
surgery in the United States. The idea of establishing a
postgraduate course of study came into my mind as a result of
my own necessities. I was graduated in March, 1869, from the
Medical Department of the University of Louisville, after
attending two sessions of lectures of not quite seven months
each.</p>
          <p>Recognized as one of the oldest and best-known of the medical
colleges in the United States, the course of study and the
standard of requirements then prevailing in that institution may be
taken as typical of American methods at that period. There was
no entrance examination. Any white male who had mastered the
rudiments of English was eligible. Neither Latin nor Greek was
essential. The division of subjects was: anatomy, physiology,
surgery, medicine, obstetrics, chemistry, and materia medica.
Anatomy was thoroughly taught in the lectures, supplemented by
dissecting-room work of a high class. In physiology
<pb id="wyeth462" n="462"/>
there were no laboratory exercises, no practical demonstrations
of the living structures nor of the functions of the normal organs.
The teaching of surgery, medicine, and obstetrics was almost
wholly didactic. When an operative clinic was given it was
witnessed at such a distance from the subject, with so much
interruption of vision, that it was impossible to follow closely the
details of technique, without which the lesson of a demonstration
is valueless.</p>
          <p>Not once in my two years of study did I enter the wards of a
hospital or receive instruction by the bedside of a patient. I
witnessed one gynecological clinic and examined one obstetric
patient. I did not witness or assist at a single case of delivery.
Beyond the chemical analysis of urine for albumen and sugar and
the litmus testing reaction I had no laboratory drilling, nor did I
look through a microscope. In proof of my earnestness of
purpose and close application, I may add that during the two
years of study at this school I never attended a theater or place
of idling or amusement, and when not in the lecture-room I was
reading or dissecting.</p>
          <p>It was my good fortune to be graduated 
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">cum laude</foreign></hi> in March,
1869, and I began practice in my home village of Guntersville,
Alabama, in April of that year. The experiment lasted through six
weeks of the most trying and humiliating period of my life. In that
time I performed one surgical operation, under the guidance of my
good preceptor, Dr. James M. Jackson, an ex-army surgeon,
treated a case of lobar pneumonia, attended one delivery, and finally
a fatal case of diabetes mellitus. Upon the death of this patient I
realized that I needed a thorough clinical and laboratory training, and
could not conscientiously practise without it. The story of how the
means to this end were secured
<pb id="wyeth462a" n="462a"/>
<figure id="ill14" entity="wyeth462a"><p>POLYCLINIC MEDICAL SCHOOL AND HOSPITAL, 
341-351 WEST FIFTIETH STREET, NEW YORK</p></figure>
<pb id="wyeth463" n="463"/>
is told elsewhere. I came to New York City in 1872. To my
surprise and disappointment, there was here no opportunity for
the special instruction or training of a graduate, except by
attending the lectures in common with undergraduates. As this
was the best I could do, I took this course at Bellevue Hospital
Medical College, and was graduated <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">ad 
eundem</foreign></hi> in March, 1873.
In April of that year I was appointed assistant demonstrator of
anatomy in this college, where in this capacity and as prosector
to the chair of anatomy and assistant to the professor of
pathology I worked until 1877.</p>
          <p>I had never lost sight of the conviction brought home to me
by my unfortunate experience, that the most perfect theoretical
education could not properly prepare one for the practice of
medicine and surgery unless supplemented by a thorough
practical training, under expert guidance, at the bedside and in the
operating-room and laboratory; and in 1877 I undertook to
organize a school in which such training could be secured.</p>
          <p>The scheme then formulated required for admission a
college degree, or an equivalent classical education, to be
determined by a preliminary examination, and a five-year term of
study, of which three years were to be in the undergraduate and
two in the postgraduate or clinical department. I submitted this
plan to a number of distinguished medical men—among whom
were Doctors J. Marion Sims, Willard Parker, Frank H.
Hamilton, and A. Jacobi. All of them gave it their hearty
approval. On account of the long term of study and rigid
requirements for admission it was realized that in competition
with the short-term colleges such an institution could not be
supported by student fees; and these eminent men, each of
whom had
<pb id="wyeth464" n="464"/>
treated me with marked personal consideration, insisted that an
endowment sufficient to furnish an income which would assure
the payment of current expenses was a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">sine 
qua non</foreign></hi>. For three
years I tried without success to raise the amount deemed
necessary, and finally in the early winter of 1881 I abandoned
the undergraduate feature of the plan, and took up actively the
organization of the Polyclinic as a postgraduate school.
Meanwhile I had visited Europe and had studied the methods in
vogue in London, Paris, Berlin, and Vienna.</p>
          <p>The organization was begun in 1881, and the school was
opened in East Thirty-fourth Street in 1882, with the following
faculty and assignment of subjects:</p>
          <list type="simple">

          </list>
          <p>At the suggestion of Dr. Richard Brandeis, the foreign
appellation of “<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="de">Poliklinik</foreign></hi>”

<figure id="ill15" entity="wyeth464a"><p>[Word in Greek]</p></figure>
(many), and <figure id="ill16" entity="wyeth464b"><p>[Word in Greek]</p></figure>(beds). 
From the day our doors were
opened the success of postgraduate instruction was assured, and
it has become a permanent feature of medical education. As
before stated, it is based upon the recognized fact that no amount
of theoretical teaching in an undergraduate college can turn out a
thoroughly equipped practitioner.</p>

          <p>While a hospital interneship is an ideal method of postgraduate
training, not more than ten to twenty per cent. of graduates can
under present conditions be provided with such interneships. The
remaining large majority must depend for their training upon a
course of practical study under competent specialists in the
various departments of medicine and surgery in a school which is
part of a general hospital and dispensary, and provided with all
the laboratory facilities for analytic work. The Polyclinic
Hospital, with a capacity of three hundred beds, a walking clinic
of between fifty thousand and one hundred thousand cases per
year, has in addition an ambulance and emergency service
covering a district in New York City which includes a population
of three hundred and sixty thousand. The acute medical and
surgical cases which are gathered up by this vast service are
among the most interesting and useful features of its course of
instruction.</p>
          <p>The entire course of study is divided into the following
departments: Clinical medicine and physical diagnosis, diseases of
the digestive system, diseases of children, diseases of the throat
and nose and of the eye, diseases of the nervous system, general
and orthopedic and neurological surgery, diseases of the rectum,
genito-urinary surgery, diseases of the skin, diseases of women,
obstetrics, radiology, electrotherapy, clinical microscopy, urinary
analysis, practical histology, and pathology and bacteriology.</p>
          <p>In the department of internal medicine there is a special
laboratory for instruction in the examination of stomach contents,
alimentary discharges, and the various secretions and excretions.
There is a special laboratory in the department of dermatology
and in general medicine, while the main laboratory of biology is
thoroughly equipped for a
<pb id="wyeth466" n="466"/>
practical training of the practitioner in the use of the microscope
and in chemical analysis and the study of the various reactions.</p>
          <p>The necessity of dividing the classes into small sections is
recognized as the essential feature of thorough postgraduate
training, so that those interested in any particular case may come
in actual contact with the patients. To this end seven operating
and three different medical clinical rooms are often utilized at the
same hour. Realizing the greater value of prolonged and
continuous attendance, a special course is arranged in which the
practitioner resides within the hospital and serves on the assistant
interne staff. To the date of this writing, in 1914, approximately
twenty-five thousand graduates of medicine and surgery have
attended the clinics and courses of study in this institution.</p>

LIGATION OF THE EXTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY</head>
          <p><hi rend="italics">MY Essays on the Surgical Anatomy and Surgery of the
Common External and Internal Carotid Arteries</hi>, made public
in 1878, <hi rend="italics">established as an accepted operative procedure the
ligation of the external carotid artery</hi>. Until that date every
text-book on surgery in the English, French, or German language
advised the application of the ligature to the common trunk, and
<hi rend="italics">not to the external carotid</hi>, in all lesions within 
the distribution of
the external carotid artery. Within two years after the publication
of these essays by the American Medical Association, the text-books
and teachers of surgery had condemned the old operation
and advised the new procedure.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref61" n="61" rend="sc" target="note61">1</ref> 
My attention was attracted to
this subject by a statement made by my teacher in surgery,
Professor Frank H. Hamilton, while I was a student in Bellevue
Medical College. In advising the application of the ligature to the
primitive carotid he gave as the reason that the external carotid
artery differed from all the other arteries of body in the wide
variations in origin and irregularity of the arrangement and
distribution of its branches.</p>
          <p>Believing, as I did, that there could be no exception to the law
of development, I undertook a careful study of this important
vessel, in the course of which I made one hundred
<note id="note61" n="61" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref61">1 
Prominent among the great surgeons of his day, and among the first to
appreciate the value of this operation, was the late Henry B. Sands, Professor of
Surgery at the College of Physicians and Surgeons.</note>
<pb id="wyeth468" n="468"/>
and twenty-one dissections of the surgical triangles of the neck,
measuring accurately with rule and pointers the points of origin
on the six regular branches—<hi rend="italics">viz.</hi>, the 
superior thyroid, lingual, and
facial anteriorly, and the ascending pharyngeal, occipital, and
auricular posteriorly, from the center of bifurcation of the
common trunk and from one another. I proved that this vessel
followed the general law of development; that the range of origin
of each branch was so limited and the variations from the normal
so slight as to offer no difficulty or danger to the application of a
ligature at any point in the course of this artery.</p>
          <p>Extending my investigations into the surgical history of these
vessels, I found that in the entire records of surgery, searched
with great care, the external carotid artery alone had been tied
for lesions within its distribution only sixty-seven times, with a
mortality ratio of four and a half per cent. At the same time I
tabulated seven hundred and eighty-nine cases of ligature of the
common trunk, of which two hundred and fifty-one were for
lesions in the distribution of the external carotid artery, and in
every one of which this latter vessel might have been tied. One
hundred and eight, or forty-three per cent., died.</p>
          <p>Extending these researches to the arch of the aorta, and the
other great vessels springing from it, and desiring to test crucially
the value of the conclusions arrived at, I entered into competition
for the annual prize of the American Medical Association in
1878, and submitted my work as a single essay.</p>
          <p>As far as the carotid arteries are concerned, this was the
conclusion reached at that period:</p>
          <p>The rate of mortality after the ligature of the <hi rend="italics">common carotid</hi>
artery was forty-one per cent.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth469" n="469"/>
          <p>After ligature of the <hi rend="italics">external carotid</hi> the death-rate was four
and a half per cent.</p>
          <p>There was but one conclusion: <hi rend="italics">The common carotid should
never be tied for a lesion of the external carotid or its branches
when there is room enough between the lesions and the
bifurcation of the primitive carotid to permit the ligature of the
external carotid.</hi></p>
          <p>I was led to this conclusion not only by the comparison of the
analysis of seven hundred and eighty-nine cases of ligature of the
<hi rend="italics">common trunk</hi>, with the instances in which the 
<hi rend="italics">external</hi> carotid
had been tied, but also from the analysis of one hundred and
twenty-one dissections of these vessels, made to determine the
relations of these arteries and their branches to one another. I
said at that time: “It would be a waste of time to cite the eminent
authorities in surgery who advise the ligature of the <hi rend="italics">common
trunk</hi> instead of the <hi rend="italics">external</hi>. The teaching and practice is
almost universal. It is as wrong as it is general, as false as it is
dangerous. It is forty-one per centum of deaths in the one to four
and a half per centum in the other.”</p>

                  <p>Your committee to determine the merits of prize essays would respectfully
report: That they have had three separate papers submitted to their inspection.
Two of these papers present subjects of very great interest, and show original
research, but are too imperfect, in the estimation of the committee, to command
a prize. The remaining paper, in the judgment of your committee, is fully up to
the requirements. Indeed, the paper is so elaborate as to fill a large space in the
volume of the Transactions of the Association. The paper should be considered
as <hi rend="italics">two</hi>, and not as <hi rend="italics">one</hi>. The analysis 
of seven hundred and eighty-nine cases of
operation on the carotid artery, and the careful and minute measurements of the
artery and its branches in one hundred and twenty-one subjects, showing the
range of variation and the percentage of the same,
<pb id="wyeth470" n="470"/>
followed by inferences, bold and original, naturally constitutes a paper complete in
itself. Another one on the same plan, with reference to the innominate and
subclavian arteries, being an analysis of three hundred cases and the observation 
of fifty-two subjects, is presented to us in such a manner that we may consider the
whole as one prize, or they may compete for both.</p>
                  <p>Your committee believes that both prizes should be awarded to the two essays

          <p>The publication and wide distribution of these investigations
by the National Association added materially to the immediate
general acceptance of the operation of ligation of the external
carotid artery which now prevails. As an indication of the change
of view which was brought about, the following is quoted from the
American edition of Sir Thomas Bryant's <hi rend="italics">Manual for the
Practice of Surgery</hi>, from the chapter devoted to this subject:</p>
          <p>“In this connection the views of Dr. John A. Wyeth, of New York, deserve
great attention; for, in his prize essays, presented to the American Medical
Association in 1878, he has investigated the subject of ligation of the primitive
carotid artery and its branches with such painstaking
accuracy that his paper will deservedly become classical. He has collected and
analyzed seven hundred and eighty-nine cases of ligation
of the common carotid artery, ninety-one instances of ligation of the
external and eighteen of ligation of the internal carotid. In addition he has given
accurate measurements of the arteries in one hundred and twenty-one subjects,
showing the range of variation and the position of branches.
His inferences from this astonishing amount of research are at variance
in some respects with the surgical teaching and practice of the day; but
it would seem that the profession must be in the wrong rather than
who has considered the subject in such a thorough and scientific manner.”</p>
          <p>In the practice of to-day, under modern aseptic conditions,
<pb id="wyeth471" n="471"/>
the death-rate after deligation of the external carotid artery
is practically nil. I have tied it more than two hundred times
without secondary hemorrhage or a fatality. In three instances
the catgut ligature was applied in the crotch of bifurcation and
included in its grasp the superior thyroid at its origin.

BLOODLESS AMPUTATION AT THE HIP-JOINT AND AT THE
SHOULDER</head>
          <p>THE method of controlling hemorrhage in so formidable an
operation as removal of the lower extremity by amputation and
disarticulation at the coxo-femoral joint was devised by me, and
first performed successfully upon a living subject at the New
York Polyclinic Medical School and Hospital in 1889. This case
was reported in the <hi rend="italics">New York Medical Record</hi>, and the
procedure was the subject of a paper read at the meeting of the
American Medical Association at Nashville, 1890.</p>
          <p>The <hi rend="italics">History of Surgery</hi> contains a long list of ingenious
methods in the effort to reduce the mortality of this operation,
which for gunshot wounds in the American Civil War reached
the high mortality ratio of ninety-three per cent., of which
Professor John Ashurst in his great work on surgery wrote as
late as 1881: “The removal of the lower limb at the coxo-femoral
articulation may be properly regarded as the gravest operation
that the surgeon is ever called upon to perform, and it is only
within a comparatively recent period that it has been accepted as
a justifiable procedure. The most pressing risk is that of
hemorrhage.”</p>
          <p>Dr. Walter Brashear, of Bardstown, Kentucky, in a case of
compound fracture of the femur near the hip, in August, 1806,
applied a constricting tourniquet to the limb just below
<pb id="wyeth473" n="473"/>
the hip, amputated the soft parts six inches beyond, tying all
the vessels while the tourniquet was in place, then dividing the
bone at this level, and after all hemorrhage was controlled by the
ligature he successfully enucleated the broken particles of the
shaft, together with the head of the femur. The method of this
pioneer attracted no attention, and was not cited in the text-books
on surgery.</p>
          <p>The first real advance came with the introduction of Esmarch's
elastic bandage. In the <hi rend="italics">Lancet</hi>, 1883 (Volume 1, page 897),
Jourdan-Lloyd described the following method: “A strip of black
India-rubber bandage about two yards long is doubled and passed
between the thighs, its center lying between the tuber ischii of the
side to be operated on and the anus. The ends are drawn tight,
one in front and one behind, to a point above the center of the
iliac crest.” By this method there was secured a fair degree of
compression upon the external iliac artery.</p>
          <p>Trendelenburg endeavored to improve on this method by
adding transfixion with a single strong mattress-needle which was
passed in front of the neck of the femur and beneath the great
vessels. A rubber cord in figure-of-eight fashion was carried over
the ends in front, compressing only the anterior and most vascular
portion of the flap. Fourneaux advised a figure-of-eight rubber
spica, using the Esmarch bandage in practically the same manner
as in the Jourdan-Lloyd method.</p>
          <p>Richard Volkmann endeavored to control hemorrhage by
elastic circular constriction without needles. His three cases were
reported in the <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="de">Deutsche Klinik</foreign></hi> 
of 1868, <hi rend="italics">but in each case a
preliminary ligature of the femoral was done</hi>. That his method
was not accepted is evident in the fact that neither in Billroth and
Luecke's <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="de">Deutsche Chirurgie</foreign></hi>, 
in the <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="de">Handbuch</foreign></hi>
<pb id="wyeth474" n="474"/>
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="de">der Chirurgie</foreign></hi> by Von Pitha, 
the works of Linhart, nor in the
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="de">Centralblatt fur Chirurgie</foreign></hi> or 
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="de">Klinische Vortrage</foreign></hi>, of which
Volkmann himself was an editor, is there any mention or
description of this procedure. I had never read or heard of
Volkmann's discarded operation until several years after my
method had been made public and had been immediately and
generally accepted by the profession.</p>
          <p>Operation: The patient, properly prepared, is placed with the
sacrum resting upon the corner of the operating-table
corresponding to the member to be removed. The sound limb and
arms are wrapped with cotton batting and other parts of the body
well protected from unnecessary loss of heat. The extremity to be
amputated should be emptied of blood by elevation of the foot,
aided by the Trendelenburg posture, and, when the conditions
justify, the use of the Esmarch bandage. This may be applied
commencing at the toes, and while forcing the blood into the trunk
it should never come nearer than within twelve inches of the distal
margin of the neoplasm or seat of disease. In cases of infection,
where varicosities with possible thrombosis are present, and after
injuries with extensive destruction, elevation and gravitation must
be relied upon to carry the blood from the part to be removed into
the body. While the member is elevated and the partial
Trendelenburg position is still maintained, and before the Esmarch
bandage is removed, when this has been employed, the rubber-tubing
constrictor is applied. <hi rend="italics">The object of this is the complete closure
of every vessel above the level of the hip-joint, permitting the
disarticulation to be completed and the vessels tied without
hemorrhage and before the tourniquet is removed.</hi></p>
          <p>To prevent the possibility of the tourniquet slipping, I
employ two strong needles or skewers of steel about
<pb id="wyeth475" n="475"/>
three-sixteenths of an inch in diameter and eight inches long. One is
introduced one-quarter of an inch below the anterior superior
spine of the ilium, and slightly to the inner or central side of this
prominence, and is made to traverse superficially for about three
inches the muscles and deep fascia on the outer side of the hip,
emerging on a level with the point of entrance. The point of the
second needle is thrust through the skin and tendon of origin of
the adductor longus muscle half an inch below the crotch, the
point emerging an inch below the tuber ischii. The points should
be at once shielded with cork. No vessels or nerves are near or
are endangered by these skewers. A mat or compress of sterile
gauze about two inches thick and four inches square is laid over
the femoro-iliac artery and vein near where they cross the brim of
the pelvis, and over this a piece of strong rubber tubing, half an
inch in diameter when unstretched and long enough when in
position to go five or six times around the thigh, is now wound
very tightly around and above the fixation needles and secured. If
the Esmarch bandage has been employed, it is now removed.</p>
          <p>In the formation of the flaps the surgeon must be guided by the
condition of the parts within the field of operation, and will modify
the following method, which, when possible, I prefer: About six
inches below the tourniquet a circular incision is made down to
the muscles, and this is joined by a longitudinal incision
commencing at the tourniquet and passing over the trochanter
major. A cuff that includes everything down to the muscles is
dissected off to near the level of the trochanter minor. At about
this level the remaining soft parts, together with the vessels, are
divided squarely down to the bone by a circular cut. At this stage
of the operation the central ends of the divided femoral
<pb id="wyeth476" n="476"/>
vessels are in plain view and should be tied with good-sized catgut.
This done, the disarticulation is rapidly completed with knife or
scissors, by lifting the muscular insertions from the trochanters
and digital fossa, keeping very close to the bone and holding the
soft parts away with retractors.</p>
          <p>The capsular ligament is now exposed and divided, and by
forcible elevation, adduction, and rotation of the femur it is widely
opened, the ligamentum teres ruptured, and the caput femoris
dislocated. If properly conducted up to this point, not a drop of
blood has escaped, except that which was in the limb below the
constrictor when this was applied. The remaining vessels which
require the ligature should now be sought for and secured. These
are, first, the saphena vein, which, on account of its proximity to
the main trunk, should be tied; the sciatic artery, which will be
found near the stump of the sciatic nerve; the obturator, which is
situated between the stump of the adductor brevis and magnus,
usually about half-way from the center of the shaft of the femur to
the inner side of the thigh, the vessel being on a level with the
anterior surface of the femur; the descending branches of the
external circumflex, two or three in number, usually found about an
inch and a half outward and downward from the main femoral
vessels beneath the rectus and in the substance of the cruræus
and vastus externus. The descending branches of the internal
circumflex are insignificant, and are usually found on the level of
the femoral vessels in the substance of the adductor longus, and
between it and the adductor brevis and pectinæus.</p>
          <p>In tying the larger femoral vessels I make it a rule to dissect
both the superficial and deep femoral stumps back from one-half
to three-quarters of an inch, so that I can apply the ligature behind
any of their branches which may have
<pb id="wyeth477" n="477"/>
been divided close to their points of origin, and I do not hesitate to
include the large veins in the same ligature in order to save time.
With the vessels I have mentioned quickly secured, there is really
no necessity for even temporarily loosening the tourniquet. If the
operator is not sure that he has found and securely placed the
ligatures upon these larger vessels, it is a simple matter to loosen
slowly the grasp of the tourniquet until the pulsation of the larger
trunks is perceptible.</p>
          <p>In order to hasten the operation and stop the oozing I introduce
a snug packing of sterile ribbon-gauze into the cavity of the
acetabulum and the space between the muscles from which the
bone has been removed, leaving one end of the gauze to pass
between the flaps for the purpose of removal. With a long,
half-carved Hagedorn-Fowler needle, armed with good-sized
catgut, deep mattress sutures are passed through the stumps of the
divided muscles in such a way that large masses of muscle are
brought tightly together when these sutures are tied, including two
to four inches in the grasp of each suture. The needle is not
passed in the proximity of the large vessels or the sciatic nerve,
but in all other directions the muscles are rapidly quilted together.
This effectually and rapidly controls all oozing. The pins are now
removed. Nothing remains but to close the flaps with silkworm
gut sutures and apply a dressing of sterile gauze held snugly in
place by a figure-of-eight bandage around the stump and the
pelvis.</p>
          <p>The death-rate after amputation at the hip-joint by this method
of hemostasis and asepsis is reduced now to about six per cent. in
disease and twelve per cent. in traumatic cases.</p>
          <p>In the <hi rend="italics">Annals of Surgery</hi>, September, 1895, Dr. John F.
<pb id="wyeth478" n="478"/>
Erdmann reports that from January, 1884, to January, 1895 (the
aseptic period), there were eighteen hip-joint amputations done in
Bellevue, Roosevelt, St. Luke's, Mt. Sinai, Chambers Street,
German, and Presbyterian hospitals in New York City, with eight
deaths, a mortality of 44.4 per cent. Of the eighteen patients
seven were operated on by my method as above given, and all
recovered, leaving eight fatal cases in eleven amputations by other
methods, a death-rate of 72.7 per cent. I do not claim that such a
death-rate as this would follow other methods of operation; but I
do insist that my method of hemostasis is so simple and generally
applicable that it removes from the procedure all possible danger
of operative hemorrhage.</p>
          <p>It was a matter of gratification to the author that by the leading
surgeons of his time this method of hemostasis was generally
accepted and practised. Of it Professor W. W. Keen in a report
dated January, 1892, says:</p>
          <p>“It was reserved for an American surgeon to devise what is
undoubtedly the best method, and, in fact, what I think we can
now call the only method of hemostasis in amputation at the
hip-joint.” Dr. Charles McBurney, surgeon-in-chief of the Roosevelt
Hospital, remarks, “No other appliance that has been suggested
for the purpose could in any way compare in utility with that of
Dr. Wyeth.” Dr. J. S. Horsely, professor of surgery in the
Medical College of Virginia, Richmond: “No more blood was lost
than in an amputation through the thigh. It remained for Dr.
Wyeth to so perfect this method as to make amputation
practically a bloodless operation.” Dr. Wm. F. Fluhrer, of New
York, says, “As little blood was lost as in an ordinary amputation
at the middle of the thigh.”</p>
          <p>Being called upon early in 1889 to remove the upper
<pb id="wyeth479" n="479"/>
extremity for a large sarcoma, which involved the head of the
humerus and a portion of the scapula and which required removal
of the soft parts as well as the acromion process of the scapula, I
devised and practised successfully the following operation:</p>
          <p>The arm was emptied of blood in the same manner as outlined
for the lower extremity. With the large skewer the skin, together
with the substance of the pectoralis major muscle for about three
inches, was transfixed about the same distance from the
shoulder-joint. The second needle was passed through the tissues of the
dorsum scapulæ at the same level and for the same distance. The
rubber tube was now wound five or six times around the shoulder
above these needles, making strong traction. The incision for the
flap was made to conform to the conditions which were present.
The ideal amputation here is a circular incision through the skin
down to the deep fascia about four inches below the shoulder-joint.
This should be dissected upward for one inch in the entire
circumference of the arm, at which point the muscles, nerves,
vessels, and all the soft tissues are divided down to the bones. A
longitudinal incision is then made from the acromion directly
downward, joining with the circular incision and dividing
everything to the periosteum. From the bone the soft tissues are
now lifted by dissection, the capsule divided, disarticulation
performed, and the blood-vessels are tied. The tourniquet may at
this stage be slightly loosened in order to be sure that no bleeding
points are overlooked. The wound is then closed with silkworm
gut sutures, leaving a good-sized ten-day catgut drain leading out
from the most dependent angle into the dressing, which is held in
place by a figure-of-eight bandage around the stump, neck, and
chest.</p>

THE TREATMENT OF VASCULAR TUMORS (ANGIOMATA) BY THE
INJECTION INTO THEIR SUBSTANCE OF WATER AT A HIGH
TEMPERATURE</head>
          <p>IN dealing in 1901 with a large congenital, vascular neoplasm
(“venous angioma,” or “cavernous nævus”) of the right lower jaw,
chin, and neck of a woman twenty years old, the removal of
which by dissection had been twice attempted and abandoned
(once by myself) on account of bleeding, I conceived the idea of
coagulating the blood and lymph in the vessels involved by
injecting into the general substance of the tumor water at a
temperature sufficiently high to produce coagulation of these
liquids, and yet not hot enough to destroy the normal fascia and
integument. I reasoned that aseptic coagulation would do away
with the excessive vascularity of the mass, and that the
coagulated material would ultimately disappear by granular
metamorphosis. The result was the fulfilment of every
expectation.</p>
          <p>Under ether narcosis, on July 14, 1901, for the first time the
following operation was successfully performed in the
amphitheater of the New York Polyclinic Medical School and
Hospital:</p>
          <p>The patient's face and body were thoroughly protected with a
thick matting of sterile gauze, through which a hole was cut just
large enough to permit the surface of the tumor to be seen. An
all-metal-steel syringe, especially devised
<pb id="wyeth481" n="481"/>
by me, and manufactured by the Kny-Scheerer Company, was
filled with boiling water. Protecting my fingers with two pairs of
gloves, the water was kept at the boiling-temperature up to the
moment of injection by holding underneath the barrel of the
syringe a large alcohol-lamp (when the larger syringes are used
the Bunsen burner is preferable). A gauze mat was then held in
front of the needle-point to prevent the escaping steam from
scalding the exposed skin, and as it reached the surface of the
tumor, the needle was projected through this and carried deeply
into the substance of the mass. This precaution is very
necessary.</p>
          <p>Carrying the needle to the deepest portion of the tumor, before
beginning the injection, an assistant was directed to make digital
compression over the external and internal jugular veins on that
side to prevent the possibility of embolism. The hot water was
now forced in, injecting about twenty minims at one point,
withdrawing the syringe about one-half of an inch, and repeating
this performance by reinserting the needle along parallel lines
until the tumor was solidified. It should afford to the touch the
elastic resistance of a hard-boiled egg from which the shell
has been removed.</p>
          <p>In five minutes the compression over the jugulars was
removed. Although the sense of heat was about as much as the
hand could comfortably endure, the skin over the tumor did not
slough, and the solidified mass underwent absorption. There was
no pain after the patient became conscious and no elevation of
body temperature. Two subsequent minor operations with local
cocaine anesthesia were done in this case to coagulate small
areas which had escaped the first injection.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth482" n="482"/>
          <p>I have now employed this method in a very considerable
number of cases of venous angioma, and have succeeded in
curing or arresting the growth of the neoplasm in every case, and,
with the exception of an occasional slough on account of too
great heat, without accident.</p>
          <p>In cases of arterial angioma (cirsoid aneurism) this method
may be safely employed without the possibility of embolism. I
have used it with gratifying results in two instances, and other
surgeons have been equally successful. On account of the
newness of the procedure I include here the report of a single
case:</p>
          <p>Miss S. C., age twenty-seven, came under observation in
January, 1902, on account of a large, pulsating tumor covering
one-half of the left side of the scalp, and measuring five by six inches,
with an elevation above the level of the normal scalp varying from
one-half an inch to an inch. On the surface there were several
large cicatrices which had resulted from attempts to strangulate it
by ligature. Leading into this tumor were five arteries which could
be distinctly seen pulsating with an increasing twisting movement
as they approached a junction with the cork-screw-like vessels
which composed the mass. Two of these came from the left
temporal, one from the right temporal, and one from each occipital
artery. It had grown rapidly within the last year. The operation
above described was repeated in this instance with complete
success. A unique feature of interest was an extensive edema
which spread over the entire head and face, closing the eyes and
extending half-way down the neck. Eleven years have passed,
and this patient has remained entirely cured.</p>
          <p>In capillary angioma, or birthmark, usually seen in infants
and young children, I have used this method in a large number
<pb id="wyeth483" n="483"/>
of cases, but not with the success which has attended the
treatment of the venous or arterial neoplasms.</p>
          <p>The abnormal epidermal covering of this type of nævus is
non-resistant and sloughs as a result of the heat required to coagulate
the liquids present. Great care is necessary to prevent scalding
the contiguous normal skin. It is my rule to inject these small
areas carefully with only a few minims, in this way to arrest the
spread of the growth and then remove the resulting scar by excision
and suture. When this method was made public before the surgical
section of the American Medical Association in 1903 it was stated in the
discussion which ensued that the principle of decreasing
vascularity by coagulation of the contents of the vessels might be
applied in the treatment of tumors of the thyroid. While I have had no
personal experience in treating this form of neoplasm by this method, a
number of successful cases have been reported by Dr. Miles F. Porter, of
Fort Wayne, Indiana.</p>
          <p>The following case describes a procedure I devised to prevent
the possibilities of cerebral embolism by temporarily reversing the
direction of the blood-current in the internal carotid artery:</p>
          <p>The patient, a mechanic of nineteen years, who, with the
exception of the lesion here described, was in perfect physical
condition, came under observation in the Polyclinic Hospital in
1907. Situated on the side of the neck in the line of the internal and
external jugular veins, below the angle of the left jaw, was a
vascular neoplasm which measured about three inches in two
directions, and projected well beyond the level of the inferior
maxilla, the tumor having a thickness of between two and three
inches. It was of bluish color and without pulsation. By steady
compression
<pb id="wyeth484" n="484"/>
it could be practically emptied of blood and reduced almost
to the natural level of the neck. When the pressure was released
it filled rapidly and resumed its former size.</p>
          <p>On account of the intimate relation of this tumor to the
common internal and external carotid arteries, the external and
internal jugular veins, and the pneumogastric, sympathetic, facial,
and spinal accessory nerves, I hesitated to employ the hot-water
method for fear of causing an embolism in the jugular vein or the
internal carotid artery or of injuring one or more of the nerves.
An attempt to extirpate the mass was accompanied by such
profuse hemorrhage that it was abandoned, and later I
successfully carried out the following procedure:</p>
          <p>To prevent the possibility of pulmonic embolism the internal
jugular was exposed near the clavicle and temporarily occluded
by passing around it a large-sized catgut ligature, which was
twisted and held firmly by an artery clamp. A similar ligature was
then thrown around the common carotid artery at the same level,
and this vessel was in like manner temporarily occluded. <hi rend="italics">The
object of this last ligature was to reverse the current of blood
in the internal carotid</hi> of this side, for as soon as the normal
flow from the heart to the brain was stopped by this ligature the
current was of necessity supplied from the opposite internal
carotid through the direct and free arterial anastomosis (the circle
of Willis) between these two vessels. Under such conditions any
embolism caused by the water would be swept downward and
into the distribution of the external carotid, without danger to the
integrity of the brain.</p>
          <p>The boiling water was then injected, and the mass became
solid. I waited fifteen minutes to satisfy myself of the absence of
coagulum in the internal jugular, which could
<pb id="wyeth485" n="485"/>
readily have been recognized by the sense of touch. I then
removed this ligature and that around the common carotid. There
was no paralysis and no change in the pupils during or after the
operation. The patient made an uninterrupted recovery, has been
kept under observation, and now, after more than five years, is
entirely well. There is no suggestion of a tumor or swelling in the
neck, the two sides being symmetrical and normal.</p>

DEMONSTRATION BY EXPERIMENTAL STUDIES ON ANIMALS
AND BY OPERATIONS ON HUMAN BEINGS OF THE PROCESS
OF PERMANENT ARTERIAL OCCLUSION AFTER DELIGATION</head>
          <p>I PRESENTED to the New York Pathological Society, on April
26, 1882, a series of specimens which showed the results
obtained by the use of broad animal ligatures applied to arteries in
continuity. One of these specimens was the common carotid
artery of a woman, which I tied in September, 1881, using the
sciatic nerve of a calf which had been made asceptic by
treatment in carbolic-acid solution. This tape-like ligature was not
quite one-fourth of an inch in width. The artery was tied just
tightly enough to arrest entirely the circulation without doing
violence to the inner elastic layer. The patient died seven months
after the operation from an intercurrent disease. The artery was
completely occluded in the area compressed by the ligature, and
its continuity was unbroken. There was a slight depression,
one-fourth of an inch in width, which marked the exact location of the
ligature, every other trace of which had disappeared.</p>
          <p>I presented at the same meeting the carotid and subclavian
arteries of another patient, which I had tied with a broad ligature
made of ox aorta after the method of Mr. Richard Barwell, of
London. This operation had been done for the cure of aneurism
of the ascending segment of the aorta, which operation had
proved successful. The patient
<pb id="wyeth487" n="487"/>
died one year later from entero-colitis. The occlusion of the
arteries was complete, and the conditions the same as in the case
first reported.</p>
          <p>I also presented the carotid artery of a large dog tied
experimentally with the nerve ligature, similar to that used in the
case of the woman above reported. The animal was killed five
weeks later, and, as shown, the artery was completely occluded
and the continuity of the inner layer seemingly unbroken.</p>
          <p>In another specimen the carotid artery of a horse was shown.
In the application of this ligature, the lumen of the vessel was
intentionally not entirely occluded, permitting a portion of the
blood current to pass through. Mounted sections of these arteries
showed active proliferation in all the normal cells of the arterial
wall, most marked in the connective tissue group. THEY
DEMONSTRATED THAT ARTERIAL OCCLUSION WAS THE
DIRECT RESULT OF CELL PROLIFERATION AND THE
RESULTING FIBRILLATION AND CONTRACTION OF THE
NEW CELLS OF THE INFLAMMATORY PROCESS CAUSED
BY THE TRAUMATISM OR IRRITATION OF THE
CONSTRICTING BAND OR LIGATURE.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref63" n="63" rend="sc" target="note63">1</ref></p>
          <p>Scarpa had advanced the idea many years before that it was
not necessary to constrict an artery with a ligature forcibly
enough to break even the inner elastic layer. Jameson, of
Baltimore, with this same idea in mind, had later recommended
broad animal ligatures made of deer-tendon, <hi rend="italics">but the fact that the clot
was an accident of rather than a factor in arterial occlusion after the
ligature, and that closure was due to cell proliferation, was now for
the first time demonstrated.</hi></p>

CONTRIBUTION TO THE STUDY OF THE EFFECT OF
STREPTOCOCCUS AND PYOGENIC INFECTION
UPON SARCOMA</head>
          <p>JOSEPH PHILLIPS, twenty-eight years old, of Gainesville,
Texas, came under my observation in 1884, with the following
history:</p>
          <p>A year previous he had received a blow on the abdomen over
the right iliac region, which was followed by induration and the
development of a neoplasm. At the time of the examination the
tumor was four by six inches in surface measurement and about
three and one-half inches in thickness. On account of the
involvement of the abdominal wall it was found impossible to
remove it. A section extending almost entirely through the mass
was excised, and examined by Dr. William H. Welch and two
other competent pathologists. The diagnosis of each was
spindle-cell sarcoma. Having noticed in a current medical
periodical the report of a case of sarcoma said to have been
cured by the direct injection into its substance of Fowler's solution
of arsenic, I advised this treatment, and began with injections in
two or more portions of the mass of from one to three minims of
the solution, gradually increasing the quantity to as much as ten
minims. These were repeated daily for four or five days, then
every other day for about ten days. They became so painful that
at the patient's request the treatment was discontinued.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth490" n="490"/>
          <p>The gradually increasing pain was occasioned no doubt by a
pyogenic infection which had supervened in and near several of
the punctures. This spread over the entire tumor, which became
red and swollen, and pitted on pressure. The skin did not have the
glazed or “stove-polish” appearance of erysipelas, but rather the
look of a severe dermatitis. The infection proved to be in part
pyogenic, and several incisions were necessary to permit the free
discharge of pus. The patient suffered very considerably from the
high temperatures due to aseptic absorption, but after a period of
about two weeks the swelling began to diminish in size, and with
this there was a general improvement in his condition. Four
months later his physician, Dr. A. H. Conson, of Gainesville,
informed me that the tumor had entirely disappeared. The patient
regained his former condition of health and survived, without
recurrence, eighteen years, and until a few days before his death
from acute pneumonia was hale and hearty, his weight at that
time being one hundred and seventy pounds.</p>
          <p>So far as I am able to learn this was the first known case of a
cure of sarcoma by an infective process other than erysipelas,
and this experience has since been confirmed in a number of
instances, one of the most remarkable and instructive of which is
the following:</p>
          <p>A man from Augusta, Georgia, aged thirty-five, consulted me
in 1893 in regard to a large intra-abdominal tumor occupying
the right hypochondriac region. He was anemic,
greatly emaciated, and had the marked cachexia of a malignant
growth. On account of ascites he had been tapped on three
occasions, and I removed at one operation five gallons of fluid
from the peritoneal cavity. With the collapse of the abdominal
wall there was felt a hard, round,
<pb id="wyeth491" n="491"/>
slightly movable tumor, four or five inches in diameter, which was
exposed by a longitudinal incision of about six inches. To the
touch the tumor was firm, slightly elastic, and occupied the space
between the stomach and the liver, having developed from the
gastro-hepatic omentum. It was of a reddish-brown color, and
covered in front with a network of large vessels.</p>
          <p>On account of its vascularity and the feeble condition of the
patient I did not venture to remove a section for microscopic
examination, but from its location and microscopic appearance I
have no doubt that it was a sarcoma. The edges of the abdominal
incision were retracted so as to permit about one-third of the
anterior surface of the mass to be delivered into the wound, while
sterile gauze was inserted around the edges to secure adhesions
and to prevent any general peritoneal infection from the exposed
mass, which was now covered with loose gauze. Three days later
this packing was removed, and the wound and the exposed
surface of the tumor were permitted to become infected.
Suppuration was soon established, the dressings were changed
daily, and within two weeks' time there was a noticeable
diminution in the size of the mass and an improvement in the
patient's general condition. This wound was kept open and
allowed to suppurate for about two months, at the end of which
time, as well as I could estimate, the neoplasm had diminished
about one-half its original size.</p>
          <p>After the wound healed the shrinkage continued, and six
months after the operation it had disappeared. The patient's
general health became better from day to day. Five years later I
operated on him for hemorrhoids. A few years after his recovery
he married, and is the father of a
<pb id="wyeth492" n="492"/>
number of children, and to-day, after a lapse of more than twenty
years, is in the enjoyment of excellent health. The ascites was
evidently caused by direct pressure of the heavy tumor upon the
portal vein. Its delivery into the wound and subsequent adhesions
to the anterior abdominal wound lifted it and held it, leaving the
vein free.</p>
          <p>There was admitted to Mt. Sinai Hospital in 1882, in the service
of my colleague, Dr. A. G. Gerster, a young woman suffering
with sarcoma of the leg, for which an amputation was made just
below the knee. A recurrence took place, followed by a hip-joint
disarticulation. The disease again appeared in the stump,
developing rapidly into an extensive, cauliflower-like mass which
became accidentally infected with erysipelas. This infection ran
the usual course of erysipelas, during the progress of which the
tumor began to diminish in size and eventually entirely
disappeared. In 1907, more than twenty-five years after this
experience, when this patient was last heard from, she was
entirely well, and still actively engaged in her work as a
school-teacher.</p>
          <p>The experiments of Fehleisen and others by direct infection
with the streptococcus erysipelatis have confirmed the result in
the case above narrated; but as far as I am able to inform myself
the two cases here reported are the first on record in which a
cure of sarcoma was effected by pyogenic infection, the one
accidental, the other intentional.</p>
          <p>In a paper on the “Frequency of Recurrence of Sarcoma, with
Special Reference to Amputation at the Hip-joint on Account of
this Neoplasm,” read before the Philadelphia Academy of Surgery
in April, 1901, I submitted an analysis of the results in one hundred
and ninety-one amputations at this joint, by my “bloodless method,”
on account of
<pb id="wyeth493" n="493"/>
sarcoma chiefly affecting the femur, but in a few instances
involving the other connective tissues of the thigh and the hip. I
was profoundly impressed with the frequency of recurrence in
remote organs. In the fifty-three recurring cases in which the
histories were accepted as reliable the seat of metastasis was in
the lung alone in twenty-three, lung and bronchi one, lung and
pleura one, lung and abdomen one, pleura two, abdominal viscera
three, liver one, abdomen and chest one, in the stump ten, stump
and mesenteric glands one, stump and general metastasis one,
stump and iliac-fossa one, lymphatic glands of groin one,
sacro-iliac synchondrosis one, location not given four, and in one
instance apoplexy was given as the cause of death.</p>
          <p>My conclusions were: first, that the cells or germs, prior to
amputation, had been carried from the original focus of the
disease, lodged in these various remote organs, and there awaited
conditions favorable to their further proliferation; second, that
after amputation (or extirpation of sarcoma) the patient should be
subjected to the immunizing influence of a streptococcus and
pyogenic infection. This I practise in all instances, and in a fair
proportion with gratifying results. I rely so confidently upon the
beneficial effects of this treatment that instead of amputating high
up at the hip-joint, as I did formerly, I now divide the bone in the
non-involved portion within six inches of the location of the tumor.</p>
          <p>The operation is done with the usual aseptic precautions, and
the flaps sutured, leaving about one inch of an angle open,
through which a twist of gauze half an inch thick is inserted, one
end deep in the wound, the other protruding. At the end of the
second week the gauze twist is replaced by another, which has
been soaked in fresh culture of pyogenic
<pb id="wyeth494" n="494"/>
streptococcus. The patient's temperature is kept at from 100° to 103°
Fahrenheit for three weeks by reinfection when necessary. Then
a rest for ten days, and a final reinfection practised for two more
weeks, when the sinus is allowed to close.</p>
          <p>After removal of a sarcoma of the soft tissues the same
method is followed.</p>
          <p>While in the present state of our knowledge a large proportion
of cases of sarcoma will end fatally, without regard to the
treatment instituted, every case, after removal of the original
focus when possible (or without this in nonoperative cases),
should be treated with the alternative of mixed infection with the
pyogenic streptococcus cultures. That in a certain proportion of
cases this injection destroys the cells or germs already deposited
remote from the parent neoplasm and effects a permanent cure I
have no doubt. A very considerable list of such cures in my own
experience has emphasized this conviction.</p>

THE SURGICAL ANATOMY AND SURGERY OF THE TIBIO-TARSAL
ARTICULATION, WITH SPECIAL REFERENCE TO A
MODIFICATION OF SYME'S AMPUTATION <ref targOrder="U" id="ref64" n="64" rend="sc" target="note64">1</ref></head>
          <p>PROFESSOR STEPHEN SMITH in his clinical lectures at Bellevue
and in his <hi rend="italics">Operative Surgery</hi> in 1874 stated that on account of
sloughing of the inner-posterior flap after Syme's method of
disarticulation at the ankle-joint as then performed, the necessity
for reamputation was three per cent. greater than after any other
amputation. In the effort to discover the cause of this sloughing I
made eighty-seven dissections of the region involved, with special
regard to the distribution of the blood-supply to the heel. It was
demonstrated that the line of incision well back over the point of
the heel as commonly advised and practised in this amputation
divided the vessels so far back that the ligature occluded the
recurrent branches which were essential to the nourishment of
the flap. The modification advised was to carry the incision across
the sole well forward, making a longer posterior and a shorter
anterior flap.</p>
          <p>The modified procedure is as follows:</p>

axis of the leg, place the thumb at the tip of one malleolus, and the
index at the other, and from the center of the malleolus internus
carry an incision directly across the sole of the foot to a point
one-fourth of an inch anterior to the tip of the malleolus externus. This
incision should divide all the tissues to the bones, and its
perpendicular portion should descend in a direction slightly anterior
to the axis of the tibia. The ends of this cut are united by a second,
which arches sharply upward about on the line of section of the
bones, and should also divide tendons and all intervening
structures, opening into the joint. The foot should now be firmly
grasped and extended, so as to make tense the anterior ligament
of the ankle, which is easily divided. Carrying the knife to either
side of the articular surfaces of the astragalus, the lateral
ligaments are cut, and the joint thus widely exposed. An assistant
now holds and depresses the foot, while the operator carefully
dissects the tissues closely from the astragalus and calcaneum.
Care should be taken not to bruise the flap by too great traction. In
dissecting along the inner surface of the ankle the knife should be
kept close to the bones, so that when the lesser process of the
calcaneum is reached it will slide behind and under this process,
passing between it and the flexor tendon and the vessels. If this
precaution is not taken the arteries may be wounded and the
nutrition of the flap seriously impaired.</p>
          <p>As the dissection proceeds the foot is further depressed, and
the tendo Achillis separated from its insertion into the tuberosity
of the calcaneum, in doing which care must be taken not to
buttonhole the flap. The posterior portion of the os calcis may
now be brought through the joint and the dissection continued in
this direction or finished by
<pb id="wyeth497" n="497"/>
working back along the under surface of this bone. After the foot
is removed the flaps are lifted from the tibia and fibula until a
section of these bones can be made just on the level of the
anterior margin of the tibia. It is not necessary to remove the
articular surface. The flaps should now be trimmed and fitted, and
the vessels tied. As the sutures are applied it will be noticed that
there is a redundancy of tissue in the long flap, leaving a
cup-shaped cavity; but this can be thoroughly drained from the angles
of the wound, and disappears when the stump is healed.</p>

TRANSPLANTING SKIN FROM THE ABDOMEN OR
OTHER PARTS OF THE BODY TO THE HAND OR
FOREARM—TRANSFERRING THE GRAFT BY THIS
MEANS TO THE FACE, NECK, OR ELSEWHERE</head>
          <p>IN the case of a boy who had suffered a very severe burn on
the wrist I devised an operation for the transplantation of skin (<hi rend="italics">en
masse</hi>), from the abdomen or other available parts of the body,
which has given great satisfaction. As far as I have been able to
inform myself it was a novel procedure. For a width of from two
to three inches, and for the entire circumference of the wrist, the
integument had been completely destroyed by the ignition of a
celluloid cuff. The tendons were in general adherent to the dense
cicatricial belt. This was entirely dissected away, freeing the
flexor and extensor tendons and the nerves.</p>
          <p>To fill in this extensive deficiency a cuff of skin was taken
from the abdomen. The forearm, flexed at ninety degrees, was
laid across the belly in a position to insure the minimum of
discomfort; and just beneath the location of the dissection at the
wrist parallel perpendicular incisions as wide apart as the area to
be covered by the graft were made through the skin and
subcutaneous fat. Leaving both ends attached, this long band, or
ribbon, of skin was dissected up, removing all the subcutaneous
fat for the central two inches. Careful measurements were
made to insure the proper width and length of the cuff.</p>
          <pb id="wyeth499" n="499"/>
          <p>The wound from which the flap was raised was closed at once
by silk-worm gut sutures. When a wide area is uncovered it may
be necessary to dissect subcutaneously on either side in order to
approximate the edges without too great tension. The hand,
resting upon a pad of dry sterile gauze, was then carried beneath
the flap, the raw edges of which were carefully stitched to the
edges of the skin upon the dorsum radii. A plaster-of-Paris
dressing was applied to within two inches of the flap to
immobolize the arm and forearm, and an aseptic dressing and
adhesive plasters were utilized to hold the hand and wrist in
proper position. The operator should be sure that there is no
tension on the flap at any point.</p>
          <p>It is a wise precaution to have the hand held firmly by an
assistant until the patient is entirely conscious, and to apply a light
dressing, which permits of frequent inspections. On the tenth day
this patient was again anesthetized, the flap divided near each
attachment, and the stitches were inserted to complete the cuff. It
was necessary to scrape off the excessive granulations on the
wrist dissection and some of the subcutaneous fat on the flap,
since the borrowed skin is apt to be too thick. The stubs were
turned back and sutured in the angles of the wound on the
abdomen from which they had been lifted. It requires about ten
days to secure a safe union with the formation of new vessels
between the flap and the tissues of the wrist sufficient to insure
vitality.</p>
          <p>In one of the most difficult and interesting plastic operations I
have ever performed this method of procedure met every
requirement. All the integument of the back of the hand and each
finger, including the five nails, had been scraped or torn off in
the mangle of a laundry, leaving
<pb id="wyeth500" n="500"/>
nothing but the bones and some frazzles of tendons. The skin on
the palmar aspect of the hand and fingers was normal, but the
four fingers were welded into one mass of adhesions with no
interdigital spaces. All cicatricial tissue was removed by a tedious
dissection, the fingers split apart, and the two central extensor
tendons not destroyed were split, and the borrowed halves
stitched to the terminal phalanx of the index and little finger,
which had been entirely denuded. A great square sheet of skin
large enough to roof over the entire dorsum of the hand and
fingers was now lifted from the belly after the manner just
described. This was so large that the underlying edges could be
only partially approximated. The fingers were now <hi rend="italics">stretched as wide
apart as possible</hi>, and the blanket flap was closely sutured along
the edge of the skin incision across the back of the hand or wrist.
Stitches were inserted near the tips and on the two sides of each
finger, to anchor them and the flap in place.</p>
          <p>On the tenth day the flap was cut loose, and the freshly divided
edges were carefully stitched to the freshened edges of the incision
along the outer, or radial, side of the thumb and the ulnar margin
of the little finger. As much of the wound on the abdomen as
possible was now closed by turning back the stubs of the flap. Ten
days later the flap halfway between the thumb and the index
finger and the little and ring fingers was split, and the edges
stitched into proper place, and after the lapse of another ten days
the two remaining fingers were treated in the same way. The result
was remarkably satisfactory. The entire transplanted flap survived,
each finger was perfectly covered, and a useful hand was secured.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">By this method a piece of skin of suitable dimensions may</hi>
<pb id="wyeth501" n="501"/>
<hi rend="italics">be temporarily grafted upon the back of the hand or wrist
until its vitality in the new position is assured</hi>, then freed from
the abdomen, thigh, or back, and carried to the face, neck, or
wherever necessity may require. After being held in this position
until the graft has taken, the remnant may be restored to its
original location.</p>

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SURGERY OF THE MOUTH,
NASO-PHARYNX, AND ANTRUM MAXILLARIS</head>
          <p>IN the operation for the correction of complete harelip with
cleft of the alveolus and hard palate, the flattening of the alænasi
cannot be properly corrected without the formation of a normal
maxillary or alveolar arch upon which the wings of the nostrils
must be supported. In the majority of cases this wide gap in the
alveolus in front can be filled by forcible fracture of the projecting
intermaxillary bone, which is then carried into line with the normal
alveolar arch and there sutured until osseous union is secured.</p>
          <p>In certain, fortunately rare and neglected, cases in which the
intermaxillary bone is undeveloped the following procedure, which
I have practised satisfactorily in two instances, may be carried out:
The inner surface of the intermaxillary bone and the opposing
surface of the receding alveolus of the other side are freshened by
slicing off the mucous covering. Between two of the teeth on the
short side a chisel is introduced and the bone freely divided upward.
A wire or heavy silk cord is inserted in this fissure, and by strong
traction the anterior portion of the superior maxilla is fractured
and carried forward, where it is wired in contact with the opposite
freshened surface.</p>

of S. J., thirty-eight years of age, at the Mt. Sinai
<pb id="wyeth503" n="503"/>
Hospital, on January 6, 1890, I removed one-half of the 
lower jaw, disarticulating at the temporo-maxillary joint by the
following method:</p>
          <p>The orbicularis oris was widely dilated by four strong silk
threads inserted equidistant and used as retractors. The bone was
divided with the Gigli saw at the symphisis menti. As the disease
was a simple necrosis, the periosteum was carefully raised, the
insertion of the temporal muscle divided with the scissors, and the
bone disarticulated by twisting, which ruptured the capsular
ligament and prevented hemorrhage from the inferior dental
artery. The wound was packed at once with sterile gauze, which
was removed two days after the operation and not renewed. As
soon as the operation was completed the teeth of the remaining
half of the lower jaw were wired to those of the upper maxilla,
preventing inward displacement, until the patient three weeks later
was ready to be fitted with an artificial apparatus. This apparatus,
made by a dentist, enabled the patient to keep the remaining teeth
in line and to use them satisfactorily for purposes of mastication.
A very satisfactory new bone filled the periosteal shell and
prevented serious permanent deformity.</p>
          <p>This operation was original, but, as I discovered later, not novel.
In looking over the papers of the late Dr. J. Marion Sims in the
preparation of an address upon his life-work, I found that before
chloroform or ether had been discovered he had performed this
same operation, his case having been published in the <hi rend="italics">American
Journal of the Medical Sciences</hi> for October, 1847. He had
displayed the wonderful genius which characterized this great
man by preliminary division of the inferior dental nerve, as it
entered the canal in the lower jaw, “<hi rend="italics">in order to render the
operation</hi>
<pb id="wyeth504" n="504"/>
<hi rend="italics">painless</hi>. There are several considerations to recommend this
operation in preference to the usual one with its extensive
incisions. (1) There is no external mutilation. (2) As the third branch
of the fifth pair of nerves was divided at the outset of the operation,
its subsequent stages were comparatively free from pain. (3) As no
important blood-vessels are cut, no ligatures are required. (4)
There is no trouble with the after-treatment. (5) It is just as easy
of performance as the old operation.”</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">A New Procedure for the Removal of Otherwise Inoperable
Tumors from the Posterior Pharynx.</hi>—The following operation
was performed on December 12, 1894, in the case of a man twenty
years of age who was <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">in extremis</foreign></hi> from a large neoplasm of the
naso-pharynx and antrum maxillare, which caused frequent
hemorrhages which had left him practically exsanguinated. The
operation was witnessed by a number of distinguished surgeons
and laryngologists, among them the late Drs. Henry D. Noyes,
R. P. Lincoln, and Drs. J. B. Emerson, Robert C. Myles, and R.
H. M. Dawbarn.</p>
          <p>As a precautionary measure a vein was opened in the arm in
order to be ready for saline injection, which was later done by Dr.
Dawbarn. An incision was made, beginning along the temporal
ridge, two inches back of the outer angle of the orbit, following the
temporal ridge to the edge of the orbital cavity, along the frontal
process of the malar bone, curving parallel with and one-eighth of
an inch from the orbital margin, until the point of the knife reached
the infra-orbital foramen; then downward to the level of the ala nasi
and outward through the cheek until the point of the knife neared
the opening of Steno's duct.</p>
          <p>Hemorrhage was carefully stopped throughout the entire
<pb id="wyeth505" n="505"/>
incision by pressure and by ligating with catgut the larger
vessels which were divided. The soft parts were in no way
dissected up from the bone, except when it became necessary to
enter the orbital cavity in its outer half, where the tissues were
carefully dissected away from the bone and the eye displaced
toward the median line, until the anterior commissure of the
spheno-maxillary fissure came into view. I then passed into this a
keyhole saw with the teeth turned upward, and rapidly sawed
through the junction of the malar with the frontal bone.</p>
          <p>The saw was then turned over, with the teeth directed
downward; and, beginning at the same point, the floor of the
orbital cavity was sawed through until the antrum of Highmore
was bisected as far down as the level of the root of the teeth of
that side. A hook was then placed in the outer angle of the orbit,
and a quick, sharp jerk fractured the zygomatic process of the
temporal bone, displacing the side of the face, completely
exposing the antrum of Highmore, the zygomatic fossa, and the
pterygo- and spheno-maxillary fissures. The hemorrhage was
profuse, but was controlled by rapidly packing sponges into the
wound and making firm compression. The pulse jumped from
eighty to one hundred and forty, and the patient seemed about to
expire in collapse. At this juncture one pint of saline solution,
already prepared, and kept so hot that the hand could scarcely be
borne in it with comfort (110° to 120° F.), was allowed to run into the
vein.</p>
          <p>The heart rallied at once, and the pulse came down to eighty-five
beats to the minute. The tumor was again exposed, and with
a periosteal elevator lifted out of the antrum of Highmore, its
attachments to the pterygoid process of the sphenoid bone being
separated by removing
<pb id="wyeth506" n="506"/>
the periosteum. By opening the patient's mouth and thus
depressing the coronoid process of the inferior maxilla, the
pterygomaxillary fissure and the zygomatic fossa were well
exposed. The whole antrum was packed with a long wick of
iodoform gauze, which was allowed to project at the anterior
inferior angle of the wound. The bone, which had been temporarily
displaced with the soft parts adherent, was then brought back into
position and held there by stitching the soft parts along the line of
incision. A bandage and compress were applied in order to
maintain approximation. No sutures were inserted in the bones.
The patient made an uninterrupted recovery. Nineteen years after
the operation he is entirely well. The bones are united in their
normal position; he has perfect use and function of the eyeball,
and, although the filaments of the facial nerve were divided, he still
has very fair motion of the orbicularis palpebrarum muscle.
Disfigurement from the scar is insignificant.</p>
          <p>Besides the novelty of this procedure there are three points of
interest. First, the character of the anesthetic, morphine being
almost entirely relied upon. The amount of chloroform taken was
only two drachms in an hour and forty minutes of narcosis. I have
done a number of major operations about the respiratory tract
with this combination of morphine and chloroform or morphine
and ether, and in one instance of removal of the larynx I used
nothing but morphine and obtained complete narcosis and
anesthesia, the operation lasting an hour and thirty-two minutes.
The patient remained perfectly quiescent during the operation,
suffering no shock and with no memory of pain.</p>
          <p>The second important point is the value of transfusion with a
salt solution to prevent collapse and shock under
<pb id="wyeth507" n="507"/>
great and sudden loss of blood. During this operation five pints in
all were allowed to run into the veins, and the blood became so
thin that practically salt water ran out of the vessels in the line of
the incision, showing the red corpuscles were almost exhausted;
and yet we were able to make the patient's pulse drop from 130
and 140 to 80 or 90 beats per minute, full and strong, showing that
the heart had plenty of volume to act upon and so did well.</p>
          <p>Finally, in the persistence of motion in the orbicular muscle of
the lids after division of the branches of the seventh nerve.</p>
          <p>For the following study of the nervous distribution of the
orbicularis palpebrarum I am indebted to Professor J. A. Bodine,
of the New York Polyclinic:</p>
          <p>“The orbicular portion of the muscle is supplied solely by the
facial nerve. This portion, however, is not necessary to the act of
closing the eye. In fact, the palpebral portion is quite distinct from
the orbicular, and its action is habitually involuntary. It receives
nerve impulses from the sympathetic plexus around the cavernous
sinus. In addition to the nerve fibers from the seventh, the upper
lid may and does get motor impulse thus: the ophthalmic, or first,
division of the fifth receives fibers from the fourth and third, and
frequently from the sixth, prior to its division into nasal, frontal,
and lachrymal. Some or all of these motor fibers may go with the
lachrymal branch of the ophthalmic. After the lachrymal supplies
the tear-gland it sends fibers to the upper lid. (Gray, page 760.)</p>
          <p>“The lachrymal not infrequently arises by two filaments, one
from the ophthalmic and one from the sixth nerve; thus the upper
lid would get motor impulse from the abducens (sixth).</p>
          <pb id="wyeth508" n="508"/>
          <p>“Again, if the ophthalmic has received motor fibers from the
fourth, third, and sixth, as already stated, the supraorbital branch
of the frontal nerve, which goes partly to the upper lid, would
carry motor influence, and from this same (frontal) nerve the
lower lid could be supplied through the infratrochlear.</p>
          <p>“Of course the act of lifting the lid depends upon the levator
palpebræ supplied by the third nerve.”</p>
          <p>Fortunately, so formidable an operation as the one just detailed
will rarely be called for. The vast majority of neoplasms of the
naso-pharynx can be successfully and satisfactorily reached
through an incision directly into the antrum of Highmore.</p>

CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE SURGERY OF THE BONES—
TRANSPLANTATION OF THE PROXIMAL END OF THE
ULNA TO THE DISTAL END OF THE RADIUS IN AN
UNUNITED COLLES' FRACTURE</head>
          <p>W. M. Y., at the age of nine, suffered a compound right Colles'
fracture, which, becoming infected, resulted in nonunion,
destruction of the epiphysis, and arrest of growth, with extensive
atrophy of the proximal end of the radius.</p>
          <p>Six years later the right hand was deflected sharply toward the
radial side, and, having no bony support, hung loose like a flail, and
was practically useless. The ulna, continuing to grow, was slightly
curved in the direction of the radius.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Operation.</hi>—The end of the posterior surface of the distal
fragment of the broken radius was freshened by section with a
chisel, and the ulna divided with the Gigli saw on the same level.
The tissues were separated from the bones anteriorly and
posteriorly, and the cut surface of the longer (posterior) portion of
the ulna was carried over and wired to the anterior fragment of
the radius. The anterior extremity of the ulna was then dropped
back, or overlapped one inch to compensate for the accidental
shortening of the radius. The contiguous surfaces of the
periosteum were lifted, and the bone chipped with the chisel in
order to excite osteogenesis, and a silver wire-collar was thrown
around
<pb id="wyeth510" n="510"/>
the opposing sections to hold them firmly in contact. This
manipulation carried the hand in a straight position, and at the
same time brought the spindle-shaped atrophied posterior
fragment of the radius in contact with the anterior fragment from
which it had long been separated.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Subsequent History.</hi>—Two years after the operation the
radiograph showed perfect fusion between the two fragments of
the ulna, and between the bone and the anterior fragment of the
broken radius. It also shows the very remarkably improved
condition of the proximal portion of the radius. This is no longer
spindle-shaped, but, having reunited itself to the anterior fragment
proper, it has very appreciably thickened as a result of its
increased function.</p>
          <p>The hand has been restored to usefulness, and the arm has
become strong, so that the lad can use it for practically any
purpose. While supination and pronation have been lost, rotary
movements at the shoulder and elbow have been acquired and
have greatly lessened the inconvenience of the loss of rotation in
the forearm.</p>
          <p>A letter received five years after the operation says, “The
developments in the arm have been most remarkable and
surprising.”</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Green-stick Fracture of the Radius in the Posterior
Third—Extreme Supination of the Posterior and Pronation of
the Anterior Fragments—Union in this Position with Complete
Loss of Pronation and Supination.</hi>—M. C., a Cuban lad, in a fall
from a horizontal bar, had injured his forearm. There had been no
treatment. The pain suffered at the time gradually disappeared,
but when after three or four weeks he tried to use the arm it was
discovered that the power of pronation and supination had been
lost.</p>
          <p>An X-ray picture showed that there had been a fracture
<pb id="wyeth511" n="511"/>
in the posterior third of the radius. As the two bones of the
forearm were not in contact at any point, and as there was no
muscular paralysis, interosseous union and injury to the nerves
were eliminated. A careful study of this case convinced me that
there had been a green-stick fracture without displacement of the
fragments. The pronator radii teres, no longer opposed by the
supinator brevis, had rotated the anterior fragment into complete
pronation and fixed it there, while the supinator brevis, acting on
the upper end, had rotated that fragment in an opposite direction
and held it fixed until bony union at the point of fracture had taken
place.</p>
          <p>Under ether the bone was divided at the point of fracture, the
ends seized with lion-jaw forceps, and by forcible inward rotation
for the upper and outward for the lower end the contracted
muscles were divulsed. The ends were held in this corrected
position, splints applied, and normal reunion secured with
restoration of supination and pronation as complete as before the
injury.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Novel Procedure for Restoring the Anterior Extremity of the
Radius.</hi>—T. A., a male about twenty-one years of age, in excellent
general health, was operated on, November 15, 1890. A
38-caliber-pistol ball entered through the articular surface of the wrist,
traversed and destroyed three inches of the carpal end of the
radius. Some of the fragments were carried away and lost, while
others were embedded in the contiguous muscles and under the
skin. These were carefully removed, placed in a solution of warm
mercuric chloride (1 to 3,000) and kept at about 100° Fahrenheit. A
hole was drilled through the proximal end of the radius and the
scaphoid and through each of the dozen fragments of the
shattered bone, and these were threaded like beads on
<pb id="wyeth512" n="512"/>
a silver wire secured first to the scaphoid and then to the radius
above. All of these fragments survived and fused, and by their
presence stimulated osteogenesis, and formed a new and useful
radius.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Fracture of the Hip in Childbirth.</hi>—January 26, 1887, I was
called to see an infant just born. The accoucher in making traction
by means of the fingers inserted into the flexures at the groin, in a
case of breech presentation, in order to make a rapid delivery, had
caused a fracture of the left femur immediately below the lesser
trochanter. The fracture was very evident, for when extension
was made on the leg the upper fragment projected forward, the
end being felt just beneath the skin. The position of this fragment
was evidently due to the still contracted condition of the psoas and
iliacus muscles, since the thigh had as yet not been extended. The
only position of the thigh which brought the fragments in line and
in apposition was by flexing it firmly against the abdomen just as it
had been <hi rend="italics">in utero</hi>.</p>
          <p>In this position, with the leg at an angle of ninety degrees to the
thigh, firm rolls of cotton batting were applied along the abdomen
and on either side of the thigh. While extension was made, the
lower portion of the chest, the entire abdomen, and the thigh were
included in a plaster-of-Paris cuirass. The bandages did not
encircle the thigh, but included it in the cast which surrounded the
body. Plaster bandages were applied to the leg from the ankle to
the knee. To secure complete immobility, these were incorporated
into the general cuirass. The right leg was left free, and the
plaster cut away so as to permit of the necessary attentions to the
infant. Firm extension from the flexed knee in an upward direction
was made until the plaster hardened.</p>
          <p>At the end of three weeks the dressing was removed, and
<pb id="wyeth513" n="513"/>
union without deformity or shortening had resulted. This patient is
now a well-developed woman twenty-six years old, and there is
no difference in the length or functions of the two extremities.</p>
          <p>To the date of this experience I had not heard or read of this
complication. Dr. Edgar Wilkinson, of Hamilton, Bermuda, writes
me that he has met with a similar case and carried out with
perfect success the exact treatment as given in my book on

          <p>IN October, 1879, I treated my first case of hip-joint disease by
adding to the excellent and well-known hip-joint apparatus of
Professor Lewis A. Sayre the elevation of the shoe of the well
foot and the use of crutches. This method swings the lame leg in
the air free from any possible friction of the joint in the act of
walking, and at the same time it is protected by the Sayre splint. I
have used it in a number of cases with great satisfaction. In one
of my later cases a boy of nine years recovered so thoroughly all
the functions of the joint that he ran second in a five-mile
Marathon race, defeating some twenty competitors. In all these
cases of the tuberculous dyscrasia, tuberculin injections as now
given at the Polyclinic should be employed.</p>

            <p>Without suspension, as advised when the Sayre solid plaster-of-Paris

fitting knit undershirt, two jackets or zones of plaster of Paris are

below the point of disease. The one catches over and rests on the
hips, while the other meets the upward expansion of the chest and
scapulæ. As the plaster bandages are setting, three zinc plates about
two by four inches (perforated with numerous holes to make them
fasten readily) are placed in each section of the jacket. To the
center of each plate is securely riveted a flattened staple of iron.
One of these is fastened over the spinal column above and below,
one under each arm, and one directly underneath these over the
hips. These plates are securely held in position by several turns of
plaster bandage, passing alternately above and below the staples,
which are left exposed. As soon as the jackets are firmly set the
extension bars are applied.</p>
            <p>These bars consist of a shoulder at each end, and a solid
section cut with cogs and grooves, which telescopes into a hollow
section, with a key for lengthening or shortening, and a spring-catch
to hold it fixed at any point. This is the exact mechanism
used in Dr. Sayre's knee-joint splint. The shoulders are caught in
the staples riveted to the immovable plates, and the requisite

            <head>FEMORAL HERNIA. A NEW AND SUCCESSFUL METHOD OF
OBLITERATING THE FEMORAL CANAL</head>
            <p>I have employed for many years the method of MacEwen of
folding into a mass a portion of the sac of an inguinal hernia, and
of holding it between the inner surface of the abdominal wall and
the outer surface of the peritoneum
<pb id="wyeth516" n="516"/>
lining that wall. This procedure entirely obliterates the hernial sac
at its neck. As soon as I became acquainted with this procedure I
began to use it in all my operations on the sac of a femoral hernia,
until in 1903 I devised the following modification which I have
used in every subsequent operation for femoral hernia; in each
instance without recurrence, so far as I am able to inform myself.</p>
            <p>Instead of folding the sac over upon itself and holding it fixed
between the layer of the peritoneum, which lines the abdominal
wall in front and the muscle, I turn it completely
outside in by the following method: After the hernial sac has been
properly exposed, opened, and the reduction effected, it is cut off
about one-half to three-fourths of an inch distal to the outer margin
of the femoral canal, an the stump and neck of the sac is carefully
separated by dry dissection from the femoral and iliac veins, and the
other contiguous structures. A number two chromicized ten-day
catgut suture twelve inches long is carried through one side of the
sac near the edge and the suture tied. The nearly straight Hagedorn
needle, four or five inches long and very slightly curved at the point,
remains threaded with this catgut loop, while a second needle is
attached to the free end and is used to fasten the suture in the ring
of the sac exactly opposite the one first inserted.</p>
            <p>The index finger of the most convenient hand is now carried
into the sac, through the canal into the peritoneal
cavity, and a careful examination made by the touch to assure the
operator that there are no adhesions near the internal orifice of the
sac. The finger is then withdrawn, and the tip of the long needle,
held firmly in the holder which clasps it near the eye, is buried or
well depressed into the skin of the palmar surface of the end of the
finger, which,
<pb id="wyeth517" n="517"/>
serving as a guide, is then again carried into the sac and through
the canal, the needle remaining steadily fixed until its point is
placed safely against the inner surface of the abdominal
peritoneum, where it is made to transfix this and the muscular
wall, and is brought through the integument at a point an inch or
more beyond the upper level of the internal femoral ring or mouth
of the canal. Traction on the double catgut loop now turns the sac
completely outside in, entirely obliterating it. It is held safely in
position by tying the two ends of the divided loop over a pencil of
gauze. I have found no difficulty in avoiding the spermatic cord or the
inferior epigastric vessels.</p>
            <p>A class-room illustration of this technique is readily made by
seizing and holding the edge of the coat-sleeve of one arm with
the hand of that side, and then removing the coat, thus turning the
sleeve completely inside out.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italics">The Author's Bandage Covering the Heel and Foot with a Single
Roller.</hi>—This method of bandaging the entire foot with a single
roller was devised in 1875. Begin by placing bits of absorbent
cotton between the toes. Take a roller from two to two and a half
inches wide, and about two yards long. Lay the end of the
bandage parallel with the axis of the leg, half-way between the
two malleoli in front, and carry the roller by the inner side to the
heel, so that the middle of the bandage will be over the center of
the heel's convexity, and on to the starting-point. Next, make
another turn around the ankle, carrying the posterior edge of the
bandage over the center of the turn that has just preceded it, and
make one or two other turns in front of this until the heel is
completely covered.</p>
            <p>The bandage is then carried around the heel in the same
direction, so that its anterior border rests on the middle
<pb id="wyeth518" n="518"/>
of the first turn, and the roller is carried from the fibular side of
the heel across the dorsum of the foot to the tibial side of the
great toe. It then travels under the bases of the toes to the little
toe, making a couple of complete turns around the foot at this
point, and when the roller has again reached the fibular side of
the little toe it is made to cross the dorsum of the foot obliquely to
the tibial side of the heel, keeping the lower edge of the bandage
about a quarter of an inch above the bottom of the heel. Repeat
this figure-of-eight turn until the entire foot is thoroughly
concealed. It is best to cut with the scissors each turn of the
roller about half through just when it crosses the front of the
ankle, so that the accumulation of the bandage at this point may
not interfere with the movements of the ankle-joint. The crossings
of the figure-of-eight bandage on the dorsum of the foot should
be kept a little to the fibular side of the median line.</p>
            <p><hi rend="italics">A Simple Device for the Prevention of Snoring.</hi>—Snoring is the
noise caused in the act of breathing by the vibration or fluttering
of the pendulous soft-palate or curtain which hangs down from
the posterior margin of the roof of the mouth. It
is possible for the air, which is being carried into the lungs in
breathing, to pass not only through the nostrils—the natural and
proper way—but through the mouth at the same time. If one will
keep the lips closely compressed, and allow the air to pass in
through the nostrils, it is practically impossible to snore. The same
is true in a lesser degree if the nostrils are closed, and breathing is
only through the mouth. The curtain will scarcely vibrate
or flutter in a single current or stream of air; but when the mouth is
open the two currents are rushing in, and the hanging curtain,
caught between them, is thrown into audible vibration—and this
is snoring.</p>
            <pb id="wyeth519" n="519"/>
            <p>It follows that any device which prevents the lower jaw during
the relaxation of sleep from dropping down and thus opening the
mouth will shut out the one unnatural current of air and prevent
snoring.</p>
            <p>I devised an apparatus which consists of a simple cap fitting the
head snugly; a cap of soft material fitting the chin; and a piece of
elastic webbing tacked to the chin-piece and to the head-cap near
the ears. The webbing can be made more or less tense as may
be required to effect the closure of the mouth. It is so simple that
any one can make it, and should recommend itself to those
individuals who, in the toils of this unfortunate habit, are a
nuisance to everybody except themselves.</p>

        <p>John Allan Wyeth, fourth and youngest child and only surviving
son of Louis Weiss Wyeth and Euphemia Allan, was born at
Missionary Station, Marshall County, Alabama, May 26, 1845.</p>
        <p>Descended from Welsh, Scotch, English, and German ancestors who
settled in America, a grandfather of each of his parents fought in the
Revolutionary War for the Independence of the Colonies.</p>

          <p>Nicholas Wyeth (or Wythe, as the name appears in some of the
earlier records) and a brother came from England to America in
1630; the former settling at New Town (Newton), near Boston,
Massachusetts, the latter joining the colonists of Virginia.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref66" n="66" rend="sc" target="note66">1</ref></p>
          <p>Nicholas Wyeth was born in England in 1595, and died at Cambridge
July 19, 1680. He came to Massachusetts with one of the Winthrop
colonies in 1630, and after five years at Newton moved to Cambridge.
According to Paige's <hi rend="italics">History of Cambridge</hi>, “about 1640 he became the
owner of a landed estate at Cambridge, which for more than two
centuries remained in possession of his descendants in the male line.”
Wyeth Street, near Harvard College, is named in his honor. On his
tombstone is engraved: “Nicholas Wyeth 1595-1680. Settled Newton
1630.”</p>
          <note id="note66" n="66" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref66">
            <p>1 The Virginia branch of this family became extinct at the death of
George Wythe, LL.D., who, an only child, born in 1726, died childless in
1806 and was buried in St. John's churchyard in Richmond, Virginia.</p>
            <p>He was the first chancellor of Virginia, the friend and counselor of
Washington, member of the House of Burgesses, a signer of the
Declaration of Independence, and Professor of Law in William and Mary
College. John Marshall, Thomas Jefferson, James Monroe, and Henry
Clay were law pupils in his office, the latter in his earlier youth serving as
his private secretary. He emancipated his slaves and made liberal
provision for their subsistence.</p>
            <p>Thomas Jefferson wrote of him as, “The honor of his own and the
model of all future times.”</p>

          <pb id="wyeth529" n="529"/>
          <p>John, fourth child of Nicholas, was born at Cambridge, July 15, 1655,
and died December 13, 1706.</p>
          <p>Ebenezer, sixth child of John, was baptized July 24, 1698, and died
April 3, 1754.</p>
          <p>Ebenezer II., eldest of six children of Ebenezer I., was born in
Cambridge April 8, 1727, and died there August 4, 1799. This man,
great-grandfather of our subject, was a farmer, and from 1781 to 1790
served as “Selectman” (one of the governors) of Cambridge Township.
He, two of his sons, and two nephews were of the seventy-five men of
Captain Samuel Thatcher's company who attacked the British at or near
Concord Bridge on their retreat from Lexington. It was of this fight that
Emerson wrote the immortal lines:</p>
          <lg type="stanza">
            <l>Here once the embattled farmers stood</l>
            <l>And fired the shot heard round the world.</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Paige's history says, “In commemoration of their patriotism I insert a
muster-roll of this company which marched on the alarm, April 19, 1775.”
Thatcher's company became a part of the regiment of Colonel Thomas
Gardner, who was mortally wounded in the battle of Bunker Hill, and died
July 3, 1775. Washington issued a special order for his funeral services,
paying a high tribute to his gallant conduct.</p>
          <p>John Wyeth (grandfather), the tenth child and sixth son of Ebenezer
II., was born at Cambridge March 31, 1770, and died at Philadelphia
January 23, 1858. Educated at Cambridge, he became a printer and
publisher of books. Settling in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, he founded the
<hi rend="italics">Oracle of Dauphin</hi>, the first newspaper published in that city, which later
became the capital of the state. He was appointed postmaster by
President Washington; was prominent in educational matters; served as
president of the Harrisburg Academy; and built “Wyeth Hall,” the first
place of public amusement in this city. He amassed a considerable
fortune, was a Unitarian in religion, and left a reputation for courage and
integrity worthy of emulation. He married, June 6, 1793, Louisa Weiss, of
Philadelphia, who was born there April 29, 1775, and died in Harrisburg
June 1, 1822. Her father, Wilhelm Ludwig Weiss, born in Berlin, Prussia,
December 27, 1717, graduated at Lindheim and settled in Philadelphia,
where he studied
<pb id="wyeth530" n="530"/>
law and became Justice of the Court of Common Pleas and Quarter
Sessions of Philadelphia County, and Justice of the Orphans Court. He
married Johanna Pflüger, and died in Philadelphia October 22, 1796.</p>
          <p>Louis Weiss Wyeth, the sixth child and next to the youngest of five
brothers (father of our subject), was born at Harrisburg, Pennsylvania,
June 20, 1812, and died in Marshall County, Alabama, July 7, 1889.
He received a classical education at the Harrisburg Academy, studied law,
was admitted to practice in 1833, and in 1836 settled in Alabama, where
he was made County judge of Marshall County in 1837, and later became
the leading practitioner of that county. In 1847, while in the legislature,
he secured the charter and became president of the Tennessee&amp;
Coosa Railroad, now part of the Nashville, Chattanooga&amp; St. Louis
Railway System. In 1848 he founded Guntersville, the present county-seat,
and built at his private expense a brick court-house and jail which he
presented to Marshall County.</p>
          <p>He opposed secession in 1861, but when the convention voted to join
the Southern Confederacy he gave himself to the cause. Although
beyond the legal military age, he volunteered and served at the front
until discharged on account of a serious illness which left him unfit
for duty. In 1864 he again volunteered in the state troops in the effort
to repel Sherman's invasion of Georgia. In 1874 he was elected Judge
of the Fifth Judicial District of Alabama and served eight years,
declining re-election. A year later he was offered the Chief Justiceship
of the Supreme Court of Alabama, which he declined. From early youth
to the day of his death he was a consistent member of the Presbyterian
Church. One who knew him well wrote: “His was the purest life, the most
beautiful and faultless character I have ever known. Tender, brave, and
true, he lived without reproach and died without fear.”</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">Large was his bounty and his soul sincere.</q>
          <p>Louis Wyeth married at Huntsville on April 9, 1839, Euphemia Allan.</p>

        <div2 type="subchapter">
          <head>MATERNAL ANCESTRY</head>
          <p>Euphemia Allan, daughter of John Allan and Nancy Hodge,
was born at Gallatin, Tennessee, June 17, 1817, educated at the
<pb id="wyeth531" n="531"/>
Huntsville Seminary, and died at Guntersville, Alabama, December 27,
1896. Her paternal grandfather was David Allan, of Ayrshire, Scotland,
who married Mary Knight, member of a family of wealth and influence in
Dorsetshire, England. Here on April 21, 1788, John Allan was born.
When he was sixteen years old his parents settled near Athens, Georgia.
From the University of Georgia, at Athens, he was graduated in the class
of 1807, and then studied theology, adding to the classical course of the
university the French language and Hebrew translation. A man of great
learning and piety, he became a Presbyterian minister, married Nancy
Hodge July 20, 1809, was called to the Presbyterian Church in Huntsville,
Alabama, in 1820, the pastor of which he remained until his death,
November 14, 1843.</p>
          <p>Nancy Hodge, his wife, was born at Guilford Court House, North
Carolina, April 14, 1785. Her father, Joseph Hodge, born in England, 1755,
emigrated to North Carolina, served under General Greene in the
Revolutionary War, and was severely wounded in the battle of Guilford
Court House, March 15, 1781. As a reward for his services he received a
valuable grant of lands in Sumner County, Tennessee, where he died
February 28, 1822.</p>
          <p>John Allan Wyeth was educated at the common school at Guntersville
until January, 1861, when he became a cadet at La Grange Military
Academy (La Grange College), in Franklin (now Colbert) County,
Alabama. Here he remained for one year, when on account of the Civil
War this college was closed.</p>
          <p>Of the teachers in the common school, Mr. W. D. Lovett, of
Zanesville, Ohio, left the deepest impression upon his pupils and the
community. With a thorough collegiate training and a sympathetic
nature, he had the gift not only of imparting knowledge, but of
stimulating his boys to extraordinary endeavor.</p>
          <p>At La Grange Military Academy, where the strictest military discipline
prevailed, with the same curriculum as that of the United States Military
Academy at West Point, the professors were men of high attainment and
conscientious in the discharge of their duties. The members of the
faculty were James W. Robertson, president and professor of
engineering; William H. Hunt, commandant of cadets and professor of
drawing; Rev. Felix Johnson, chaplain and professor of mental and moral
science; Edward
<pb id="wyeth532" n="532"/>
Goodwin, of language and literature; Albert A. McGregor, of
mathematics; Rev. G. Williams, history, natural science, and chemistry;
and Dr. Alfred Stephenson as surgeon.
<ref targOrder="U" id="ref67" n="67" rend="sc" target="note67">1</ref></p>
          <p>Of the 179 cadets, 176 served in the Confederate army; 23 were killed in
battle, and 26 died from diseases incident to the service—a death-rate of 28
per cent. Of the survivors many were wounded one or more times or were
physically impaired by sickness and exposure, which carried them to
untimely graves or seriously handicapped them in the struggle for
existence.</p>
          <p>In 1862 young Wyeth served with a company of Partisan Rangers and
with Quirk's Scouts of Morgan's cavalry, and from April, 1863, to the
surrender in April, 1865, was a private in Company I (Russell's regiment),
Fourth Alabama Cavalry. He was present in the engagements at Law's
Landing, June 7, 1862; Glasgow, Bear Wallow, Upton's Station,
Elizabethtown, Muldrough's Hill, and Rolling Fork, December 24, 25, 26,
27, 28, and 29, 1862; Shelbyville, Tennessee, June 27, 1863; Morris's Ford,
Elk River, and Winchester, July 2d; in a series of skirmishes preceding the
battle of Chickamauga and in that battle, September 18, 19, and 20, 1863,
and September 21st, in McLemore's Cove. He took part in the action at
Cottonport, September 30th, and in the capture of General Rosecrans's
great supply-train in Sequatchie Valley, October 2, 1863. Taken prisoner
October 4, 1863, he was confined at Camp Morton, Indiana, and
exchanged in April, 1865. In 1866 and 1867 he was engaged in farming in
Alabama; began the study of medicine and graduated in April,
1869. Impressed with the importance of a thorough laboratory and
practical clinical training under the guidance of expert instructors as a
prerequisite to practice, in order to secure the means to take his course of
study he engaged in business for three years in the state of Arkansas,
chiefly in transporting materials in connection with public works. He
served as pilot and in charge of the steamer <hi rend="italics">Converse</hi>, completing his
contracts in May, 1872.</p>
          <p>In October, 1872, he resumed his professional studies in New York
City, receiving the degree <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">ad eundem</foreign></hi> in March, 1873, at Bellevue
Hospital Medical College, in which institution in April

of that year he was appointed assistant demonstrator of anatomy. In 1874
he was made prosector to the chair of anatomy, and in 1875 instructor for
the faculty. On account of a long and severe illness which incapacitated
him for work for nearly two years he resigned from Bellevue College and
visited the medical centers of Europe.</p>
          <p>In 1880 he was appointed visiting surgeon to Mount Sinai Hospital
and consulting surgeon to St. Elizabeth Hospital. In 1881 he founded and
became surgeon in chief and later president of the New York Polyclinic
Medical School and Hospital, the first postgraduate medical organization
in America, which has grown to be one of the largest and most
successful teaching institutions in the United States.</p>
          <p>In 1885, and again in 1886, he was elected president of the New York
Pathological Society; 1893, first vice-president, and, in 1901, president of
the American Medical Association, having been in 1900 elected
president of the New York State Medical Association. In the same year
the honorary degree of Doctor of Laws was conferred upon him by the
University of Alabama, and in 1908 the same by the University of
Maryland. In 1907, and again in 1908, he was elected president of the New
York Southern Society, and from 1907 to 1911 president of the New York
Academy of Medicine. In 1913 the Hospital Alliance of Greater New York
elected him their president, as did the Alabama Society.</p>
          <p>He married, April 10, 1886, Florence Nightingale Sims, daughter of the
great surgeon, J. Marion Sims, in whose honor a statue in bronze now
stands in Bryant Park, New York City. Another has been erected by the
legislature of his native state in the capitol grounds at Columbia, South
Carolina.</p>
          <p>By this union there are three children. Florence Sims Wyeth graduated
from Barnard College, Columbia University, 1909; Marion Sims Wyeth,
Princeton, 1910; and John Allan Wyeth, Jr., Princeton class of 1915.</p>
          <p>He is the author of a <hi rend="italics">Handbook of Medical and 
Surgical Reference</hi>
(1875); an essay on “Dextral Preference (or Right-Handedness) in Man”
(1875); a “Monograph on Minor Surgery (1876).<sic>”</sic> In 1876 he received
the award of the Bellevue Hospital Medical
<pb id="wyeth534" n="534"/>
College Alumni Association prize for “the best essay on any subject
connected with surgery or surgical pathology,” his subject being
“Amputation at the Ankle-joint.” In 1878 he received the first prize of the
American Medical Association for an essay on “The Surgical Anatomy
and Surgery of the Carotid Arteries,” and received the second prize of the
same association (1878) for an essay on the “Surgical Anatomy and
Surgery of the Innominate and Subclavian Arteries.” At this time he
published an essay on the “Obturator Arteries and the Importance of
their Relation to Hernia,” and later a pamphlet on “Suprapubic
Cystotomy, with a Report of Sixty Cases”; “Osteoplastic Operation for
the Correction of Deformities of the Alveolar Arch and for Cleft Palate
and Harelip”; “Removal of the Lower Jaw from Within the Mouth
Without External Incision”; “The Surgical Treatment of Aneurisms of the
Arch of the Aorta, Innominate, Subclavian, and Carotid Arteries by the
Distal Ligature,” and “Some Original Researches on the Occlusion of
Arteries by Cell Proliferation.” In 1886 he made public the first recorded
case of the cure of sarcoma by streptococcus infection. In 1890 he made
public his “Bloodless Method of Amputation at the Shoulder and Hip
Joints,” and in 1903 “A New Method of Treating Inoperable Vascular
Tumors by the Injection into their Substance of Water at a High
Temperature.”</p>
          <p>In 1895 he delivered an oration on J. Marion Sims and his work before
the Southern Surgical and Gynecological Association at Washington,
and an address on medical education before the Mississippi Valley
Medical Association, at Louisville, in 1890. In 1886 he published the first
edition of his text-book on surgery, which in 1909 had passed through
four separate editions. In 1901, at St. Paul, he delivered the “Oration on
Surgery” before the American Medical Association, and the “President's
Address” before the same association at Saratoga in 1902.</p>
          <p>Among his contributions to other than professional literature are: An
article in the <hi rend="italics">Century Magazine</hi> for April, 1891, entitled, “Cold Cheer in
Camp Morton,” a narrative of prison life from October, 1863, to February,
1865; an historical sketch in <hi rend="italics">Harper's Magazine</hi>, November, 1892,
