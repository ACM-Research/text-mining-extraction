        </note>
        <p>I am a negro and was born some time during the war in Elbert County, Ga., and I reckon by this time I must be a little over forty years old.  My mother was not married when I was born, and I never knew who my father was or anything about him.  Shortly after the war my mother died, and I was left to the care of my uncle.  All this happened before I was eight years old, and so I can't remember very much about it.  When I was about ten years old, my uncle hired me out to Captain——.  I had already learned how to plow, and was also a good hand at picking cotton.  I was told that the Captain wanted me for his house-boy, and that later on he was going to train me to be his coachman.  To be a coachman in those days was considered a post of honor, and, young as I was, I was glad of the chance.  But I had not been at the Captain's a month before I was put to work on the farm, with some twenty or thirty other negroes—men, women and children.  From the beginning the boys had the same tasks as the men and women.  There was no difference.  We all worked hard during the week, and would frolic on Saturday nights and often on Sundays.  And everybody was happy.  The men got $3 a week and the women $2.  I don't know what the children got.  Every week my uncle collected my money for me, but it was very little of it that I ever saw.  My uncle fed and clothed me, gave me a place to sleep, and allowed me ten or fifteen cents a week for “spending change,” as he called it.  I must have been seventeen or eighteen years old before I got tired of that arrangement, and felt that I was man enough to be working for myself and handling my own wages.  The other boys about my age and size were “drawing” their own pay, and they used to laugh at me and call me “Baby” because my old uncle was always on hand to “draw” my pay.  Worked up by these things, I made a break for liberty.  Unknown to my uncle or the Captain I went off to a neighboring plantation and hired myself out to another man.  The new landlord agreed to give me forty cents a day and furnish me one meal.  I thought that was doing fine.  Bright and early one Monday morning I started for work, still not letting the others know anything about it.  But they found out before sundown.  The Captain came over to the new place and brought some kind of officer of the law.  The officer pulled out a long piece of paper from his pocket and read it to my new employer.  When this was done I heard my boss say:
<q direct="unspecified"><p>“I beg your pardon, Captain.  I didn't know this nigger was bound out to you, or I wouldn't have hired him.”</p><p>“He certainly is bound out to me,” said the Captain.  “He belongs to me until he is twenty-one, and I'm going to make him know his place.”</p></q></p>
        <p>So I was carried back to the Captain's.  That night he made me strip off my clothing down to my waist, had me tied to a tree in his backyard, ordered his foreman to give me thirty lashes with a buggy whip across my bare back, and stood by until it was done.  After that experience the Captain made me stay on his place night and day,—but my uncle still continued to “draw” my money.</p>
        <p>I was a man nearly grown before I knew how to count from one to one hundred.  I was a man nearly grown before I ever saw a colored school teacher.  I never went to school a day in my life.  To-day I can't write my own name, tho<pb id="p410" n="410"/> I can read a little.  I was a man nearly grown before I ever rode on a railroad train, and then I went on an excursion from Elberton to Athens.  What was true of me was true of hundreds of other negroes around me—'way off there in the country, fifteen or twenty miles from the nearest town.</p>
        <p>When I reached twenty-one the Captain told me I was a free man, but he urged me to stay with him.  He said he would treat me right, and pay me as much as anybody else would.  The Captain's son and I were about the same age, and the Captain said that, as he had owned my mother and uncle during slavery, and as his son didn't want me to leave them (since I had been with them so long), he wanted me to stay with the old family.  And I stayed.  I signed a contract—that is, I made my mark—for one year.  The Captain was to give me $3.50 a week, and furnish me a little house on the plantation—a one-room log cabin similar to those used by his other laborers.</p>
        <p>During that year I married Mandy.  For several years Mandy had been the house-servant for the Captain, his wife, his son and his three daughters, and they all seemed to think a good deal of her.  As an evidence of their regard they gave us a suit of furniture, which cost about $25, and we set up housekeeping in one of the Captain's two-room shanties.  I thought I was the biggest man in Georgia.  Mandy still kept her place in the “Big House” after our marriage.  We did so well for the first year that I renewed my contract for the second year, and for the third, fourth and fifth year I did the same thing.  Before the end of the fifth year the Captain had died, and his son, who had married some two or three years before, took charge of the plantation.  Also, for two or three years, this son had been serving in Atlanta in some big office to which he had been elected.  I think it was in the Legislature or something of that sort—anyhow, the people called him Senator.  At the end of the fifth year the Senator suggested that I sign up a contract for ten years; then, he said, we wouldn't have to fix up papers every year.  I asked my wife about it; she consented; and so I made a ten-year contract.</p>
        <p>Not long afterward the Senator had a long, low shanty built on his place.  A great big chimney, with a wide, open fireplace, was built at one end of it, and on each side of the house, running lengthwise, there was a row of frames or stalls just large enough to hold a single mattress.  The places for these were fixed one above the other; so that there was a double row of these stalls or pens on each side.  They looked for all the world like stalls for horses.  Since then I have seen cabooses similarly arranged as sleeping quarters for railroad laborers.  Nobody seemed to know what the Senator was fixing for.  All doubts were put aside one bright day when about forty able-bodied negroes, bound in iron chains, and some of them handcuffed, were brought out to the Senator's farm in three big wagons.  They were quartered in the long, low shanty, and it was afterward called to stockade.  This was the beginning of the Senator's convict camp.  These men were prisoners who had been leased by the Senator from the State of Georgia at about $200 each per year, the State agreeing to pay for guards and physicians, for necessary inspection, for inquests, all rewards for escaped convicts, the costs of litigation and all other incidental camp expenses.  When I saw these men in shackled, and the guards with their guns, I was scared nearly to death.  I felt like running away, but I didn't know where to go.  And if there had been any place to go to, I would have had to leave my wife and child behind.  We free laborers held a meeting.  We all wanted to quit.  We sent a man to tell the Senator about it.  Word came back that we were all under contract for ten years and that the Senator would hold us to the letter of the contract, or put us in chains and lock us up—the same as the other prisoners.  It was made plain to us by some white people that in the contracts we had signed we had all agreed to be locked up in a stockade at night or at any other time that our employer saw fit; further, we learned that we could not lawfully break our contract for any reason and go and hire ourselves to somebody else without the consent of our employer; and, more than that, if we got mad and<pb id="p411" n="411"/> ran away, we could be run down by bloodhounds, arrested without process of law, and be returned to our employer, who, according to the contract, might beat us brutally or administer any other kind of punishment that he though proper.  In other words, we had sold ourselves into slavery—and what could we do about it?  The white folks had all the courts, all the guns, all the hounds, all the railroads, all the telegraph wires, all the newspapers, all the money, and nearly all the land—and we had only our ignorance, our poverty and our empty hands.  We decided that the best thing to do was to shut our mouths, say nothing, and go back to work.  And most of us worked side by side with those convicts during the remainder of the ten years.</p>
        <p>But this first batch of convicts was only the beginning.  Within six months another stockade was built, and twenty or thirty other convicts were brought to the plantation, among them six or eight women!  The Senator had bought an additional thousand acres of land, and to his already large cotton plantation he added two great big saw-mills and went into the lumber business.  Within two years the Senator had in all nearly 200 negroes working on his plantation—about his half of them free laborers, so-called, and about half of them convicts.  The only difference between the free laborers and the others was that the free laborers could come and go as they pleased, at night—that is, they were not locked up at night, and were not, as a general thing, whipped for slight offenses.  The troubles of the free laborers began at the close of the ten-year period.  To a man, they all wanted to quit when the time was up.  To a man, they all refused to sign new contracts—even for one year, not to say anything of ten years.  And just when we thought that our bondage was at an end we found that it had really just begun.  Two or three years before, or about a year and a half after the Senator had started his camp, he had established a large store, which was called the commissary.  All of us free laborers were compelled to buy our supplies—food, clothing, etc.—from that store.  We never used any money in our dealings with the commissary, only tickets or orders, and we had a general settlement once each year, in October.  In this store we were charged all sorts of high prices for goods, because every year we would come out in debt to our employer.  If not that, we seldom had more than $5 or $10 coming to us—and that for a whole year's work.  Well, at the close of the tenth year, when we kicked and meant to leave the Senator, he said to some of us with a smile (and I never will forget that smile—I can see it now):
	<q direct="unspecified"><p>“Boys, I'm sorry you're going to leave me.  I hope you will do well in your new places-so well that you will be able to pay me the little balances which most of you owe me.”</p></q></p>
        <p>Word was sent out for all of us to meet him at the commissary at 2 o'clock.  There he told us that, after we had signed what he called a written acknowledgment of our debts, we might go and look for new places.  The storekeeper took us one by one and read to us statements of our accounts.  According to the books there was no man of us who owed the Senator less than $100; some of us were put down for as much as $200.  I owed $165, according to the bookkeeper.  These debts were not accumulated during one year, but ran back for three and four years, so we were told—in spite of the fact that we understood that we had had a full settlement at the end of each year.  But no one of us would have dared to dispute a white man's word—oh, no; not in those days.  Besides, we fellows didn't care anything about the amounts—we were after getting away; and we had been told that we might go, if we signed the acknowledgments.  We would have signed anything, just to get away.  So we stepped up, we did, and made our marks.  That same night we were rounded up by a constable and ten or twelve white men, who aided him, and we were locked up, every one of us, in one of the Senator's stockades.  The next morning it was explained to us by the two guards appointed to watch us that, in the papers we had signed the day before, we had not only made acknowledgment of our indebtedness, but that we had also agreed to work for the Senator until the debts were paid off by hard labor.  And from that day forward we were treated just like convicts.  Really we had <pb id="p412" n="412"/>made ourselves lifetime slaves, or peons, as the law called us.  But, call it slavery, peonage, or what not, the truth is we lived in a hell on earth what time we spent in the Senator's peon camp.</p>
        <p>I lived in that camp, as a peon, for nearly three years.  My wife fared better than I did, as did the wives of some of the other negroes, because the white men about the camp used these unfortunate creatures as their mistresses.  When I was first put in the stockade my wife was still kept for a while in the “Big House,” but my little boy, who was only nine years old, was given away to a negro family across the river in South Carolina, and I never saw or heard of him after that.  When I left the camp my wife had had two children for some one of the white bosses, and she was living in fairly good shape in a little house off to herself.  But the poor negro women who were not in the same class with my wife fared about as bad as the helpless negro men.  Most of the time the women who were peons or convicts were compelled to wear men's clothes.  Sometimes, when I have seen them dressed like men, and plowing or hoeing or hauling logs or working at the blacksmith's trade, just the same as men, my heart would bleed and my blood would boil, but I was powerless to raise a hand.  It would have meant death on the spot to have said a word.  Of the first six women brought to the camp, two of them gave birth to children after they had been there more than twelve months—and the babies had white men for their fathers!</p>
        <p>The stockades in which we slept were, I believe, the filthiest places in the world.  They were cesspools of nastiness.  During the thirteen years that I was there I am willing to swear that a mattress was never moved after it had been brought there, except to turn it over once or twice a month.  No sheets were used, only dark-colored blankets.  Most of the men slept every night in the clothing that they had worked in all day.  Some of the worst characters were made to sleep in chains.  The doors were locked and barred each night, and tallow candles were the only lights allowed.  Really the stockades were but little more than cow lots, horse stables or hog pens.  Strange to say, not a great number of these people died while I was there, tho a great many came away maimed and bruised and, in some cases, disabled for life.  As far as I remember only about ten died during the last ten years that I was there, two of these being killed outright by the guards for trivial offenses.</p>
        <p>It was a hard school that peon camp was, but I learned more there in a few short months by contact with those poor fellows from the outside world than ever I had known before.  Most of what I learned was evil, and I now know that I should have been better off without the knowledge, but much of what I learned was helpful to me.  Barring two or three severe and brutal whippings which I received, I got along very well, all things considered; but the system is damnable.  A favorite way of whipping a man was to strap him down to a log, flat on his back, and spank him fifty or sixty times on his bare feet with a shingle or a huge piece of plank.  When the man would get up with sore and blistered feet and an aching body, if he could not then keep up with the other men at work he would be strapped to the log again, this time face downward, and would be lashed with a buggy trace on his bare back.  When a woman had to be whipped it was usually done in private, tho they would be compelled to fall down across a barrel or something of the kind and receive the licks on their backsides.</p>
        <p>The working day on a peon farm begins with sunrise and ends when the sun goes down; or, in other words, the average peon works from ten to twelve hours each day, with one hour (from 12 o'clock to 1 o'clock) for dinner.  Hot or cold, sun or rain, this is the rule.  As to their meals, the laborers are divided up into squads or companies, just the same as soldiers in a great military camp would be.  Two or three men in each stockade are appointed as cooks.  From thirty to forty men report to each cook.  In the warm months (or eight or nine months out of the year) the cooking is done on the outside, just behind the stockades; in the cold months the cooking is done inside the stockades.  Each peon is provided with a great big tin cup, a flat tin pan and two big tin spoons.  No knives or forks are ever seen, except those used by the cooks.  At meal time the peons<pb id="p413" n="413"/> pass in single file before the cooks, and hold out their pans and cups to receive their allowances.  Cow peas (red or white, which when boiled turned black), fat bacon and old-fashioned Georgia corn bread, baked in pones from one to two and three inches thick, make up the chief articles of food.  Black coffee, black molasses and brown sugar are also used abundantly.  Once in a great while, on Sundays, biscuits would be made, but they would always be made from the kind of flour called “shorts.”  As a rule, breakfast consisted of coffee, fried bacon, corn bread, and sometimes molasses—and one “helping” of each was all that was allowed.  Peas, boiled with huge hunks of fat bacon, and a hoe-cake, as big as a man's hand, usually answered for dinner.  Sometimes this dinner bill of fare gave place to bacon and greens (collard or turnip) and pot liquor.  Tho we raised corn, potatoes and other vegetables, we never got a chance at such things unless we could steal them and cook them secretly.  Supper consisted of coffee, fried bacon and molasses.  But, altho the food was limited to certain things, I am sure we all got a plenty of the things allowed.  As coarse as these things were, we kept, as a rule, fat and sleek and as strong as mules.  And that, too, in spite of the fact that we had no special arrangements for taking regular baths, and no very great effort was made to keep us regularly in clean clothes.  No tables were used or allowed.  In summer we would sit down on the ground and eat our meals, and in winter we would sit around inside the filthy stockades.  Each man was his own dish washer—that is to say, each man was responsible for the care of his pan and cup and spoons.  My dishes got washed about once a week!</p>
        <p>To-day, I am told, there are six or seven of these private camps in Georgia—that is to say, camps where most of the convicts are leased from the State of Georgia.  But there are hundreds and hundreds of farms all over the State where negroes, and in some cases poor white folks, are held in bondage on the ground that they are working out debts, or where the contracts which they have made hold them in a kind of perpetual bondage, because, under those contracts, they may not quit one employer and hire out to another, except by and with the knowledge and consent of the former employer.  One of the usual ways to secure laborers for a large peonage camp is for the proprietor to send out an agent to the little courts in the towns and villages, and where a man charged with some petty offense has no friends or money the agent will urge him to plead guilty, with the understanding that the agent will pay his fine, and in that way save him from the disgrace of being sent to jail or the chain-gang!  For this high favor the man must sign beforehand a paper signifying his willingness to go to the farm and work out the amount of the fine imposed.  When he reaches the farm he has to be fed and clothed, to be sure, and these things are charged up to his account.  By the time he has worked out his first debt another is hanging over his head, and so on and so on, by a sort of endless chain, for an indefinite period, as in every case the indebtedness is arbitrarily arranged by the employer.  In many cases it is very evident that the court officials are in collusion with the proprietors or agents, and that they divide the “graft” among themselves.  As an example of this dickering among the whites, every year many convicts were brought to the Senator's camp from a certain county in South Georgia, 'way down in the turpentine district.  The majority of these men were charged with adultery, which is an offense against the laws of the great and sovereign State of Georgia!  Upon inquiry I learned that a number of negro lewd women were employed by certain white men to entice negro men into their houses; and then, at a given signal, when all was in readiness, raids would be made upon these houses, and the men would be arrested and charges with living in adultery.  Nine out of ten of these men, so arrested and so charged, would find their way ultimately to some convict camp, and, as I said, many of them found their way every year to the Senator's camp while I was there.  The low-down women were never punished in any way.  On the contrary, I was told that they always seemed to stand in high favor with the sheriffs, constables and other officers.  There can be no room to doubt<pb id="p414" n="414"/> that they assisted very materially in furnishing laborers for the prison pens of Georgia, and the belief was general among the men that they were regularly paid for their work.  I could tell more, but I've said enough to make anyone's heart sick.  I am glad that the Federal authorities are taking a hand in breaking up this great and terrible iniquity.  It is, I know, widespread throughout Georgia and many other Southern States.  Since Judge Speer fired into the gang last November at Savannah, I notice that arrests have been made of seven men in three different sections of the State—all charged with holding men in peonage.  Somewhere, somehow, a beginning of the end should be made.</p>
        <p>But I didn't tell you how I got out.  I didn't get out—they put me out.  When I had served as a peon for nearly three years—and you remember that they claimed that I owed them only $165—when I had served for nearly three years, one of the bosses came to me and said that my time was up.  He happened to be the one who was said to be living with my wife.  He gave me a new suit of overalls, which cost about seventy-five cents, took me in a buggy and carried me across the Broad River into South Carolina, set me down and told me to “git.”  I didn't have a cent of money, and I wasn't feeling well, but somehow I managed to get a move on me.  I begged my way to Columbia.  In two or three days I ran across a man looking for laborers to carry to Birmingham, and I joined his gang.  I have been here in the Birmingham district since they released me, and I reckon I'll die either in a coal mine or an iron furnace.  It don't make much difference which.  Either is better than a Georgia peon camp.  And a Georgia peon camp is hell itself!</p>
