        <head>INTRODUCTION.
<lb/>
CHAPTER I.</head>
        <p>It is for the amusement and entertainment of the thousands of
young Kentuckians now enlisted beneath the Stars and Stripes in
the world cataclysm of war for the cause of humanity and
righteousness that these recollections and reminiscences are
published. The author believing they will enable the “boys” to
pass what might otherwise be at times lonesome and monotonous
hours.</p>
        <p>And while refused by the Secretary of War (by reason of
age) the opportunity to participate in the great struggle now
raging, it is his province now only to watch their career, to pray
for them and their success, for their successful and triumphant
return.</p>
        <p>And by reason of his experience as a soldier he can enter
into fully their aspirations and ambitions and share their hopes,
rejoice in their victories and their triumphs. He understands the
dread suspense of the impending conflict, the thrill and shock of
battle, the victorious shout, the gloom and chagrin of defeat, the
pangs of hunger and suffering from wounds and disease  -  for he
has seen war in all its horrors.</p>
        <p>And he knows that when the supreme moment comes that
Kentucky blood will assert itself; that her traditional honor will be
upheld, her renown glorified anew.</p>
        <p>He knows that these inspirations will insure steadiness of
step, strength of arm and force of stroke.</p>
        <p>He rejoices that the ever assertive blood of the Anglo-Saxon
flows through the veins of these young Kentuckians, ready at all
times and under all circumstances to be dedicated to the cause of
humanity and righteousness.</p>
        <p>As will be readily seen, at the time of the writing of these
chapters, there was no thought of the great war in
<pb id="young6" n="6"/>
which the world is now engulfed and it was mainly a work of
pastime and personal satisfaction that they were then written and
published. But the suggestion has been made that if published in
suitable form for distribution and donated by friends to the
Kentucky boys now in service that it might be appreciated by the
boys “over there,” some of whom are doubtless the sons or
grandsons of those who composed this little band of “immortals”
and who contributed so much to Kentucky's history in the
unfortunate fratricidal conflict of almost sixty years ago. Thank
God that the animosities of that unhappy period have long since
been banished, and there is now but one thought, one aim,
animating the hearts and minds of these sons and grandsons, viz.,
the overthrow of autocracy and the avenging of the outrages of
the Huns  -  and a readjustment and regeneration of the relationship
and affairs of men.</p>
        <p>In the changed conditions that confront us today we see the
history of the Commonwealth being absorbed by the Nation and
almost imperceptibly blended into a Nationalized, Americanized
whole.</p>
        <p>And whatever of history the sons of the Commonwealth
achieve in the great war will be accredited to the nation
America, and not Kentucky. And recognizing this unification
as a fixed policy of our government, the writer takes
advantage of the opportunity in this little booklet (lest
we forget) to individualize and compliment the magnificent
record of that little band of Kentuckians, known
in history as the “Orphan Brigade” and whose achievements
form one of the most brilliant chapter's in the history of the
State and Nation. Hence the publication of
this booklet. The writer does not for a moment stop to
criticise the wisdom of this change (from the volunteer
to the conscript system) and he hopes he may be pardoned
for expressing pride in Kentucky's unexcelled past history.
Henceforth it will not be what Kentucky or Ohio
accomplished  -  in war, but what the Nation, unified America,
<pb id="young7" n="7"/>
accomplished. It will now be “liberty enlightening” and
leading the world.</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>Then let the battle rage and onward move,</l>
          <l>Count not the cost nor falter in the breach,</l>
          <l>God, the Great Commander, wields the righteous wand,</l>
          <l>And bids you<hi rend="italics"> His Love</hi> the tyrant teach.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>When that shall have been accomplished (should the author
be living) he will be tempted to exclaim in the language of old
Moses when from Mt. Nebo he beheld the land of Canaan and
exclaimed “Now Lord, I am ready.”</p>
        <p>In writing these recollections and reminiscences he has aimed
as much as possible to avoid aspersions, reflections and
criticisms and confine himself to a personal knowledge, which, of
course, was more or less limited, because of the restricted sphere
of his activities and operations. But he assures the “boys” that his
stories, while not classic, are substantially true. He could not
afford to, at his advanced age, attempt to misrepresent or
deceive, and he hopes the reader will excuse any irregularities in
the order of publication in book form for, as previously stated,
that was not originally contemplated.</p>
        <p>In comparing conditions and surroundings of that day with
those of the soldier of today, we find them so radically different
as to be incomparable. And for this the soldier of today should be
truly thankful, since in the case of these isolated Kentuckians  -  
none of whom could communicate with friends and receive a
message or word of cheer from the dear ones at home,
circumstances today are so very, very different. And while you
are called upon to meet and face many and more trying dangers,
because of the new and more modern instruments of war, you
are in many ways much better provided for than were your sires
and grandsires. Now when sick or wounded you have every
attention that modern skill and science can command. You have
also the angelic help and ministrations of that greatest of all help
and comfort, the Red
<pb id="young8" n="8"/>
Cross, and many other sources of help and aid that the soldiers of
the past did not have.</p>
        <p>So that while the dangers may be greater, the casualties more
numerous, relief has multiplied proportionately. And you are
today soldiers engaged in war which has the same meaning it
has always had. Because of the gloom and sorrow that now
enshrouds the world, it would be well if we could forget the past  -  
for the events of today are but a portrayal of the past, a renewal
of man's “inhumanity to man.” But it has been so decreed by Him
who “moves in a mysterious way His wonders to perform, Who
plants His footsteps in the sea and rides upon the storm.”</p>
        <p>And let us hope  -  as many believe  -  that out of “Much tribulation
cometh great joy.” If it were not for a great and wise purpose,
how could it be? It is God's will and submission to His will is
man's only choice.</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>So let your spirits as they rise and fall,</l>
          <l>Ever cling to the Faith that Right will prevail,</l>
          <l>That God will be with you to the end and is all in all,</l>
          <l>And no foeman, freedom's banner shall assail.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>It is at the instance of the Richard Hawes Chapter of the U.
D. C. chiefly that the writer of these recollections and
reminiscences has collected and published them.</p>
        <p>If in contributing this history of experiences and recollections
he shall give in any degree pleasure and furnish entertainment to
the “dear Kentucky boys” over the seas he shall feel happy to
have had that privilege and opportunity.</p>
        <p>He assures them that none more sincerely, more prayerfully
hopes for their safe and triumphant return. He knows that this
triumph will be the grandest chapter in the world's history and
that America will have played her part gloriously in the grand
tragedy.</p>
        <p>Oh! that he could he one of the actors!</p>
        <p>Then will the dark and gloomy days of your absence
hallowed by the blood of your lost comrades be made
<pb id="young9" n="9"/>
glorious by a triumphant return, the like of which the world has
never before seen nor never will see again.</p>
        <p>Then will every hilltop and mountain peak blaze with the
bonfires of a glorious greeting.</p>
        <p>Then will the dear old mother's heart thrill with joy and
happiness, then will the old father say “Welcome! Welcome! my
dear boy, I knew you would come.” Then too will she who
promised, watched, hoped and prayed
be found seeking the opportunity to say “I am now ready to
redeem my promise.”</p>
        <p>Then will the old soldier (God permitting him to live) who
dedicates these lines extend the glad hand of greeting to the
noble boys of his acquaintance and say, “well done ye noble
sons! I rejoice in your achievements, your victories, your
triumphs.</p>
        <p>“Welcome, thrice welcome, and again welcome, God smiles
and the land is yours. Let justice and righteousness prevail now,
henceforth and forever.”</p>
        <p>It is conceivable that forty or fifty years hence some of these
soldier boys now participating in the great war
will find themselves wandering over these fields upon which the
greatest tragedies in the world's history are now being enacted,
and it is in full comprehension (because
of similar experiences) that the writer can extend the
imaginations of the mind to that time.</p>
        <p>It will be for him, who may be so fortunate, a glorious day, a
thrilling and inspiring reminiscence. To be one of
the actors in this stupendous tragedy in the history and affairs of
the world; to see, to participate in and realize these grand events
is to see things that have heretofore seemed impossible, or
inconceivable.</p>
        <p>But the times are full of wonders and amazements, and
things are happening faster and faster day by day.</p>
        <p>If the early history of the writer, read before the U. D. C.'s,
contains matter that would seem more appropriate for a novel,
because of its romantic character he justifies himself by saying
that “youth is full of romance” and he
<pb id="young10" n="10"/>
believes, yea he knows, that many a brave boy today feels the
impulse and touch of these thoughts and suggestions  -  and not
alone the soldier boy, but the modest, timid, retiring maiden
whose heart quavered when she said goodbye.</p>

        <opener><dateline>(An address delivered at Paris, Ky., June 26, 1916.)</dateline>
<salute><hi rend="italics">Madame President, Ladies, Daughters of the Confederacy:</hi></salute></opener>
        <p>I have several times promised your ex-president, Mrs. Leer, that I
would furnish her with a brief history of my observations and
experiences as a soldier, and have so far failed; but will now,
ere it is too late, try to comply with this promise.</p>
        <p>But for the life of me I cannot see how I shall comply with
this request without (seemingly at least) appearing in the role of
one given to self praise or eulogy, and, modest man that I am, I
hesitate; this will explain why I have been so long complying
with your request, and shall constitute my apology.</p>
        <p>The history of Kentucky Confederates was in most instances
very similar and their duties likewise similar. All were imbued
with the spirit of patriotism and love for the cause in which they
had engaged, each determined to do whatever he could to
promote and advance the cause in which he was enlisted. In this
I claim to have done no more than other Kentucky soldiers who
fought under the “Stars and Bars.”</p>
        <p>And yet there may be some incidents, some experiences in
my history so different from others as to make them somewhat
interesting by contrast, and as others have kindly furnished you
with a history of their experience, you may be somewhat
interested in making comparisons.</p>
        <p>Now, so far as relates to my history as a <hi rend="italics">real</hi> soldier, the
beginning of that career was on the 8th of September, 1861. On
the 22d of January following I was twenty years old  -  quite a
youth you are ready to say. But I had been a soldier almost two
years, being a charter member of that little band of “Sunday”
soldiers  -  the “Flat Rock Grays”  -  and which constituted an integral
part of what
<pb id="young12" n="12"/>
was known at that time as the Kentucky “State Guard.”</p>
        <p>This little company of citizen soldiers were in their conceit and
imagination very important and consequential fellows. Invited
to all the noted gatherings and public affairs of the day,
dressed in gaudy and flashy uniforms and flying plumes, filled
with pride and <hi rend="italics">conceit,</hi> they did not know they were nursing
their pride against the day of wrath. One only of two now
living, I look back upon those days and scenes of youthful
pride and ambition, with a feeling of awe and reminiscence,
and wonder why and wherefore have I been spared through
the labyrinth of time elapsed and for what, alas! I am
wondering.</p>
        <p>The most of the “Grays” left home for the scenes of the war
in August, but I had not completed my arrangements and did not
reach “Camp Burnett,” Tennessee, until September 7. Now the
most trying and impressing circumstances of these preparations
was the last “goodbye” to my dear old mother and sweetheart,
both of whom survived the war; the dear old mother greeting me
on my return in a manner I shall leave to the imagination of you
ladies to describe. I was her “baby” and had been mourned as lost
more than once. But the sweetheart in the meantime had become
the wife of another and gone to a distant state to make her home.
Oh! the fickleness of woman and the <hi rend="italics">uncertainties of war</hi>.
Pardon me, ladies, I mean no reflection, but it hurts to this day;
yet God in His wisdom and goodness knows I forgave her.
Perhaps schoolday love is remembered and still lingers in the
heart of some of those I am addressing, then she, at least, can
appreciate this sentiment.</p>
        <p>The 6th of September found me in this town (Paris, Ky.),
where I began preparations for the life of a soldier, by
substituting my “pumps” for “Brogans,” which I knew would be
more suitable, really indispensable for a soldier on the march over
rough and rugged roads. I sent back home my pumps and horse,
the latter afterward confiscated and appropriated by the Yanks.
Now I am sure
<pb id="young13" n="13"/>
my brogans presented a striking and ludicrous contrast to my
“clawhammer” blue broadcloth and gold buttons, and to which I
shall have occasion to refer again. But I was going to the war
and why should I care for comment or criticism? That night
found me in Louisville, a shy, cringing guest of the old Louisville
Hotel, my brogans giving me more concern than anything else,
being in such striking contrast to my clawhammer broadcloth and
gold buttons. I recall the scenes of that night and next morning
with a distinctness that makes me almost shudder to this day. If it
were possible for you ladies to imagine the excitement of those
days, filled with the thousands of exciting rumors that were heard
every hour in the day, turn in whatever direction you might, and
the clangor and preparation for war, you might have some idea
of, and appreciate, my predicament. A solitary country boy, who
had seen but little of the world, on his road South in quest of
Southern rights on the field of battle. Were it not fraught with
fearful recollections it would now seem ridiculous. But the night
was spent, not in sleep, but in wild imaginings as to the outcome
on the morrow and what the morning would develop. Morning
came and with reddened eyes and unsteady step, I came down
the winding stairs of the old hotel, my mind filled with fearful
misgivings. Going up to the office shyly I began instinctively to
turn the leaves of the register; imagine my surprise when I read
the names of Generals W. T. Sherman, L. J. Rousseau, Major
Anderson of Fort Sumter fame and other Federal officers, aides
and orderlies, who were stopping there; that humbug Kentucky
“neutrality” no longer being observed. I was now almost ready to
call on the Lord to save me. But my fears were intensified when
a gentleman of middle age, whom I had noticed eyeing me
closely, walked across the room, putting his hand on my shoulder
and asked me to a corner of the room. “Angels and ministers of
grace defend me”  -  in the hands of a detective. I'm gone now!
Noticing my look of fear and trepidation, he said, “Compose
<pb id="young14" n="14"/>
yourself young man, <hi rend="italics">I am</hi> your friend  -  the shoes you wear
(Oh, the tell-tale shoes! Why didn't I keep my pumps) lead me to
believe you meditate joining the army, and if I am not mistaken
you are aiming to go South to join the Confederates.” I was now
halting between two opinions; was he aiming to have me commit
myself, or was he really a friend? But proceeding, he said, “It is
but natural you should suspect me, but I am your friend
nevertheless, and am here to advise and assist young men like
you in getting through the lines (a somewhat calmer feeling came
over me now) and you will have to be very cautious, for I fear
your brogans are a tell-tale  -  (I had already realized THAT). You
see,” said, he, “excitement is running high and almost everybody
is under suspicion, myself with others.” I ventured to ask his
name, which he readily gave me as Captain Coffee of Tennessee,
to me a very singular name.</p>
        <p>Feeling sure of his man and continuing, he said, “The train that
leaves here this morning will likely be the last for the state line
(and sure enough it was) and you will find excitement running
high at the station; they have guards to examine all passengers
and their baggage, and when you reach the station go straight to
the ticket office, secure your ticket and go to the rear of the train.
Go in and take the first vacant seat and for Heaven's sake, if
possible, hide your brogans, for I fear they may tell on you.” I had
by this time become thoroughly convinced that he was really my
friend and decided to take his advice.</p>
        <p>But now the climax to the situation was, as I thought, about to
be reached. Looking toward the winding stairs I saw coming
down them (Coffee told me who they were) dressed in their
gaudy regimentals (the regulation blue and gold lace), Generals
W. T. Sherman and L. J. Rousseau, side by side, arm in arm,
behind them the short, chubby figure of Major Anderson of Fort
Sumter fame and some other prominent officers whose names I
have
<pb id="young15" n="15"/>
forgotten, accompanied by their staff officers and orderlies. A
“pretty kettle of fish” for me to be caught with  -  I thought. They
passed into the dining room immediately. I shall never forget the
hook-nose, lank, lean and hungry look of General Sherman,
reminding me of Julius Caesar's description of Cassius. Later on I
was often reminded of this incident, when Sherman was pushing
us through Georgia, toward the sea in the celebrated campaign of
'64. I was then almost wicked enough to wish that I had at this
time and there ended his career. But, exchanging a few more
words with Capt. Coffee, I called for my satchel and took the
“bus” for the station; arriving there I acted upon the advice of my
new made friend and adviser. Quickly procuring my ticket and
entering the car, I secured the rear seat and with fear and
trembling attempted to hide my brogans by setting my satchel on
them. (We had no suit cases then.) This was a morning of
wonderful excitement in the station for it was the last train to
leave Louisville for the State line and Memphis. There were
thousands of people there crowding every available foot of space
  -  excitement ran high. The train guards or inspectors  -  fully armed
  -  were busy examining passengers and their baggage. My heart
almost leaped from my bosom as they came down the aisle. But
just before they reached the rear of the car the bell rang and the
train started. The guards rushed for the door, leaving me and one
or two others unquestioned and unmolested. Like “Paul, when he
reached the three taverns,” I thanked God and took courage. I
doubt if the old station ever before or since saw such excitement
and heard such a shout as went up from the people therein
assembled as the train pulled out for Dixie. Many of these people
were Southern sympathizers and wished us God-speed and a safe
journey.</p>
        <p>That evening I joined my schoolboy friends and soldier
comrades, the “Flat Rock Grays,” in Camp Burnett, Tennessee,
the Grays dropping their name and acquiring the letter “H” in
the regimental formation of that celebrated
<pb id="young16" n="16"/>
regiment commanded by Col. Robert P. Trabue and known as the
Fourth Kentucky, C. S. A. That night I slept in camp for the first
time  -  as to what I dreamed I am unable to say  -  it might have been
of the sweetheart. The next day was spent in getting acquainted
with the dear fellows whose comradeship I was to have and
share for the next four years. Here began the experiences of the
<hi rend="italics">real </hi>soldier, that was to include some of the most momentous
events in American history. Only one day, however, was spent in
Burnett, for that night orders came for those companies that had
been supplied with arms to break camp early next morning and
take the train for Bowling Green  -  to “invade Kentucky.” The
companies without arms, among which was Company H, was to
repair to Nashville where we procured arms, joining the rest of
the regiment a few weeks later at Bowling Green.</p>
        <p>I have told you of the beginning, now it is proper and
altogether pertinent that I should refer to some of the closing
scenes of my career as a soldier. But I am here leaving a gap in
my history, the most important part of it, which will be found in
other parts of this little book.</p>
        <p>Having received my furlough at Jonesboro, where I was
wounded on August 31, 1864, the following six months were
spent in hospitals; first at Barnesville, later at Macon and then
Cuthbert, Ga., and later still at Eufaula, Ala. I had as companions
in hospital experiences three other Kentuckians, Captain E. F.
Spears of this city, Paris, whom you all know to have been a
gentleman of the highest honor and noblest emotions  -  a
gentleman  -  Oh, how I loved him; and Lieutenants Hanks and
Eales, noble fellows and companionable comrades. Here were
formed ties of friendship  -  that death alone could sever.</p>
        <p>But having sufficiently recovered from my wound, I decided
the last of March that I would make an effort to reach my
command (the Orphan Brigade) now engaged in a desperate
effort to stay the progress of Sherman's devastating columns now
operating in South Carolina.
<pb id="young17" n="17"/>
The “Orphans” in the meantime and during my absence had
been converted into cavalry. I was still on crutches and
bidding Eufaula friends good-bye (with regret) I started once
more for the front.</p>
        <p>The times were now fraught with gloomy forebodings and
misgivings, excitement running high. The South was in tears,
terror stricken  -  the Confederacy surely and rapidly was reeling to
her doom. General Wilson's cavalry was raiding through
Alabama and Georgia with but little opposition, destroying the
railroads and almost everything else of value as they moved
across the country.</p>
        <p>On the train I had very distinguished company in the person
of General “Bob” Toombs, who commanded the Georgia militia, a
mythical organization of the times, and Mrs. L. Q. C. Lamar of
Mississippi, whose husband was afterward a member of
Cleveland's Cabinet. I was very much impressed with the
remarkable personality of this lady and felt sorry for her and her
family of seven children, fleeing terror stricken from the raiders.
Pandemonium seemed to reign supreme among these fleeing
refugees, the air being literally alive with all sorts of rumors about
the depredations and atrocities of the raiders. Numerous delays
occurred to the train, everybody on board fearing the raiders and
anxious to move on. General Toombs, excited and worried at
these delays, determined to take charge of the situation and see
that the train moved on. With a navy revolver in each hand he
leaped from the train and with an oath that meant business said
<hi rend="italics">he</hi> would see that the train moved on  -  which it did rather promptly,
the General taking due credit to himself for its moving, which the
passengers willingly accorded him. Inquiring who this moving
spirit was, I was told that it was General “Bob” Toombs (by this
name, <hi rend="italics">“Bob” Toombs</hi>, he was known throughout the United
States). Instantly there flashed into my mind the celebrated
speech he made in the United States Senate, in which he said
that “erelong he expected to call the roll
<pb id="young18" n="18"/>
of his slaves beneath the shadow of Bunker Hill Monument”  -  and
which speech did more to fire the hearts of the North than almost
anything said or done prior to the war.</p>
        <p>But finally we reached Macon  -  where I had been in the
hospital  -  and on the afternoon of the second day after our arrival,
Wilson's cavalry took possession of the city. That night some of
the fiends, that are to be found in every army, applied the torch to
the home of Senator Howell Cobb, the Lanier Hotel and a
number of other prominent buildings. I could realize the
excitement from the Confederate hospital on College Hill, which
overlooks the city, and which was terrifying and appalling beyond
anything I had ever before seen. The shrieks and cries of the
women and children almost unnerved me. Woe of woes! Horror
of horrors! I thought.</p>
        <p>But I must do General Wilson the honor to say that he did not
order or approve of this fiendish piece of work, for he did all in
his power to prevent and stop it; and but for his efforts the city
would no doubt have been completely destroyed.</p>
        <p>Of course I abandoned my attempt to join the old boys of the
“Orphan Brigade.” I was now a prisoner, everything lost (save
honor), gloom and chaos were everywhere. Obtaining a parole
from the Federal officer in command (something new), I decided
to join my comrades Knox and Harp, each of whom, like myself,
had been put out of business by wounds received sometime
before and who were sojourning with a friend in the country near
Forsythe, intending to counsel with them as to the best course to
be pursued next. Having enjoyed the hospitality of our host and
his good wife for several days, Knox and myself decided to go
down to Augusta for a last and final parting with the remnant of
these dear “old boys” of the “Orphan Brigade” whom we learned
were to be paroled in that city. We soon learned upon our arrival
in the city that General Lewis and staff would arrive next
morning. Next
<pb id="young19" n="19"/>
morning the General and staff rode through the city, the most
sorrowful and forlorn looking men my eyes ever looked upon; it
was enough to make a savage weep. The cause for which we
had so long fought, sacrificed and suffered, lost, everything lost,
God and the world apparently against us, without country, without
home or hope, the old family being broken up and separated
forever, our very souls sinking within us, gloom and sorrow
overhanging the world; what would we do; what could we do?
Learning from General Lewis that the remnant of the little band
of immortals who had contributed so much to the history and
renown of Kentucky in the great conflict would be paroled at
Washington, some twenty miles from Augusta, Knox and myself
proceeded to that place for a last and final farewell.</p>
        <p>The associations of almost four years of the bloodiest war in
modern times up to that day were here, to be forever broken up.
The eyes that gleamed defiance in the battles' rage were now
filled with tears of sorrow at parting. The hand that knew no
trembling in the bloody onslaught now wavered and trembled  -  
the hour for the last parting had arrived, the long struggle ended
forever  -  good-bye, John; farewell, Henry; it is all over and all is
lost, ended at last; good-bye, boys; good-bye.</p>
        <p>Are their deeds worth recording, worth remembering? It is
for you, dear ladies, rather than men, to say whether it shall be
done or not, and in what way. <hi rend="italics">I</hi> am content to leave it to you,
knowing that it will be well and faithfully done.</p>
        <p>Resuming the closing scenes of my experiences at
Washington and the final sad leave-taking of these dear old
“Orphans,” I must revert to my friend and well wisher (as he
proved to be), General Toombs.</p>
        <p>The Confederate Government had saved from the ruin that
befell and overtook it several thousand dollars in coin
<pb id="young20" n="20"/>
and which was being transported across the country, whither,
no one seemed to know  -  in charge of a certain major.</p>
        <p>Now Washington was the home of my hero of the train
incident. The powers that were left decided to distribute a part of
this coin among the faithful veterans who were being paroled at
this point. The cavalry, who did not enlist until later in '62,
receiving $26, in some instances more, while the Orphans
received as their share only $3.50, a very unfair and inequitable
distribution, character of service and time being considered. The
cavalry in this, as in some other instances, receiving the lion's
share and getting the most of the good things that fell to the lot of
the “pooh” soldier. This money consisted mainly of “double
eagles,” three of which fell to the remnant of my company. The
perplexing question now was how could we divide this money.
The matter was finally settled by the boys commissioning me to
go down into the town (a mile or more away) to see if I could
exchange it for smaller coins. Still on crutches, I finally consented,
but it was a task. Going into town and from home to home  -  all
business houses long since closed  -  I at last staggered on the home
of General Toombs  -  not knowing he lived there. I recognized at
once the moving spirit of the train incident. He and another
gentleman were seated on the veranda engaged in earnest and
animated conversation. Saluting in military style, I at once made
known my business. The General protested that <hi rend="italics">he</hi> had no
change, but referring me to his guest, Major  -  , who, he said, was
in charge of some funds in the house belonging to the
government. The Major remarked if I would wait awhile he would
furnish me with the required change, at the same time retiring to a
back room of the house where I soon heard the sound of a
hammer or hatchet, presumably in the hand of the Major, who
was engaged in opening a box or chest. In the meantime the
General invited me to a seat on the veranda and began plying me
with numerous and pertinent questions  -  not giving me a chance to
refer
<pb id="young21" n="21"/>
to the train incident  -  asking to what command I belonged, when
and where I was wounded and how I expected to get home and
many other questions, not forgetting in his vigorous and vehement
way (for which he was noted) to deplore the fate of the
Confederacy and denouncing the Yankee in unmeasured and
vigorous terms.</p>
        <p>Finally after so long a time the Major returned with the
required change  -  all in silver and while not much, it gave me
(already tired out) great worry before I reached camp on my
crutches. Of course I thanked the Major and apologized for
having put him to so much trouble, and saluting him good day, I
started for the gate, the General preceding me and still asking
questions. Opening the gate, for which I thanked him, I tipped a
military salute and started up the sidewalk. But the General
seemed very much interested in me and walking alongside the
yard fence he suddenly thrust his hand into his vest pocket,
pulling out a twenty dollar coin and quickly reaching across the
fence, he said, “Here, Lieutenant, take this from me. You will
doubtless need it.” Dumfounded at this sudden change of affairs,
I politely declined it, but the General, in a spirit of earnest
command, forcefully said, “Here, take it, sir; you are a d---n long
way from home and you will need it before you get there.”
Comprehending the spirit which prompted it, I accepted it and
thanked him, extending him my hand, which he grasped with a
warmth that thrilled my soul to its very depths.</p>
        <p>Thus the diamond in the rough that I had seen on the train at
once became the glittering jewel that sparkled and shed its
brilliance to the depths of my then thankful and weary soul. I love
to think of this incident and this great man (for he was truly a
great man of his time) and transpiring at the time it did and under
to me  -  such distressing and discouraging circumstances, it is
one of the happy and cheering oases of my soldier life.</p>
        <p>Going from Washington back to Augusta I met and spent the
following night in company with Hon. E. M.
<pb id="young22" n="22"/>
Bruce, one of the best friends I ever had, whose friendship,
magnanimity and generosity toward myself and other
Kentuckians was, as in my case, made practical, he presenting
me with three double eagles, which I was <hi rend="italics">compelled</hi> to receive
as a recompense for acts of friendship and assistance rendered
him during the trying times of the preceding four years. I have
never known a grander character than E. M. Bruce, a truer
friend, a nobler man.</p>
        <p>But now, with more than $80 of <hi rend="italics">real</hi> money, I was quite well
equipped for the return to dear “Old Kentucky,” which I was glad
to see after an absence of almost four years, spent under the
most dangerous and trying circumstances to which it was
possible for man to be exposed.</p>
        <p>There were doubts in my mind as to what our status as
citizens would be and just how we would be received and
regarded by some; returning as we did, overcome, discomfited,
defeated. But we well knew how we would be received by those
who loved us and whose sympathies were manifested in a
thousand ways not to be mistaken or misunderstood. Here in
these manifestations was recompense for the long years of
absence amid dangers, trials and suffering.</p>
        <p>And now after a lapse of more than half a century, with its
wonderful history, we are still remembered by some of the kind
and gentle spirits that greeted us on our return, and other
charming and lovely spirits of the U. D. C., descendants of the
noblest ancestry that ever lived and inhabited this, the fairest land
that God ever made.</p>
        <p>These circumstances, these surroundings and inspiring scenes
make hallowed the lives of these few surviving old veterans,
rendering it a panacea for all that we as soldiers of the “lost
cause” encountered and suffered.</p>
        <p>From the fulness of my heart I thank you, noble ladies, for
your kindness and patient attention. This opportunity to appear
before you today is more than a pleasure and I feel honored to
find myself in your presence and appreciate your happy greeting.</p>

RECOLLECTIONS OF THE BATTLE OF SHILOH.</head>
        <opener><dateline>(From an address delivered at the meeting of the Morgan's
Men Association at Olympian Springs, September 2, 1916.)</dateline>
<salute><hi rend="italics">Mr. President, Old Comrades, Ladies and Gentlemen:</hi></salute></opener>
        <p>I must confess that this is somewhat embarrassing attempting
to talk in public at the age of seventy-two, never having
attempted such a thing before. But the subject upon which I am
expected to talk is certainly, to myself, at least, interesting, and
the occasion I am sure is happy and inspiring, had I only the
ability to do them justice. However, by reason of my inexperience
in matters of this kind, I believe I can safely appeal to the charity
of my audience to overlook any failure I may make to properly
interest them in what I shall have to say.</p>
        <p>You ask sir, that I shall relate some of my observations and
experiences of the great battle of Shiloh. Well fifty-two years and
more is a long time and takes us back to that important event in
American History that transpired on the banks of the Tennessee
on April 6 and 7, 1862. Some of these old veterans now seated
before me can doubtless remember many of the exciting and
intensely interesting scenes of these two eventful days. It is more
deeply impressed upon my mind, because of the fact that it was
our initial battle and early impressions are said to be always most
lasting.</p>
        <p>This was the first of a series of grand and important events in
the history of that renowned little band of Kentuckians, known in
history as the “Orphan Brigade,” but which for the present
occasion I shall designate as the Kentucky Brigade, it not
receiving its baptismal or historic name until the celebrated
charge of Breckinridge at Murfreesboro.
<pb id="young24" n="24"/>
But what a grand and thrilling opening chapter in the
lives of these Kentucky boys, as soldiers, for we were only boys,
as we now look back at things, a majority of us being under
twenty-one.</p>
        <p>Now, if I were called upon to say which in my judgment was
the best planned, most thoroughly and systematically, fought
battle of the war in which I took part, I would unhesitatingly say
Shiloh. As time rolled on and with subsequent observations and
experiences on other important fields, such as Murfreesboro,
Chickamauga, Resaca, Atlanta, Jonesboro and a number of
others, I am still constrained to say that Shiloh was the typical
battle. I mean, of course, battles fought in the West and in which
Kentucky troops took a prominent part.</p>
        <p>If in relating my story I shall seem somewhat partial to
Kentuckians, I hope I may be excused for it is of them I shall talk
mainly, besides, you know I love them dearly. And in the exercise
of this partiality I claim to be justified from the fact that a number
of the leading characters in this grand tragedy of war were
Kentuckians. First among whom was the great general and
peerless leader; others were Breckinridge, Preston, Tighlman,
Trabue, Helm, Morgan, Monroe, Lewis, Hunt, Hodges, Wickliffe,
Anderson, Burns, Cobb and last but by no means least, Governor
George W. Johnson whose patriotic example was unsurpassed
and whose tragic death was one of the most pathetic incidents of
the great battle. A conspicuous figure indeed was he, so much so
that when found on the field mortally wounded by the enemy, they
believed him to be General Breckinridge. Private John Vaughn, of
my old Company H of the Fourth Regiment, relates this story in
regard to this sad and lamentable incident. Vaughn was severely
wounded and was lying on the field near where Governor
Johnston fell and from which he had just been removed by the
enemy, when General Grant rode up and inquired to what
command he belonged. When told by Vaughn to what command
he belonged, Grant said: “And
<pb id="young25" n="25"/>
it is Kentuckians, is it, that have been fighting my men so
desperately at this point?” Here is where the four desperate
charges and counter-charges were made on the Seventh and
noted by Colonel Trabue as commander of the Kentucky Brigade
in his official report of the great battle, the bloodiest part of the
field where Kentucky gave up many of her noblest and best. This
is the field to which General Grant refers in his “Memoirs,” when
in writing of the desperate fighting of the Confederates, he says:
“I saw an open field on the second day's battle over which the
Confederates had made repeated charges, so thickly covered
with their dead that it might have been possible to have walked
across the clearing in any direction stepping on dead bodies
without touching a foot to the ground.”</p>
        <p>Here were enacted scenes of sublime courage and heroism
that elicited the admiration and comment of the civilized world;
here the soil of Tennessee drank freely the blood of her elder
sister, Kentucky.</p>
        <p>But Grant, when told by Vaughn that he belonged to the
Kentucky Brigade, turned to one of his aids and ordered a litter to
be brought and had Vaughn placed upon it saying, “We have
killed your General Breckinridge and have him down yonder,”
pointing in the direction of their field hospital. He then had him
taken down to where the supposed General Breckinridge lay. It
seems that they were doubtful of and wished to establish his
identity. Pointing to the body of the dying Governor he asked
Vaughn if he was not his general. When Vaughn told him that it
was Governor Johnson and not General Breckinridge, Grant
turned away quickly with a look of disappointment upon
discovering his mistake and learning who he was. Vaughn used to
relate this incident with considerable feeling and pride as
connecting him with General Grant at this particular time and
under such peculiar and painful circumstances. I mention it
because it contains more than ordinary interest to some of us
Kentuckians,
<pb id="young26" n="26"/>
who had the opportunity of witnessing the heroic conduct and
sublime courage of this noble citizen of Kentucky.</p>
        <p>But let us notice while passing some of the sacrifices
Kentucky made in this first great battle of the war in the West
and the compliment incidently and unintentionally paid us (as
Kentuckians), by the greatest general that ever commanded the
Federal army.</p>
        <p>First among whom was the great general and peerless leader,
Albert Sidney Johnston, whose name I always mention with
feelings of profound pride and admiration, I would liked to have
said veneration. George W. Johnson, the noble beloved citizen
and patriotic Governor, whose voluntary example of sublime
courage and heroism was without a parallel in the great battle.
Thomas B. Monroe, the youthful and distinguished journalist,
statesman and accomplished soldier, a man with scarce a peer at
his age in either civil or military life. Charles N. Wickliffe, the
gallant and dashing colonel of the Seventh Kentucky, and a
thousand other Kentuckians many less distinguished but equally
brave  -  the flower of Kentucky youth and manhood. Is it any
wonder I am partial to Kentuckians and proud of their record in
this great and memorable battle?</p>
        <p>Oh, how well I remember the morning of that eventful Easter
Sabbath, April 6, 1862. So beautiful and lovely that all nature
seemed proud and happy. Trees budding, flowers blooming, birds
singing, everything seemingly joyful and happy in the bright
sunshine of early spring, save man alone. But with what
awfulness the scene changes when we contemplate man's
actions at this hour and time bent upon the overthrow and
destruction of his fellowman and how ominously significant the
preparation.</p>
        <p>Just at early dawn we were quietly awakened by our officers  -  
many a noble and brave boy from his last sleep on earth; the
bugle not sounding the reveille, for fear of attracting the attention
of the enemy, it being part of the great general's plan to take him
by surprise, which succeeded admirably, notwithstanding the oft
repeated denials
<pb id="young27" n="27"/>
of General Grant to the contrary. Quickly arranging our
toilets and having hastily despatched breakfast from our
haversacks we formed in double column by company, the band in
front leading, playing “Dixie,” which sounded upon the early
morning stillness in this deep wildwood, as it never before
sounded, soul-stirring and inspiring. What patriotic soldier could
fail to be moved by its charm and pathos? The veil of caution
and silence now removed by the band, down through the woods
of massive oaks we moved at quick-step, every man doubtless
believing himself the equal of half a dozen Yankees. A very
erroneous notion indeed, soon dispelled by hard and stubborn
facts to the contrary. But on we moved stopping but once to
unsling knapsacks, which with our Sunday clothes and precious
jewels we never saw again. Ah, some of those precious jewels!
Still on we moved. Now the roll of the Skirmishers' rifles away
out in front told that the issue of battle was being joined, not
Greek against Greek, but American against American in one of
the most desperate and sanguinary conflicts of the great war.
Led by two of the greatest military chieftains of the age; here the
high spirited and chivalrous youth from the Southern plantations
and the daring, hardy Western boy from the prairies of the West,
had met in battle array.</p>
        <p>Here was to be a display of courage and chivalry
unsurpassed in the annals of war. Now an occasional boom,
boom, of the big guns, began to echo up and down the valley of
the Tennessee as Hardee's batteries seemingly in chorus with
those of the enemy in reply, began to open on Grant's battalions
now hurriedly forming, having recovered from their surprise
caused by the sudden and unexpected attack of Hardee's
advanced lines. Stirred by the highest ambition of our youthful
hearts on toward the front rapidly and steadily, now in column of
fours, moved the Kentucky Brigade. Passing down a little narrow
valley just to the left and on the higher ground, we passed that
gallant little band of Kentuckians known as Morgan's Squadron
<pb id="young28" n="28"/>
at the head of which, seated on “Black Bess” the real (not
the mythical “Black Bess” that some of you fellows sometimes
talk so loudly about and never saw), but the <hi rend="italics">real</hi> Black Bess  -  was
that grandest specimen of a Kentucky soldier, save one  -  the
immortal Breckinridge  -  Captain John H. Morgan. The Kentucky
Brigade was proud to find itself in such noble, such royal
company, though for a passing moment only. Oh, how it thrilled
our hearts as these Kentucky boys, Morgan's men, greeted us by
waving their hats, cheering and singing their famous battle song;</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>“Cheer, boys, cheer; we'll march away to battle;</l>
          <l>Cheer, boys, cheer, for our sweethearts and our wives;</l>
          <l>Cheer, boys, cheer; we'll nobly do our duty,</l>
          <l>And give to Kentucky our arms, our hearts, our lives.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>General Duke, you remember this incident. Do you not, sir?
More than happy am I with such a noble witness to attest the
correctness of this part of my story. It was the second line of this
famous stanza that touched my soul most and sunk deepest into
my youthful heart, for I had left back in old Nicholas a little, black-eyed,
curly-haired maiden whose image at that very moment
seemed fairer than all the angels in heaven. My old heart still
beats quick when I think of this thrilling incident and those
charming eyes. Now there are doubtless some of you old veterans
who are listening to me that left home under similar
circumstances as myself kissing farewell, as you thought, perhaps
for the last time, the dear little girl you were leaving behind and
who felt on the battle's verge as I did and was tempted to exclaim
with me in the anguish of your heart, “Oh cruel, cruel relentless
war, what sad havoc you have wrought with lovers and lovers'
lives.” Verily, old comrades, I believe I am growing sentimental as
well as very childish, but these thoughts crowd my memory and
must have vent. Still to the battle's breach I must go where the
“pride, pomp and circumstances of glorious war” invite.</p>
        <p>Pressing rapidly forward we quickly passed through
<pb id="young29" n="29"/>
the enemy's outer encampments from which they had fled
when attacked and surprised by Hardee's skirmishers, leaving
behind them untouched, their breakfasts of steaming hot coffee,
fried ham and other good things with which their improvised
tables seemed to be heavily ladened, and which under other
and more favorable circumstances, we would have quickly
appropriated. But the scenes of greatest moment and absorbing
interest were on the front toward which we were rapidly hurrying
where the clash of steel, shot and shell was resounding with the
fury of desperation.</p>
        <p>How well I remember the first victim of war  -  a Confederate  -  I
saw on this eventful morning. How well, too, I remember the hiss
and scream of the first shells of the enemy's guns that passed
closely above our heads, and how quickly and ungracefully we
bowed in acknowledgment. How well, also, I remember the first
volley fired at us by Colonel Worthington's Forty-sixth, Ohio, our
neighbors from just across the river. We had hardly completed
the formation of changing “front to rear” on our first company in
order to confront them squarely by bringing our line parallel with
theirs, when they opened fire on us, getting the drop on us, if you
please.</p>
        <p>Now I need not say much about this experience, for I am
sure that every old veteran remembers well the first fire to which
he was exposed, but I do believe that my hair must have stood on
end and fairly lifted my cap for I felt as they leveled their rifles,
that every man of us would surely be killed. Not many however,
were killed or seriously hurt, for the enemy in their eagerness and
great excitement fired wildly over our heads. The next was ours,
and as we had been previously cautioned by Major Monroe to
fire low, we made it count. Quickly reloading our rifles we had
hardly fired the second volley when the sharp shrill voice of
Major Monroe rang out amid the roar and din of battle, “Fix
bayonet” and was quickly repeated by the company commanders.
My, my; oh Lord; but the cold
<pb id="young30" n="30"/>
chills darted up and down my spinal column as I contemplated the use of
the bayonet. Now if there is any scene upon the battle-field more exciting
and more terrifying than the glimmer and glitter of a fixed bayonet in the
hands of a desperate and determined enemy, pointed directly at your
throat or your stomach, I have never seen it. Terrified at the gleam and
clatter of our bayonets Worthington's men broke and fled through the
woods rallying on their reserves, stationed some distance in rear of their
original position. It was well perhaps for them that they did, for
thoroughly drilled as we were in the bayonet exercise, they would
doubtless have found themselves at a great disadvantage in the use of
this weapon, had they stood to make the test. But with fixed bayonets,
accelerated by the Rebel yell, we followed at a double-quick, passing
over their dead and wounded halting just beyond. What a ghastly sight;
what a terrible scene! Here was pictured for the first time in our
experience the horrors of the battle-field in all of its hideousness. How
well the new Enfield rifles, with which we had been armed just before
leaving Burnsville for the battlefield two days before, following the
reading of General Johnston's famous battle order, were used upon this
occasion, the dead and severely wounded of more than three hundred of
the enemy grimly told. Colonel Trabue in his official report says more
than four hundred but I hardly think there were so many. There were
enough at least to attest the efficiency of our new Enfields and the
correctness of our aim. Many of these poor fellows begged us piteously
not to kill them as though we were a band of savages without pity or
compassion, knowing nothing of the usages and customs of civilized
warfare. It was an insult to our sense of honor and chivalry. But we
soon convinced them by every act of kindness possible under the
circumstances that we were both civilized and chivalrous,
notwithstanding the teachings of the Northern press to the contrary.
How false, absurd and ridiculous these charges by some of these
stayed-at-home sycophants
<pb id="young31" n="31"/>
of the Northern press accusing us with brutal and inhuman treatment of
their wounded that fell into our hands.</p>
        <p>But, just before the encounter of the Fourth Kentucky, which
occupied the extreme left of the Confederate battle line, with the
Forty-sixth Ohio, the roll of musketry and the roar of artillery came down the
battle line from right to left (a distance of more than three miles), like the
successive waves of the ocean as Grant hurled his battalions in echelon
against the extended lines of Johnston, opening fire in rapid succession
as they deployed and struck our lines, to which, the Confederates in like
successive manner instantly replied. Oh, I tell you this was sublimely
grand beyond the power of man to describe. As Grant's battalions were
successfully met and hurled back, that terrible and ominous sound, the
“Rebel yell” heard by us for the first time on the battle field told that the
day was surely and steadily becoming ours. The enemy made another
desperate and determined stand and from their advantageous position
occupied by their reserves on which their broken columns had rallied,
they poured a deadly and destructive fire into our ranks killing and
wounding many of our men. We had been pushed forward under the
enemy's fire and halted to await the movement of our reinforcements
moving in our rear and to our left, and while awaiting the execution of
this movement we learned quickly for the first time the importance of
lying flat on our faces as a means of protection from this deadly fire of
the enemy. This was trying indeed under orders not to fire; compelled to
remain passive and see your comrades being killed all around you,
momentarily expecting the same fate yourself. At last co-operating with
the flanking column on our left, with fixed bayonets we made a desperate
direct attack and drove the enemy from this very formidable position
which they had been holding for some time, not however until we had
lost in killed and wounded more than two score of our brave and gallant
boys. I am now speaking of the operations of my own regiment  -  matters were
<pb id="young32" n="32"/>
too absorbing to pay much attention to what others were doing.</p>
        <p>Again pushing forward we quickly encountered the enemy's
reinforcements, which they had thrown forward to resist our
advance and were again exposed to another scathing and deadly
fire. Again resorting to our former tactics of lying flat on our
faces, we returned their fire, turning upon our backs to reload our
rifles, then again upon our faces to deliver fire, here the battle
raged furiously, for some time and here again we lost a number
more of our gallant boys. I shall never forget the anguish of the
boy immediately to my left, as he expired from the effects of a
ball that passed through his body. In the meantime and while the
battle was raging at this point, Burns' and Cobb's Kentucky
batteries of fourteen pieces, which were stationed upon the
extreme right of the Kentucky Brigade, were hurling shot and
shell, grape and canister, with terrific and deadly force into the
enemy's moving columns, as they shifted from right to left of the
battle line. Grant seemed anxious to turn our left, but was
anticipated and promptly met by counter-movements of the
Confederates, he having a most worthy rival in the art and skill of
maneuvering troops upon the battlefield. Finally the terrible and
desperate assault of the Tennesseans away to our right, led by
the gallant Breckinridge and the peerless Johnston against the
enemy's center and his stronghold, known as the “Hornet's Nest,”
compelled Grant to yield every position he had taken and seek
shelter and protection under the banks of the Tennessee. This
was the sad and fatal moment, for here in this desperate charge
the great general fell.</p>
        <p>Co-operating with the troops on our left the Kentucky
Brigade hinged upon Burns' battery, the whole left wing of the
army swinging like a massive gate to the right, joined in this last
desperate charge and had the proud satisfaction of participating
in the capture and impounding of Prentiss' division of more than
three thousand men, including
<pb id="young33" n="33"/>
the celebrated Watterhouse battery of Chicago with its
magnificent equipment of new guns and fine horses. This
magnificent battery had been equipped by this great millionaire for
whom it was named, we wondered how he felt when he learned
the fate of his pets. I never in my entire experience as a soldier
saw such a humiliated and crestfallen body of soldiers as these
men were; prisoners driving their own magnificent battery
from the field. It looked really cruel to thus humiliate them. But
then you know it is said, that all's fair in love and war. To the first
of which saying I am compelled to demur for I know that all is not
fair in love, however, it may be in war. But in striking contrast
what, a jubilant and overjoyed set of fellows we Confederates
were, what a time for rejoicing!</p>
        <p>This was one of the proudest moments of my soldier life,
exciting and thrilling almost beyond description. Their artillery
being driven from the field by their own gunners; their infantry
formed in a hollow square stacking arms and lowering their
colors; their officers dismounting and turning over their
horses and side arms; Confederate officers and orderlies
galloping to and fro in every direction; excitement unbounded and
uncontrolled everywhere. Imagine these transcendent and rapidly
transpiring scenes and think for a moment if you can, how these
“boys” unused to such tragedies must have felt amid such
stupendous and overwhelming surroundings. Why we made the
very Heaven and earth tremble with our triumphant shouts. And I
doubt not, I know they did, for General Grant intimates they did,
the enemy routed and hurrying to the banks of the Tennessee for
protection, trembled also.</p>
        <p>Now the scene changes somewhat, reforming our lines and
filing to the right and left around this enclosed square in which
these prisoners were held, we again moved forward to the front
expecting to deliver the last and final blow. Four o'clock three-quarters
of an hour later, with more than two hours of sunshine in
which to deliver the last and final blow, found us drawn up in the
most magnificent
<pb id="young34" n="34"/>
line of battle I ever beheld, extending up and down the
river bottom to the right and left as far as we could see, straight
as an arrow; every man in place standing at “attention” exuberant
with joy, flushed with victory, all understanding the situation, eager
for the signal to be given that they knew would finish the glorious
day's work. Grant's army cowering beneath the banks of the
Tennessee awaiting the final summons to surrender. What a
moment of grand anticipation and oh, how quick the heart beat!
But at what fearful cost to the Confederate cause, the apparent
great victory! The voice of the great commander, now silent with
a successor unwilling to finish the day's work so gloriously begun
and so successfully executed up to the hour of his fall. And oh,
how important the hour to the new born nation! How portentous
the signs! Here and in this hour was sacrificed the opportunity of
the Southland's cause, here was thrown away, so to speak the
grandest opportunity ever offered to any general in modern times.
Here the “green-eyed monster,” jealousy, must have whispered
into the ear of Beauregard. Here I must draw the black curtain of
disappointment and despair to which I never can be reconciled.
But let it rest as lost opportunity and bury it in the oblivion of
forgetfulness. Paradoxically speaking here was lost the
opportunity of the “Lost Cause.” But what followed, many, yes all
of us know too well.</p>
        <p>It is strange what momentous events sometimes turn upon
seemingly trifling and insignificant circumstances. With the
prevailing tenseness of the moment, if one man had leaped to the
front of that battle line and shouted “forward,” Grant's army as a
consequence would have been overrun and captured. Grant
known no more in history; the “Stars and Bars” would have been
planted upon the banks of the Ohio; Kentucky redeemed and
history differently written. Had Johnston the great captain, lived,
<pb id="young35" n="35"/>
this would have been accomplished. But it seems that
Providence decreed it otherwise by removing the master
mind.</p>
        <p>From this magnificent battle line which I have attempted to
describe and this moment of proud hope and expectancy we were
by order of Beauregard, withdrawn to the camps of the enemy
from which we had driven them during the day  -  <hi rend="italics">not worn out and
exhausted</hi>  -  which Beauregard gave as his excuse for failing to
carry out the plans of the great commander to crush Grant
before Buell could come to his rescue.</p>
        <p>Passing the night in the camps of the enemy; recounting the
exciting incidents of the day; indulging in the rich and bountiful
supplies of a plethoric commissary, and no less rich and bountiful
supply of sutlers stores in great variety, just received from the
North, we enjoyed a “Balshazzar” feast not knowing, and little
thinking of the “handwriting on the wall” in the form of 30,000
reinforcements then crossing the Tennessee to be met and
reckoned with on the morrow.</p>
        <p>Why, oh why, did Beauregard not allow us to finish the day's
work so gloriously begun by Johnston? Every man must answer
this question for himself. Beauregard did not answer it
satisfactorily to the soldiers who were engaged, whatever the
opinion of the world. What, but the spirit of envy and jealousy and
an overweening ambition to divide the honors of victory with
Johnston, which he hoped and expected to win on the morrow
could have controlled his course? That and that alone, answers
the sad question in the mind of your humble friend and comrade. I
am aware that this will be considered presumption in me, but it is
history in part and as observer and participant, I have the right to
criticize.</p>
        <p>The morning of the fateful 7th came and with it the direful
results that followed. The arrival of Buell, the Blucher of the day,
turned the tide and sealed the fate of the cause  -  the golden
opportunity lost, lost forever! The history of that day is well
known to all students of the
<pb id="young36" n="36"/>
great war and to none better than the few survivors of that little
band of Kentuckians afterward known in history, as the Orphan
Brigade, and whose part in the grand tragedy was such an
important factor. It needs no studied eulogium or lofty peroration
to tell the story of the part played by this little band. A loss of
forty per cent in killed and wounded tells the story, and is the
panegyric offered by Kentucky on this memorable and bloody
field.</p>
        <p>I might speak more in detail of this last day's bloody work and
describe more at length many of the horrible sights witnessed and
the terrible suffering of our wounded in their transfer to Corinth
during the next three days over almost impassable roads  -  the most
horrible the mind could possibly picture, exposed to the almost
continuous downpour of rain and the awful, awful sadness that
filled our hearts in the loss of so many of our comrades, kinsmen
and school-fellow friends and the further deep humiliation of final
defeat, but the story would be too horrible and sad to elaborate.</p>
        <p>I have already taken too much of your time in relating a little
of personal romance in connection with something of history and
in conclusion will say I am here in part for what may be, though I
hope not, a last farewell handclasp with these dear “Old Boys,”
Morgan's men, the equals of whom as soldiers and citizens,
Kentucky and the world will never again see. I thank you for
your attention and the courtesy you have shown me.</p>
        <p>It seems altogether natural and opportune now that a large
part of the world is engaged in war that our minds should revert
to the past and the historic battle scenes in which we engaged
should be renewed in reminiscence.</p>

<lb/>
THE BOMBARDMENT OF VICKSBURG.</head>
        <p>Because of the similarity of scenes now transpiring on the
Western front in France I am tempted to describe a scene that
occurred and that I witnessed during the siege of Vicksburg in
July, 1862. My regiment (4th Ky.) had been detailed and sent on
detached service down to Warrenton, some miles below
Vicksburg, leaving in camp a number of sick that were unable to
go, among whom was Capt. Bramblett and myself. On the
morning of the 15th of July just at sunrise, suddenly,
unexpectedly, as if the infernal regions had suffered an eruption,
the earth rocked and trembled, the Heavens seemed pierced and
rent with the roar and thunder of cannon of all sizes, mortars
from gunboats, siege guns, land batteries and everything of a
terrifying and destructive character, that man was capable of
inventing appeared to be turned loose, an explanation of which no
one would venture to make.</p>
        <p>Directly however, news came that the Confederate ram
“Arkansas” had run the blockade of the upper fleet of federal
gunboats and transports, and was lying at the wharf in Vicksburg.
The news was magical on some of us sick fellows, and myself
and Sergeant Knox started immediately, without breakfast, to see
the wonder and learn the news of the exciting episode. Arriving
at the wharf we soon saw the cause of the terrible outburst of
excitement and terror.</p>
        <p>The Arkansas had been constructed at Yazoo City.
Whisperings of its existence and probable descent upon the
blockading fleet in the Mississippi had been heard for sometime,
and now we could see the monster (so to speak) in her grim and
battered condition with numerous holes in her smoke stack, made
by shots from the enemy's guns,
<pb id="young38" n="38"/>
and a large piece torn out of her cast prow. Her crew was composed of
the most daring despicable smoke-begrimed, looking set I ever beheld,
but who were elated at their successful victory. It was both interesting
and amusing to hear them discussing their recent experiences.</p>
        <p>That night the world went wild and pandemonium reigned supreme
in and around Vicksburg; for every gun and mortar in both the upper
and lower fleets turned loose every element of hell and terror they
possessed, with the seeming determination to destroy everything in and
around the devoted old city. The Confederate siege-guns with
“Whistling Dick” for leader joining in the grand Orchestral chorus of
ruin and chaos.</p>
        <p>The scene was the most spectacular and pyrotechnical event of
the war and has never been equaled unless it has occurred in the awful
experiences on the Western front or at the Dardanelles. It was sublimely
grand and tests the wildest imagination of the mind to describe it.</p>
        <p>The air was literally burdened, with ascending and descending
shells which were easily traced in their course upward and downward,
shells from the upper and lower fleets, crossing each other in their flight
Heavenward, before they reached their zenith, others in their downward
course and a few at the apex and still others, that failed to explode
reached the ground destroying everything with which they came in
contact. The flashes from these guns illumined the surroundings for
miles, and reminded you of a terrific thunderstorm with continuous
flashes of lightning. Every color of the rainbow could be seen in this
terrible and grand display. Balloon shaped clouds of smoke from
exploding shells could be seen, floating slowly, softly, through the air,
adding amazement and wonder to the grand aerial tragedy taking place in
the Heavens.</p>
        <p>In reading of the terrific bombardments in the great war now raging,
and comprehending these descriptions and pictures, I count myself no
stranger, and this scene I have attempted to describe I am sure will
compare favorably
<pb id="young39" n="39"/>
with anything in the great world-war of today. Not all the wonders and
terrors of war are yours, boys! Some of us older warriors have seen
something of war too. But it's all grand and glorious, isn't it boys?</p>

        <head>CHAPTER V.
<lb/>
MURFREESBORO (STONE RIVER).</head>
        <p>It is to the great and interesting battle of Murfreesboro and
some of the incidents and circumstances preceding it, that I shall
devote this article. History will some day accord it but one name,
whereas it now has two  -  Murfreesboro and Stone River  -  but I
shall use the former.</p>
        <p>Here a mile or so Southeast of the city, on a beautiful little
plain or suburban scope of country, was encamped for a period of
three months, the Orphan Brigade. The weather was beautiful
and we enjoyed both it and the many good things we had to eat
and the hospitable greetings of the good people of the town and
surrounding country. But while we were enjoying these good
things, we were undergoing a strict military training, being drilled
in the school of the company, battalion and the more
comprehensive and enlarged movements of the brigade and
division maneuvers, some of which we had seen employed at
Shiloh and elsewhere by exigencies in actual battle. It was a
matter of general pride in which as a member, I still glory that the
Orphan Brigade was the most thoroughly drilled and best
disciplined body of men in the Confederate army. In
substantiation of this claim, I refer to the compliment paid us a
little later on by General Hardee, in a trial drill with the First
Louisiana Brigade, held at Beech Grove in the Spring
following, and at which trial drill General Hardee was one of the
judges, and was heard to say that to excel our drilling would
require the construction of a different and better code than was
laid down in the system of tactics bearing his name. The truth
was we were determined to allow no body of troops to excel us in
anything pertaining to these accomplishments or history of the
soldier. This was accomplished in a great measure by the
<pb id="young41" n="41"/>
requirements and training of that military martinet, “Old” Roger
Hanson. I use the appellation with the most profound respect.
The facts as to these accomplishments can be attested by
numbers of men still living and who often refer to General
Hanson's rigid discipline and requirements with feelings of
respect and pride. I must instance one circumstance, in support of
this assertion.</p>
        <p>Some time after he took command he issued an order that all
officers and privates alike should be in full dress and in proper
places at roll call in the morning after the sounding of the reveille.
This did not suit many of the officers who wanted to take a
morning snooze, but “Roger's” orders were inexorable to officers
and soldiers alike and it was for a few mornings laughable to see
these officers hustling on their clothes and into line. There was
nothing that pertained to discipline and order that escaped his
notice. It was sometimes amusing to hear some fellow relate his
experience in attempting to outwit and fool him, and the fellow
that attempted it was always caught. It just could not be done.</p>
        <p>But the whirligig of time was rapidly turning and bringing with
it lively and exciting times; big with importance to the country and
the Confederate cause and especially and particularly to these
dear Orphans of mine.</p>
        <p>While in Mississippi and preceding his disastrous Kentucky
campaign and in which his malevolent nature was displayed,
Bragg refused us the great joy we so earnestly and hopefully
prayed for viz, the return to Kentucky with his army, where we
might see the dear ones at home, and incidentally aid the cause
by inducing enlistments.</p>
        <p>But the fact that quite a number of our fellow Kentuckians
were coming out with the newly enlisted cavalry commands and
bringing with them the news from home and friends  -  the first of
consequence for a year or more  -  gave us some comfort and
consolation. In the meantime some interesting matters of thrilling
moment were transpiring
<pb id="young42" n="42"/>
down here, “Where the oak, the ash and red elm tree, all grow
green in old Tennessee.”</p>
        <p>Rosecrans, not satisfied with results at Perryville, was cutting
across the country for another opportunity to test his military skill and
prowess, and to punish these unrepentant rebels for daring to offer
resistance to the “old flag” and trying to “break up the best Government
the world ever saw,” and over which Government some of these same
people are now fussing among themselves.</p>
        <p>Excuse me, please. I see I am again off my base. Back to my beloved
Orphans I must go. Oh, how I do love them!</p>
        <p>The change from the ordinary routine of drill maneuver and review
was brought about by the plan of General Morgan to attack the enemy's
advance post at Hartsville, North of the Cumberland and about thirty
miles or more from Murfreesboro. This movement included in its plan the
co-operation of the Orphan Brigade and making it a distinctly Kentucky
command, planned, led and fought by Kentuckians, and which was one
of the most complete and brilliant affairs of the war. Some of us to this
day feel the sting of disappointment of not being privileged to share in
this <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">“coupe de grace,”</foreign></hi> as the Fourth and Sixth Regiments were left at
Baird's mill to guard against the possibility of an intercepting column
from Nashville. My heart went out in sympathy (practically) to these
boys on their return to our encampment, worn out with fatigue,
exhausted and hungry and almost frozen, the weather being bitter cold
and the ground covered with snow to a depth of several inches. I
confess also to a feeling of sorrow for the poor blanketless prisoners
who passed a night of suffering, though we did the best we could for
them by furnishing them with fires.</p>
        <p>But here again the Orphans engaged in this fight paid dearly for
their honors, especially the Second Regiment, which lost heavily in both
officers and men, the Ninth Regiment also losing considerable. But this
seemed but the
<pb id="young43" n="43"/>
prelude to the grand Christmas entertainment staged to come off later
and when Breckinridge's Kentuckians received the soubriquet Orphan
Brigade by which they have ever since been known and which will pass
into the annals of history, alongside that of the “Tenth Legion,” the
“Old Guard” and “Light Brigade.”</p>
        <p>With a sense of feeling that impresses me with my utter inability to
at all do justice to the subject of Murfreesboro (or Stone River), I fear to
undertake the task.</p>
        <p>To the writer this was in some respects one of the most interesting,
exciting and captivating battles of the war in which he took part.
Captivating, because the great battle of the 31st was witnessed from my
vantage point of view  -  the left of our entrenchments on Swain's hill  -  
overlooking the stretch of country on which the battle was fought,
extending as it, did from the Nashville turnpike and railroad, which at
this point are parallel, and at which point also stood the famous
“Cowans' burnt house,” referred to by historians and which I saw burn,
the afternoon before. From this knoll I could see the principal part of the
field.</p>
        <p>Before attempting to describe the battle on this part of the field, I
must look up my Orphans and see what they are now, and have been
doing these last few hours. On the afternoon of Monday, the 29th they
took possession of this hill, which was the acknowledged key to Bragg's
position of defense. And herein lies a kind of mystery, why he would
trust to these men, in the judgment of whose officers he showed later on
he had so little confidence, this the most important point in his whole
line, and why should it be entrusted to them  -  the Kentucky Brigade.
Some were wicked enough to say, and his course toward us later, as that
of Friday, strengthens this belief that he wanted us all killed, hence
placing us in the most perilous position. Now mind you, gentle reader, I
am not giving this as my opinion, but others have given it as theirs.
While “bivouacking” a little behind this hill the enemy's skirmishers a
little after dark made quite a determined onset on our
<pb id="young44" n="44"/>
skirmishers in front of the hill, but were driven back finally with
considerable loss to both parties. It was a daring and courageous
move and created no little excitement and concern and looked for
a time like a night attack was pending. The 30th was spent in
getting ready by both parties to the battle.</p>
        <p>And early on the morrow we took our position on Swain's hill
in support of Cobb's and the Washington artillery. From my
vantage position I could see more plainly the Confederate lines
than the Federal, because the Confederates were on a direct line
extending Southward, while the Federals were obliquely to the
front and partially obscured by an intervening cedar glade and in
the afternoon the Confederates swung like a great gate on their
pivotal position, while just behind and to the left of this was the
enemy's strong point of resistance, to which he had finally been
driven. The smoke from the guns of the long lines of infantry, as
they moved forward to the attack and the counter stroke from the
enemy's resisting columns, the dashing to and fro, up and down
the lines and over the field by officers, orderlies, aides and
couriers, carrying orders and dispatches, with here and there a
battery belching forth shot and shell was a sight wonderful to
behold and never to be forgotten. The most thrilling incident to
that view was early in the day when a body of cavalry, supposed
to be “Dragoons,” swung into line from behind the cedar glade
with drawn sabers, gleaming and waving in the crisp chill sunlit
air, dashed down over the open fields in a grand charge upon the
Confederate infantry, whose movements a few moments before
convinced me of this approaching cavalry charge.</p>
        <p>We had been instructed by Buckner, Monroe and others on
the drill field in the formation of the “hollow square” to resist the
charge of cavalry and when I saw these regiments doubling
column at half distance I knew what was coming. To see the field
officers on horseback rushing within the squares as they closed
and the front rank kneeling,
<pb id="young45" n="45"/>
all with fixed bayonets glittering in the frosty sunlight, and
these oncoming charges with waving sabers and glittering helmets
was a sight unsurpassed by anything I witnessed during the war.
The nearest approaching it was by Sherman's charge at Resaca.
As soon as the squares were formed the artillery in the rear
opened fire through these intervening spaces made by the
formation of the square, whereupon artillery and infantry
combined swept the field and the charging column turned in
confusion and route, <sic corr="scurrying">skurrying</sic> helter skelter back over the field,
leaving numbers of men horseless.</p>
        <p>Soon the “Rebel yell” down the line told us that things were
going our way and looking we could see our friends moving
forward like a mighty serpent drawing his coils.</p>
        <p>While this was transpiring on the left a battery in our front on
the opposite side of the river was industriously employed in
shelling Cobb's and Slocum's batteries stationed on Swain's hill,
and whose business for the time it was the Orphans to support.
When I saw this cavalry charge, to which I have referred, the
thought instantly and involuntarily came to my mind of the
repeated attacks of Napoleon's cavalry on the squares of
Wellington's infantry at Waterloo. The sight was so thrilling that I
hoped they would repeat it. But how foolish, I thought this was, in
this body of cavalry attempting to ride down regiments of veteran
infantry. Their officers must surely have thought that they could
reach the Confederate line before they could complete this
formation. If so, they paid dearly for their mistake.</p>
        <p>The battle progressed steadily and satisfactorily to the
Confederates until about four o'clock, when they, in the language
of the “bum,” “run against a snag.” Woods' and Sheridan's
divisions, with other of Rosecrans' forces had concentrated upon
his extreme left, which was his strongest position for a final and
last stand. The conflict here
<pb id="young46" n="46"/>
was desperate and bloody, neither party seeming to have much
the advantage.</p>
        <p>The National cemetery now occupies this identical ground
and in which there are more than 6,000 Federal soldiers buried.
A beautiful and fit place for the remains of these brave Western
soldiers to rest, for here upon this field was displayed a courage
that all men must admire.</p>
        <p>Both armies slept that night upon the field with the greater
part of the field in possession of the Confederates and the
advantages and results of the day almost wholly in their favor.</p>
        <p>The Orphans spent the night in the rear of and among the
artillery they had been supporting. When morning came we found
that the enemy was still in our front instead of on the road to
Nashville as Bragg believed. Both parties seemed willing that a
truce should prevail for the day and scarcely a shot was heard.
Bragg believed that Rosecrans' army was “demolished” and
would surely retreat to his base (Nashville), and so informed
President Davis.</p>
        <p>But old “Rosy” had something else in his mind. He was
planning and scheming and matured a plan for a trap and Bragg
walked right into it with the innocence of a lamb and the
ignorance of a man that had never known anything of the art of
war, and the butchery of the next day followed as a result of his
obstinacy and the lack of military skill. Had he listened to the
protestations of General Breckinridge and his officers he might
have saved for the time being his military reputation and the lives
of several hundred brave and noble men.</p>
        <p>The recounting of the steps that led up to this ill-conceived
and fatal denouement and the efforts by General Breckinridge to
prevent its consummation, by one while not high in rank, but who
claims to know something of the facts in the case, may not go
amiss even at this late day.</p>
        <p>Early on the morning of January 2, Captain Bramblett,
commanding Company H, Fourth Kentucky, and who had served
with General Breckinridge in Mexico, received orders
<pb id="young47" n="47"/>
from him (Breckinridge), to make a thorough reconnaissance
of the enemy's position, Company H being at that time on the
skirmish line. Captain Bramblett with two of his lieutenants,
myself one of them, crawled through the weeds a distance of
several hundred yards to a prominent point of observation from
which through his field glass and even the naked eye we could
see the enemy's concentrated forces near and above the lower
ford on the opposite side of the river, his artillery being thrown
forward and nearest to the river. His artillery appeared to be
close together and covering quite a space of ground; we could not
tell how many guns, but there was quite a number. The infantry
was seemingly in large force and extended farther down toward
the ford. Captain Bramblett was a man of no mean order of
military genius and information, and after looking at, and studying
the situation in silence for some minutes, he said to us boys, “that
he believed Rosecrans was setting a trap for Bragg.” Continuing,
he said, “If he means to attack us on this side, why does he not
reinforce on this side? Why concentrate so much artillery on the
bluff yonder? He must be expecting us to attack that force
yonder, pointing to Beatty's position on the hill North of us,
and if we do, he will use that artillery on us as we move to the
attack.” At another time during the afternoon I heard him while
discussing the situation with other officers of the regiment use
substantially the same argument. I accompanied Captain
Bramblett to General Breckinridge's headquarters and heard him
make substantially in detail a report containing the facts above
recited. Captain Tom Steele was ordered (his company having
relieved ours) on the skirmish line to make a reconnaissance also,
and made a similar report, and lastly General Breckinridge, to
thoroughly and unmistakably understand the situation and satisfy
himself, in company with one or two of his staff examined the
situation as best he could and I presume reached the same
conclusion, and when he (Breckinridge) repaired to Bragg's
<pb id="young48" n="48"/>
headquarters and vouchsafed this information and suggested the
presumptive plan of the enemy, Bragg said: “Sir, my information
is different. I have given the order to attack the enemy in your
front and expect it to be obeyed.”</p>
        <p>What was General Breckinridge to do but attempt to carry out
his orders, though in carrying out this unwise and ill-conceived
order it should cost in one hour and ten minutes 1,700 of as brave
and chivalrous soldiers as the world ever saw. What a terrible
blunder, what a bloody and useless sacrifice! And all because
General Breckinridge had resented the imputation that the cause
of the failure of Bragg's Kentucky campaign was the “disloyalty
of her people to the Confederate cause.” Could anyone of the
thousands of Kentuckians that espoused the cause of the South,
complacently acquiesce in this erroneous charge and endorse the
spirit that prompted this order and led to the slaughter of so many
of her noble boys? This was the view that many of us took of
Bragg's course.</p>
        <p>How was this wicked and useless sacrifice brought about?
“That subordinate must always obey his superior”  -  is the military
law. In furtherance of Bragg's order we were assembled about
three o'clock on the afternoon of January 2, 1863 (Friday, a day
of ill luck) in a line North of and to the right of Swain's hill,
confronting Beatty's and Growes' brigades, with a battery or two
of artillery as support. They being intended for the bait that had
been thrown across the river at the lower ford, and now occupied
an eminence some three-quarters of a mile to the right-front of
the Orphan's position on Swain's hill.</p>
        <p>This was the force, small as it was that Bragg was so
anxious to dislodge. Between the attacking line and federal
position was a considerable scope of open ground, fields and
pastures, with here and there a clump of bushes or briars, but the
entire space was in full view of and covered by the enemy's
batteries to the left of the line on the opposite side of the river
previously referred to. If
<pb id="young49" n="49"/>
the reader will only carry these positions in his eye, he can readily
discover the jaws of the trap in this murderous scheme.</p>
        <p>A more imposing and thoroughly disciplined line of soldiers
never moved to the attack of an enemy than responded to the
signal gun stationed immediately in our rear, which was fired
exactly at four o'clock. Every man vieing with his fellowman, in
steadiness of step and correct alignment, with the officers giving
low and cautionary commands, many knowing that it was their
last hour on earth, but without hesitating moved forward to their
inevitable doom and defeat. We had gotten only fairly started,
when the great jaws of the trap on the bluff from the opposite side
of the river were sprung, and bursting shells that completely
drowned the voice of man were plunging and tearing through our
columns, ploughing up the earth at our feet in front and behind,
everywhere. But with steadiness of step we moved on. Two
companies of the Fourth regiment, my own and adjoining
company, encountered a pond, and with a dexterous movement
known to the skilled officer and soldier was cleared in a manner
that was perfectly charming, obliquing to the right and left into line
as soon as passed.</p>
        <p>By reason of the shorter line held by the enemy, our line,
which was much longer and the colors of each of our battalions
being directed against this shorter line, caused our lines to interlap,
making it necessary, in order to prevent confusion and crowding,
that some of the regiments halt, until the others had passed
forward out of the way. When thus halted they would lie down in
order to shield themselves from the enemy infantry fire in front,
who had by this time opened a lively fusillade from behind their
temporary works.</p>
        <p>While lying on the ground momentarily a very shocking and
disastrous occurrence took place in Company E, immediately on
my left and within a few feet of where I lay<sic corr=".">,</sic> A shell exploded
right in the middle of the company,
<pb id="young50" n="50"/>
almost literally tearing it to pieces. When I recovered from the
shock the sight I witnessed was appalling. Some eighteen or
twenty men hurled in every direction, including my dear friend,
Lieut. George Burnley of Frankfort. But these circumstances
were occurring every minute now while the battle was raging all
around and about us. Men moved intuitively  -  the voice being
silenced by the whizzing and bursting shells. On we moved,
Beatty's and Growes' lines giving way seemingly to allow the
jaws of the trap to press with more and ever increasing vigor
upon its unfortunate and discomfited victims. But, on we moved,
until the survivors of the decoy had passed the river and over the
lines stationed on the other side of the river, when their new line
of infantry opened on our confused and disordered columns
another destructive and ruinous fire.</p>
        <p>Coupled with this condition and correlative to it, a battery of
Growes and a part of their infantry had been cut off from the ford
and seeing our confused condition, rallied, reformed and opened
fire on our advanced right now along the river bank. Confronted
in front by their infantry, with the river intervening; swept by their
artillery from the left and now attacked by both infantry and
artillery by an oblique fire from the right, we found ourselves in a
helpless condition, from which it looked like an impossibility to
escape; and but for the fact that two or three batteries had been
ordered into position to check the threatened advance of the
enemy and thereby distract their attention, we doubtless would
have fared still worse.</p>
        <p>We rallied some distance to the right of where we started and
found that many, very many, of our noblest, truest and best had
fallen. Some of them were left on the field, among whom was my
military preceptor, advisor and dear friend, Captain Bramblett,
who fell into the hands of the enemy and who died a few days
after in Nashville. I shall never forget our parting, a moment or
two before, he received his wound  -  never forget the last quick
glance
<pb id="young51" n="51"/>
and the circumstances that called it forth. He was a splendid
soldier and his loss grieved me very much. Many another gallant
Kentuckian, some of our finest line and field officers, were left on
the field, a sacrifice to stupidity and revenge. Thirty-seven per cent
in one hour and ten minutes  -  some say one hour  -  was the
frightful summary. Among the first of these was the gallant and
illustrious Hanson, whose coolness and bearing was unsurpassed
and whose loss was irreparable. He with Breckinridge,
understood and was fully sensible of  -  as indicated by the very
seriousness of his countenance  -  the unwisdom of this move and
as shown in their protest to Bragg. What a pity that a strict
observance of military rule compelled it to be obeyed against his
mature military mind and judgment, causing the loss of such a
magnificent soldier and gentleman  -  uselessly and foolishly.</p>
        <p><sic corr="Contemplating">Comtemplating</sic> this awful sacrifice, as he rode by the dead
and dying in the rear of our lines, General Breckinridge, with tears
falling from his eyes, was heard to say in tones of anguish, “My
poor Orphans! My poor Orphans!” little thinking that he was
dedicating to them a name that will live throughout the annals of
time and crown the history of that dear little band with everlasting
immortality.</p>
        <p>I have tried to give you above a description from memory's
tablet  -  of the battle of Murfreesboro, and I shall now relate some
of my observations made on my recent visit together with further
references, to the events that transpired on that eventful field  -  the
study of which is of almost overwhelming interest.</p>
        <div2 type="subchapter">
          <head>A VISIT TO MURFREESBORO IN 1912.</head>
          <p>Here, as elsewhere and on other fields, the view is especially
and particularly interesting, because of the country being more
level and more open with the view much less obstructed. It was
worth a half dozen years to live over,
<pb id="young52" n="52"/>
in reminiscence, this week of intense excitement, interest and danger.
And here too, as at Chickamauga, memory refused to be satisfied, and I
find myself wishing I could see it again. I feel that I could never tire
looking at the different aspects of the view and studying the tragic
scenes as they transpired on this eventful closing of this eventful year
of 1862, and the no less eventful opening of the year 1863. To those who
lived in this historic decade and participated in these events of bygone
years are of intense and ever thrilling interest, but few realize that these
things happened a half century ago.</p>
          <p>Here as elsewhere events came back to me and I had but little or no
difficulty in locating the leading and many of the minor places of
interest.</p>
          <p>The immediate vicinity of our long encampment is changed
considerably by houses being erected nearby and on the ground where
our camps stood, but the big spring house, however, still does duty as
of yore. The place on the Shelbyville turnpike where we held guard
mount and review is much changed. So also are the grounds on the East
side of the city where we held brigade and division drill, it now being
“built up.” But one of the leading landmarks of the town and of special
interest to the Orphans and other Kentuckians is still intact and but little
changed in appearance but now used for a different purpose. I refer to
the Judge Ready residence where General Morgan captured his grand
prize. There is not an old Orphan now living, that does not remember
how he used to primp for the march by this house, and how proudly he
stepped and with what perfect mien he marched to Billy McQuown's best
pieces, all to, have the privilege of “showing off,” and having the
opportunity for a sly glance at the beautiful Queen sisters standing on
the upper veranda. You know, old boys, just how this was, don't you?</p>
          <p>But my mind is taking me back to the battlefield where the things of
real excitement were transpiring, where “the
<pb id="young53" n="53"/>
pride, pomp and circumstances of glorious war are to be found.”</p>
          <p>Starting out in company with Rev. Everett Smith, we took the
Nashville pike crossing the river at the same place we crossed when on
the retreat from Bowling Green to Shiloh in February, 1862, and where I
had crossed several times while encamped later, near the town and over
and beyond which I saw the celebrated cavalry charge and the
victorious columns of the Confederates move on December 31. My mind
was so completely occupied and crowded that I scarcely knew what to
do or say. I know I must have been a study, to my young friend for a
time at least.</p>
          <p>I could see again in imagination the smoke and red fire and could
hear the crackling flames as they leaped high in air of the famous
“Cowan” house as we rode by. I imagined as we rode on that I could
hear the yells and shouts of the contending lines as they surged
forward and across the turnpike to the famous cut in the railroad, where
Wood and Sheridan saved the day to the Federals against the last
grand charge of Cleburne, Preston and Pillow of the Confederates.</p>
          <p>As before stated here is a fitting place for the six thousand Federals
who rest here. Here at the cemetery, I was introduced to Captain
Thomas, the officer in charge, who was exceedingly polite and courteous
and whom I found by conversing with, that I had faced at Shiloh and
who had the most perfect recollection of many of the chief points and
incidents of that battle. I regretted very much that I could not spend
more time with him, as he impressed me as being a man after my own
heart. But my young friend and myself had promised to be back at the
dinner hour and I was therefore, compelled to close my interview.</p>
          <p>I spent the afternoon in glancing over town and meeting and
conversing with old soldiers and others whom I found interested in my
mission, and willing and anxious to give me any information I desired.</p>
          <p>I met and arranged with Captain Mitchell, who now
owns a part of the field over which the celebrated charge
<pb id="young54" n="54"/>
of Breckinridge was made, to go out with me next morning and in
company with him and a young friend, W. H. Hohgatt, of
Pittsburgh, Pa. We started early, going over the same road,
crossing the same bridge, as the day before to a point near the
cemetery where the road to McFadden's ford leaves the turnpike
and runs North by the bluff, the famous bluff where Rosecrans'
fifty-eight pieces of artillery were stationed that wrought such
dreadful havoc upon Breckinridge's men as they moved across
the fields to attack Beatty and Growes (the decoy) on the other
side of the river, here we crossed the river at the lower ford, so
famous in history but which is properly known as McFadden's.
Here we “tied up” and in company with my companions we took
to the fields and woods, which latter exist now in fancy only. Up
the gradual slope we go to the crest of the ridge (now a cotton
patch) to where Beatty and Growe were stationed, swinging
around as we go to the point overlooking the river on which stood
the massive oaks where the Sixth Kentucky, led by that incarnate
demon of war, “Old Joe” Lewis, with flashing sword and
blazing eyes, more terrible than the eyes of a raging lion and who
impressed me as I was never impressed before or since, with the
devil in human form. He presented a picture at that time I shall
never forget. It is. as grimly and immovably fixed in my mind as
the sun and the stars and I become enthusiastic whenever I think
of him and the incident. Now we move along the crest Northward
to the point where the Fourth Kentucky struck Beatty's line.
Looking East and South towards the Lebanon pike, we can see
the vicinity where we started in the charge about midway
between the crest and the pike. Turning around we can look
down the North slope of the ridge and over which we pressed
Beatty and the right of Growes' brigade to McFadden's ford,
dropping into, as we move down the narrow sag or depression
that leads from the top of the hill straight to the ford and which
furnished the only protection from the murderous fire of the
fifty-eight guns
<pb id="young55" n="55"/>
massed on the bluff. Out of this depression, going or coming, we
were exposed to this dreadful and incessant fire. Opposite to and
some forty yards from this ford is the picket fence where we
were compelled to halt and which is so well remembered by
many of the Orphans.</p>
          <p>The Federals passed around the end of this fence, they being
acquainted with the situation, but we struck it square and were
compelled to halt. Just outside and along this picketing were piled
the enemy's drums and upon which the minnie balls from their
new and supporting line on the opposite side of the river were
beating a funeral dirge for many of our dear boys who were here
compelled to halt and die to no purpose whatever. I walked along
this picket fence, which looks just as it did then, but of course has
been rebuilt, and over the very ground on which my dear Captain
Bramblett fell and with whom I exchanged glances a moment
before. To give expression to my feelings as I contemplated this
last glance, this look in life at my dear friend and leader is
impossible and I turn away with sickened heart from the fatal
spot and retrace my steps over the field to the rallying point,
every step of the way marked by exploding shells and flying shot
from the enemy's battery of fifty-eight guns which seemed
determined to show no mercy at all.</p>
          <p>Lest some one may say I am magnifying this story of
the “battery on the bluff” I will quote here verbatim from
the tablet on the twenty-foot granite monument which
marks the place occupied by these guns to mark the place
from which the death-dealing shot and shell were hurled that
resulted in the death of so many of Kentucky's noble and brave
boys.</p>
          <p>I understand this monument was erected by the president of
one of the great railway systems, the N. C.&amp; St. L., who had
participated in the famous charge. It is the most interesting and
historic point of all the very interesting points of this eventful
field. It was with awe and overpowering wonder and feeling that
I indulged the scenes
<pb id="young56" n="56"/>
of fifty years ago, enacted on this spot. Here the very earth
trembled beneath the thunderings of these fifty-eight cannon,
sending death and destruction into the ranks of us poor
unfortunate Confederates.</p>
          <p>The tablet upon this monument reads as follows:</p>
          <p>“On January 2, 1863, at three p. m., there were stationed on
this hill, fifty-eight cannon commanding the field across the river
and as the Confederates advanced over this field the shot and
shell from these guns resulted in a loss of 1,800 killed and
wounded in less than one hour.”</p>
          <p>What a harvest of death in so short a time was wrought by
shot and shell! The most of whose victims were mutilated and
lacerated beyond recognition or description. Had the earth been
torn by an earthquake the scene would not have been more
terrible and hideously appalling.</p>
          <p>On a board marker, near by, in faded letters is this indefinite
inscription:</p>
          <p>“Col. S. Mat-, Third Division 14th A. C. Fed-, Col. S. W.
Price commanding. Holding Lower Ford, Dec. 31, 1862.”</p>
          <p>This evidently refers to the battery that played upon Cobb
and Slocum on Swain's Hill.</p>
          <p>It would seem from these last words of this poster that the
Federals were afraid on the first day's fight that the Confederates
would attempt to turn their left by crossing at this ford, hence the
placing of this battery here. Bragg, it seems, had no such thought,
and, however, it was stationed in our immediate front, West from
Swain's Hill and as the battle progressed on the plain South of the
railroad and turnpike it played upon Cobb and Slocum with
increasing vigor and spirit. As before stated, the Orphans were
stationed at this time in support to these batteries, and it was from
this point that I witnessed the thrilling sights on the West side of
the river.</p>
          <p>In company with my new-made genial and accommodating
friend, W. G. Beatty, whose father owned the land on which the
battle of the 2nd was fought, I visited
<pb id="young57" n="57"/>
Swain's Hill, which is evidently a mistaken name for the place,
no one with whom I conversed, old or young, knew it by that
name. I found on the hill, which I very readily recognized from
the distance, the old entrenchments intact, save from the leveling
effects of time, and on which an occasional locust sapling is
growing with quite a thicket of the same in the immediate front.
But from the left of this line of works and where I was stationed
on the 31st the view overlooking the railroad, turnpike and plain is
perfectly clear. From here I looked, studied and wondered. Why
should I not linger and contemplate? Never until the great day of
judgment do I ever expect to witness such a thrilling and
awe-inspiring scene as I here witnessed on that eventful day of
December 31, 1862.</p>
          <p>Beatty contemplated me with interest, if not astonishment. So
intensely interesting were these scenes and recollections I was
almost tempted to spend another day contemplating and
reviewing them. But we returned to the city at night to attend a
church affair at the instance and invitation of my young friend
from Bourbon, Rev. Everett Smith, whose guest I had been while
here.</p>
          <p>I tried hard to forget and partially succeeded in forgetting the
thoughts and reminiscences the day had suggested  -  in the
presence of so many charming ladies and gallant gentlemen of
Brother Smith's congregation and the additional enjoyment of the
ice cream, cakes and strawberries, my appetite of fifty years ago
suddenly returning to remind me of the difference twixt now and
then.</p>
          <p>Next morning my friend Beatty was on hand early with his
automobile and speeded me over the city which I am frank to say
is one of the most beautiful little cities I ever saw. I was charmed
by the old time warmth and hospitality of its people and the
greeting given me and I shall remember them as among the
happiest of my life. And if I were young once more, I would be
almost tempted to cast
<pb id="young58" n="58"/>
my lot with these good people in this good country, both of which
are the next best to Kentucky.</p>
          <p>I must not forget to remind the old Orphans and others who
may read this paper that after considerable inquiry I was able to
find the old Haynes home, in which General Hanson died, and
which is now occupied by Hon. Jesse C. Beasley, the present
Democratic nominee for Congress in this district. I was shown
through the house by his good little wife who although taken
somewhat by surprise at my sudden and unexpected visit, but
who courteously invited me to examine and inspect until fully
satisfied. I stood in the room in which he died almost dumfounded
with emotion. Here, in the presence of his heart-broken wife, and
sorrowing friends his life gradually ebbed away and took its flight
to the realms above.</p>
          <p>I was reminded to tread lightly and speak softly on this
solemn occasion, for here, passed away into the Great Beyond
one of Kentucky's grandest and greatest noblemen.</p>
          <p>I attended that afternoon, in company with Captain Baird,
Beatty and others, the anniversary decoration of the Confederate
graves and listened to a fine oration and the delightful rendering
of several appropriate songs by the Murfreesboro quartette.
When they sang “My Old Kentucky Home,” I hugged tightly, the
tree against which I leaned and fear I betrayed a weakness for
which I am not altogether ashamed, for what Kentuckian that
lives, especially when away from home, whose soul is not moved,
when he hears the sweet strains of this touching and soul inspiring
song. How can he, when thus reminded of his old Kentucky

LOOKOUT MOUNTAIN.
<lb/>
BATTLE OF CHICKAMAUGA  -  1863.</head>
        <p>I am now attempting to write from this Lookout Mountain,
one of the most picturesque as well as interesting places on the
American continent. Near by and round about here some of the
greatest episodes in the world's history transpired near the close
of that eventful year, 1863.</p>
        <p>Chickamauga, Lookout Mountain, Missionary Ridge, where
the lives of sixty-five thousand Americans were either destroyed
or more or less wrecked.</p>
        <p>A feeling of philosophy and awe prompts me to ask why all
this great sacrifice of human life, misery and suffering?</p>
        <p>Was the Great God that made man now looking on this awful
scene of carnage and woe again repenting that He had made
wicked, rebellious and murderous man; or was it a part of His
omnipotent plan for man's inherent folly and wickedness driving
him to destroy his fellowman?</p>
        <p>Whatever it was it seems to have been accomplished here
amid these towering mountains.</p>
        <p>But so it was and I, one insignificant actor in the grand
drama, am still permitted to live and recount some of the thrilling
scenes as they were enacted. It is beyond my power to describe
minutely and correctly all the thrilling sights that I witnessed on
this eventful occasion (Battle of Chickamauga) and I shall refer
to those only that concern myself and my Kentucky comrades,
unless incidentally it shall appear necessary to my story.</p>
        <p>I will, therefore, not attempt to note the maneuvering, the
marching and counter-marching, back and forth, up
<pb id="young61" n="61"/>
and down the Chickamauga Valley, in and about Rossville and
Crawfish Springs and their vicinity; all of which, at that time,
seemed to me was but the waving of the red flag in the face of
Rosecrans in <hi rend="italics">“I dare you to come out”</hi> spirit on the part of
Bragg.</p>
        <p>Whatever motives, schemes and strategy it contained we all
knew, rank and file, field and staff, that we were on the eve of
momentous events. We all knew that here the question of “Greek
meeting Greek” would soon again be tested and two of the
mightiest armies of modern times would be locked in mortal
combat. We had not long to wait for on the morning of the
nineteenth (September, 1863) an occasional boom, boom, away
to the right and front told us of the coming storm that was about
to break over and sweep Chickamauga Valley with a mighty
avalanche of thunder and horror that shook the very earth itself.
Slowly but steadily the roar of artillery increased and by the
middle of the afternoon became almost incessant.</p>
        <p>Longstreet's Virginians had come out to show the Western
army how to fight and they were now learning that Rosecrans'
Western veterans could give instructions in the art of war as well
as they and that they were not facing the aliens and wage
soldiers that constituted a large part of the Army of the
Potomac. They also found, as the battle progressed, that the
Western army of the South knew as well and were as willing to
“stand up Johnnie” and give and take blow for blow as they. The
evening wore on and occasional reports from the front brought
news that the Confederates were holding their own and a little
better.</p>
        <p>Meantime the “Orphans” were on the move toward the front
and facing the enemy's moving column on the Chattanooga road,
which led to Rossville and near Glass' Mill, at which place the
artillery of Breckinridge's division, commanded by the gallant
Major Graves, engaged the enemies in one of the fiercest
artillery duels it was my
<pb id="young62" n="62"/>
pleasure to witness during the war. I say pleasure advisedly, for it
was a magnificent sight to see from where I was stationed
Graves moving among his men and directing their every action,
which was done with an admirable celerity and precision that
was perfectly charming. I must here do Graves the honor to say
that he was the most perfect military man I ever saw. But this
was but the prelude to the play of the morrow; both parties
seeming (after a half hour's engagement) to say we will settle
tomorrow. “Sunday is a better day.”</p>
        <p>Shifting our position to Lee and Gordon's Mill, further down
the Chickamauga, in the afternoon, we here awaited
developments and that night made a long detour and crossed at
Alexander's Bridge, several miles down the river. Next morning
we found ourselves on the extreme right of the dividing line of the
stage of action marked out by the respective commanders for the
grand tragedy that day to be enacted upon the stage of war.
Early, very early the Fourth Kentucky Skirmishers (and I here
glory in the fact) had the honor of firing the first shots in the
opening that day of the greatest battle ever fought on the
American continent, if not the greatest in modern times. This
assertion may be called In question by critics, but if I mistake not
there were more men killed and wounded at Chickamauga than in
any other engagement of the war.</p>
        <p>Here the old and somewhat sacrilegious saying of “Hell broke
loose in Georgia” was fully and forcefully emphasized by the
almost continuous thundering of 200 cannons that made the very
earth tremble, besides the constant rattle of musketry and the
shouts of more than a hundred thousand struggling combatants
determined on each other's destruction. Americans all, and all for
what? That a God-made inferior race might occupy the same
plane with the superior was the object of one, while that right was
disputed by the other. But I fear I may be digressing somewhat
from the original purpose in these chapters. Still these thoughts
are hard to suppress. Reviewing
<pb id="young63" n="63"/>
the incidents of the great battle and the part played by
Kentucky Confederates I return to the skirmish line of the Fourth
Kentucky, which covered the front of the Orphan Brigade and
which was commanded by Col. Joe Nuckols, who was wounded
at the very outset of the engagement and compelled to leave the
field.</p>
        <p>The writer was the subject at this particular time and place of
the most ridiculous and practical joke of his entire war
experience, but which (thanks to the Bill of Rights) he is not here
compelled to relate. This was the beginning of that chapter in the
history of the Orphan Brigade, which took the lives and blood of
so many noble Kentuckians to write. In the first and desperate
onset, led by the noble and intrepid Helm, whose name is a
household word with almost all Kentuckians, fell here, together
with Graves, Hewitt, Dedman, Daniel, Maderia and other officers
of the line, and many splendid men of the Second and Ninth
Regiments, who paid with their lives tribute to Mars and added to
Kentucky's old traditional glory and renown.</p>
        <p>Three regiments on the right, Fourth, Sixth and Forty-First
Alabama, swept everything before them  -  the enemy being in the
open field. But the Second and Ninth encountered the enemies'
breastworks and were repulsed with terrible slaughter. Here was
where the officers just mentioned fell in one of the most
desperate struggles of the day. Here “Pap Thomas' ” veterans
took advantage of their works and exacted deep and merciless
toll. More than once during the day was this position assailed by
other bodies of Confederates with similar results. About the
middle of the afternoon the assembling of Cheatham's and
Walker's division in conjunction with Breckinridge warned us that
the fatal moment had arrived and the hour of desperation was at
hand.</p>
        <p>The old veteran needs no one to tell him when a crisis is
approaching, he instinctively and otherwise comprehends the
meaning of these movements and nerves himself
<pb id="young64" n="64"/>
for the desperate work before him. His countenance would
convince the stoic of what his mind contained, in modern
parlance he “understands the game.” When the signal gun was
fired we knew its meaning, so also did the enemy. Then three
lines in solid phalanx, desperate and determined men, moved
forward on the Federal stronghold to be met by a withering and
blighting fire from the enemy behind their works. But so furious
and desperate was the onslaught that Thomas' veterans, who had
withstood all previous attempts to dislodge them, could no longer
face the line of gleaming bayonets of the Confederates as they
leaped over the breastworks the Federals had so successfully
defended up to that hour.</p>
        <p>Some surrendered, others made their escape and still others
met their doom  -  many, not hearing the shouts of the victorious
Confederates as they rushed over and among them.</p>
        <p>This was the culmination of the struggle. Similar movements
with similar results were taking place simultaneously all along the
line, closing the most stupendous struggle of the war. But at this
particular point and at Snodgrass Hill, where the Fifth Kentucky
contributed additional and unsurpassed glory to Kentucky's part in
the great battle, were the keys to Rosecrans' position, and here
the fighting was the hardest and the losses heaviest.</p>
        <p>In the first charge in the morning where the right of the
brigade was so successful, we captured a section of the enemy's
artillery. The writer seized the trunnion of one of the guns and
with assistance turned it on them while the other was turned by
others of our men; but we could find no ammunition to fire them
and were deprived of the anticipated glory of firing on the enemy
as they fled from the field. I wish here, and in my feeble way, to
lift my hat to do honor to the gallantry of the captain commanding
that battery (who I learned was from Indiana) as doing the most
daring and chivalrous act I ever saw performed
<pb id="young65" n="65"/>
by an enemy during my entire war experience. Both his
lieutenants and a number of his men having been killed before he
abandoned his guns, which were in a battery just on the West
side of the Chickamauga road and in the face of us
Confederates, who had reached the East side of the road, he
dashed into the road and past us, lifting his hat and waving us a
salute that would have put to shame a Chesterfield or a Prince
Rupert. The act was almost paralyzing and not a man of the fifty
or more who fired at him point blank touched him or his horse. If
there is such a thing as a charmed life, this captain must have
possessed it on that occasion. If living I would gladly travel miles
to shake his hand.</p>
        <p>Our next move was to unite our separated line which we did
by retiring later on to the point from where we started.</p>
        <p>During the occasional lulls in the musketry firing the artillery
from left to right and especially on the left about Snodgrass Hill,
was thundering defiance and sending death into each other's
ranks that seemingly made old earth shake from center to
circumference, set the birds to flight, caused reptiles, <sic corr="lizards">lizzards</sic> and
all manner of wild animals to flee from the wrath of murderous
man, among which was a cotton-tail deer that was seen by some
of the men running in a bewildered and dazed manner in the rear
of the contending lines, not knowing which way to flee or what it
all meant.</p>
        <p>The enemy routed, the conflict ceased  -  about dark  -  with the
Orphans (those left) on the West side of the Chickamauga road,
some of the men playfully astride the enemy's guns  -  several in
number  -  that had been abandoned at this point, others prostrate
on the ground resting and recounting incidents of the day, ALL
glad enough that it was over.</p>
        <p>Here General Buckner rode up, he having come over from
the left where his artillery and division of infantry had done such
splendid work and who was greeted with a cheer
<pb id="young66" n="66"/>
from the surviving Orphans that must have done his soul good
and which he acknowledged with a smile, lifting his hat gracefully
in acknowledgment of the greeting.</p>
        <p>What next! We all expected that we would follow
immediately without an hour's delay on the heels of the retreating
and discomfited Federals and overtake and completely <sic corr="rout">route</sic> and
possibly capture them before they could get settled behind their
fortifications around Chattanooga. But here the fatal mistake of
Beauregard at Shiloh (and for which Bragg censured him) was
duplicated by Bragg himself.</p>
        <p>Back to the field among the boys where we spent the night
among the dead and wounded; and awaiting orders from Bragg,
who was spending his time in sending congratulations to
President Davis while Rosecrans was busy preparing to receive
and entertain him from his fortifications around Chattanooga.</p>
        <p>The writer having learned that we would likely spend the day
on the field resting  -  <hi rend="italics">“resting”</hi> (I toss my head in derision of the
thought), obtained permission to visit and inspect the field of
battle, and in company with one or two comrades started early
next morning from the extreme right, where we opened the battle,
and traversed the entire length of the field, a distance of seven
miles or more. This was the first time such an enviable opportunity
had ever presented itself and I seized it gladly, notwithstanding the
many horrible and ghastly sights I knew I would see. On every
hand, in every direction, were evidences of the desperate conflict
of the preceding day. The forest trees splintered and torn by the
plunging shot and shell from the cannon's deadly throat,
dismantled <sic corr="caissons">caissions</sic> and artillery wheels, dead horses, guns,
cartridge boxes, bayonets and almost every kind of war
paraphernalia imaginable were strewn promiscuously over the
field. Trees and saplings, not larger than a man's body to a height
of six or eight feet, contained from a dozen to as high as sixty rifle
balls. But worst of all with upturned faces and glaring
<pb id="young67" n="67"/>
eyes, torn and mangled bodies of not less than four thousand dead
men on the field and at the hospitals. At the latter, especially at
the Snodgrass place, there were acres covered with wounded
and many dead. Here I witnessed the most appalling sight my
eyes ever beheld, a description from which I shudder and shrink
at this distant day, and which is too terrible for delicate and
sensitive natures to ponder; and which involuntarily reminds me
of Sherman's saying again. The citizens of today will doubtless
wonder how any man could escape such a rain of shot and shell,
but by the old soldier it is readily understood. While ninety per cent
of these shots were being fired the men were lying flat on
their faces and were overshooting each other when suddenly one
or the other would spring to his feet and with a bound and a yell
rush at a double-quick upon their foe, giving him time to fire one
or at most two rounds when his ranks would be broken and
compelled to retire.</p>
        <p>After seeing these appalling sights I retraced my steps and
reached the starting point about twilight to find that my command
had been ordered forward toward Chattanooga and the vicinity of
Missionary Ridge, which we reached next day to find Rosecrans
occupying his fortifications and redoubts ready to receive and
entertain us. We were formed in line of battle at or near the foot
of Missionary Ridge and expected when the formation was
completed to be hurled against the forts and redoubts to
certain and inevitable destruction.</p>
        <p>Many expressions of evil and forebodings of disaster
were indulged in and anathemas were hurled at the commander
without stint for holding us back for this, the hour of our doom.
Many farewells were being exchanged, mingled with jeers and
sarcasm, all knowing and understanding fully the gravity of the
situation. It was an hour of intense, of dreadful suspense, which
could only be felt and not described.</p>
        <p>But thanks to an allwise and merciful Providence which at
the last moment withheld the hand and changed
<pb id="young68" n="68"/>
the mind that commanded. But for this change of mind he who
writes this story would doubtless now be “sleeping the sleep that
knows no waking on fame's eternal camping ground.” When we
were ordered to retire to Missionary Ridge many were the
longdrawn sighs of relief that we had escaped from this
threatened and, as we felt, certain doom.</p>

          <head>THE WRITER'S VISIT TO CHICKAMAUGA  -  
IN MAY, 1912.</head>
          <p>I have visited scenes of the great conflict twice, traversed
the very ground from the point where we formed line of battle
and moved to the charge against “Pap” Thomas' veterans and am
still unsatisfied. Not that the points of greatest interest have been
lost to memory, but because memory will not be satisfied. I can
see in my mind the anxious look in the faces of those brave
Kentucky boys, as they stepped into line and touched elbows in
obedience to the commands “dress to the right; dress to the left;
steady, steady, men; quick step, forward, march!”</p>
          <p>Tell me I shall ever forget these commands or this hour!
Never, while “memory lasts and reason holds sway.”</p>
          <p>From this very starting point I traced the ground over which
we moved (in 1863) taking the monument erected to the memory
of General Helm as a guide and allowing for the space of the two
regiments to occupy the right, coursing Westward, the exact
direction we moved, crossing the LaFayette road at or near the
very point where the two pieces of artillery were captured and
previously referred to. The tablet here tells me who my gallant
captain of Indiana (Bridges) was and recites the facts of the
capture correctly. There, too, is the open field through which the
broken regiments of infantry were fleeing that
<pb id="young69" n="69"/>
I was so anxious to assist with shots from their own battery.</p>
          <p>Here I must criticise a little at the risk of censure. I will do so
by quoting from memory, not literally, from Gen. Breckinridge's
official report saying, “That a strong supporting line at this
moment, thrown on Thomas' flank and rear, would have resulted
in dislodging and overthrowing Thomas early in the day.” This
was plain to line and field officer alike. The opportunity was
presented but not availed of; why, I know not.</p>
          <p>The tablets here with their historic record briefly stamped in
metal are substantially correct. My version of the battle
previously stated to the guides while going out (I. P. Thoeford, an
old Confederate) and S. P. Black were so nearly identical that
these men threw up their hands in amazement when I read from
the tablet. It was no trouble to convince them that I had been
there and knew something about the battle and the positions of
the troops on that part of the line. Here stands nearby the Glenn
House, some old log houses. Not far away is the Kentucky
monument, a fitting memorial to Kentuckians of both sides
crowned with the Goddess of Love and Peace. Northeast is the
monument to that gallant, lovable character, Ben Hardin Helm  -  
my hand trembles as I write his name, for I really believe he
was one of the kindest-hearted and best men I ever knew. Near
this spot was where so many of the Second and Ninth fell, some
of whose names are already mentioned in this chapter on
Chickamauga. I could write much, very much, more of this very
interesting and historic field, but will not trespass further on your
time and space.</p>

MISSIONARY RIDGE.</head>
        <argument>
          <p>KENTUCKY CONFEDERATE VISITS SCENES OF
BATTLE AND SIEGE DURING CIVIL WAR.</p>
        </argument>
        <p>From here (Missionary Ridge) about the last of September
the Orphans were sent to Tyner Station as a base from which to
guard the commissary stores at Chickamauga Station, that place
being the depot of supplies for the army investing Chattanooga.</p>
        <p>But when it was seen that Grant, who had arrived and
assumed command of the Federal Army, was planning to move
on our lines on Lookout and Missionary Ridge, we were ordered
back to our original position on the Ridge, not far from Bragg's
headquarters. From this point we could see on the night of the
24th of November the flashes from the rifles of the contending
lines on Lookout, like so many fireflies on a hot July evening.</p>
        <p>The extravagant talk about Hooker's “battle above the clouds”
is a misnomer, that has found its way into print, and for a long
time filled the papers and magazines and is nothing but a
magnified myth (unsupported by facts) that is absolutely
incredible. At no time were the contending forces more than half
way up the mountain, and all the glory arrogated by the Federals
was achieved over a light line deployed as skirmishers, composed
of Alabamans. For a long time this twaddle was absolutely and
positively sickening.</p>
        <p>But I must return to my beloved Orphans. Next morning
(25th) before daylight we were ordered to the extreme right
(Northern point of the Ridge) as support to Cleburne's division, a
man who was never known to ask for support. This move was a
complete waste of that important element of strength at this
critical and all-important
<pb id="young71" n="71"/>
time, for we, the Orphans, rendered practically no
service at all on that eventful day. But here I conjecture land
philosophize again. May be and perhaps it was providential, for
had we kept our place in the line between and among Cobb's
guns, “Lady Breckinridge,” “Lady Buckner” and “Lady Helm,”
and his other guns to which the Orphans were lovingly endeared,
they would never have been surrendered while a man was on his
feet. Lucky indeed for Sheridan and Wood that day that the
Orphans were away from home, and perhaps equally lucky for
some, if not all, of us, for we had sworn never to abandon this
position while a man of us lived.</p>
        <p>This, in my mind, was the strongest natural position with one
exception (Rockyface Gap) ever held by the Confederate forces
in the West, and its abandonment was a disgrace to Confederate
arms. Imagine our mortification and deep chagrin when we
learned that our battery  -  Cobb's  -  with the endearing names
inscribed thereon, had been cowardly abandoned after we had
successfully defended them at Shiloh, Vicksburg, Baton Rouge,
Murfreesboro, Jackson, Chickamauga and other places. It was
enough to make an angel weep and justified the anathemas hurled
at the commander and the cowardly troops that were left to
defend them. The circumstance left a sting that never can be
forgotten while an Orphan survives.</p>
        <p>We never knew what had happened until about dark, when
we were ordered from our position toward Chickamauga Station.
Then the truth took first the form of conjecture, then misgiving
and lastly the sad news that we were to cover the retreat of the
army. Then all was explained.</p>
        <p>The retreat that night was one of intense hardship and
excitement, and it was entrusted to the Orphan Brigade, with the
help of Cleburne's division, to protect the retreating army. We
were in their grasp had they only known it. Passing so near one
of their pursuing columns we
<pb id="young72" n="72"/>
could actually hear them talking and see them moving around the
camp fires they were kindling. To prevent being ambushed we
threw out a string of guards on both sides of the road, who
moved along parallel with the road and near it. Every moment we
expected an attack.</p>
        <p>The feeling was one of intenseness and we were greatly
relieved when at last we became assured of our escape.</p>
        <p>Had the Federals only known it, they had our retreating
column cut in two and could have made a finish of the day's work
and probably the Confederacy as well.</p>
        <p>But they, too, as well as the Confederates, failed sometimes
to grasp their opportunities. One of the pleasant and enjoyable
features of this night's experience was the wading of
Chickamauga River, waist deep, which had a tendency to further
exasperate us and cause the men to express themselves in
anything but Sunday school phrase and song.</p>
        <p>Next day was but little less exciting. The Federal advance
was pressing us with unusual vigor and compelled us to turn time
and again from the line of march and check their advance. It was
fight and run until Cleburne determined to, and did, put an end to
it, ambushing them at Ringgold Gap, where they paid for their
persistence with the lives of several hundred men.</p>
        <p>After this costly warning from Cleburne we were permitted
to continue our retreat unmolested and reached, the next day,
that haven of rest, Dalton, about which I have written in
a subsequent chapter.</p>
        <p>I am making my chapter on Mission Ridge short because
there is nothing pertaining to it that is to the credit of the
Confederate soldier as a whole. Yet there were some commands
of the army that did their duty well and creditably.</p>
        <p>In looking at the tablets of many  -  in fact most of the Federal
regiments and brigades which contain a summary of their losses  -  I
was struck with amazement at the very light loss sustained in this
memorable engagement,
<pb id="young73" n="73"/>
so disgraceful to the Confederates. Some regiments losing only
one man killed and ten or twelve wounded, and no brigade, so far
as I noticed, lost more than thirteen men, which was an average
of three to the regiment. We had a single company, Company I,
of the Fourth Kentucky, that lost more men at Shiloh than a
whole brigade here.</p>
        <p>When considering the great advantage of position held by
them and the insignificant losses inflicted upon the Federals, the
losses but emphasize the fact that the Confederates must have
been badly rattled on this summit and would no doubt have made
a better fight from their entrenchments at the base of the
mountain bordering the valley, over which the columns of Grant
moved to the attack.</p>
        <p>But let us think and reason for the moment, and if possible
find some excuse for this miserable failure. It is well known to
the expert marksman and sportsman as well, that in shooting on a
steep decline you are much more apt to overshoot than when
directing a shot horizontally or upward. This was the case there
on these steep mountain sides, which furnishes the one excuse
only for such bad marksmanship and the low per cent of
casualties just noticed. But notwithstanding this fact a much more
creditable record could have been made by rolling the huge
boulders that were abundant down upon the Federals, whose
progress was, of course, necessarily slow; and, lastly, when the
enemy reached the summit exhausted, what were their bayonets
for and why did they not use them? These are questions that
suggest themselves to the mind of the writer at this distant day,
while looking at, this natural and seeming impregnable position.
As stated before, the history on one part of the field would have
been differently written had not the Orphans been taken away
from their pets  -  “Lady Buckner,” “Lady Breckinridge,” “Lady
Helm,” “Lady Hanson,” “Lady Lyon” and others of their
companions in war. A feeling of
<pb id="young74" n="74"/>
chagrin creeps over me when I think of the surrender of these
guns with their endearing names and hitherto immortal history.</p>
        <p>But General Bragg, in his wisdom  -  no, his unwisdom  -  thought
it best to send us away from our idols and hazard them in the
keeping of those who betrayed their trust, and left us, like
Rachael, weeping, because they were lost and we “also refused
to be comforted.”</p>
        <p>I find almost innumerable tablets, markers and monuments
placed here to commemorate the deeds of valor here performed
by the Federals; but I find very few (which is well) to mark the
Confederates and <hi rend="italics">their</hi> deeds. But could I have my way every
one of these would be removed and in their stead I would place
the Goddess of Liberty, weeping for shame that her children had
so dishonored their heritage.</p>
        <p>I have said that I would be brief, and choking back the feeling
of remorse and disgrace that this one incident in the history of the
Confederate soldier has fixed upon their otherwise brilliant and
incomparable record, I close by referring the reader to
Murfreesboro.</p>

DALTON.</head>
        <p>Who that spent the winter of '63-'64 at Dalton does not
recall some circumstance or incident to remind him of the dreary
“winter of discontent” spent in this mountain fastness of Northern
Georgia? To many of us it seemed like an age, but withal it was a
season of much needed rest and recuperation. Here in and
around this little city flanked by majestic mountains, pondering
over the disasters of Lookout and Missionary Ridge, we spent the
time in comparative comfort and ease, some planning in mind the
future campaign and its outcome, others indifferent as to the
future and caring but little, willing to entrust all to those at the
helm, and making the most of circumstances and the ever
present, little thinking or caring for the great dangers and
hardships that awaited us.</p>
        <p>There was from the time we turned our faces Southward
from Bowling Green to the very close of the war an air of
indifference, a “devil may care,” happy-go-lucky spirit, about
these young Kentuckians that made them ready to cheerfully
undertake any enterprise, no matter how dangerous or exacting
the duty or perilous the undertaking. They had become so
accustomed to all these things, and so thoroughly inured to
hardships, that they felt themselves prepared for and rather
coveted them, no matter how great or trying. While here we
enjoyed more liberty and recreation than any time during or since
the war began. Some of the men were furloughed and enjoyed a
few days of rest with relatives and friends (if perchance they had
any) in the South. The writer spent his in gay old Richmond on
the James, in company with General Lewis, Captain McKendrie
and other Kentuckians there assembled. All amused themselves
as best they could in camp and town.</p>
        <p>Drilling had been dispensed with  -  no need now for
<pb id="young76" n="76"/>
that, for in this we were perfect. Dress parade, guard mount and
review were about the only exercises now required. A great
sham battle broke the monotony once, and a snowball battle at
another time was a diversion indulged for one day. A very
pertinent question was often asked toward the close of the winter  -  
“Who would command in the next campaign?” When at last it
was given out that General Johnson would command, the spirits
of the men revived and hope was again renewed. While
contemplating the future, news came that the enemy were now
moving Daltonward. We indulged the hope and wondered
whether Sherman would undertake to force the pass in
Rockyface Mountain through which the railroad and wagon road
both ran. We thought of Leonidas and his Spartans and hoped for
an opportunity to imitate and if possible to eclipse that immortal
event at Thermopylae. But not so the wily Sherman. That “old
fox” was too cunning to be caught in that or any other trap.</p>
        <p>We were ordered out to meet him and took position in the gap
and on the mountain, from which we could see extending for
miles his grand encampment of infantry and artillery, the stars and
stripes floating from every regimental brigade, division and corps
headquarters and presenting the greatest panorama I ever beheld.
Softly and sweetly the music from their bands as they played the
national airs were wafted up and over the summit of the
mountain. Somehow, some way, in some inexplicable and unseen
manner, “Hail Columbia,” “America” and “The Star Spangled
Banner” sounded sweeter than I had ever before heard them, and
filled my soul with feelings that I could not describe or forget. It
haunted me for days, but never shook my loyalty to the Stars and
Bars or relaxed my efforts in behalf of our cause.</p>
        <p>While thus arrayed in his grand encampment, his banners
flying and bands playing, a part of his force (McPherson's
Corps), like a gladiator, was rapidly and
<pb id="young77" n="77"/>
stealthily gliding over the plain West of the mountains to seize
Snake Creek and Dug Gaps and strike Johnson in the rear at
Resaca. But you know “the best laid schemes of mice and men
gang aft agley.” We arrived there first and gave him a hearty
welcome, as described in my chapter on Resaca.</p>
        <p>Dalton, like other towns and cities, has changed wonderfully
in the days since the war. From a quaint old mountain town of a
half century ago to the modern and thrifty little city of today,
putting on airs like many other towns. To me no landmarks are
visible save the old stone springhouse, near where General Lewis
had his headquarters and Captain Phillips, A. Q. M. of the
Fourth, had his quartermaster store and where his lovely little
wife graced his “marquee” with the air and dignity of the queen
that she was. I walked over the ground on which the Fourth was
encamped and stood upon the very spot where Captain Hugh
Henry's tent was pitched, and in which we were often
entertained by the Kentucky Glee Club, which was composed of
some of the finest talent in the army. While it may not be
altogether relevant to the purpose of these chapters, I cannot
refrain from referring to and mentioning the fact that the Fourth
Kentucky was admitted to have the finest band in the Western
Army, led by that accomplished and expert musician who (after
the war) became a teacher in the Boston Conservatory of Music  -  
Billy McQuown. Many, many times were we regaled by the
music of our band and carried back to the bosom of friends by the
sweet strains of “My Old Kentucky Home” and other familiar
and inspiring airs played by this band. It is no stranger, than it is
true, that music exercises a wonderful and inspiring influence
over the soldier, making him forget the hardships, trials and
dangers to which he is almost constantly exposed, and troops are
never happier than when being entertained in this way, unless it
be at a full mess table.</p>
        <p>I have been reluctantly compelled to pass by Kennesaw
<pb id="young78" n="78"/>
and Pine Mountains, both of which are places of much
interest to surviving Orphans. On the former we left several of
our best officers and men. Among the former was Major John
Bird Rogers of the Fourth Kentucky Regiment, and Lieutenant
Bob Innis of the Second. Than the former there was not a more
capable and gallant officer identified with the history of the
Orphan Brigade as was also Lieutenant Innis.</p>
        <p>Pine Mountain, a lone sentinel of nature, was made sacredly
historic by the blood of the great preacher, General Bishop Polk. I
saw the “grand old man” as he, Generals Johnston and Bates and
others rode by the Orphans' position to the summit of the
mountain to view and examine the enemy's position in front, and
could not but admire the graceful and dignified bearing of the
grand old man as he saluted in true military style as he passed. I
saw the smoke from and heard the thunder of Simonson's guns as
they sent the fatal shot that tore his body and ended his earthly
career. Sad and awful moment for the Confederacy! But we have
here presented one of the most noted and conspicuous characters
in America history. I stood on the very spot on which he fell not
twenty minutes after the sad occurrence  -  Burton's sharpshooters
with their Kerr rifles having driven Simonson and his gunners to
cover. I believe the sacred spot should have erected on it a
monument commemorative of this tragic incident and the life and
character of this great man. It is certainly a picturesque and
interesting spot.</p>
        <p>But before I go I must tell of my visit to Rockyface Gap.
Here is one of the grand sentinels of nature  -  a lofty and
stone-crowned mountain towering above and looking
contemplatively down upon his neighbors and the low-bending
valleys upon whose bosom Sherman pitched his grand and
imposing encampment in the make-believe that he was going
South through this impregnable pass held by Johnson. Next to
Lookout it is the grandest mountain in the Appalachian chain,
and one well worthy of a visit
<pb id="young79" n="79"/>
by the tourist lover of nature. I climbed to the top of it this
morning, going over the same identical path traveled by us
while doing picket and observation duty. Here we had the only
human telegraph line I ever saw, which was made by placing the
operator (an officer) on the summit to report the operations and
movements of the enemy to the first man in the line, he repeating
it to the next in line and so on down the mountain to its base
where the general had his staff officers and couriers to receive
the message and report to him at his headquarters. The scheme
worked like a charm, notwithstanding its uniqueness.</p>
        <p>I was impelled to make this trip  -  although I felt when I
reached the summit I was about to collapse  -  to see the resting
place of a noble and brave old Orphan who was killed while on
duty here  -  George Disney of Company K, Fourth Kentucky  -  an
account of whose singular death is noted by Virginius Hutchings
in the history of the Orphan Brigade. I learned before going on
this trip that the Boy Scouts of Dalton, under Captain Sapp,
county clerk, had only two days before gone up and placed a
marble headstone to the grave to take the place of the board that
had so long marked his resting place  -  a place that a monarch or
king might envy, hundreds of feet above common man.</p>
        <p>I wished while there, so high upward toward Heaven, that I
could wield the pen of a Gray or a Kipling, that I might do this
subject of my thoughts justice. The subject, the inspiration, was
here, but language to express it was lacking. Poor George! You
have had one friend after these long years to leave a tear of
tribute to your memory.</p>
        <p>I cannot close without first thanking the good daughters of
Dalton for the compliment they paid me by really forcing upon
me undeserved attentions in a very fine lunch set before and out
of time specially for me just before taking the train at 11:50 a. M.,
and who I think had a
<pb id="young80" n="80"/>
scheme to force me to make them a speech  -  it being Decoration
Day  -  but I slipped through their fingers and got away.</p>

<lb/>
VISIT TO RESACA  -  1912.</head>
        <p>May 14th found us after a tiresome night's march at
Resaca, from which point I again write you.</p>
        <p>Here today and on the morrow was fought the first battle of
magnitude in the great hundred and twenty days' battle of the
celebrated Georgia campaign from Dalton to Atlanta. I say
hundred and twenty days' battle, which may seem a little
far-fetched, but which is almost literally true, for there was not a day
or night, yes scarcely an hour, that we did not hear the crack of a
rifle or roar of a cannon. Their sounds were our lullaby, sleeping
or waking  -  to their music we slept, by their thunderings we were
awakened, and to the accompanying call of the bugle we
responded on the morning of May 14 to engage in the death
grapple with Sherman's well clothed, well fed and thoroughly
rested veterans  -  a matter “of Greek meeting Greek again.”
Sherman had pushed down the West side of Rockyface Mountain
and through Snake Creek Gap the day and night before in an
effort to cut Johnston's communications and take him in the rear.
But we had been doing some marching and digging, too, and
when Sherman's columns four or five deep debouched from their
positions  -  a long, heavily wooded ridge  -  into the narrow valley, on
the East side of which we had constructed rifle pits, he found us
ready to receive his gay and awe-inspiring columns, who moved
in perfect step, with banners flying and bands playing, as though
he expected to charm us.</p>
        <p>The eagerness of our own men could scarcely be restrained
until they had reached the point to which our orders had been
given, seventy-five to eighty yards, when our lines opened almost
simultaneously a deadly and murderous fire from both infantry
and double-shotted artillery, that flesh and blood could not
withstand. Retiring
<pb id="young82" n="82"/>
in disorder to their original position in the woods, they rallied
and reformed, while their artillery was busy playing upon our
batteries, from which they received no response whatever, a
mystery at the time to many of us, but which we understood a
little later on when they again moved down to the attack, to be
met in the same manner with both infantry and artillery, and with
similar results. Three times during the morning and early
afternoon were these attacks made upon our lines, with the same
results. It was a veritable picnic for the Confederates and was
the second time in the history of the war, up to this time, that we
had presented such a glorious opportunity, protected as we were
by earthworks, with clear and open ground in front. Had Sherman
continued this business during the entire day (as we hoped he
would) the campaign would have ended right here, as we had not
called into requisition any of our reserve force. The principal part
of the afternoon was spent by the artillery  -  after the infantry had
gotten enough of it  -  on both sides pounding away at each other in
a lively and entertaining fashion.</p>
        <p>Some daring and courageous deeds were performed by the
Federal officers and men on this occasion, the recollection of
which is refreshing and exhilarating to the writer, but for want of
time I shall be compelled to pass over. However, one instance, I
will relate as being somewhat interesting to Kentuckians as
showing the home spirit and natural feeling existing between them
as Kentuckians, although now engaged in the deadly breach. That
night some of our boys of the Fourth Kentucky learned from
inquiry of our “friends” in our front that we were confronting the
Federal Fourth Kentucky (Colonel Tom Croxton), whereupon a
bantering of epithets and compliments was at once begun and
exchanged in a very amusing and interesting way. I listened to
the colloquy with great interest and amusement, which was
conducted on our side by Lieutenant Horace Watts, who was a
noted wit and humorist. But I regret that I have forgotten the
<pb id="young83" n="83"/>
name of his interrogator, whom I recall, however, was from
Vanceburg, Ky.</p>
        <p>That night was spent in strengthening our works and
preparing for the work of the morrow, which work we well knew
was coming. When morning came the appearance of Old Sol was
greeted with a signal from a battery immediately in our front,
which had been stationed there during the night and protected by
substantial and elaborate earthworks. The shots from this battery
were directed against Hotchkiss' battalion of artillery, and which
the Fourth Kentucky Infantry was supporting. The enemy's guns
from every part of the line kept up a continuous fire throughout
the entire day and was the greatest open field bombardment of
the war. We were much amused at the manner of firing of the
battery in our front, which was done by bugle signal, the meaning
of which our men soon learned, for a moment later our works
would be pierced by their shells and when they exploded threw
high in the air a cloud of dirt and smoke from the embankment
that almost covered us up. At intervals of about every five or ten
minutes the bugle's “whe-whee-deedle-dee-dee” told us of the
crash that was coming and almost lifted our scalps and rendered
some of us deaf for weeks. Had the day been an hour longer we
would have been compelled to abandon our works, for the
embankments were almost leveled and the trenches filled.</p>
        <p>Two of Hotchkiss' guns were cut down and had to be
abandoned, and but for the fact that they had been run back
beyond the crest, not a splinter of them would have been left.</p>
        <p>Our batteries did not fire a gun that day, having been ordered
to withhold their fire in anticipation of another attack by the
enemy's infantry. This day's work was a very clever ruse of
Sherman's and demonstrated the cunning of that wily general, for
while he was thus entertaining us with the main part of his army,
especially his artillery, like the sly old fox that he was, he was
planning our
<pb id="young84" n="84"/>
undoing by sending down the river to our rear Dodge's
Corps to fall on our rear and cut our communications and
intercept our retreat.</p>
        <p>Had his plan been expedited by Dodge, as it might
have been, it would surely have been “all day” with us
poor devils of Confederates. It was certainly a “close
shave,” for which we were all very thankful. But we here
on the 14th enjoyed the “picnic” for which we Orphans
paid most dearly on the 28th at Dallas, and which I shall
describe in another place. War, it seems from my experience
and observation, may be described as a dreadful and costly
game of “tit-for-tat.”</p>
        <p>The losses sustained by the Orphans in this engagement at
Resaca were insignificant compared with that inflicted upon the
enemy in their front. There is not a single recognizable object here
save the ground where we fought, from the fact that we arrived here
in the night and took our departure in the night. The narrow valley
and the long extended <sic corr="ridge">rigde</sic> in its front and the spur occupied by
Hotchkiss and the Fourth Kentucky, is all that I see to remind me of
the two days of “pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war.”
But how's this, we fighting behind entrenchments and the enemy in the
open, four or five lines deep?</p>
        <p>“Our loss was 2,747, and his (Johnson's) 2,800. I fought offensively and
he defensively, aided by earthwork parapets.”  -  [General Sherman's statement.]
There must have been some bad shooting on this occasion  -  the
advantages all on one side, but results so nearly even.</p>
        <p>Today, May 16 (1912), marks the forty-eighth anniversary of this
important event, and finds me on the ground. Here, as at other places
previously mentioned and described, things came back to me and I
see them being reenacted. I was accompanied on this inspection
by an old comrade (J. H. Norton), who lost an arm at Chancellorsville,
and who has lived here in Resaca almost all his life and who was at
home at the time, having been
<pb id="young85" n="85"/>
discharged on account of the loss of his arm, and who
assisted in burying the dead, and he pooh-poohed Sherman's
statement as to relative losses. Another old comrade, who
is a merchant in the town, told me that he had bought over
a hundred thousand pounds of minnie balls picked up on the
ground where the battle was fought. I saw a three-bushel box
full in his store today. How many poor devils were killed by
these would be impossible to tell. They have a neat little cemetery
near the town, in which there are nine Kentuckians (Confederates)
buried, some of those names I have copied.</p>

<lb/>
DALLAS.</head>
        <p>Here, as at Balaklava, “some one blundered,” and while we
have not had a Tennyson to immortalize the event, it is of more
than ordinary interest to Kentuckians, <sic corr="especially">especialy</sic> those who
participated in the bloody event. More because of the fearful
slaughter and the mournful fact that it was the result of a failure
to deliver orders at the proper time. The official report showed a
loss of 51 per cent, a loss, considering the time actually engaged,
unparalleled in the history of the war. To my mind it was the most
desperate and disastrous of all the many engagements in which
the Orphans took part during their four years of experience.</p>
        <p>The actual time under fire did not in my judgment exceed
thirty minutes. To describe accurately the position of the enemy
at this distant day would be a difficult task, but when the reader is
told that they occupied two parallel lines of entrenchments, from
both of which he delivered simultaneously a destructive and
murderous fire, that was so fatal that nothing but the protecting
hand of an all-wise and merciful Providence could save. The first
of these lines was a few yards below, and in front of the second,
which ran along the summit of the ridge and enabled the second
line to fire directly overhead without endangering the first.
Besides this double advantage, they were able to enfilade our line
with their artillery from both extremes of their line. Smith's
brigade, on our left, having received orders (which were also
intended for us and which failed of delivery) to withhold the
attack, enabled the enemy to deliver an oblique fire upon us from
his infantry on the left, as well as from his two lines directly in
front. At every step Kentucky was paying
<pb id="young87" n="87"/>
double toll with the lives of her noblest and best. To push forward
meant certain and complete annihilation; to remain where we
were some seventy-five or eighty yards in their front, meant the
same, only a little slower death.</p>
        <p>The order to “fall back” having been given, we were only too
glad to attempt our escape from the death trap into which we had
been ordered. Many of our wounded and all of our dead were left
on the field or intervening space between the entrenched lines of
the opposing forces. Several of the wounded crawled back after
nightfall and in this way made their escape. The grounds in the
rear of our works presented an appalling sight when I reached
them with my burden on my back  -  Sergeant W. E. Knox, who had
a broken leg. Nothing but a miracle saved us both from the
murderous fire of the enemy. Here fell the gallant and polished
Major Millett within ten paces of our entrenchment, he being the
third major of the Fourth Regiment to be killed on the field.</p>
        <p>Several incidents of a thrilling and miraculous character
occurred on this field, as afterward related. Some of our wounded
who approached nearest the enemy's works and fell into their
hands were taken to the little town of Dallas, a mile or two
distant, where they were found two days later, and left in a
shamefully neglected condition. Among them was one of the most
noble gentlemen and gallant soldiers it was ever my good fortune
to know, Captain D. E. McKendrie of the Sixth Kentucky, and
who died a few days later.</p>
        <p>There were really only two brigades engaged in this
encounter, the Orphan Brigade and Findlay's Florida Brigade.
The burden of the encounter fell upon the Orphans, as shown by
their greater loss. But here again was displayed that daring,
regardless of consequences, which had been so often displayed
by this little band of Kentuckians on so many fields from Fort
Donaldson to this eventful day. I hope I shall not be accused of
egotism for seeming to arrogate to myself and my fellow
Kentuckians honors to
<pb id="young88" n="88"/>
which we are not entitled and of which all of her people may be
justly proud. The loss of 51 per cent tells the story more
graphically than anything I may say by way of compliment or
eulogy.</p>
        <p>The reader may wonder why this attack was ordered against
a force so strongly and irresistibly posted. The answer is easy to
the old veteran who knows the difficulty in ascertaining an
enemy's position in a heavily timbered country like this, with trees
and bushes in full leaf, and how great the danger from the ever
alert sharpshooter to the man attempting a reconnaissance. The
object was to develop his strength at this point, the commander
believing Sherman to be only feigning while he was carrying out
other and ulterior plans. But so it was, we paid dearly for the
desired information.</p>
        <p>I have reviewed every foot of this ground the second time,
stopping here and there to pick up a minnie ball lodged in the
enemy's works, fired at them by my dear old “Orphan” boys, and
while thus engaged the familiar faces of many a noble comrade
and in one or two instances school fellows' images passed before
my mind in panorama that almost unnerved and dumfounded me.
Studying coolly at this time the great advantage the enemy had in
position and numbers, I am surprised that any of us escaped at all.
I had no difficulty whatever in locating at once the position of both
parties and the exact spot on which my regiment and company
fought. Most of the Confederate lines have been partly and in
some places completely obliterated by the plow, but hills and
hollows are still there. The enemy's lines have been little disturbed
and are mostly intact even at this distant day.</p>
        <p>I must confess that I am wont to linger about this hallowed
spot and my heart beats heavily when I think of the comrades
and friends who died here and whose bodies I assisted in giving
the last rude sepulchre. I turn away from it with tearful eyes and
sorrowful heart.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XI.
<lb/>
ATLANTA  -  MAY, 1912.</head>
        <p>I am writing this from historic Atlanta, the “gateway of the
South.” How very different to the Atlanta I knew in the days
gone by when her streets were filled with the tramp, tramp of
marching armies, when her walls were rocked by the thunders of
the cannon's mighty roar, when the rockets' “red glare gave proof
through the night that our new flag was still there.” Oh! what a
wonderful change 'twixt now and then. “Lovely city now, quiet
and mighty in her peaceful ways, may the God of war never
again sound his bugle calls over her peaceful slumbers, and may
she know the ways of war no more forever.”</p>
        <p>How very, very different to the Atlanta I saw in June, 1865,
when on my way home from the South, returning disabled,
discomfited, defeated. What darker picture could be imagined
unless it be “Dante's Inferno,” than a city of destroyed homes
with blackened walls and chimneys punctuating the fiendish spirit
that prompted the ruin of its people and their homes. When
General Sherman first gave expression to his oft-repeated
apothegm he must have had in mind the ruin he had accomplished
in the destruction of this fair city of the South. Certainly nothing
but a fiendish spirit could have prompted it.</p>
        <p>But two buildings of prominence were left  -  the Masonic
Temple and a hotel. But her people are now enjoying the
blessings of peace and prosperity, having risen, Phoenix-like,
from her ashes.</p>
        <p>I must now return to some of the incidents and events of the
defense of Atlanta in which I was an humble participant. On the
9th of July General Johnston's army crossed the Chattahoochee
River on pontoons and the time until the 22d was employed by
Johnston and Hood chiefly in marching and counter-marching to
checkmate the movements of Sherman. A circumstance
happened
<pb id="young90" n="90"/>
about this time that gave Sherman great pleasure (he says so)
and correspondingly great sorrow and despondency to the
Confederates, heretofore so successfully led by General
Johnston, viz., the removal of Johnston and the substitution of
Hood.</p>
        <p>While Hood was a Kentuckian as well as we Orphans, and
we priding in everything pertaining to the history of Kentucky, we
had unbounded confidence in General Johnston. But once before
had we felt such sadness and regret  -  when General Breckinridge
was taken from us and sent to Virginia. This feeling was
intensified by the belief that Bragg was responsible.</p>
        <p>On the 20th the battle of Peach Tree Creek was fought and
given a prominence in excess of the facts as the writer saw it; a
straggling, haphazard kind of hide and seek affair, magnified into
a battle. On the 22d of July was fought what is known in history
as the battle of Atlanta.</p>
        <p>The night march of the 21st from our place in the line of
defense on the left and to the extreme right near Decatur, where
this battle was fought, was the most trying, with one exception,
the writer remembers to have ever experienced, occupying the
entire night in dust ankle deep, without a drop of water or an
hour's rest. It is remembered to this day with a distinctness that
makes me fairly shudder. When morning came we looked like the
imaginary Adam “of the earth earthy,” so completely were we
encased in dust. But for the nerve stimulus that imminent and
great danger gives a man on the eve of a great battle, I don't
think I could have rendered much service, on this occasion, after
such exhaustion and suffering from thirst. In fact were it not an
indispensable part of my plan I should have little to say about this
whole affair, for it was to me the most ill-conceived and
unsatisfactory executed plan of battle of the whole war in which I
participated.</p>
        <p>There were difficulties to overcome that might easily have
been avoided had the proper engineering skill been
<pb id="young91" n="91"/>
employed in time and the necessary reconnaissance been
made. So far as results accomplished were concerned, it was
barren and fruitless. Especially was this the case on the extreme
right, where Bates' division fought and where the Orphans took
part. Not that any man or body of men proved recreant, but there
was a lack of understanding and cooperation of movement,
coupled with almost insurmountable obstacles that might have
been avoided. For instance, the Kentucky Brigade was compelled
to struggle through the mire of a slough and millpond filled with
logs, stumps, brush and what-not in water and mire knee-deep,
the men in many instances being compelled to extricate their
comrades by pulling them onto logs and other footings before we
could pass the obstruction. This so deranged our battle alignment
that in the press and excitement of the moment, caused by the enemy firing
at this critical moment, we were never able to correct it and
present a solid front. Out of dust ankle deep into water and mire
knee-deep was too much for the nerves and patience of the strongest
man and most patient Christian. And then, to be finally pitched in one
disordered and confused mass against a well disciplined and strongly
posted line of veterans, behind earthworks, was too much for the
best soldiers of the times. And yet with the proper use of artillery at the
right time and place, we might have accomplished more decisive results.</p>
        <p>This affair was the more lamentable to the Orphans because
of the loss of quite a number of our best officers
and men without any tangible results. The whole thing was
disappointing and to me really disgusting. Hood at Atlanta, like
Bragg at Murfreesboro, might profitably have spent more time
with his engineers in examining and surveying the ground on
which he expected to fight. General Johnson was doubtless better posted.
But the final result would have been the same; Atlanta was doomed  -  
by Sherman's force of three to one. After summing up results and exchanging
regrets and expressing sorrow for
<pb id="young92" n="92"/>
the loss of comrades, we returned to our original places in the
lines of defense to await the next scene in the grand drama.</p>
        <p>This came on August 6th at Utoy Creek on the Sandtown
road leading Southwest from Atlanta. The Orphan Brigade and
Tyler's Tennessee Brigade had been pushed forward on a kind of
salient to the left and front of the main line and touching the little
stream known as Utoy Creek. Here occurred the battle known
by the above name. I here recognize more distinctly than any
other place, so far visited, the general appearance of the ground
and especially the falls of the little creek at which on the day
previous to the battle I enjoyed the only refreshing bath for
several days. It is quite an interesting place to the writer. I here
witnessed on the morning of the battle the capture of Lieut.
Isham Dudley, in command of the videttes, together with some
half dozen men of the Orphan Brigade, they having been
completely surprised just at daybreak by a sudden and
unexpected rush of the enemy.</p>
        <p>The writer had the honor to command the skirmish line
covering the Confederate position and had a fine opportunity to
witness the charge of the two Federal brigades, which were
composed chiefly of East Tennesseans, as they swept past the
right of our skirmish line, they doubtless not knowing that they
were about to encounter breastworks of a formidable character,
receiving at the same time a scathing flank fire from the Fourth
Kentucky and the skirmish line above alluded to. But they were
plucky fellows and charged to within a few yards of our works,
paying dearly for their courage and temerity. In this affair we
were attacked by a force somewhat superior in numbers, but the
advantage that our breastworks afforded us made the victory
easily won. I here quote the order of General S. D. Lee,
commanding corps, congratulating them and incidentally
<sic corr="complementing">complimenting</sic> the defenders.</p>
        <p>“The lieutenant general commanding takes pleasure
<pb id="young93" n="93"/>
in announcing to the officers and men of this corps the splendid
conduct of a portion of Bates' Division, particularly Tyler's
Brigade and the Second and Fourth Kentucky regiments of
Lewis' Brigade, in sustaining and repulsing on yesterday
afternoon three assaults of the enemy in which his loss in killed,
wounded and prisoners was from eight hundred to a thousand
men, with three stands of colors, three or four hundred small arms
and all of his entrenching tools. Soldiers who fight with the coolness
and determination that these men did will always be
victorious over any reasonable number.”</p>
        <p>In this engagement we lost only about eighteen men all told,
while the enemy's loss in killed alone was 160. I walked over the
ground ten minutes after it occurred and found the crest of the hill
covered with the dead and wounded, swords, guns, cartridge
boxes and other paraphernalia of war.</p>
        <p>I found here the thing I need and coveted most of all at
this time, a fine black sombrero, which furnished me ample
protection thereafter from the intense rays of the August sun. I
“swapped” my spoon-bill cap with the fellow who had worn this
hat, to which he, of course, raised no objection. Others provided
themselves in like manner, which was entirely legitimate, of
course, the original owners having no further use for such things.
But a flanking column that night, as usual, compelled us to
abandon the position of our recent victory and we retired to our
original position in the circle of entrenchments.</p>
        <p>I have this day, May 13, 1912, carefully and studiously
reviewed the very spot on which those 160 men lay dead, and I
feel safe in saying that it is not larger than one-half a city block.
They were met square in front and were fired on from both
flanks, and had they attempted to remain there as much as one
hour there would not have been a man of them left on his feet. It
was a death trap similar to the one into which we Orphans fell at
Dallas.</p>
        <p>I could hardly control my emotions when viewing this
<pb id="young94" n="94"/>
place, and my mind was almost overwhelmed as I walked along
on top of these still distinct and undisturbed parapets, stopping
now and then to pick up a “Yankee bullet” lodged in them, or a
small stone that had been thrown out by the Confederates. The
surroundings here are perfectly familiar to me, notwithstanding
opinions of friends at home to the contrary. So interesting is this
spot that I have made the second visit to it.</p>
        <p>Here the time from August 7 to 29, 1864, was spent in
listening to the music of the rifle and the cannon and an
occasional sweet, faint and harmonious symphony from the
enemy's brass bands as they played, seemingly for our
entertainment, “The Star Spangled Banner,” “Hail Columbia,”
“Yankee Doodle” and, to taunt us, “Dixie.” At night they would
vary the entertainment by sending up innumerable rockets, which
some of the men interpreted to mean the arrival of a new
command or shift of position, but to most of us it was “Greek and
Hebrew.”</p>
        <p>But this condition was not to last; Sherman's definition of war
was in him and must come out. On the 29th we packed our
knapsacks and bidding good-bye to the Atlanta of the day, soon to
be no more, we again turned Southward to meet the flanking
columns of Sherman at Jonesboro, with a description of which I
shall close these recollections.</p>
        <p>Before leaving this dear old city I must take one more last
look at her steeples, her walls and her streets, shake the hand of
friends in the last farewell grasp and say good-bye forever.</p>
        <p>I find Atlanta so wonderfully changed, commercially,
assuming metropolitan airs and wearing her honors so gracefully
that I dare not attempt a description of her present status.
Besides, these things are well known now by the whole
American people. Still I find myself comparing her (in mind) with
what she was “before and during the war.”</p>
        <p>The fact that I am now looking upon her for the last
<pb id="young95" n="95"/>
time, and the further fact that she contains many warm and true
friends whom I shall never see again, causes a feeling of sadness
I wish I could resist. But I break camp and take up my line of
march for Jonesboro.</p>
        <p>But before I leave I must tender my thanks to my young
friend from Bourbon, W. H. Letton (who is now a
prosperous business man here), for many favors and courtesies
so cheerfully extended me. It were cruel to allow
him to spend with me so much of his time from his lovely little
Georgia bride, so recently taken to himself. But this
is Kentucky, you know, and he inherits it. I am also indebted to
my old comrades, J. W. McWilliams of the Forty-Second
Georgia; J. M. Mills of the Soldiers' Home, and C. L. Ingram of
Fort McPherson; ex-Sheriff Barnes, Major Jones of the Seventeenth
Infantry at the fort (McPherson), and last, though not least by any
means, Mrs. Jones of the city at whose boarding house I was a guest.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XII.
<lb/>
JONESBORO.</head>
        <p>I begin here the last inspection and reminiscence, on my
return trip from attending the recent Confederate reunion at
Macon, May, 1912, and while I distrust my ability to do the theme
proper justice, I am tempted to undertake the task through the
love of the brave “old boys” who still survive and the memory of
several hundred noble young Kentuckians whose life blood
consecrates the soil of Georgia on every field from Chattanooga
to Jonesboro.</p>
        <p>My mind becomes a whirlpool of recollections as I stand here
and “view the landscape o'er” and contemplate the horrible
scenes enacted here forty-eight years ago, and in which the
Confederacy was surely and rapidly expiring in the throes of
dissolution.</p>
        <p>It is not my purpose or aim to controvert in any instance the
descriptions and recitals of the historians, but merely as a pastime
to revert to some of my personal experiences and recollections.
Nor shall I attempt to enlarge upon or embellish the history of that
glorious little band of Kentuckians known as the “Orphan
Brigade.” That has been done by others, done by such men as
Prof. N. S. Shaler, Gens. Joseph E. Johnson, W. J. Hardee,
Stephen D. Lee, Ed. Porter Thompson and many others, able and
eloquent men, historians and statesmen, and in whose history
Kentuckians of all beliefs must ever rejoice as one of the brightest
and most interesting pages in her history. And why not, since they
represented so many of the noblest and best young men of the
state and were led by such men as Breckinridge, Hanson, Helm,
Lewis, Monroe and others whose names are a synonym of glory
and greatness.</p>
        <p>When we arrived here (Jonesboro) in the great
campaign there were many absent  -  not without leave, thank
<pb id="young97" n="97"/>
God, but with honor, whose brows had been crowned with
everlasting wreaths of honor  -  in death “on Fame's eternal camping
ground.” When the roll was called no response came from many.
Hanson, Helm, Hewitt, Graves, Rogers, Dedman, Madeira,
Daniel, McKendrie, Millett, Williams, Innis, Bramblett, Bell and
three thousand others failed to answer. But as the “blood of
martyrs is the seed of the church,” so the sacrifice of these
Kentuckians is a diadem in the wreath that encircles her history.</p>
        <p>But now I stand on this historic spot where forty-eight years
ago the unequal, almost suicidal conflict raged with destruction
and fury, and see, in my mind's eye, the raging conflict and hear
the cannon's mighty roar, the screaming shot and shell and the
ping and whistle of the deadly minnie, the shouts and yells of the
combatants as they grapple in the deadly conflict. Here I
experienced the pangs of a painful wound from a minnie ball,
while assisting a dear friend (Lieutenant Neal), being in the
throes of death, both he and the man on my left falling
simultaneously. How well I remember the look of anguish upon
his noble countenance as he held up both hands, imploring my
assistance. Brave, noble fellow and Christian gentleman, I trust
and believe his soul rests in peace among the angels.</p>
        <p>Imagine my grief on reaching the ambulance (assisted by
comrades) to find my bosom friend (and by many said to be my
double), Ensign Robert H. Lindsay of Scott County, in the
ambulance, he having received a mortal wound from which he
died that night while lying upon the same blanket with myself.
The reader can imagine my feelings when the dawn of morning
came and I threw back the blanket that covered us and beheld
his noble countenance cold in death, with the fixed glare of the
eyes that told me that my beloved comrade and friend had
passed to the realms of eternal glory. Poor Bob! I tried in vain,
while on the way to the field hospital, to extort a parting message,
a last farewell to mother and family,
<pb id="young98" n="98"/>
but the messenger of death held him in his grasp and refused
compliance with this last request of his friend who loved him as a
brother. A circumstance coincident with his death was the fact
that we prepared and ate our dinners together that day, meantime
talking over the probable results of the approaching battle and
making certain requests of each other in the event that one or the
other should fall. Hence my anxiety to hear a last farewell from
his dying lips. Memory takes me back over the intervening years
and I am tempted to exclaim:</p>
        <lg type="verse">
          <l>Sing thou music of the spheres</l>
          <l>The song of the weeping pines</l>
          <l>As the days and years go by,</l>
          <l>But let me, Oh! let me not forget,</l>
          <l>The dear friend who 'neath them lies.</l>
        </lg>
        <p>I have always thought this a singular circumstance, that the
three friends  -  boon companions  -  holding the same rank, should be
stricken down almost at the same moment  -  that “two should be
taken and the one left,” but such are the vicissitudes of war.</p>
        <p>I can recognize only two landmarks of this historic spot and its
surroundings  -  the old stone depot and the prominent knoll,
occupied by the enemy's skirmishers on the morning of the battle
(August 31st) and which Lieut. Heck Burden, the commander of
that gang of army sleuths, that Sherman and his officers admitted
they dreaded  -  known as the Kentucky sharpshooters  -  and myself,
in a spirit of daring, approached within easy rifle range, by means
of a deep gully, and which terminated in one less Federal officer
reporting to his commander. I have looked upon this particular
spot with no little concern, for it was near this my two dear
friends just noted fell, and where I also received my quietus  -  as a
reward, perhaps, for my daring of the morning. This circumstance
(my wounding) precludes the mention from personal experience a
description of the second day's fight and in which the Orphans
sustained the loss of a number of men
<pb id="young99" n="99"/>
and officers and resulted in the capture of the greater part of the
survivors, Sherman's overwhelming numbers enabling him to
outflank and overpower the left of the Confederate line. But they
were held as prisoners but a short time and were exchanged and
returned to service almost immediately. Here, as in other
instances, the enemy outnumbered us three to one and enabled
them to envelop our flanks more readily than in previous
engagements, the country being without the natural barriers and
obstructions that had previously favored us in the mountain
section of the country through which we had passed.</p>
        <p>Here at Jonesboro ended my service to the Confederacy and
my experience as a soldier in the field. The next six months,
which brought the war to a close, were spent by me in hospitals,
which also came near bringing my earthly career to a close. But,
thank God, I am still here and now engaged in reviewing our
movements of the past. And I shall be happy if what I may have
written should fall under the eye of some old comrade or friend
and afford him pleasure or food for contemplation.</p>
