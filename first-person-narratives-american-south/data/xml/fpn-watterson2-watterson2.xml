            <p><emph rend="bold">SWIFT'S</emph> definition of  “conversation” did not 
preside over or direct the daily intercourse 
between Charles Sumner, Charles Eames and 
Robert J. Walker in the old days in the National 
Capital. They did not converse. They discoursed.  
They talked sententiously in portentous essays and 
learned dissertations. I used to think it great, 
though I nursed no little dislike of Sumner.</p>
            <p>Charles Eames was at the outset of his career a 
ne'er-do-well New Englander - a Yankee 
Jack-of-all-trades - kept at the front by an exceedingly 
<pb id="watterson16" n="16"/>
clever wife. Through the favor she enjoyed at 
court he received from Pierce and Buchanan 
unimportant diplomatic appointments. During their 
sojourns in Washington their home was a kind of 
political and literary headquarters. Mrs. Eames 
had established a salon - the first attempt of the 
kind made there; and it was altogether a success. 
Her Sundays evenings were notable, indeed. 
Whoever was worth seeing, if in town, might usually be 
found there. Charles Sumner led the procession. 
He was a most imposing person. Both handsome 
and distinguished in appearance, he possessed in an 
eminent degree the Harvard pragmatism - or, shall 
I say, affectation? - and seemed never happy 
except on exhibition. He had made a profitable 
political and personal issue of the Preston Brooks 
attack. Brooks was an exceeding light weight, but 
he did for Sumner more than Sumner could ever 
have done for himself.</p>
            <p>In the Charles Eames days Sumner was exceedingly 
disagreeable to me. Many people, indeed, 
thought him so. Many years later, in the Greeley 
campaign of 1872, Schurz brought us together -  
they had become as very brothers in the Senate - 
<pb id="watterson17" n="17"/>
and I found him the reverse of my boyish ill 
conceptions.</p>
            <p>He was a great old man. He was a delightful 
old man, every inch a statesman, much of a scholar, 
and something of a hero. I grew in time to be 
actually fond of him, passed with him entire afternoons 
and evenings in his library, mourned sincerely 
when he died, and went with Schurz to Boston, 
on the occasion when that great German-American 
delivered the memorial address in honor of the dead 
Abolitionist.</p>
            <p>Of all the public men of that period Carl Schurz 
most captivated me. When we first came into 
personal relations, at the Liberal Convention, which 
assembled at Cincinnati and nominated Greeley 
and Brown as a presidential ticket, he was just 
turned forty-three; I, two and thirty. The closest 
intimacy followed. Our tastes were much alike. 
Both of us had been educated in music. He played 
the piano with intelligence and feeling - especially 
Schumann, Brahms and Mendelssohn, neither of 
us ever having quite reached the “high jinks” of 
Wagner.</p>
            <p>To me his oratory was wonderful. He spoke to  
an audience of five or ten thousand as he would 
<pb id="watterson18" n="18"/>
have talked to a party of three or six. His style 
was simple, natural, unstrained; the lucid statement 
and cogent argument now and again irradiated 
by a salient passage of satire or a burst of not 
too eloquent rhetoric.</p>
            <p>He was quite knocked out by the nomination of 
Horace Greeley. For a long time he could not 
reconcile himself to support the ticket. Horace 
White and I addressed ourselves to the task of 
“fetching him into camp” - there being in point of 
fact nowhere else for him to go - though we had to 
get up what was called The Fifth Avenue 
Conference to make a bridge.</p>
            <p>Truth to say, Schurz never wholly adjusted himself 
to political conditions in the United States. He 
once said to me in one of the querulous moods that 
sometimes overcame him: “If I should live a hundred 
years my enemies would still call me a - 
Dutchman!”</p>
            <p>It was Schurz, as I have said, who brought
Lamar and me together. The Mississippian had
been a Secession Member of Congress when I was
a Unionist scribe in the reporters' gallery. I was
a furious partisan in those days and disliked the
Secessionists intensely. Of them, Lamar was most
		
<pb id="watterson19" n="19"/>
aggressive. I later learned that he was very many-sided 
and accomplished, the most interesting and 
lovable of men. He and Schurz “froze together,” 
as, brought together by Schurz, he and I “froze 
together.” On one side he was a sentimentalist and 
on the other a philosopher, but on all sides a fighter.</p>
            <p>They called him a dreamer. He sprang from a 
race of chevaliers and scholars. Oddly enough, 
albeit in his moods a recluse, he was a man of the 
world; a favorite in society; very much at home in 
European courts, especially in that of England; 
the friend of Thackeray, at whose house, when in 
London, he made his abode. Lady Ritchie - Anne 
Thackeray - told me many amusing stories of his 
whimsies. He was a man among brainy men and 
a lion among clever women.</p>
            <p>We had already come to be good friends and 
constant comrades when the whirligig of time threw 
us together for a little while in the lower house of 
Congress. One day he beckoned me over to his 
seat. He was leaning backward with his hands 
crossed behind his head.</p>
            <p>As I stood in front of him he said: “On the
eighth of February, 1858, Mrs. Gwin, of 
California, gave a fancy dress ball. Mr. Lamar, of
		
<pb id="watterson20" n="20"/>
Mississippi, a member of Congress, was there. 
Also a glorious young woman - a vision of beauty 
and grace - with whom the handsome and distinguished 
young statesman danced - danced once, 
twice, thrice, taking her likewise down to supper. 
He went to bed, turned his face to the wall and 
dreamed of her. That was twenty years ago. 
To-day this same Mr. Lamar, after an obscure 
interregnum, was with Mrs. Lamar looking over 
Washington for an apartment. In quest of cheap 
lodging they came to a mean house in a mean quarter, 
where a poor, wizened, ill-clad woman showed them 
through the meanly furnished rooms. Of course 
they would not suffice.</p>
            <p>“As they were coming away the great Mr. Lamar 
said to the poor landlady, ‘Madam, have you lived 
long in Washington?’ She said all her life. 
‘Madam,’ he continued, ‘were you at a fancy dress 
ball given by Mrs. Senator Gwin of California, the
eighth of February, 1858?’ She said she was. ‘Do 
you remember,’ the statesman, soldier and orator 
continued, ‘a young and handsome Mississippian, a 
member of Congress, by the name of Lamar?’ She 
said she didn't.”</p>
            <p>I rather think that Lamar was the biggest 
<pb id="watterson21" n="21"/>
brained of all the men I have met in Washington. 
He possessed the courage of his convictions. A 
doctrinaire, there was nothing of the typical 
doctrinaire, or theorist, about him. He really believed 
that cotton was king and would compel England to 
espouse the cause of the South.</p>
            <p>Despite his wealth of experience and travel he 
was not overmuch of a raconteur, but he once told 
me a good story about his friend Thackeray. The 
two were driving to a banquet of the Literary 
Fund, where Dickens was to preside. “Lamar,” 
said Thackeray, “they say I can't speak. But if 
I want to I can speak. I can speak every bit as 
good as Dickens, and I am going to show you 
to-night that I can speak almost as good as you.” 
When the moment arrived Thackeray said never a 
word. Returning in the cab, both silent, Thackeray 
suddenly broke forth. “Lamar,” he exclaimed, 
“don't you think you have heard the greatest speech 
to-night that was never delivered?”</p>

            <p>Holding office, especially going to Congress, had

seemed to me ever a badge of bondage. I knew 
too much of the national capital to be allured by 
its evanescent and lightsome honors. When the 
opportunity sought me out none of its illusions 
appealed to me. But after a long uphill fight for 
personal and political recognition in Kentucky an 
election put a kind of seal upon the victory I had won 
and enabled me in a way to triumph over my 
enemies. I knew that if I accepted the nomination 
offered me I would get a big popular vote - as I 
did - and so, one full term, and half a term, 
incident to the death of the sitting member for the 
Louisville district being open to me, I took the short 
term, refusing the long term.</p>
            <p>Though it was midsummer and Congress was 
about to adjourn I went to Washington and was 
sworn in. A friend of mine, Col. Wake Holman, 
had made a bet with one of our pals I would be 
under arrest before I had been twenty-four hours 
in town, and won it. It happened in this wise: The 
night of the day when I took my seat there was an 
all-night session. I knew too well what that meant, 
and, just from a long tiresome journey, I went to 
bed and slept soundly till sunrise. Just as I was 
up and dressing for a stroll about the old, familiar,
<pb id="watterson23" n="23"/>
dearly loved quarter of the town there came an 
imperative rap upon the door and a voice said: “Get 
up, colonel, quick! This is a sergeant at arms. 
There has been a call of the House and I am after 
you. Everybody is drunk, more or less, and they 
are noisy to have some fun with you.”</p>
            <p>It was even as he said. Everybody, more or less, 
was drunk - especially the provisional speaker 
whom Mr. Randall had placed in the chair - and 
when we arrived and I was led a prisoner down the 
center aisle pandemonium broke loose.</p>
            <p>They had all sorts of fun with me, such as it was. 
It was moved that I be fined the full amount of my 
mileage. Then a resolution was offered suspending 
my membership and sending me under guard 
to the old Capitol prison. Finally two or three of 
my friends rescued me and business was allowed to 
proceed. It was the last day of a very long session 
and those who were not drunk were worn out.</p>
            <p>When I returned home there was a celebration 
in honor of the bet Wake Holman had won at my 
expense. Wake was the most attractive and lovable 
of men, by nature a hero, by profession a “filibuster” 
and soldier of fortune. At two and twenty he 
was a private in Col. Humphrey Marshall's Regiment
<pb id="watterson24" n="24"/>
of Kentucky Riflemen, which reached the 
scene of hostilities upon the Rio Grande in the 
midsummer of 1846. He had enlisted from Owen 
county - “Sweet Owen,” as it used to be called - 
and came of good stock, his father, Col. Harry Holman, 
in the days of aboriginal fighting and journalism, 
a frontier celebrity. Wake's company, out on 
a scout, was picked off by the Mexicans, and the 
distinction between United States soldiers and Texan 
rebels not being yet clearly established, a drumhead 
court-martial ordered “the decimation.”</p>
            <p>This was a decree that one of every ten of the 
Yankee captives should be shot. There being a 
hundred of Marshall's men, one hundred beans -  
ninety white and ten black - were put in a hat. 
Then the company was mustered as on dress 
parade. Whoso drew a white bean was to be held 
prisoner of war; whoso drew a black bean was to 
die.</p>
            <p>In the early part of the drawing Wake drew a 
white bean. Toward the close the turn of a neighbor 
and comrade from Owen county who had left 
a wife and baby at home was called. He and Wake 
were standing together, Holman brushed him 
aside, walked out in his place and drew his bean. It
<pb id="watterson25" n="25"/>
turned out to be a white one. Twice within the 
half hour death had looked him in the eye and 
found no blinking there.</p>
            <p>I have seen quite a deal of hardihood, endurance, 
suffering, in both women and men; splendid courage 
on the field of action; perfect self-possession in 
the face of danger; but I rather think that Wake 
Holman's exploit that day - next to actually dying 
for a friend, what can be nobler than being willing 
to die for him? - is the bravest thing I know or have 
ever been told of mortal man.</p>
            <p>Wake Holman went to Cuba in the Lopez 
Rebellion of 1851, and fought under Pickett at the 
Battle of Cardenas. In 1855-56 he was in 
Nicaragua, with Walker. He commanded a Kentucky 
regiment of cavalry on the Union side in our War 
of Sections. After the war he lived the life of a 
hunter and fisher at his home in Kentucky; a 
cheery, unambitious, big-brained and big-hearted 
cherub, whom it would not do to “projeck” with, 
albeit with entire safety you could pick his pocket; 
the soul of simplicity and amiability.</p>
            <p>To have known him was an education in primal 
manhood. To sit at his hospitable board, with him 
at the head of the table, was an inspiration in the 
<pb id="watterson26" n="26"/>
genius of life and the art of living. One of his 
familiars started the joke that when Wake drew 
the second white bean “he got a peep.” He took it 
kindly; though in my intimacy with him, extending 
over thirty years, I never heard him refer to any 
of his adventures as a soldier.</p>
            <p>It was not possible that such a man should provide 
for his old age. He had little forecast. He 
knew not the value of money. He had humor, 
affection and courage. I held him in real love and 
honor. When the Mexican War Pension Act was 
passed by Congress I took his papers to General 
Black, the Commissioner of Pensions, and related 
this story.</p>
            <p>“I have promised Gen. Cerro Gordo Williams,” 
said General Black, referring to the then senior 
United States Senator from Kentucky, “that his 
name shall go first on the roll of these Mexican 
pensioners. But” - and the General looked beamingly 
in my face, a bit tearful, and says he: “Wake 
Holman's name shall come right after.” And there 
it is.</p>

            <p>I was very carefully and for those times not
ignorantly taught in music. Schell, his name was,
		
<pb id="watterson27" n="27"/>
and they called him “Professor.” He lived over 
in Georgetown, where he had organized a little 
group of Prussian refugees into a German club, 
and from my tenth to my fifteenth year - at first 
regularly, and then in a desultory way as I came 
back to Washington City from my school in 
Philadelphia, be hammered Bach and Handel and 
Mozart - nothing so modern as Mendelssohn - into my 
not unwilling nor unreceptive mind, for my bent 
was in the beginning to compose dramas, and in 
the end operas.</p>
            <p>Adelina Patti was among my child companions. 
Once in the national capital, when I was 12 years 
old and Adelina 9, we played together at a charity 
concert. She had sung “The Last Rose of Summer,” 
and I had played her brother-in-law's variation 
upon “Home, Sweet Home.” The audience 
was enthusiastic. We were called out again and 
again. Then we came on the stage together, and 
the applause increasing I sat down at the keyboard 
and played an accompaniment with my own 
interpolations upon “Old Folks At Home,” which I had 
taught Adelina, and she sang the words. Then 
they fairly took the roof off.</p>
            <p>Once during a sojourn in Paris I was thrown 
<pb id="watterson28" n="28"/>
with Christine Nilsson. She was in the heyday of 
her success at the Theater Lyrique under the 
patronage of Madame Miolan-Carvalho. One day 
I said to her: “The time may come when you will 
be giving concerts.” She was indignant. “Nevertheless,” 
I continued, “let me teach you a sure encore.” 
I played her Stephen Foster's immortal 
ditty. She was delighted. The sequel was that it 
served her even a better turn than it had served 
Adelina Patti.</p>
            <p>I played and transposed for the piano most of 
the melodies of Foster as they were published, they 
being first produced in public by Christy's 
Minstrels.</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>IV</head>
            <p>Stephen Foster was the ne'er-do-well of a good 
Pennsylvania family. A sister of his had married 
a brother of James Buchanan. There were two 
daughters of this marriage, nieces of the President, 
and when they were visiting the White House we 
had - shall I dare write it? - high jinks with our 
nigger-minstrel concerts on the sly.</p>
            <p>Will S. Hays, the rival of Foster as a song writer 
and one of my reporters on the Courier-Journal, 
<pb id="watterson29" n="29"/>
told me this story: “Foster,” said he, “was a good 
deal of what you might call a barroom loafer. He 
possessed a sweet tenor voice before it was spoiled 
by drink, and was fond of music, though technically 
he knew nothing about it. He had a German friend 
who when he died left him a musical scrapbook, of 
all sorts of odds and ends of original text. There 
is where Foster got his melodies. When the scrapbook 
gave out he gave out.”</p>
            <p>I took it as merely the spleen of a rival composer. 
But many years after in Vienna I heard a concert 
given over exclusively to the performance of 
certain posthumous manuscripts of Schubert. Among 
the rest were selections from an unfinished opera -  
“Rosemonde,” I think it was called - in which the 
whole rhythm and movements and parts of the 
score of Old Folks at Home were the feature.</p>
            <p>It was something to have grown up contemporary, 
as it were, with these songs. Many of them 
were written in the old Rowan homestead, just 
outside of Bardstown, Ky., where Louis Philippe lived 
and taught, and for a season Talleyrand made his 
abode. The Rowans were notable people. John 
Rowan, the elder, head of the house, was a famous 
lawyer, who divided oratorical honors with Henry 
<pb id="watterson30" n="30"/>
Clay, and like Clay, was a Senator in Congress; 
his son, “young John,” as he was called, Stephen 
Foster's pal, went as minister to Naples, and fought 
duels, and was as Bob Acres wanted to be, “a devil 
of a fellow.” He once told me he had been intimate 
with Thackeray when they were wild young men in 
Paris, and that they had both of them known the 
woman whom Thackeray had taken for the original 
of Becky Sharp.</p>
            <p>The Foster songs quite captivated my boyhood. 
I could sing a little, as well as play, and learned 
each of them - especially Old Folks at Home and 
My Old Kentucky Home - as they appeared. Their 
contemporary vogue was tremendous. Nothing has 
since rivalled the popular impression they made, 
except perhaps the Arthur Sullivan melodies.</p>
            <p>Among my ambitions to be a great historian, 
dramatist, soldier and writer of romance I desired 
also to be a great musician, especially a great 
pianist. The bone-felon did the business for this 
later. But all my life I have been able to thumb 
the keyboard at least for the children to dance, and 
it has been a recourse and solace sometimes during 
intervals of embittered journalism and unprosperous 
statesmanship.</p>

            <p>Theodore Thomas and I used to play duos together. 
He was a master of the violin before he 
took to orchestration. We remained the best of 
friends to the end of his days.</p>
            <p>On the slightest provocation, or none, we passed 
entire nights together. Once after a concert he 
suddenly exclaimed: “Don't you think Wagner was 
a - fraud?”</p>
            <p>A little surprised even by one of his outbreaks, 
I said: “Wagner may have written some trick music 
but I hardly think that he was a fraud.”</p>
            <p>He reflected a moment. “Well,” he continued, 
“it may not lie in my mouth to say it - and perhaps 
I ought not to say it - I know I am most responsible 
for the Wagner craze - but I consider him a 
- fraud.”</p>
            <p>He had just come from a long “classic entertainment,” 
was worn out with travel and worry, and 
meant nothing of the sort.</p>
            <p>After a very tiresome concert when he was railing 
at the hard lines of a peripatetic musician I said: 
“Come with me and I will give you a soothing quail 
<pb id="watterson32" n="32"/>
and as dry a glass of champagne as you ever had in 
your life.”</p>
            <p>The wine was poured out and he took a sip.</p>
            <p>“I don't call that dry wine,” he crossly said, and 
took another sip. “My God,” without a pause he 
continued, “isn't that great?”</p>
            <p>Of course he was impulsive, even impetuous. 
Beneath his seeming cold exterior and admirable 
self-control - the discipline of the master artist - lay 
the moods and tenses of the musical temperament. 
He knew little or nothing outside of music and did 
not care to learn. I tried to interest him in politics. 
It was of no use. First he laughed my suggestions 
to scorn and then swore like a trooper. German he 
was, through and through. It was well that he 
passed away before the world war. Pat Gilmore 
- “Patrick Sarsfield,” we always called him - was a 
born politician, and if he had not been a musician 
he would have been a statesman. I kept the peace 
between him and Theodore Thomas by an ingenious 
system of telling all kinds of kind things each 
had said of the other, my “repetitions” being pure 
inventions of my own.</p>

<lb/>AND FRANK MASON - THE THREE MOUSQUTAIRES 
<lb/>OF CULTURE - PARIS - “THE FRENCHMAN”
<lb/>- THE SOUTH OF FRANCE</head>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>I</head>
            <p><emph rend="bold">I HAVE</emph> been of late reading The Education of 
Henry Adams, and it recalls many persons 
and incidents belonging to the period about which 
I am now writing. I knew Henry Adams well; 
first in London, then in Boston and finally throughout 
his prolonged residence in Washington City. 
He was an Adams; very definitely an Adams, but, 
though his ghost may revisit the glimpses of the 
moon and chide me for saying so, with an English 
“cut to his jib.”</p>
            <p>No three brothers could be more unlike than 
Charles Francis, John Quincy and Henry Adams. 
Brooks Adams I did not know. They represented 
<pb id="watterson34" n="34"/>
the fourth generation of the brainiest pedigree - 
that is in continuous line - known to our family 
history. Henry thought he was a philosopher and 
tried to be one. He thought he was a man of the 
world and wanted to be one. He was, in spite of 
himself, a provincial.</p>
            <p>Provincialism is not necessarily rustic, even 
suburban. There is no provincial quite so provincial 
as he who has passed his life in great cities. The 
Parisian boulevardier taken away from the asphalt, 
the cockney a little off Clapham Common and the 
Strand, is lost. Henry Adams knew his London 
and his Paris, his Boston and his Quiney - we must 
not forget Quincy - well. But he had been born, 
and had grown up, between the lids of history, and 
for all his learning and travel he never got very 
far outside them.</p>
            <p>In manner and manners, tone and cast of thought 
he was English - delightfully English - though he 
cultivated the cosmopolite. His house in the 
national capital, facing the Executive Mansion across 
Lafayette Square - especially during the life of his 
wife, an adorable woman, who made up in sweetness 
and tact for some of the qualities lacking in 
her husband - was an intellectual and high-bred
<pb id="watterson35" n="35"/>
center, a rendezvous for the best ton and the most 
accepted people. The Adamses may be said to have 
succeeded the Eameses as leaders in semi-social, 
semi-literary and semi-political society.</p>
            <p>There was a trio - I used to call them the Three
Musketeers of Culture - John Hay, Henry Cabot 
Lodge and Henry Adams. They made an interesting 
and inseparable trinity - Caleb Cushing, Robert 
J. Walker and Charles Sumner not more so - and 
it was worth while to let them have the floor and to 
hear them talk; Lodge, cool and wary as a politician 
should be; Hay, helterskelter, the real man of 
the world crossed on a Western stock; and Adams, 
something of a <foreign lang="fr">litératteur</foreign>, a statesman and a cynic.</p>
            <p>John Randolph Tucker, who when he was in Congress 
often met Henry at dinners and the like, said 
to him on the appearance of the early volumes of 
his History of the United States: “I am not 
disappointed, for how could an Adams be expected 
to do justice to a Randolph?”</p>
            <p>While he was writing this history Adams said to 
me: “There is an old villain - next to Andrew 
Jackson the greatest villain of his time - a 
Kentuckian - don't say he was a kinsman of yours! - 
whose papers, if he left any, I want to see.”</p>
            <pb id="watterson36" n="36"/>
            <p>“To whom are you referring?” I asked with mock 
dignity.</p>
            <p>“To John Adair,” he answered.</p>
            <p>“Well,” said I, “John Adair married my grandmother's 
sister and I can put you in the way of 
getting whatever you require.”</p>
            <p>I have spoken of John Hay as Master of the 
Revels in the old Sutherland-Delmonico days. 
Even earlier than that - in London and Paris - an 
intimacy had been established between us. He 
married in Cleveland, Ohio, and many years passed 
before I came up with him again. One day in Whitelaw 
Reid's den in the Tribune Building he reappeared, 
strangely changed - no longer the rosy-cheeked, 
buoyant boy - an overserious, prematurely 
old man. I was shocked, and when he had gone 
Reid, observing this, said: “Oh, Hay will come 
round all right. He is just now in one of his moods. 
I picked him up in Piccadilly the other day and by 
sheer force brought him over.”</p>
            <p>When we recall the story of Hay's life - one 
weird tragedy after another, from the murder of 
Lincoln to the murder of McKinley, including the 
tragic end of two members of his immediate family 
<pb id="watterson37" n="37"/>
- there rises in spite of the grandeur that pursued 
him a single exclamation: “The pity of it!”</p>
            <p>This is accentuated by Henry Adams' Education. 
Yet the silent courage with which Hay met 
disaster after disaster must increase both the 
sympathy and the respect of those who peruse the 
melancholy pages of that vivid narrative. Toward 
the end, meeting him on a public occasion, I said: 
“You work too hard - you are not looking well.”</p>
            <p>“I am dying,” said he.</p>
            <p>“Yes,” I replied in the way of banter, “you are 
dying of fame and fortune.”</p>
            <p>But I went no further. He was in no mood for 
the old verbal horseplay.</p>
            <p>He looked wan and wizened. Yet there were 
still several years before him. When he came from 
Mannheim to Paris it was clear that the end was 
nigh. I did not see him - he was too ill to see any 
one - but Frank Mason kept me advised from day 
to day, and when, a month or two later, having 
reached home, the news came to us that he was dead 
we were nowise surprised, and almost consoled by 
the thought that rest had come at last.</p>
            <p>Frank Mason and his wife - “the Masons,” they 
were commonly called, for Mrs. Mason made a 
<pb id="watterson38" n="38"/>
wondrous second to her husband - were from Cleveland, 
Ohio, she a daughter of Judge Birchard -  
Jennie Birchard - he a rising young journalist 
caught in the late seventies by the glitter of a 
foreign appointment. They ran the gamut of the 
consular service, beginning with Basel and Marseilles 
and ending with Frankfurt, Berlin and Paris. 
Wherever they were their house was a very home 
- a kind of Yankee shrine - of visiting Americans 
and militant Americanism.</p>
            <p>Years before he was made consul general - in 
point of fact when he was plain consul at Marseilles 
- he ran over to Paris for a lark. One day he said 
to me, “A rich old hayseed uncle of mine has come 
to town. He has money to burn and he wants to 
meet you. I have arranged for us to dine with him 
at the Anglaise to-night and we are to order the 
dinner - <foreign lang="fr">carte blanche</foreign>.” The rich old uncle to whom 
I was presented did not have the appearance of a 
hayseed. On the contrary he was a most 
distinguished-looking old gentleman. The dinner we 
ordered was “stunning” - especially the wines. 
When the bill was presented our host scanned it 
carefully, scrutinizing each item and making his 
own addition, altogether “like a thoroughbred.” 
<pb id="watterson39" n="39"/>
Frank and I watched him not without a bit of 
anxiety mixed with contrition. When he had paid 
the score he said with a smile: “That was rather a 
steep bill, but we have had rather a good dinner, 
and now, if you boys know of as good a dance hall 
we'll go there and I'll buy the outfit.”</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>II</head>
            <p>First and last I have lived much in the erstwhile 
gay capital of France. It was gayest when the 
Duke de Morny flourished as King of the Bourse. 
He was reputed the Emperor's natural half-brother. 
The breakdown of the Mexican adventure, 
which was mostly his, contributed not a little 
to the final Napoleonic fall. He died of dissipation 
and disappointment, and under the pseudonym of 
the Duke de Morra, Daudet celebrated him in 
“The Nabob.”</p>
            <p>De Morny did not live to see the tumble of the 
house of cards he had built. Next after I saw Paris 
it was a pitiful wreck indeed; the Hotel de Ville and 
the Tuileries in flames; the Column gone from the 
Place Vendôme; but later the rise of the Third 
Republic saw the revival of the unquenchable spirit 
of the irrepressible French.</p>
            <pb id="watterson40" n="40"/>
            <p>Nevertheless I should scarcely be taken for a 
Parisian. Once, when wandering aimlessly, as one 
so often does through the Paris streets, one of the 
touts hanging round the Café de la Paix to catch 
the unwary stranger being a little more importunate 
than usual, I ordered him to go about his business.</p>
            <p>“This is my business,” he impudently answered.</p>
            <p>“Get away, I tell you!” I thundered, “I am a 
Parisian myself!”</p>
            <p>He drew a little out of reach of the umbrella I 
held in my hand, and with a drawl of supreme and 
very American contempt, exclaimed, “Well, you 
don't look it,” and scampered off.</p>
            <p>Paris, however, is not all of France. Sometimes 
I have thought not the best part of it. There is the 
south of France, with Avignon, the heart of Provence, 
seat of the French papacy six hundred years 
ago, the metropolis of Christendom before the Midi 
was a region - Paris yet a village, and Rome struggling 
out of the débris of the ages - with Arles and 
Nîmes, and, above all, Tarascon, the home of the 
immortal Tartarin, for next-door neighbors. They 
are all hard by Marseilles. But Avignon ever most
<pb id="watterson41" n="41"/>
caught my fancy, for there the nights seem peopled 
with the ghosts of warriors and cardinals, and there 
on festal mornings the spirits of Petrarch and his 
Laura walk abroad, the ramparts, which bade 
defiance to Goth and Vandal and Saracen hordes, 
now giving shelter to bats and owls, but the 
atmosphere laden with legend</p>
            <lb/>
            <p>
              <hi rend="italics">“. . . tasting of Flora and the country green,
Dance and Provençal song and sun-burnt mirth.”</hi>
            </p>
            <lb/>
            <p>Something too much of this! Let me not yield 
to the spell of the picturesque. To recur to matters 
of fact and get down to prose and the times we 
live in let us halt a moment on this southerly 
journey and have a look in upon Lyons, the 
industrial capital of France, which is directly on the 
way.</p>
            <p>The idiosyncrasy of Lyons is silk. There are two 
schools of introduction in the art of silk weaving, 
one of them free to any lad in the city, the other 
requiring a trifle of matriculation. The first of these 
witnesses the whole process of fabrication from the 
reeling of threads to the finishing of dress goods,
<pb id="watterson42" n="42"/>
and the loom painting of pictures. It is most 
interesting of course, the painstaking its most obvious 
feature, the individual weaver living with his 
family upon a wage representing the cost of the 
barest necessities of life. Again, and ever and ever 
again, the inequalities of fortune! Where will it 
end?</p>
            <p>The world has tried revolution and it has tried 
anarchy. Always the survival of the strong, 
nicknamed by Spencer and his ilk the “fittest.” Ten 
thousand heads were chopped off during the Terror 
in France to make room for whom? Not for the 
many, but the few; though it must be allowed that 
in some ways the conditions were improved.</p>
            <p>Yet here after a hundred years, here in Lyons, 
faithful, intelligent men struggle for sixty, for 
forty cents a day, with never a hope beyond! What 
is to be done about it? Suppose the wealth of the 
universe were divided per capita, how long would 
it remain out of the clutches of the Napoleons of 
finance, only a percentage of whom find ultimately 
their Waterloo, little to the profit of the poor who 
spin and delve, who fight and die, in the Grand 
Army of the Wretched!</p>

            <head>III</head>
            <p>We read a deal that is amusing about the 
southerly Frenchman. He is indeed <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">sui generis</foreign></hi>. 
Some five and twenty years ago there appeared in 
Louisville a dapper gentleman, who declared 
himself a Marseillais, and who subsequently came to be 
known variously as The Major and The Frenchman. 
I shall not mention him otherwise in this 
veracious chronicle, but, looking through the city 
directory of Marseilles I found an entire page 
devoted to his name, though all the entries may not 
have been members of his family. There is no doubt 
that he was a Marseillais.</p>
            <p>Wandering through the streets of the old city, 
now in a café of La Cannebièere and now along a 
quay of the Old Port, his ghost has often crossed 
my path and dogged my footsteps, though he has 
lain in his grave this many a day. I grew to know 
him very well, to be first amused by him, then to be 
interested, and in the end to entertain an affection 
for him.</p>
            <p>The Major was a delightful composite of 
Tartarin of Tarascon and the Brigadier Gerard, with 
a dash of the Count of Monte Cristo; for when he
<pb id="watterson44" n="44"/>
was flush - which by some odd coincidence happened 
exactly four times a year - he was as liberal 
a spendthrift as one could wish to meet anywhere 
between the little principality of Monaco and the 
headwaters of the Nile; transparent as a child; 
idiosyncratic to a degree.</p>
            <p>I understand Marseilles better and it has always 
seemed nearer to me since he was born there and 
lived there when a boy, and, I much fear me, was 
driven away, the scapegrace of excellent and 
wealthy people; not, I feel sure, for any offense 
that touched the essential parts of his manhood. A 
gentler, a more upright and harmless creature I 
never knew in all my life.</p>
            <p>I very well recall when he first arrived in the 
Kentucky metropolis. His attire and raiment were 
faultless. He wore a rose in his coat, he carried a 
delicate cane, and a most beautiful woman hung 
upon his arm. She was his wife. It was a circumstance 
connected with this lady which led to the 
after intimacy between him and me. She fell 
dangerously ill. I had casually met her husband as an 
all-round man-about-town, and by this token, seeking 
sympathy on lines of least resistance, he came 
to me with his sorrow.</p>
            <pb id="watterson45" n="45"/>
            <p>I have never seen grief more real and fervid. He 
swore, on his knees and with tears in his eyes, that 
if she recovered, if God would give her back to him, 
he would never again touch a card; for gambling 
was his passion, and even among amateurs he would 
have been accounted the softest of soft things. His 
prayer was answered, she did recover, and he 
proceeded to fulfill his vow.</p>
            <p>But what was he to do? He had been taught, 
or at least he had learned, to do nothing, not even 
to play poker! I suggested that as running a 
restaurant was a French prerogative and that as 
he knew less about cooking than about anything else 
- we had had a contest or two over the mysteries of 
a pair of chafing dishes - and as there was not a 
really good eating place in Louisville, he should set 
up a restaurant. It was said rather in jest than in 
earnest; but I was prepared to lend him the money. 
The next thing I knew, and without asking for a 
dollar, he had opened The Brunswick.</p>
            <p>In those days I saw the Courier-Journal to press, 
turning night into day, and during a dozen years I 
took my twelve o'clock supper there. It was thus 
and from these beginnings that the casual acquaintance 
between us ripened into intimacy, and that I 
<pb id="watterson46" n="46"/>
gradually came into a knowledge of the reserves 
behind The Major's buoyant optimism and occasional 
gasconnade.</p>
            <p>He ate and drank sparingly; but he was not proof 
against the seduction of good company, and he had 
plenty of it, from William Preston to Joseph 
Jefferson, with such side lights as Stoddard Johnston, 
Boyd Winchester, Isaac Caldwell and Proctor 
Knott, of the Home Guard - very nearly all the 
celebrities of the day among the outsiders - myself 
the humble witness and chronicler. He secured an 
excellent chef, and of course we lived exceedingly 
well.</p>
            <p>The Major's most obvious peculiarity was that 
he knew everything and had been everywhere. If 
pirates were mentioned he flowered out at once into 
an adventure upon the sea; if bandits, on the land. 
If it was Wall Street he had a reminiscence and a 
scheme; if gambling, a hard-luck story and a 
system. There was no quarter of the globe of which 
he had not been an inhabitant.</p>
            <p>Once the timbered riches of Africa being mentioned, 
at once the Major gave us a most graphic 
account of how “the old house” - for thus he 
designated some commercial establishment, which either
<pb id="watterson47" n="47"/>
had no existence or which he had some reason for 
not more particularly indicating - had sent him in 
charge of a rosewood saw mill on the Ganges, and, 
after many ups and downs, of how the floods had 
come and swept the plant away; and Rudolph Fink, 
who was of the party, immediately said, “I can 
attest the truth of The Major's story, because my 
brother Albert and I were in charge of some fishing 
camps at the mouth of the Ganges at the exact date 
of the floods, and we caught many of those rosewood 
logs in our nets as they floated out to sea.”</p>
            <p>Augustine's Terrapin came to be for a while the 
rage in Philadelphia, and even got as far as New 
York and Washington, and straightway, The Major 
declared he could and would make Augustine 
and his terrapin look “like a monkey.” He 
proposed to give a dinner.</p>
            <p>There were great preparations and expectancy. 
None of us ate much at luncheon that day. At the 
appointed hour, we assembled at The Brunswick. 
I will dismiss the decorations and the preludes 
except to say that they were Parisian. After a while 
in full regalia The Major appeared, a train of 
servants following with a silver tureen. The lid was 
lifted.</p>
            <pb id="watterson48" n="48"/>
            <p><hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">“Voilà!”</foreign></hi> says he.</p>
            <p>The vision disclosed to our startled eyes was an 
ocean that looked like bean soup flecked by a few 
strands of black crape!</p>
            <p>The explosion duly arrived from the assembled 
gourmets, I, myself, I am sorry to say, leading the 
rebellion.</p>
            <p>“I put seeks terrapin in zat soup!” exclaimed 
The Frenchman, quite losing his usual good English 
in his excitement.</p>
            <p>We reproached him. We denounced him. He 
was driven from the field. But he bore us no malice. 
Ten days later he invited us again, and this time 
Sam Ward himself could have found no fault with 
the terrapin.</p>
            <p>Next afternoon, when I knew The Major was 
asleep, I slipped back into the kitchen and said to 
Louis Garnier, the chef: “Is there any of that 
terrapin left over from last night?”</p>
            <p>All unconscious of his treason Louis took me into 
the pantry and triumphantly showed me three jars 
bearing the Augustine label and the Philadelphia 
express tags!</p>
            <p>On another occasion a friend of The Major's, 
passing The Brunswick and observing some 
<figure id="figure2" entity="watter48"><p>HENRY WOODFIN GRADY<lb/>ONE OF MR. WATTERSON'S “BOYS”,</p></figure>
<pb id="watterson49" n="49"/>
diamond-back shells in the window said, “Major, have 
you any real live terrapins?”</p>
            <p>“Live!” cried The Frenchman. “Only this morning 
I open the ice box and they were all dancing 
the cancan.”</p>
            <p>“Major,” persisted the friend, “I'll go you a 
bottle of Veuve Cliquot, you cannot show me an 
actual living terrapin.”</p>
            <p>“What do you take me for - confidence man?” 
The Major retorted. “How you expect an old 
sport like me to bet upon a certainty?”</p>
            <p>“Never mind your ethics. The wager is drink, 
not money. In any event we shall have the wine.”</p>
            <p>“Oh, well,” says The Frenchman, with a shrug 
and a droll grimace, “if you insist on paying for a 
bottle of wine come with me.”</p>
            <p>He took a lighted candle, and together they went 
back to the ice box. It was literally filled with 
diamond backs, and my friend thought he was gone 
for sure.</p>
            <p>“Là!” says The Major with triumph, rummaging 
among the mass of shells with his cane as he 
held the candle aloft.</p>
            <p>“But,” says my friend, ready to surrender, yet 
<pb id="watterson50" n="50"/>
taking a last chance, “you told me they were 
dancing the cancan!”</p>
            <p>The Major picked up a terrapin and turned it 
over in his hand. Quite numb and frozen, the 
animal within made no sign. Then he stirred the 
shells about in the box with his cane. Still not a 
show of life. Of a sudden he stopped, reflected a 
moment, then looked at his watch.</p>
            <p>“Ah,” he murmured. “I quite forget. The terrapin, 
they are asleep. It is ten-thirty, and the terrapin 
he regularly go to sleep at ten o'clock by the 
watch every night.” And without another word he 
reached for the Veuve Cliquot!</p>
            <p>For all his volubility in matters of romance and 
sentiment The Major was exceeding reticent about 
his immediate self and his own affairs. His legends 
referred to the distant of time and place. A certain 
dignity could not be denied him, and, on occasion, 
a proper reserve; be rarely mentioned his business 
- though he worked like a slave, and could not have 
been making much or any profit - so that there rose 
the query how he contrived to make both ends meet. 
Little by little I came into the knowledge that there 
was a money supply from somewhere; finally, it 
matters not how, that he had an annuity of forty 
<pb id="watterson51" n="51"/>
thousand francs, paid in quarterly installments of 
ten thousand francs each.</p>
            <p>Occasionally he mentioned “the Old House,” and 
in relating the famous Sophonisba, episode late at 
night, and only in the very fastnesses of the wine 
cellar, as it were, at the most lachrymose passage 
he spoke of “l'Oncle Célestin,” with the deepest 
feeling.</p>
            <p>“Did you ever hear The Frenchman tell that 
story about Sophonisba?” Doctor Stoic, whom on 
account of his affectation of insensibility we were 
wont to call Old Adamant, once asked me. “Well, 
sir, the other night he told it to me, and he was 
drunk, and he cried, sir; and I was drunk, and I 
cried too!”</p>
            <p>I had known The Frenchman now ten or a dozen 
years. That he came from Marseilles, that he had 
served on the Confederate side in the Trans-Mississippi, 
that he possessed an annuity, that he 
must have been well-born and reared, that he was 
simple, yet canny, and in his money dealings 
scrupulously honest - was all I could be sure of. What 
had he done to be ashamed about or wish to conceal? 
In what was he a black sheep, for that he 
had been one seemed certain? Had the beautiful 
<pb id="watterson52" n="52"/>
woman, his wife - a tireless church and charity 
worker, who lived the life of a recluse and a saint - 
had she reclaimed him from his former self? I 
knew that she had been the immediate occasion of 
his turning over a new leaf. But before her time 
what had he been, what had he done?</p>
            <p>Late one night, when the rain was falling and the
streets were empty, I entered The Brunswick. It 
was empty too. In the farthest corner of the little 
dining room The Major, his face buried in his 
hands, laid upon the table in front of him, sat 
silently weeping. He did not observe my entrance 
and I seated myself on the opposite side of the 
table. Presently he looked up, and seeing me, without 
a word passed me a letter which, all blistered 
with tears, had brought him to this distressful state. 
It was a formal French burial summons, with its 
long list of family names - his among the rest - 
the envelope, addressed in a lady's hand - his 
sister's, the wife of a nobleman in high military 
command - the postmark “Lyon.” Uncle Célestin was 
dead.</p>
            <p>Thereafter The Frenchman told me much which 
I may not recall and must not repeat; for, included 
in that funeral list were some of the best names in
<pb id="watterson53" n="53"/>
France, Uncle Célestin himself not the least of 
them.</p>
            <p>At last he died, and as mysteriously as he had 
come his body was taken away, nobody knew when, 
nobody where, and with it went the beautiful 
woman, his wife, of whom from that day to this I 
have never heard a word.</p>

            <p><emph rend="bold">EACH</emph> of the generations thinks itself 
commonplace. Familiarity breeds equally 
indifference and contempt. Yet no age of the world 
has witnessed so much of the drama of life - of the 
romantic and picturesque - as the age we live in. 
The years betwixt Agincourt and Waterloo were 
not more delightfully tragic than the years between 
Serajevo and Senlis.</p>
            <p>The gay capital of France remains the center of 
the stage and retains the interest of the onlooking 
universe. All roads lead to Paris as all roads led to 
Rome. In Dickens' day “a tale of two cities” could 
only mean London and Paris then, and ever so 
unalike. To be brought to date the title would have 
now to read “three,” or even “four,” cities, New 
<pb id="watterson55" n="55"/>
York and Chicago putting in their claims for 
mundane recognition.</p>
            <p>I have been not only something of a traveller, but 
a diligent student of history and a voracious novel 
reader, and, once-in-a-while, I get my history and 
my fiction mixed. This has been especially the case 
when the hum-drum of the Boulevards has driven 
me from the fascinations of the Beau Quartier into 
the by-ways of the Marais and the fastnesses of 
what was once the Latin Quarter. More than fifty 
years of intimacy have enabled me to learn many 
things not commonly known, among them that 
Paris is the most orderly and moral city in the 
world, except when, on rare and brief occasions, it 
has been stirred to its depths.</p>
            <p>I have crossed the ocean many times - have lived, 
not sojourned, on the banks of the Seine, and, as I 
shall never see the other side again - do not want to 
see it in its time of sorrow and garb of mourning - 
I may be forgiven a retrospective pause in this 
egotistic chronicle. Or, shall I not say, a word or 
two of affectionate retrogression, though perchance 
it leads me after the manner of Silas Wegg to drop 
into poetry and take a turn with a few ghosts into 
certain of their haunts, when you, dear sir, or
<pb id="watterson56" n="56"/>
madame, or miss, as the case may be, and I were 
living that “other life,” whereof we remember so 
little that we cannot recall who we were, or what 
name we went by, howbeit now-and-then we get a 
glimpse in dreams, or a “hunch” from the world of 
spirits, or spirts-and-water, which makes us fancy 
we might have been Julius Cæsar, or Cleopatra - 
as maybe we were! - or at least Joan of Arc, or 
Jean Valjean!</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>II</head>
            <p>Let me repeat that upon no spot of earth has the 
fable we call existence had so rare a setting and 
rung up its curtain upon such a succession of 
performances; has so concentrated human attention 
upon mundane affairs; has called such a muster roll 
of stage favorites; has contributed to romance so 
many heroes and heroines, to history so many signal
episodes and personal exploits, to philosophy so 
much to kindle the craving for vital knowledge, to
stir sympathy and to awaken reflection.</p>
            <p>Greece and Rome seem but myths of an Age of 
Fable. They live for us as pictures live, as statues 
live. What was it I was saying about statues - 
that they all look alike to me? There are too many 
<pb id="watterson57" n="57"/>
of them. They bring the ancients down to us in 
marble and bronze, not in flesh and blood. We do 
not really laugh with Terence and Horace, nor weep 
with Æschylus and Homer. The very nomenclature 
has a ticket air like tags on a collection of 
curios in an auction room, droning the dull iteration 
of a catalogue. There is as little to awaken and 
inspire in the system of religion and ethics of the 
pagan world they lived in as in the eyes of the stone 
effigies that stare blankly upon us in the British 
Museum, the Uffizi and the Louvre.</p>
            <p>We walk the streets of the Eternal City with 
wonderment, not with pity, the human side quite 
lost in the archaic. What is Cæsar to us, or we to 
Cæsar? Jove's thunder no longer terrifies, and we 
look elsewhere than the Medici Venus for the lights 
o' love.</p>
            <p>Not so with Paris. There the unbroken line of 
five hundred years - semi-modern years, marking a 
longer period than we commonly ascribe to Athens 
or Rome - beginning with the exit of this our own 
world from the dark ages into the partial light of 
the middle ages, and continuing thence through the 
struggle of man toward achievement - tells us a tale 
more consecutive and thrilling, more varied and
<pb id="watterson58" n="58"/>
instructive, than may be found in all the pages of all 
the chroniclers and poets of the civilizations which 
vibrated between the Bosphorus and the Tiber, to 
yield at last to triumphant Barbarism swooping 
down from Tyrol crag and Alpine height, from the 
fastnesses of the Rhine and the Rhone, to swallow 
luxury and culture. Refinement had done its 
perfect work. It had emasculated man and unsexed 
woman and brought her to the front as a political 
force, even as it is trying to do now.</p>
            <p>The Paris of Balzac and Dumas, of De Musset 
and Hugo - even of Thackeray - could still be seen 
when I first went there. Though our age is as full 
of all that makes for the future of poetry and 
romance, it does not contemporaneously lend itself 
to sentimental abstraction. Yet it is hard to 
separate fact and fiction here; to decide between the 
true and the false; to pluck from the haze with 
which time has enveloped them, and to distinguish 
the puppets of actual flesh and blood who lived and 
moved and had their being, and the phantoms of 
imagination called into life and given each its local 
habitation and its name by the poet's pen working 
its immemorial spell upon the reader's credulity.</p>
            <p>To me D'Artagnan is rather more vital than 
<pb id="watterson59" n="59"/>
Richelieu. Hugo's imps and Balzac's bullies dance 
down the stage and shut from the view the tax-collectors 
and the court favorites. The mousquetaires 
crowd the field marshals off the scene. There is 
something real in Quasimodo, in Cæsar de Birotteau, 
in Robert Macaire, something mythical in 
Mazarin, in the Regent and in Jean Lass. Even 
here, in faraway Kentucky, I can shut my eyes and 
see the Lady of Dreams as plainly as if she were 
coming out of the Bristol or the Ritz to step into 
her automobile, while the Grande Mademoiselle is 
merely a cloud of clothes and words that for me
mean nothing at all.</p>
            <p>I once passed a week, day by day, roaming through
the Musée Carnavalet. Madame de Sévigné had
an apartment and held her salon there for nearly
twenty years. Hard by is the house where the
Marquise de Brinvilliers - a gentle, blue-eyed thing
they tell us - a poor, insane creature she must have
been - disseminated poison and death, and, just
across and beyond the Place des Vosges, the Hotel
de Sens, whither Queen Margot took her doll-rags
and did her spriting after she and Henri Quatre
had agreed no longer to slide down the same cellar
door. There is in the Museum a death-mask, colored
<pb id="watterson60" n="60"/>
and exceeding life-like, taken the day after
Ravaillac delivered the finishing knife-thrust in the 
Rue de Ferronnerie, which represents the Bèarnais 
as anything but a tamer of hearts. He was a 
fighter, however, from Wayback, and I dare say 
Dumas' narrative is quite as authentic as any.</p>
            <p>One can scarce wonder that men like Hugo, and
Balzac chose this quarter of the town to live in - 
and Rachael, too! - it having given such frequent
shelter to so many of their fantastic creations, 
having been the real abode of a train of gallants and
bravos, of saints and harlots from the days of Diane
de Poitiers to the days of Pompadour and du
Barry, and of statesmen and prelates likewise from
Sully to Necker, from Colbert to Turgot.</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>III</head>
            <p>I speak of the Marais as I might speak of Madison 
Square, or Hyde Park - as a well-known local 
section - yet how few Americans who have gone to 
Paris have ever heard of it. It is in the eastern 
division of the town. One finds it a curious circumstance 
that so many if not most of the great cities
<pb id="watterson61" n="61"/>
somehow started with the rising, gradually to 
migrate toward the setting sun.</p>
            <p>When I first wandered about Paris there was little 
west of the Arch of Stars except groves and 
meadows. Neuilly and Passy were distant villages. 
Auteuil was a safe retreat for lovers and debtors, 
with comic opera villas nestled in high-walled 
gardens. To Auteuil Armand Duval and his Camille 
hied away for their short-lived idyl. In those days 
there was a lovely lane called Marguerite Gautier, 
with a dovecote pointed out as the very “rustic 
dwelling” so pathetically sung in Verdi's tuneful 
score and tenderly described in the original Dumas 
text. The Boulevard Montmorenci long ago 
plowed the shrines of romance out of the knowledge 
of the living, and a part of the Longchamps racecourse 
occupies the spot whither impecunious poets 
and adventure-seeking wives repaired to escape the 
insistence of cruel bailiffs and the spies of suspicious 
and monotonous husbands.</p>
            <p><foreign lang="la">Tempus fugit</foreign>! I used to read Thackeray's Paris 
Sketches with a kind of awe. The Thirties and the 
Forties, reincarnated and inspired by his glowing 
spirit, seemed clad in translucent garments, like the 
figures in the Nibelungenlied, weird, remote, glorified.
<pb id="watterson62" n="62"/>
I once lived in the street “for which no rhyme 
our language yields,” next door to a pastry shop 
that claimed to have furnished the <foreign lang="fr">mise en scène</foreign> 
for the “Ballad of Bouillabaisse,” and I often 
followed the trail of Louis Dominic Cartouche “down 
that lonely and crooked byway that, setting forth 
from a palace yard, led finally to the rear gate of 
a den of thieves.” Ah, well-a-day! I have known 
my Paris now twice as long as Thackeray knew his 
Paris, and my Paris has been as interesting as his 
Paris, for it includes the Empire, the Siege and the 
Republic.</p>
            <p>I knew and sat for months at table with Comtesse 
Walewska, widow of the bastard son of Napoleon 
Bonaparte. The Duke de Morny was rather a person 
in his way and Gambetta was no slouch, as 
Titmarsh would himself agree. I knew them both. 
The Mexican scheme, which was going to make 
every Frenchman rich, was even more picturesque 
and tragical than the Mississippi bubble. There 
were lively times round about the last of the Sixties 
and the early Seventies. The Terror lasted longer, 
but it was not much more lurid than the Commune; 
the Hotel de Ville and the Tuileries in flames, the 
column gone from the Place Vendôme, when I got
<pb id="watterson63" n="63"/>
there just after the siege. The regions of the 
beautiful Opera House and of the venerable Notre 
Dame they told me had been but yesterday running 
streams of blood. At the corner of the Rue 
de la Paix and the Rue Daunou (they called it 
then the Rue St. Augustine) thirty men, women, 
and boys were one forenoon stood against the wall 
and shot, volley upon volley, to death. In the 
Sacristy of the Cathedral over against the Morgue 
and the Hotel Dieu, they exhibit the gore-stained 
vestments of three archbishops of Paris murdered 
within as many decades.</p>

            <p>Thackeray came to Paris when a very young 
man. He was for painting pictures, not for writing 
books, and he retained his artistic yearnings if 
not ambitions long after he had become a great and 
famous man of letters. It was in Paris that he 
married his wife, and in Paris that the melancholy 
finale came to pass; one of the most heartbreaking 
chapters in literary history.</p>
            <p>His little girls lived here with their grandparents. 
The elder of them relates how she was once taken 
<pb id="watterson64" n="64"/>
up some flights of stairs by the Countess X to the 
apartment of a frail young man to whom the Countess 
was carrying a basket of fruit; and how the 
frail young man insisted, against the protest of the 
Countess, upon sitting at the piano and playing; 
and of how they came out again, the eyes of the 
Countess streaming with tears, and of her saying, 
as they drove away, “Never, never forget, my child, 
as long as you live, that you have heard Chopin 
play.” It was in one of the lubberly houses of 
the Place Vendôme that the poet of the keyboard 
died a few days later. Just around the corner, in 
the Rue du Mont Thabor, died Alfred de Musset. 
A brass plate marks the house.</p>
            <p>May I not here transcribe that verse of the famous 
“Ballad of Bouillabaisse,” which I have never 
been able to recite, or read aloud, and part of which 
I may at length take to myself:</p>
            <lg type="verse">

            <head>V</head>
            <p>It is impossible to speak of Paris without giving 
a foremost place in the memorial retrospect to the 
Bois de Boulogne, the Parisian's Coney Island. I 
recall that I passed the final Sunday of my last 
Parisian sojourn just before the outbreak of the 
World War with a beloved family party in the joyous 
old Common. There is none like it in the world, 
uniting the urban to the rural with such surpassing 
grace as perpetually to convey a double sensation 
of pleasure; primal in its simplicity, superb in its 
setting; in the variety and brilliancy of the life 
which, upon sunny afternoons, takes possession of 
it and makes it a cross between a parade and a 
paradise.</p>
            <p>There was a time when, rather far away for foot 
travel, the Bois might be considered a driving park 
for the rich. It fairly blazed with the ostentatious
<pb id="watterson66" n="66"/>
splendor of the Second Empire; the shoddy Duke 
with his shady retinue, in gilded coach-and-four; 
the world-famous courtesan, bedizened with costly 
jewels and quite as well known as the Empress; the 
favorites of the Tuileries, the Comédie Française, 
the Opera, the Jardin Mabille, forming an unceasing 
and dazzling line of many-sided frivolity from 
the Port de Ville to the Port St. Cloud, circling 
round La Bagatelle and ranging about the Café 
Cascade, a human tiara of diamonds, a moving bouquet 
of laces and rubies, of silks and satins and 
emeralds and sapphires. Those were the days when 
the Duc de Morny, half if not full brother of the 
Emperor, ruled as king of the Bourse, and Cora 
Pearl, a clever and not at all good-looking Irish 
girl gone wrong, reigned as Queen of the Demimonde.</p>
            <p>All this went by the board years ago. Everywhere, 
more or less, electricity has obliterated distinctions 
of rank and wealth. It has circumvented 
lovers and annihilated romance. The Republic 
ousted the bogus nobility. The subways and the 
tram cars connect the Bois de Boulogne and the 
Bois de Vincennes so closely that the poorest may 
make himself at home in either or both.</p>
            <pb id="watterson67" n="67"/>
            <p>The automobile, too, oddly enough, is proving a 
very leveller. The crowd recognizes nobody amid 
the hurly-burly of <foreign lang="fr">coupés</foreign>, pony-carts, and taxicabs, 
each trying to pass the other. The conglomeration 
of personalities effaces the identity alike of the 
statesman and the artist, the savant and the cyprian. 
No six-inch rules hedge the shade of the trees and 
limit the glory of the grass. The <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">ouvrier</foreign></hi> can bring 
his brood and his basket and have his picnic where 
he pleases. The pastry cook and his <foreign lang="fr">chére amie</foreign>, the 
<foreign lang="fr">coiffeur</foreign> and his grisette can spoon by the lake-side 
as long as the moonlight lasts, and longer if they 
list, with never a gendarme to say them nay, or a 
rude voice out of the depths hoarsely to declaim, 
<foreign lang="fr">“allez!”</foreign> The Bois de Boulogne is literally and 
absolutely a playground, the playground of the people, 
and this last Sunday of mine, not fewer than 
half a million of Parisians were making it their own.</p>
            <p>Half of these encircled the Longchamps racecourse. 
The other half were shared by the boats 
upon the lagoons and the bosky dells under the 
summer sky and the cafés and the restaurants with 
which the Bois abounds. Our party, having 
exhausted the humors of the drive, repaired to Pré 
Catalan. Aside from the “two old brides” who are
<pb id="watterson68" n="68"/>
always in evidence on such occasions, there was a 
veritable “young couple,” exceedingly pretty to 
look at, and delightfully in love! That sort of thing 
is not so uncommon in Paris as cynics affect to 
think.</p>
            <p>If it be true, as the witty Frenchman observes, 
that “gambling is the recreation of gentlemen and 
the passion of fools,” it is equally true that love is 
a game where every player wins if he sticks to it 
and is loyal to it. Just as credit is the foundation 
of business is love both the asset and the trade-mark 
of happiness. To see it is to believe it, and - though 
a little cash in hand is needful to both - where either 
is wanting, look out for sheriffs and scandals.</p>
            <p>Pré Catalan, once a pasture for cows with a 
pretty kiosk for the sale of milk, has latterly had 
a tea-room big enough to seat a thousand, not counting 
the groves which I have seen grow up about it 
thickly dotted with booths and tables, where some 
thousands more may regale themselves. That 
Sunday it was never so glowing with animation and 
color. As it makes one happy to see others happy 
it makes one adore his own land to witness that 
which makes other lands great.</p>
            <p>I have not loved Paris as a Parisian, but as an
<pb id="watterson69" n="69"/>
American; perhaps it is a stretch of words to say 
I love Paris at all. I used to love to go there 
and to behold the majesty of France. I have 
always liked to mark the startling contrasts of light 
and shade. I have always known what all the world 
now knows, that beneath the gayety of the French 
there burns a patriotic and consuming fire, a high 
sense of public honor; a fine spirit of self-sacrifice 
along with the sometimes too aggressive spirit of 
freedom. In 1873 I saw them two blocks long and 
three files deep upon the Rue St. Honore press up 
to the Bank of France, old women and old men 
with their little all tied in handkerchiefs and stockings 
to take up the tribute required by Bismarck 
to rid the soil of the detested German. They did 
it. Alone they did it - the French people - the 
hard-working, frugal, loyal commonalty of France 
- without asking the loan of a sou from the world 
outside.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>VI</head>
            <p>Writing of that last Sunday in the Bois de Boulogne, 
I find by recurring to the record that I said: 
“There is a deal more of good than bad in every 
Nation. I take off my hat to the French. But, 
<pb id="watterson70" n="70"/>
I have had my fling and I am quite ready to go 
home. Even amid the gayety and the glare, the 
splendor of color and light, the Hungarian band 
wafting to the greenery and the stars the strains 
of the delicious waltz, La Veuve Joyeuse her very 
self - yea, many of her - tapping the time at many 
adjacent tables, the song that fills my heart is 
‘Hame, Hame, Hame! - Hame to my ain countree.’ 
Yet, to come again, d'ye mind? I should be loath 
to say good-by forever to the Bois de Boulogne. 
I want to come back to Paris. I always want to 
come back to Paris. One needs not to make an 
apology or give a reason.</p>
            <p>“We turn rather sadly away from Pré Catalan 
and the Café Cascade. We glide adown the 
flower-bordered path and out from the clusters of Chinese 
lanterns, and leave the twinkling groves to their 
music and merry-making. Yonder behind us, like 
a sentinel, rises Mont Valerien. Before us glimmer 
the lamps of uncountable coaches, as our own, veering 
toward the city, the moon just topping the tower 
of St. Jacques de la Boucherie and silver-plating 
the bronze figures upon the Arch of Stars.</p>
            <p>“We enter the Port Maillot. We turn into the 
Avenue du Bois. Presently we shall sweep with 
<pb id="watterson71" n="71"/>
the rest through the Champs Elysées and on to the 
ocean of the infinite, the heart of the mystery we 
call Life, nowhere so condensed, so palpable, so 
appealing. Roll the screen away! The shades of 
Clovis and Genevieve may be seen hand-in-hand 
with the shades of Martel and Pepin, taking the 
round of the ghost-walk between St. Denis and 
St. Germain, now le Balafré and again Navarre, 
now the assassins of the Ligue and now the 
assassins of the Terror, to keep them company. Nor 
yet quite all on murder bent, some on pleasure; the 
Knights and Ladies of the Cloth of Gold and the 
hosts of the Renaissance: Cyrano de Bergerac and 
François Villon leading the ragamuffin procession; 
the jades of the Fronde, Longueville, Chevreuse 
and fair-haired Anne of Austria; and Ninon, too, 
and Manon; and the never-to-be-forgotten Four, 
‘one for all and all for one;’ Cagliostro and Monte 
Cristo; on the side, Rabelais taking notes and 
laughing under his cowl. Catherine de Medici and 
Robespierre slinking away, poor, guilty things, into 
the pale twilight of the Dawn!</p>
            <p>“Names! Names! Only names? I am not just 
so sure about that. In any event, what a roll call! 
We are such stuff as dreams are made of, and our 
<pb id="watterson72" n="72"/>
little life is rounded by a sleep; the selfsame sleep 
which these, our living dead men and women in 
steel armor and gauzy muslins, in silken hose and 
sock and buskin, epaulettes and top boots, brocades 
and buff facings, have endured so long and know 
so well!</p>
            <p>“If I should die in Paris I should expect them 
- or some of them - to meet me at the barriers and 
to say, ‘Behold, the wickedness that was done in the 
world, the cruelty and the wrong, dwelt in the body, 
not in the soul of man, which freed from its foul 
incasement, purified and made eternal by the hand 
of death, shall see both the glory and the hand of 
God!’ ”</p>
            <p>It was not to be. I shall not die in Paris. I 
shall never come again. Neither shall I make 
apology for this long quotation by myself from 
myself, for am I not inditing an autobiography, so 
called?</p>

            <p><emph rend="bold">HAVING</emph> disported ourselves in and about 
Paris, next in order comes a journey to the 
South of France - that is to the Riviera - by geography 
the main circle of the Mediterranean Sea, by 
proclamation Cannes, Nice, and Mentone, by actual 
fact and count, Monte Carlo - even the swells 
adopting a certain hypocrisy as due to virtue.</p>
            <p>Whilst Monte Carlo is chiefly, I might say 
exclusively, identified in the general mind with 
gambling, and was indeed at the outset but a gambling 
resort, it long ago outgrew the limits of the Casino, 
becoming a Mecca of the world of fashion as well as 
the world of sport. Half the ruling sovereigns of 
<pb id="watterson74" n="74"/>
Europe and all the leaders of European swelldom, 
the more prosperous of the demi-mondaines and no 
end of the merely rich of every land, congregate 
there and thereabouts. At the top of the season the 
show of opulence and impudence is bewildering.</p>
            <p>The little principality of Monaco is hardly 
bigger than the Cabbage Patch of the renowned Mrs. 
Wiggs. It is, however, more happily situate. 
Nestled under the heights of La Condamine and Tête 
de Chien and looking across a sheltered bay upon 
the wide and blue Mediterranean, it has better 
protection against the winds of the North than Nice, 
or Cannes, or Mentone. It is an appanage - in 
point of fact the only estate - remaining to the once 
powerful Grimaldi family.</p>
            <p>In the early days of land-piracy Old Man 
Grimaldi held his own with Old Man Hohenzollern 
and Old Man Hapsburg. The Savoys and the 
Bourbons were kith and kin. But in the long run 
of Freebooting the Grimaldis did not keep up with 
the procession. How they retained even this remnant 
of inherited brigandage and self-appointed 
royalty, I do not know. They are here under leave 
of the Powers and the especial protection, strange 
to say, of the French Republic.</p>
            <pb id="watterson75" n="75"/>
            <p>Something over fifty years ago, being hard-up 
for cash, the Grimaldi of the period fell under the 
wiles of an ingenious Alsatian gambler, Guerlac 
by name, who foresaw that Baden-Baden and 
Hombourg were approaching their finish and that 
the sports must look elsewhere for their living, the 
idle rich for their sport. This tiny “enclave” in
French territory presented many advantages over 
the German Dukedoms. It was an independent 
sovereignty issuing its own coins and postage 
stamps. It was in proud possession of a half-dozen 
policemen which it called its “army.” It was 
paradisaic in beauty and climate. Its “ruler” was as 
poor as Job's turkey, but by no means as proud as 
Lucifer.</p>
            <p>The bargain was struck. The gambler smote the 
rock of Monte Carlo as with a wand of enchantment 
and a stream of plenty burst forth. The 
mountain-side responded to the touch. It chortled 
in its glee and blossomed as the rose.</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>II</head>
            <p>The region known as the Riviera comprises, as 
I have said, the whole land-circle of the Mediterranean
<pb id="watterson76" n="76"/>
Sea. But, as generally written and understood, 
it stands for the shoreline between Marseilles 
and Genoa. The two cities are connected by the 
Corniche Road, built by the First Napoleon, who 
learned the need of it when he made his Italian 
campaign, and the modern railway, the distance 
260 miles, two-thirds of the way through France, 
the residue through Italy, and all of it surpassing 
fine.</p>
            <p>The climate is very like that of Southern Florida. 
But as in Florida they have the “Nor'westers” 
and the “Nor'easters,” on the Riviera they have 
the “mistral.” In Europe there is no perfect winter 
weather north of Spain, as in the United States 
none north of Cuba.</p>
            <p>I have often thought that Havana might be made 
a dangerous rival of Monte Carlo under the one-man 
power, exercising its despotism with benignant 
intelligence and spending its income honestly upon 
the development of both the city and the island. 
The motley populace would probably be none the 
worse for it. The Government could upon a liberal 
tariff collect not less than thirty-five millions 
of annual revenue. Twenty-five of these millions 
would suffice for its own support. Ten millions a
<pb id="watterson77" n="77"/>
year laid out upon harbors, roadways and internal 
improvements in general would within ten years 
make the Queen of the Antilles the garden spot and 
playground of Christendom. They would build a 
Casino to outshine even the architectural miracles 
of Charles Garnier. Then would Havana put 
Cairo out of business and give the Prince of 
Monaco a run for his money.</p>
            <p>With the opening of every Monte Carlo season 
the newspapers used to tell of the colossal winnings 
of purely imaginary players. Sometimes the 
favored child of chance was a Russian, sometimes 
an Englishman, sometimes an American. He was 
usually a myth, of course. As Mrs. Prig observed 
to Mrs. Camp, “there never was no sich person.”</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>III</head>
            <p>Charles Garnier, the Parisian architect, came and 
built the Casino, next to the Library of Congress 
at Washington and the Grand Opera House at 
Paris the most beautiful building in the world, with 
incomparable gardens and commanding esplanades 
to set it off and display it. Around it palatial hotels 
and private mansions and villas sprang into existence.
<pb id="watterson78" n="78"/>
Within it a gold-making wheel of fortune 
fabricated the wherewithal. Old Man Grimaldi in 
his wildest dreams of land-piracy - even Old Man 
Hohenzollern, or Old Man Hapsburg - never 
conceived the like.</p>
            <p>There is no poverty, no want, no taxes - not any 
sign of dilapidation or squalor anywhere in the 
principality of Monaco. Yet the “people,” so called, 
have been known to lapse into a state of discontent. 
They sometimes “yearned for freedom.” Too well 
fed and cared for, too rid of dirt and debt, too 
flourishing, they “riz.” Prosperity grew monotonous. 
They even had the nerve to demand a “Constitution.”</p>
            <p>The reigning Prince was what Yellowplush 
would call “a scientific gent.” His son and heir, 
however, had not his head in the clouds, being in 
point of fact of the earth earthly, and, of 
consequence, more popular than his father. He came 
down from the Castle on the hill to the marketplace 
in the town and says he: “What do you galoots 
want, anyhow?”</p>
            <p>First, their “rights.” Then a change in the 
commander-in-chief of the army, which had grown from 
<pb id="watterson79" n="79"/>
six to sixteen. Finally, a Board of Aldermen and 
a Common Council.</p>
            <p>“Is that all?” says his Royal Highness. They 
said it was. “Then,” says he, “take it, <foreign lang="fr">mes enfants</foreign>, 
and bless you!”</p>
            <p>So, all went well again. The toy sovereignty 
began to rattle around in its own conceit, the 
“people” regarded themselves, and wished to be 
regarded, as a chartered Democracy. The little 
gimcrack economic system experienced the joys of 
reform. A “New Nationalism” was established in 
the brewery down by the railway station and a 
reciprocity treaty was negotiated between the Casino 
and Vanity Fair, witnessing the introduction of 
two roulette tables and an extra brazier for cigar 
stumps.</p>
            <p>But the Prince of Monaco stood on one point. 
He would have no Committee on Credentials. 
He told me once that he had heard of Tom Reed 
and Champ Clark and Uncle Joe Cannon, but that 
be preferred Uncle Joe. He would, and he did, 
name his own committees both in the Board of 
Aldermen and the Common Council. Thus, for the 
time being, “insurgency” was quelled. And once 
more serenely sat the Castle on the hill hard by the 
<pb id="watterson80" n="80"/>
Cathedral. Calmly again flowed the waters in 
the harbor. More and more the autos honked outside 
the Casino. Within “the little ball ever goes 
merrily round,” and according to the croupiers and 
the society reporters “the gentleman wins and the 
poor gambler loses!”</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>IV</head>
            <p>To illustrate, I recall when on a certain season 
the lucky sport of print and fancy was an Englishman. 
In one of those farragos of stupidity and 
inaccuracy which are syndicated and sent from 
abroad to America, I found the following piece 
with the stuff and nonsense habitually worked off 
on the American press as “foreign correspondence”:</p>
            <p>“Now and then the newspapers report authentic 
instances of large sums having been won at the 
gaming tables at Monte Carlo. One of the most 
fortunate players at Monte Carlo for a long time 
past has been a Mr. Darnbrough, an Englishman, 
whose remarkable run of luck had furnished the 
morsels of gossip in the capitals of Continental 
Europe recently.</p>
            <p>“If reports are true, he left the place with the 
snug sum of more than 1,000,000 francs to the good
<pb id="watterson81" n="81"/>
as the result of a month's play. But this, I hear,
did not represent all of Mr. Darnbrough's 
winnings. The story goes that on the opening day of
his play he staked 24,000 francs, winning all along
the line. Emboldened by his success, he continued
playing, winning again and again with marvelous
luck. At one period, it is said, his credit balance
amounted to no less than 1,850,000 francs; but from
that moment Dame Fortune ceased to smile upon
him. He lost steadily from 200,000 to 300,000
francs a day, until, recognizing that luck had turned
against him, he had sufficient strength of will to
turn his back on the tables and strike for home with
the very substantial winnings that still remained.</p>
            <p>“On another occasion a well-known London
stock broker walked off with little short of £40,000.
This remarkable performance occasioned no small
amount of excitement in the gambling rooms, as
such an unusual incident does invariably.</p>
            <p>“Bent on making a ‘plunge,’ he went from one
table to another, placing the maximum stake on
the same number. Strange to relate, at each table
the same number won, and it was his number.
Recognizing that this perhaps might be his lucky
day, the player wended his way to the 
			
<pb id="watterson82" n="82"/>
<foreign lang="fr">trente-et-quarante</foreign> room and put the maximum on three of 
the tables there. To his amazement, he discovered 
that there also he had been so fortunate as to select 
the winning number.</p>
            <p>“The head croupier confided to a friend of the 
writer who happened to be present that that day 
had been the worst in the history of the Monaco 
bank for years. He it was also who mentioned the 
amount won by the fortunate Londoner, as given 
above.”</p>
            <p>It is prudent of the space-writers to ascribe such 
“information” as this to “the head croupier,” 
because it is precisely the like that such an authority 
would give out. People upon the spot know that 
nothing of the kind happened, and that no person 
of that name had appeared upon the scene. The 
story on the face of it bears to the knowing its own 
refutation, being absurd in every detail. As if 
conscious of this, the author proceeds to quality it in 
the following:</p>
            <p>“It is a well-known fact that one of the most 
successful players at the Monte Carlo tables was 
Wells, who as the once popular music-hall song 
put it, ‘broke the bank’ there. He was at the zenith 
of his fame, about twenty years ago, when his 
<pb id="watterson83" n="83"/>
escapades - and winnings - were talked about widely 
and envied in European sporting circles and among 
the demi-monde.</p>
            <p>“In ten days, it was said, he made upward of 
£35,000 clear winnings at the tables after starting 
with the modest capital of £400. It must not be 
forgotten, however, that at his trial later Wells 
denied this, stating that all he had made was £7,000 
at four consecutive sittings. He made the statement 
that, even so, he had been a loser in the end.</p>
            <p>“The reader may take his choice of the two 
statements, but among frequenters of the rooms at 
Monte Carlo it is generally considered impossible 
to amass large winnings without risking large 
stakes. Even then the chances are 1,000 to 1 in 
favor of the bank. Yet occasionally there are 
winnings running into four or five figures, and to 
human beings the possibility of chance constitutes 
an irresistible fascination.</p>
            <p>“Only a few years ago a young American was 
credited with having risen from the tables $75,000 
richer than when first he had sat down. It was his 
first visit to Monte Carlo and he had not come with 
any system to break the bank or with any ‘get-rich-quick’ 
idea. For the novelty of the thing he risked 
<pb id="watterson84" n="84"/>
about $4,000, and lost it all in one fell swoop 
without turning a hair. Then he ‘plunged’ with double 
that amount, but the best part of that, too, went 
the same way. Nothing daunted, he next ventured 
$10,000. This time fickle fortune favored him. He 
played on with growing confidence and when his 
winnings amounted to the respectable sum of 
$75,000 he had the good sense to quit and to leave the 
place despite the temptation to continue.”</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>V</head>
            <p>The “man who broke the bank at Monte Carlo,” 
and gave occasion for the song, was not named 
“Wells” and he was not an Englishman. He was 
an American. I knew him well and soon after the 
event had from his own lips the whole story.</p>
            <p>He came to Monte Carlo with a good deal of 
money won at draw-poker in a club at Paris and 
went away richer by some 100,000 francs (about 
$20,000) than he came.</p>
            <p>The catch-line of the song is misleading. There 
is no such thing as “breaking the bank at Monte 
Carlo.” This particular player won so fast upon 
two or three “spins” that the table at which he
<pb id="watterson85" n="85"/>
played had to suspend until it could be replenished 
by another “bank,” perhaps ten minutes in point 
of time. There used to be some twenty tables. 
Just how one man could play at more than one of 
them at one time a “foreign correspondent,” but 
only a “foreign correspondent,” might explain to 
the satisfaction of the horse-marines.</p>
            <p>I very much doubt whether any player ever won 
more than 100,000 francs at a single sitting. To 
do even that he must plunge like a ship in a hurricane. 
There is, of course, a saving limit set by the 
Casino Company upon the play. It is to the 
interest of the Casino to cultivate the idea, and the 
letter writers are willing tools. Not only at Monte 
Carlo, but everywhere, in dearth of news, gambling 
stories come cheap and easy. And the cheaper the 
story the bigger the play. “The Jedge raised him 
two thousand dollars. The Colonel raised him back 
ten thousand more. Both of 'em stood pat. The 
Jedge bet him a hundred thousand. The Colonel 
called. ‘What you got?’ says he. ‘Ace high,’ says 
the Jedge; ‘what you got?’ ‘Pair o' deuces,’ says 
the Colonel.”</p>
            <p>Assuredly the “play” in the Casino is entirely 
fair. It could hardly be otherwise with such crowds 
<pb id="watterson86" n="86"/>
of players at the tables, often covering the whole 
“layout.” But there is no such thing as “honest 
gambling.” The “house” must have “the best of 
it.” A famous American gambler, when I had 
referred to one of his guild, lately deceased, as “an 
honest gambler,” said to me: “What do you mean 
by ‘an honest gambler’?”</p>
            <p>“A gambler who will not take unfair advantage!” 
I answered.</p>
            <p>“Well,” said he, “the gambler must have his 
advantage, because gambling is his livelihood. He 
must fit himself for its profitable pursuit by learning 
all the tricks of trade like other artists and 
artificers. With him it is win or starve.”</p>
            <p>Among the variegate crowds that thronged the 
highways and byways of Monte Carlo in those days 
there was no single figure more observed and striking 
than that of Leopold the Second, King of the 
Belgians. He had a bungalow overlooking the sea 
where he lived three months of the year like a country 
gentleman. Although I have made it a rule to 
avoid courts and courtiers, an event brought me 
into acquaintance with this best abused man in 
Europe, enabling me to form my own estimate of his 
very interesting personality.</p>
            <pb id="watterson87" n="87"/>
            <p>He was not at all what his enemies represented 
him to be, a sot, a gambler and a <foreign lang="fr">roué</foreign>. In appearance 
a benignant burgomaster, tall and stalwart; 
in manner and voice very gentle, he should be 
described as first of all a man of business. His 
weakness was rather for money than women. Speaking 
of the most famous of the Parisian dancers with 
whom his name had been scandalously associated, 
he told me that he had never met her but once in 
his life, and that after the newspaper gossips had 
been busy for years with their alleged love affair. 
“I kissed her hand,” he related, “and bade her 
<foreign lang="fr">adieu</foreign>, saying, ‘Ah, ma'mselle, you and I have 
indeed reason to congratulate ourselves.’ ”</p>
            <p>It was the Congo business that lay at the bottom 
of the abuse of Leopold. Henry Stanley had put 
him up to this. It turned out a gold mine, and then 
two streams of defamation were let loose; one from 
the covetous commercial standpoint and the other 
from the humanitarian. Between them, seeking to 
drive him out, they depicted him as a monster of 
cruelty and depravity.</p>
            <p>A King must be an anchorite to escape calumny, 
and Leopold was not an anchorite. I asked him 
<pb id="watterson88" n="88"/>
why I never saw him in the Casino. “Play,” he 
answered, “does not interest me. Besides, I do not 
enjoy being talked about. Nor do I think the 
game they play there quite fair.”</p>
            <p>“In what way do you consider it unfair, your 
Majesty?” I asked.</p>
            <p>“In the zero,” he replied. “At the Brussels 
Casino I do not allow them to have a zero. Come 
and see me and I will show you a perfectly equal 
chance for your money, to win or lose.”</p>
            <p>Years after I was in Brussels. Leopold had 
gone to his account and his nephew, Albert, had 
come to the throne. There was not a roulette table 
in the Casino, but there was one conveniently 
adjacent thereto, managed by a clique of New York 
gamblers, which had both a single “and a double 
O,” and, as appeared when the municipality made 
a descent upon the place, was ingeniously wired 
to throw the ball wherever the presiding coupier 
wanted it to go.</p>
            <p>I do not believe, however, that Leopold was a 
party to this, or could have had any knowledge of 
it. He was a skillful, not a dishonest, business man, 
who showed his foresight when he listened to Stanley
<pb id="watterson89" n="89"/>
and took him under his wing. If the Congo 
had turned out worthless nobody would ever have 
heard of the delinquencies of the King of the 
Belgians.</p>

          <head>A PARISIAN “PENSION” - THE WIDOW OF WALEWSKA, 
<lb/>NAPOLEON'S DAUGHTER-IN-LAW - THE
<lb/>CHANGELESS - A MORAL AND ORDERLY CITY</head>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>I</head>
            <p><emph rend="bold">I HAVE</emph> said that I knew the widow of Walewska, 
the natural son of Napoleon Bonaparte 
by the Polish countess he picked up in Warsaw, 
who followed him to Paris; and thereby hangs 
a tale which may not be without interest.</p>
            <p>In each of our many sojourns in Paris my wife 
and I had taken an apartment, living the while in 
the restaurants, at first the cheaper, like the Café 
de Progress and the Duval places; then the Bœuf 
à la Mode, the Café Voisin and the Café Anglais, 
with Champoux's, in the Place de la Bourse, for a 
regular luncheon resort.</p>
            <p>At length, the children something more than 
half grown, I said: “We have never tried a Paris 
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">pension</foreign></hi>.”</p>
            <pb id="watterson91" n="91"/>
            <p>So with a half dozen recommended addresses we 
set out on a house hunt. We had not gone far 
when our search was rewarded by a veritable find. 
This was on the Avenue de Courcelles, not far from 
the Parc Monceau; newly furnished; reasonable 
charges; the lady manager a beautiful well-mannered 
woman, half Scotch and half French.</p>
            <p>We moved in. When dinner was called the 
boarders assembled in the very elegant drawing-room. 
Madame presented us to Baron - . Then 
followed introductions to Madame la Duchesse and 
Madame la Princesse and Madame la Comtesse. 
Then the folding doors opened and dinner was 
announced.</p>
            <p>The baron sat at the center of the table. The 
meal consisted of eight or ten courses, served as if 
at a private house, and of surpassing quality. During 
the three months that we remained there was 
no evidence of a boarding house. It appeared an 
aristocratic family into which we had been hospitably 
admitted. The baron was a delightful person. 
Madame la Duchesse was the mother of Madame 
la Princesse, and both were charming. The 
Comtesse, the Napoleonic widow, was at first a little 
<pb id="watterson92" n="92"/>
formal, but she came round after we had got 
acquainted, and, when we took our departure, it 
was like leaving a veritable domestic circle.</p>
            <p>Years after we had the sequel. The baron, a 
poor young nobleman, had come into a little money. 
He thought to make it breed. He had an equally 
poor Scotch cousin, who undertook to play hostess. 
Both the Duchess and the Countess were his kinswomen. 
How could such a <foreign lang="fr">ménage</foreign> last?</p>
            <p>He lost his all. What became of our fellow-lodgers 
I never learned, but the venture coming to 
naught, the last I heard of the beautiful high-bred 
lady manager, she was serving as a stewardess on 
an ocean liner. Nothing, however, could exceed the 
luxury, the felicity and the good company of those 
memorable three months <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">chez l'Avenue de Courcelles, 
Parc Monceau</foreign></hi>.</p>
            <p>We never tried a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">pension</foreign></hi> again. We chose a delightful 
hotel in the Rue de Castiglione off the Rue 
de Rivoli, and remained there as fixtures until we 
were reckoned the oldest inhabitants. But we never 
deserted the dear old Bœuf à la Mode, which we
lived to see one of the most flourishing and popular
places in Paris.</p>
          </div2>
          <pb id="watterson93" n="93"/>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>II</head>
            <p>In the old days there was a little hotel on the Rue 
Dannou, midway between the Rue de la Paix and 
what later along became the Avenue de l'Opéra, 
called the Hôtel d'Orient. It was conducted by a 
certain Madame Hougenin, whose family had held 
the lease for more than a hundred years, and was 
typical of what the comfort-seeking visitor, somewhat 
initiate, might find before the modern tourist 
onrush overflowed all bounds and effaced the 
ancient landmarks - or should I say townmarks? - 
making a resort instead of a home of the gay French 
capital. The d'Orient was delightfully comfortable 
and fabulously cheap.</p>
            <p>The wayfarer entered a darksome passage that 
led to an inner court. There were on the four sides 
of this seven or eight stories pierced by many 
windows. There was never a lift, or what we Americans 
call an elevator. If you wanted to go up you 
walked up; and after dark your single illuminant 
was candlelight. The service could hardly be 
recommended, but cleanliness herself could find no 
fault with the beds and bedding; nor any queer 
<pb id="watterson94" n="94"/>
people about; changeless; as still and stationary as 
a nook in the Rockies.</p>
            <p>A young girl might dwell there year in and year 
out in perfect safety - many young girls did so - 
madame a kind of duenna. The food - for it was a 
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">pension</foreign></hi> - was all a gourmet could desire. And the 
wine!</p>
            <p>I was lunching with an old Parisian friend.</p>
            <p>“What do you think of this vintage?” says he.</p>
            <p>“Very good,” I answered. “Come and dine with 
me to-morrow and I will give you the mate to it.”</p>
            <p>“What - at the d'Orient?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, at the d'Orient.”</p>
            <p>“Preposterous!”</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, he came. When the wine was 
poured out he took a sip.</p>
            <p>“By - !” he exclaimed. “That is good, isn't 
it? I wonder where they got it? And how?”</p>
            <p>During the week after we had it every day. Then 
no more. The headwaiter, with many apologies, 
explained that he had found those few bottles in 
a forgotten bin, where they had lain for years, and 
he begged a thousand pardons of monsieur, but we 
had drunk them all - <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">rien du plus</foreign></hi> - no more. I 
might add that precisely the same thing happened
<pb id="watterson95" n="95"/>
to me at the Hôtel Continental. Indeed, it is not 
uncommon with the French caravansaries to keep a 
little extra good wine in stock for those who can 
distinguish between an <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">ordinaire</foreign></hi> and a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">supérieur</foreign></hi>, 
and are willing to pay the price.</p>

            <p>“See Naples and die,” say the Italians. “See 
Paris and live,” say the French. Old friends, who 
have been over and back, have been of late telling 
me that Paris, having woefully suffered, is nowise 
the Paris it was, and as the provisional offspring 
of four years of desolating war I can well believe 
them. But a year or two of peace, and the city will 
rise again, as after the Franco-Prussian War and 
the Commune, which laid upon it a sufficiently 
blighting hand. In spite of fickle fortune and its 
many ups and downs it is, and will ever remain, 
“Paris, the Changeless.”</p>
            <p>I never saw the town so much itself as just before 
the beginning of the world war. I took my 
departure in the early summer of that fateful year 
and left all things booming - not a sign or trace 
that there had ever been aught but boundless happiness
<pb id="watterson96" n="96"/>
and prosperity. It is hard, the saying has it, 
to keep a squirrel on the ground, and surely Paris 
is the squirrel among cities. The season just ended 
had been, everybody declared, uncommonly successful 
from the standpoints alike of the hotels and 
cafés, the shop folk and their patrons, not to 
mention the purely pleasure-seeking throng. People 
seemed loaded with money and giddy to spend it.</p>
            <p>The headwaiter at Voisin's told me this: “Mr. 
Barnes, of New York, ordered a dinner, <foreign lang="fr">carte 
blanche</foreign>, for twelve.</p>
            <p>“ ‘Now,’ says he, ‘garcon, have everything bang 
up, and here's seventy-five francs for a starter.’</p>
            <p>“The dinner was bang up. Everybody hilarious. 
Mr. Barnes immensely pleased. When he came to 
pay his bill, which was a corker, he made no 
objection.</p>
            <p>“ ‘<foreign lang="fr">Garcon</foreign>,’ says he, ‘if I ask you a question will 
you tell me the truth?’</p>
            <p>
              <hi rend="italics">“ ‘<foreign lang="fr">Oui, monsieur; certainement.</foreign>’</hi>
            </p>
            <p>“Well, how much was the largest tip you ever 
received?”</p>
            <p>“Seventy-five francs, monsieur.”</p>
            <p>“ ‘Very well; here are 100 francs.’</p>
            <p>“Then, after a pause for the waiter to digest his
<pb id="watterson97" n="97"/>
joy and express a proper sense of gratitude and 
wonder, Mr. Barnes came to time with: ‘Do you 
remember who was the idiot that paid you the 
seventy-five francs?’</p>
            <p>“ ‘Oh, yes, monsieur. It was you.’ ”</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>IV</head>
            <p>It has occurred to me that of late years - I mean 
the years immediately before 1914 - Paris has been 
rather more bent upon adapting itself to human 
and moral as well as scientific progress. There has 
certainly been less debauchery visible to the naked 
eye. I was assured that the patronage had so fallen 
away from the Moulin Rouge that they were 
planning to turn it into a decent theater. Nor 
during my sojourn did anybody in my hearing so 
much as mention the Dead Rat. I doubt whether 
it is still in existence.</p>
            <p>The last time I was in Maxim's - quite a dozen 
years ago now - a young woman sat next to me 
whose story could be read in her face. She was a 
pretty thing not five and twenty, still blooming, 
with iron-gray hair. It had turned in a night, I 
was told. She had recently come from Baltimore
<pb id="watterson98" n="98"/>
and knew no more what she was doing or whither 
she was drifting than a baby. The old, old story: 
a comfortable home and a good husband; even a 
child or two; a scoundrel, a scandal, an elopement, 
and the inevitable desertion. Left without a dollar 
in the streets of Paris. She was under convoy of 
a noted procuress.</p>
            <p>“A duke or the morgue,” she whimpered, “in six 
months.”</p>
            <p>Three months sufficed. They dragged all that 
remained of her out of the Seine, and then the whole 
of the pitiful disgrace and tragedy came out.</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>V</head>
            <p>If ever I indite a volume to be entitled Adventures 
in Paris it will contain not a line to feed any 
prurient fancy, but will embrace the record of many 
little journeys between the Coiffeur and the Marché 
des Fleurs, with maybe an excursion among the 
cemeteries and the restaurants.</p>
            <p>Each city is as one makes it for himself. Paris 
has contributed greatly to my appreciation, and
perhaps my knowledge, of history and literature 
and art and life. I have seen it in all its aspects;
<pb id="watterson99" n="99"/>
under the empire, when the Duc de Morny was 
king of the Bourse and Mexico was to make every 
Frenchman rich; after the commune and the siege, 
when the Hôtel de Ville was in ruins, the palace of 
the Tuileries still aflame, the column gone from
the Place Vendôme, and everything a blight and 
waste; and I have marked it rise from its ashes, 
grandly, proudly, and like a queen come to her own 
again, resume its primacy as the only complete 
metropolis in all the universe.</p>
            <p>There is no denying it. No city can approach 
Paris in structural unity and regality, in things 
brilliant and beautiful, in buoyancy, variety, charm 
and creature comfort. Drunkenness, of the kind 
familiar to London and New York, is invisible to 
Paris. The brandy and absinthe habit has been 
greatly exaggerated. In truth, everywhere in 
Europe the use of intoxicants is on the decline. They 
are, for the first time in France, stimulated partly 
by the alarming adulteration of French wines, 
rigorously applying and enforcing the pure-food laws.</p>
            <p>As a consequence, there is a palpable and decided 
improvement of the vintage of the Garonne and the 
Champagne country. One may get a good glass of 
wine now without impoverishing himself. As men
<pb id="watterson100" n="100"/>
drink wine, and as the wine is pure, they fall away 
from stronger drink. I have always considered, 
with Jefferson, the brewery in America an excellent 
temperance society. That which works otherwise 
is the dive which too often the brewery fathers. 
They are drinking more beer in France - even making 
a fairly good beer. And then - </p>
            <p>But gracious, this is getting upon things controversial, 
and if there is anything in this world that 
I do hybominate, it is controversy!</p>
            <p>Few of the wondrous changes which the Age of 
Miracles has wrought in my day and generation 
exceeded those of ocean travel. The modern liner 
is but a moving palace. Between the ports of the 
Old World and the ports of the new the transit is 
so uneventful as to grow monotonous. There are 
no more adventures on the high seas. The ocean 
is a thoroughfare, the crossing a ferry. My experience 
forty years ago upon one of the ancient tubs 
which have been supplanted by these liners would 
make queer reading to the latter-day tourist, 
taking, let us say, any one of the steamers of any one 
of the leading transatlantic companies. The difference 
in the appointments of the William Penn of 
1865 and the star boats of 1914 is indescribable. It 
<pb id="watterson101" n="101"/>
seems a fairy tale to think of a palm garden where 
the ladies dress for dinner, a Hungarian band which 
plays for them whilst they dine, and a sky parlor 
where they go after dinner for their coffee and 
what not; a tea-room for the five-o'clockers; and 
except in excessive weather scarcely any motion at 
all. It is this palm garden which most appeals to 
a certain lady of my very intimate acquaintance 
who had made many crossings and never gone to 
her meals - sick from shore to shore - until the gods 
ordained for her a watery, winery, flowery paradise 
- where the billows ceased from troubling and a 
woman could appear at her best. Since then she 
has sailed many times, lodged à la Waldorf-Astoria 
to eat her victuals and sip her wine with perfect 
contentment. Coming ashore from our last crossing 
a friend found her in the Red Room of that 
hostel just as she had been sitting the evening 
before on shipboard.</p>
            <p>“Seems hardly any motion at all,” she said, looking 
about her and fancying herself still at sea, as 
well she might.</p>

            <p><emph rend="bold">WHAT</emph> may be called the Grover Cleveland 
period of American politics began with the 
election of that extraordinary person - another man 
of destiny - to the governorship of New York. 
Nominated, as it were, by chance, he carried the 
State by an unprecedented majority. That was 
not because of his popularity, but that an incredible 
number of Republican voters refused to support 
their party ticket and stayed away from the 
polls. The Blaine-Conkling feud, inflamed by the 
murder of Garfield, had rent the party of Lincoln 
and Grant asunder. Arthur, a Conkling leader, 
had succeeded to the presidency.</p>
            <p>If any human agency could have sealed the 
<pb id="watterson103" n="103"/>
breach he might have done it. No man, however, 
can achieve the impossible. The case was hopeless.</p>
            <p>Arthur was a man of surpassing sweetness and 
grace. As handsome as Pierce, as affable as 
McKinley, he was a more experienced and dextrous 
politician than either. He had been put on the 
ticket with Garfield to placate Conkling. All sorts 
of stories to his discredit were told during the 
ensuing campaign. The Democrats made him out a 
tricky and typical “New York politician.” In 
point of fact he was a many-sided, accomplished 
man who had a taking way of adjusting all 
conditions and adapting himself to all companies.</p>

head of his domestic fabric, the White House 
bloomed again. He possessed the knack of 
surrounding himself with all sorts of agreeable people. 
Frederick Frelinghuysen was Secretary of State 
and Robert Lincoln, continued from the Garfield 
Cabinet, Secretary of War. Then there were three 
irresistibles: Walter Gresham, Frank Hatton and 
“Ben” Brewster. His home contingent - “Clint” 
Wheeler, “Steve” French, and “Jake” Hess - pictured 
as “ward heelers” - were, in reality, efficient 
<pb id="watterson104" n="104"/>
and all-around, companionable men, capable and 
loyal.</p>
            <p>I was sent by the Associated Press to Washington 
on a fool's errand - that is, to get an act of 
Congress extending copyright to the news of the 
association - and, remaining the entire session, my 
business to meet the official great and to make 
myself acceptable, I came into a certain intimacy with 
the Administration circle, having long had friendly 
relations with the President. In all my life I have 
never passed so delightful and useless a winter.</p>
            <p>Very early in the action I found that my mission 
involved a serious and vexed question - nothing less 
than the creation of a new property - and I 
proceeded warily. Through my uncle, Stanley 
Matthews, I interested the members of the 
Supreme Court. The Attorney General, a great 
lawyer and an old Philadelphia friend, was at my call 
and elbow. The Joint Library Committee of Congress, 
to which the measure must go, was with me. 
Yet somehow the scheme lagged.</p>
            <p>I could not account for this. One evening at a 
dinner Mr. Blaine enlightened me. We sat 
together at table and suddenly he turned and said: 
“How are you getting on with your bill?” And 
<pb id="watterson105" n="105"/>
my reply being rather halting, he continued, “You 
won't get a vote in either House,” and he 
proceeded very humorously to improvise the average 
member's argument against it as a dangerous 
power, a perquisite to the great newspapers and an 
imposition upon the little ones. To my mind this 
was something more than the post-prandial levity 
it was meant to be.</p>
            <p>Not long after a learned but dissolute old lawyer 
said to me, “You need no act of Congress to protect 
your news service. There are at least two, 
and I think four or five, English rulings that cover 
the case. Let me show them to you.” He did so 
and I went no further with the business, quite agreeing 
with Mr. Blaine, and nothing further came of 
it. To a recent date the Associated Press has relied 
on these decisions under the common law of England. 
Curiously enough, quite a number of newspapers 
in whose actual service I was engaged, 
opened fire upon me and roundly abused me.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>II</head>
            <p>There appeared upon the scene in Washington 
toward the middle of the seventies one of those 
<pb id="watterson106" n="106"/>
problematical characters the fiction-mongers delight 
in. This was John Chamberlin. During two decades 
“Chamberlin's,” half clubhouse and half chophouse, 
was all a rendezvous.</p>
            <p>“John” had been a gambler; first an underling 
and then a partner of the famous Morrissy-McGrath 
racing combination at Saratoga and Long 
Branch. There was a time when he was literally 
rolling in wealth. Then he went broke - dead 
broke. Black Friday began it and the panic of '73 
finished it. He came over to Washington and his 
friends got him the restaurant privileges of the 
House of Representatives. With this for a starting 
point, he was able to take the Fernando Wood 
residence, in the heart of the fashionable quarter, 
to add to it presently the adjoining dwelling of 
Governor Swann, of Maryland, and next to that, 
finally, the Blaine mansion, making a suite, as it 
were, elegant yet cozy. “Welcker's,” erst a 
fashionable resort, and long the best eating-place in 
town, had been ruined by a scandal, and “Chamberlin's” 
succeeded it, having the field to itself, 
though, mindful of the “scandal” which had made 
its opportunity, ladies were barred.</p>
            <p>There was a famous cook - Emeline Simmons - 
<pb id="watterson107" n="107"/>
a mulatto woman, who was equally at home in 
French dishes and Maryland-Virginia kitchen 
mysteries - a very wonder with canvasback and terrapin 
- who later refused a great money offer to be chef 
at the White House - whom John was able to 
secure. Nothing could surpass - could equal - her 
preparations. The charges, like the victuals, were 
sky-high and tip-top. The service was handled by 
three “colored gentlemen,” as distinguished in 
manners as in appearance, who were known far and 
wide by name and who dominated all about them, 
including John and his patrons.</p>
            <p>No such place ever existed before, or will ever 
exist again. It was the personality of John Chamberlin, 
pervasive yet invisible, exhaling a silent, 
welcoming radiance. General Grant once said to 
me, “During my eight years in the White House, 
John Chamberlin once in a while - once in a great 
while - came over. He did not ask for anything. 
He just told me what to do, and I did it.” I 
mentioned this to President Arthur. “Well,” he 
laughingly said, “that has been my experience with John 
Chamberlin. It never crosses my mind to say him 
‘nay.’ Often I have turned this over in my thought 
to reach the conclusion that being a man of sound 
<pb id="watterson108" n="108"/>
judgment and worldly knowledge, he has fully 
considered the case - his case and my case - leaving me
no reasonable objection to interpose.”</p>
            <p>John obtained an act of Congress authorizing 
him to build a hotel on the Government reservation 
at Fortress Monroe, and another of the Virginia 
Legislature confirming this for the State. Then he 
came to me. It was at the moment when I was 
flourishing as “a Wall Street magnate.” He said: 
“I want to sell this franchise to some man, or 
company, rich enough to carry it through. All I expect 
is a nest egg for Emily and the girls” - he had 
married the beautiful Emily Thorn, widow of George 
Jordan, the actor, and there were two daughters - 
“you are hand-and-glove with the millionaires. 
Won't you manage it for me?” Like Grant and 
Arthur, I never thought of refusing. Upon the 
understanding that I was to receive no commission, 
I agreed, first ascertaining that it was really a most 
valuable franchise.</p>
            <p>I began with the Willards, in whose hotel I had 
grown up. They were rich and going out of 
business. Then I laid it before Hitchcock and Darling, 
of the Fifth Avenue Hotel in New York. They, 
rich like the Willards, were also retiring. Then a 
<pb id="watterson109" n="109"/>
bright thought occurred to me. I went to the 
Prince Imperial of Standard Oil. “Mr. Flagler,” 
I said, “you have hotels at St. Augustine and you 
have hotels at Palm Beach. Here is a halfway 
point between New York and Florida,” and more 
of the same sort. “My dear friend,” he answered, 
“every man has the right to make a fool of himself 
once in his life. This I have already done. Never 
again for me. I have put up my last dollar south 
of the Potomac.” Then I went to the King of the 
transcontinental railways. “Mr. Huntington,” I 
said, “you own a road extending from St. Louis to 
Newport News, having a terminal in a cornfield 
just out of Hampton Roads. Here is a franchise 
which gives you a magnificent site at Hampton 
Roads itself. Why not?” He gazed upon me 
with a blank stare - such I fancy as he usually 
turned upon his suppliants - and slowly replied: “I 
would not spend another dollar in Virginia if the 
Lord commanded me. In the event that some 
supernatural power should take the Chesapeake &amp; 
Ohio Railway by the nape of the neck and the seat 
of the breeches and pitch it out in the middle of the 
Atlantic Ocean it would be doing me a favor.”</p>
            <p>So I returned John his franchise marked “nothing 
<pb id="watterson110" n="110"/>
doing.” Afterward he put it in the hands of
a very near friend, a great capitalist, who had no
better luck with it. Finally, here and there, 
literally by piecemeal, he got together money enough
to build and furnish the Hotel Chamberlin, had a
notable opening with half of Congress there to see,
and gently laid himself down and died, leaving little
other than friends and debts.</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>III</head>
            <p>Macaulay tells us that the dinner-table is a 
wondrous peacemaker, miracle worker, social solvent;
and many were the quarrels composed and the plans
perfected under the Chamberlin roof. It became a
kind of Congressional Exchange with a close White
House connection. If those old walls, which by the
way are still standing, could speak, what tales they
might tell, what testimonies refute, what new lights
throw into the vacant corners and dark places of
history!</p>
            <p>Coming away from Chamberlin's with Mr.
Blaine for an after-dinner stroll during the winter
of 1883-4, referring to the approaching National
Republican Convention, he said: “I do not want
<pb id="watterson111" n="111"/>
		
the nomination. In my opinion there is but one 
nominee the Republicans can elect this year and 
that is General Sherman. I have written him to 
tell him so and urge it upon him. In default of him 
the time of you people has come.” He subsequently 
showed me this letter and General Sherman's reply. 
My recollection is that the General declared that he 
would not take the presidency if it were offered him, 
earnestly invoking Mr. Blaine to support his brother, 
John Sherman.</p>
            <p>This would seem clear refutation that Mr. Blaine 
was party to his own nomination that year. It 
assuredly reveals keen political instinct and foresight. 
The capital prize in the national lottery was 
not for him.</p>
            <p>I did not meet him until two years later, when 
he gave me a minute account of what had happened 
immediately thereafter; the swing around the circle; 
Belshazzar's feast, as a fatal New York banquet 
was called; the far-famed Burchard incident. 
“I did not hear the words, ‘Rum, Romanism and 
Rebellion,’ ” he told me, “else, as you must know, 
I would have fittingly disposed of them.”</p>
            <p>I said: “Mr. Blaine, you may as well give it up. 
The doom of Webster, Clay, and Douglas is upon 
<pb id="watterson112" n="112"/>
you. If you are nominated again, with an assured 
election, you will die before the day of election. If 
you survive the day and are elected, you'll die 
before the 4th of March.” He smiled grimly and 
replied: “It really looks that way.”</p>
            <p>My own opinion has always been that if the 
Republicans had nominated Mr. Arthur in 1884 they 
would have elected him. The New York vote would 
scarcely have been so close. In the count of the 
vote the Arthur end of it would have had some 
advantage - certainly no disadvantage. Cleveland's 
nearly 200,000 majority had dwindled to the claim 
of a beggarly few hundred, and it was charged that 
votes which belonged to Butler, who ran as an 
independent labor candidate, were actually counted 
for Cleveland.</p>
            <p>When it was over an old Republican friend of 
mine said: “Now we are even. History will attest 
that we stole it once and you stole it once. Turn 
about may be fair play; but, all the same, neither 
of us likes it.”</p>
            <p>So Grover Cleveland, unheard of outside of Buffalo 
two years before, was to be President of the 
United States. The night preceding his nomination 
for the governorship of New York, General 
<pb id="watterson113" n="113"/>
Slocum seemed in the State convention sure of that 
nomination. Had he received it he would have 
carried the State as Cleveland did, and Slocum, not 
Cleveland, would have been the Chief Magistrate. 
It cost Providence a supreme effort to pull 
Cleveland through. But in his case, as in many another, 
Providence “got there” in fulfilment of a decree 
of Destiny.</p>

            <head>I</head>
            <p><emph rend="bold">THE</emph> futility of political as well as of other 
human reckoning was set forth by the result of 
the presidential election of 1884. With a kind of 
prescience, as I have related, Mr. Blaine had foreseen 
it. He was a sagacious as well as a lovable and 
brilliant man. He looked back affectionately upon 
the days he had passed in Kentucky, when a poor 
school-teacher, and was especially cordial to the 
Kentuckians. In the House he and Beck were 
sworn friends, and they continued their friendship 
when both of them had reached the Senate.</p>
            <p>I inherited Mr. Blaine's desk in the Ways and 
Means Committee room. In one of the drawers of 
<pb id="watterson115" n="115"/>
this he had left a parcel of forgotten papers, which 
I returned to him. He made a joke of the secrets 
they covered and the fortunate circumstance that 
they had fallen into the hands of a friend and not 
of an enemy.</p>
            <p>No man of his time could hold a candle to Mr. 
Blaine in what we call magnetism - that is, in manly 
charm, supported by facility and brain power. 
Clay and Douglas had set the standard of party 
leadership before his time. He made a good third 
to them. I never knew Mr. Clay, but with Judge 
Douglas I was well acquainted, and the difference 
between him and Mr. Blaine in leadership might 
be called negligible.</p>
            <p>Both were intellectually aggressive and individually 
amiable. They at least seemed to love their fellow 
men. Each had been tried by many adventures. 
Each had gone, as it were, “through the flint mill.” 
Born to good conditions - Mr. Blaine sprang from 
aristocratic forebears - each knew by early albeit 
brief experience the seamy side of life; as each, like 
Clay, nursed a consuming passion for the presidency. 
Neither had been made for a subaltern, and 
they chafed under the subaltern yoke to which fate 
had condemned them.</p>
          </div2>
          <pb id="watterson116" n="116"/>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>II</head>
            <p>In Grover Cleveland a total stranger had arrived 
at the front of affairs. The Democrats, after 
a rule of more than half a century, had been out 
of power twenty-four years. They could scarce 
realize at first that they were again in power. The 
new chieftain proved more of an unknown quantity 
than had been suspected. William Dorsheimer, a 
life-long crony, had brought the two of us together 
before Cleveland's election to the governorship of 
the Empire State as one of a group of attractive 
Buffalo men, most of whom might be said to have 
been cronies of mine, Buffalo being a delightful 
halfway stop-over in my frequent migrations 
between Kentucky and the Eastern seaboard. As in 
the end we came to a parting of the ways I want to 
write of Mr. Cleveland as a historian and not as a 
critic.</p>
            <p>He said to Mr. Carlisle after one of our occasional 
tiffs: “Henry will never like me until God 
makes me over again.” The next time we met, 
referring to this, I said: “Mr. President, I like you 
<pb id="watterson117" n="117"/>
very much - very much indeed - but sometimes I 
don't like some of your ways.”</p>
            <p>There were in point of fact two Clevelands - before 
marriage and after marriage - the intermediate 
Cleveland rather unequal and indeterminate. 
Assuredly no one of his predecessors had 
entered the White House so wholly ignorant of 
public men and national affairs. Stories used to be 
told assigning to Zachary Taylor this equivocal 
distinction. But General Taylor had grown up in the 
army and advanced in the military service to a chief 
command, was more or less familiar with the party 
leaders of his time, and was by heredity a 
gentleman. The same was measurably true of Grant. 
Cleveland confessed himself to have had no social 
training, and he literally knew nobody.</p>
            <p>Five or six weeks after his inauguration I went 
to Washington to ask a diplomatic appointment for 
my friend, Boyd Winchester. Ill health had cut 
short a promising career in Congress, but Mr. 
Winchester was now well on to recovery, and there 
seemed no reason why he should not and did not 
stand in the line of preferment. My experience 
may be worth recording because it is illustrative.</p>
            <p>In my quest I had not thought of going beyond 
<pb id="watterson118" n="118"/>
Mr. Bayard, the new Secretary of State. I did go 
to him, but the matter seemed to make no headway. 
There appeared a hitch somewhere. It had not 
crossed my mind that it might be the President 
himself. What did the President know or care about 
foreign appointments?</p>
            <p>He said to me on a Saturday when I was introducing 
a party of Kentucky friends: “Come tip to-morrow 
for luncheon. Come early, for Rose” - his 
sister, for the time being mistress of the White 
House - “will be at church and we can have an 
old-fashioned talk-it-out.”</p>
            <p>The next day we passed the forenoon together. 
He was full of homely and often whimsical talk. 
He told me he had not yet realized what had 
happened to him.</p>
            <p>“Sometimes,” he said, “I wake at night and rub 
my eyes and wonder if it is not all a dream.”</p>
            <p>He asked an infinite number of questions about 
this, that and the other Democratic politician. He 
was having trouble with the Kentucky Congressmen. 
He had appointed a most unlikely scion of a 
well-known family to a foreign mission, and 
another young Kentuckian, the son of a New York 
magnate, to a leading consul generalship, without 
<pb id="watterson119" n="119"/>
consultation with any one. He asked me about 
these. In a way one of them was one of my boys, 
and I was glad to see him get what he wanted, 
though he aspired to nothing so high. He was 
indeed all sorts of a boy, and his elevation to such a 
post was so grotesque that the nomination, like 
that of his mate, was rejected by the Senate. I 
gave the President a serio-comic but kindly 
account, at which he laughed heartily, and ended by 
my asking how he had chanced to make two such 
appointments.</p>
            <p>“Hewitt came over here,” he answered, “and then 
Dorsheimer. The father is the only Democrat we 
have in that great corporation. As to the other, 
he struck me as a likely fellow. It seemed good 
politics to gratify them and their friends.”</p>
            <p>I suggested that such backing was far afield and 
not very safe to go by, when suddenly he said: “I 
have been told over and over again by you and by 
others that you will not take office. Too much of 
a lady, I suppose! What are you hanging round 
Washington for anyhow? What do you want?”</p>
            <p>Here was my opportunity to speak of Winchester, 
and I did so.</p>
            <pb id="watterson120" n="120"/>
            <p>When I had finished he said: “What are you 
doing about Winchester?”</p>
            <p>“Relying on the Secretary of State, who served 
in Congress with him and knows him well.”</p>
            <p>Then he asked: “What do you want for 
Winchester?”</p>
            <p>I answered: “Belgium or Switzerland.”</p>
            <p>He said: “I promised Switzerland for a friend 
of Corning's. He brought him over here yesterday 
and he is an out-and-out Republican who voted for 
Blaine, and I shall not appoint him. If you want 
the place for Winchester, Winchester it is.”</p>
            <p>Next day, much to Mr. Bayard's surprise, the 
commission was made out.</p>
            <p>Mr. Cleveland had a way of sudden fancies to 
new and sometimes queer people. Many of his 
appointments were eccentric and fell like bombshells 
upon the Senate, taking the appointee's home 
people completely by surprise.</p>
            <p>The recommendation of influential politicians 
seemed to have little if any weight with him.</p>
            <p>There came to Washington from Richmond a 
gentleman by the name of Keiley, backed by the 
Virginia delegation for a minor consulship. The 
President at once fell in love with him.</p>

            <pb id="watterson121" n="121"/>
            <p>“Consul be damned,” he said. “He is worth more 
than that,” and named him Ambassador to Vienna.</p>
            <p>It turned out that Mrs. Keiley was a Jewess and 
would not be received at court. Then he named 
him Ambassador to Italy, when it appeared that 
Keiley was an intense Roman Catholic, who had 
made at least one ultramontane speech, and would 
be <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">persona non grata</foreign></hi> at the Quirinal. Then 
Cleveland dropped him. Meanwhile poor Keiley had 
closed out bag and baggage at Richmond and was 
at his wit's end. After much ado the President was 
brought to a realizing sense and a place was found 
for Keiley as consul general and diplomatic agent 
at Cairo, whither he repaired. At the end of the 
four years he came to Paris and one day, crossing 
the Place de la Concorde, he was run over by a 
truck and killed. He deserved a longer career and 
a better fate, for he was a man of real capacity.</p>

            <p>In the case of Mr. Cleveland the break had come 
over the tariff issue. Reading me his first message 
to Congress the day before he sent it in, he had said: 
“I know nothing about the tariff, and I thought 
I had best leave it where you and Morrison had put 
it in the platform.”</p>
            <p>We had indeed had a time in the Platform Committee 
of the Chicago convention of 1884. After 
an unbroken session of fifty hours a straddle was all 
that the committee could be brought to agree upon. 
The leading recalcitrant had been General Butler, 
who was there to make trouble and who later along 
bolted the ticket and ran as an independent candidate.</p>
            <p>One aim of the Democrats was to get away from 
the bloody shirt as an issue. Yet, as the sequel 
proved, it was long after Cleveland's day before the 
<pb id="watterson123" n="123"/>
bloody shirt was laid finally to rest. It required a 
patriot and a hero like William McKinley to do 
this. When he signed the commissions of Joseph 
Wheeler and Fitzhugh Lee, Confederate generals 
and graduates of the West Point Military Academy, 
to be generals in the Army of the United 
States, he made official announcement that the War 
of Sections was over and gave complete amnesty to 
the people and the soldiers of the South.</p>
            <p>Yet the bloody shirt lingered long as a troublemaker, 
and was invoked by both parties.</p>

proved how easily men are led when taken in droves 
and stirred by partyism. Such men either bore 
no part in the fighting when fighting was the order 
of the time, or else they were too ignorant and 
therefore too unpatriotic to comprehend the meaning 
of the intervening years and the glory these 
had brought with the expanse of national progress

at ebullitions of misguided zeal so ignoble; and of

them.</p>
            <p>All the while never a people more eager to get 
together than the people of the United States after 
the War of Sections, as never a people so averse to 
getting into that war. A very small group of 
extremists and doctrinaires had in the beginning made 
a War of Sections possible. Enough of these survived 
in the days of Cleveland and McKinley to 
keep sectionalism alive.</p>
            <p>It was mainly sectional clamor out for partisan 
advantage. But it made the presidential campaigns 
lurid in certain quarters. There was no end of 
objurgation, though it would seem that even the 
<pb id="watterson125" n="125"/>
most embittered Northerner and ultra Republican 
who could couple the names of Robert E. Lee and 
Benedict Arnold, as was often done in campaign 
lingo, would not hesitate, if his passions were roused 
or if he fancied he saw in it some profit to himself 
or his party, to liken George Washington to Judas 
Iscariot.</p>
            <p>The placing of Lee's statue in the Capitol at 
Washington made the occasion for this.</p>
            <p>It is true that long before Confederate officers 
had sat in both Houses of Congress and in Republican 
and Democratic cabinets and upon the bench of 
the Supreme Court, and had served as ambassadors 
and envoys extraordinary in foreign lands. But 
McKinley's doing was the crowning stroke of union 
and peace.</p>
            <p>There had been a weary and varied interim. 
Sectionalism proved a sturdy plant. It died hard. We 
may waive the reconstruction period as ancient 
history. There followed it intense party spirit. Yet, 
in spite of extremists and malignants on both sides 
of the line, the South rallied equally with the 
North to the nation's drumbeat after the Maine 
went down in the harbor of Havana. It fought as 
bravely and as loyally at Santiago and Manila. 
<pb id="watterson126" n="126"/>
Finally, by the vote of the North, there came into 
the Chief Magistracy one who gloried in the 
circumstance that on the maternal side he came of 
fighting Southern stock; who, amid universal 
applause, declared that no Southerner could be 
prouder than he of Robert E. Lee and Stonewall 
Jackson, apotheosizing an uncle, his mother's 
brother, who had stood at the head of the 
Confederate naval establishment in Europe and had 
fitted out the Confederate cruisers, as the noblest 
and purest man he had ever known, a composite of 
Colonel Newcome and Henry Esmond.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile the process of oblivion had gone on. 
The graven effigy of Jefferson Davis at length 
appeared upon the silver service of an American 
battleship. This told the Mississippi's guests, wherever 
and whenever they might meet round her hospitable 
board, of national unification and peace, giving the 
lie to sectional malignancy. In the most famous 
and conspicuous of the national cemeteries now 
stands the monument of a Confederate general not 
only placed there by consent of the Government, 
but dedicated with fitting ceremonies supervised by 
the Department of War, which sent as its official 
<pb id="watterson127" n="127"/>
representative the son of Grant, himself an army 
officer of rank and distinction.</p>
            <p>The world has looked on, incredulous and 
amazed, whilst our country has risen to each 
successive act in the drama of reconciliation with 
increasing enthusiasm.</p>
            <p>I have been all my life a Constitutional Nationalist; 
first the nation and then the state. The 
episode of the Confederacy seems already far away. 
It was an interlude, even as matters stood in the 
Sixties and Seventies, and now he who would 
thwart the unification of the country on the lines of 
oblivion, of mutual and reciprocal forgiveness, 
throws himself across the highway of his country's 
future, and is a traitor equally to the essential 
principles of free government and the spirit of the age.</p>
            <p>If sectionalism be not dead it should have no 
place in popular consideration. The country seems 
happily at last one with itself. The South, like 
the East and the West, has come to be the merest 
geographic expression. Each of its states is in the 
Union, precisely like the states of the East and the 
West, all in one and one in all. Interchanges of 
every sort exist.</p>
            <p>These exchanges underlie and interlace our social,
<pb id="watterson128" n="128"/>
domestic and business fabric. That the 
arrangement and relation after half a century of 
strife thus established should continue through all 
time is the hope and prayer of every thoughtful, 
patriotic American. There is no greater dissonance 
to that sentiment in the South than in the North. 
To what end, therefore, except ignominious recrimination 
and ruinous dissension, could a revival of old 
sectional and partisan passions - if it were possible 
- be expected to reach?</p>

            <p>Humor has played no small part in our politics. 
It was Col. Mulberry Sellers, Mark Twain's hero, 
who gave currency to the conceit and enunciated the 
principle of “the old flag and an appropriation.” He 
did not claim the formula as his own, however. He 
got it, he said, of Senator Dillworthy, his patriotic 
file leader and ideal of Christian statesmanship.</p>
            <p>The original of Senator Dillworthy was recognized 
the country over as Senator Pomeroy, of 
Kansas, “Old Pom,” as he had come to be called, 
whose oleaginous piety and noisy patriotism, 
adjusting themselves with equal facility to the 
<pb id="watterson129" n="129"/>
purloining of subsidies and the roasting of rebels, to 
prayer and land grants, had impressed themselves 
upon the Satirist of the Gilded Age as upon his 
immediate colleagues in Congress. He was a ruffle-shirted 
Pharisee, who affected the airs of a bishop, 
and resembled Cruikshank's pictures of Pecksniff.</p>
            <p>There have not been many “Old Poms” in our 
public life; or, for that matter Aaron Burrs either, 
and but one Benedict Arnold. That the chosen 
people of God did not dwell amid the twilight of the 
ages and in far-away Judea, but were reserved to a 
later time, and a region then undiscovered of men, 
and that the American republic was ordained of 
God to illustrate upon the theater of the New 
World the possibilities of free government in 
contrast with the failures and tyrannies and 
corruptions of the Old, I do truly believe. That is the 
first article in my confession of faith. And the 
second is like unto it, that Washington was raised 
up by God to create it, and that Lincoln was raised 
up by God to save it; else why the militia colonel 
of Virginia and the rail splitter of Illinois, for no 
reason that was obvious at the time, before all other 
men? God moves in a mysterious way his wonders 
to perform. The star of the sublime destiny that
<pb id="watterson130" n="130"/>
hung over the <sic corr="manger">manager</sic> of our blessed Savior hung 
over the cradle of our blessed Union.</p>
            <p>Thus far it has weathered each historic danger 
which has gone before to mark the decline and fall 
of nations; the struggle for existence; the foreign 
invasion; the internecine strife; the disputed 
succession; religious bigotry and racial conflict. One 
other peril confronts it - the demoralization of 
wealth and luxury; too great prosperity; the 
concentration and the abuse of power. Shall we 
survive the lures with which the spirit of evil, playing 
upon our self-love, seeks to trip our wayward footsteps, 
purse-pride and party spirit, mistaken zeal 
and perverted religion, fanaticism seeking to 
abridge liberty and liberty running to license, greed 
masquerading as a patriot and ambition making a 
commodity of glory - or under the process of a 
divine evolution shall we be able to mount and ride 
the waves which swallowed the tribes of Israel, 
which engulfed the phalanxes of Greece and the 
legions of Rome, and which still beat the sides and 
sweep the decks of Europe?</p>
            <p>The one-party power we have escaped; the one-man 
power we have escaped. The stars in their 
courses fight for us; the virtue and intelligence of 
<pb id="watterson131" n="131"/>
the people are still watchful and alert. Truth is 
mightier than ever, and justice, mounting guard 
even in the Hall of Statues, walks everywhere the 
battlements of freedom!</p>

            <p><emph rend="bold">THERE</emph> were, as I have said, two Grover 
Clevelands - before and after marriage - and, 
it might be added, between his defeat in 1888 and 
his election in 1892. He was so sure of his election 
in 1888 that he could not be induced to see the 
danger of the situation in his own State of New 
York, where David Bennett Hill, who had succeeded 
him in the governorship, was a candidate for 
reëlection, and whom he personally detested, had 
become the ruling party force. He lost the State, 
and with it the election, while Hill won, and thereby 
arose an ugly faction fight.</p>
            <p>I did not believe as the quadrennial period 
approached in 1892 that Mr. Cleveland could be 
elected. I still think he owed his election, and 
<pb id="watterson133" n="133"/>
Harrison his defeat, to the Homestead riots of the 
mid-summer, which transferred the labor vote bodily 
from the Republicans to the Democrats. Mainly 
on account of this belief I opposed his nomination 
that year.</p>
            <p>In the Kentucky State Convention I made my 
opposition resonant, if not effective. “I understand,” 
I said in an address to the assembled delegates, 
“that you are all for Grover Cleveland?”</p>
            <p>There came an affirmative roar.</p>
            <p>“Well,” I continued, “I am not, and if you send 
me to the National Convention I will not vote for 
his nomination, if his be the only name presented, 
because I firmly believe that his nomination will 
mean the marching through a slaughter-house to an 
open grave, and I refuse to be party to such a 
folly.”</p>
            <p>The answer of the convention was my appointment 
by acclamation, but it was many a day before 
I heard the last of my unlucky figure of speech.</p>
            <p>Notwithstanding this splendid indorsement, I
went to the National Convention feeling very like
the traditional “poor boy at a frolic.” All seemed
to me lost save honor and conviction. I had 
become the embodiment of my own epigram, “a tariff
		
<pb id="watterson134" n="134"/>
for revenue only.” Mr. Cleveland, in the beginning 
very much taken by it, had grown first lukewarm 
and then frightened. His “Free Trade” 
message of 1887 had been regarded by the party 
as an answering voice. But I knew better.</p>
            <p>In the national platform, over the protest of 
Whitney, his organizer, and Vilas, his spokesman, 
I had forced him to stand on that gospel. He flew 
into a rage and threatened to modify, if not to 
repudiate, the plank in his letter of acceptance. We 
were still on friendly terms and, upon reaching 
home, I wrote him the following letter. It 
reads like ancient history, but, as the quarrel which 
followed cut a certain figure in the political 
chronicle of the time, the correspondence may not 
be historically out of date, or biographically 
uninteresting:</p>

            <head>II</head>
            <head>MR. WATTERSON TO MR. CLEVELAND</head>
            <opener><dateline>Courier-Journal Office, Louisville, <date>July 9, 1892.</date></dateline> 
<salute>- My Dear Mr. President:</salute></opener>
            <p> I inclose you two editorial 
articles from the Courier-Journal, and, that 
their spirit and purpose may not be misunderstood 
<pb id="watterson135" n="135"/>
by you, I wish to add a word or two of a kind 
directly and entirely personal.</p>
            <p>To a man of your robust understanding and 
strong will, opposition and criticism are apt to be  
taken as more or less unfriendly; and, as you are 
at present advised, I can hardly expect that any 
words of mine will be received by you with sentiments 
either of confidence or favor.</p>
            <p>I was admonished by a certain distrust, if not disdain, 
visited upon the honest challenge I ventured 
to offer your Civil Service policy, when you were 
actually in office, that you did not differ from some 
other great men I have known in an unwillingness, 
or at least an inability, to accept, without resentment, 
the question of your infallibility. Nevertheless, 
I was then, as I am now, your friend, and 
not your enemy, animated by the single purpose to 
serve the country, through you, as, wanting your 
great opportunities, I could not serve it through 
myself.</p>
            <p>During the four years when you were President, 
I asked you but for one thing that lay near my 
heart. You granted that handsomely; and, if you 
had given me all you had to give beside, you could 
not have laid me under greater obligation. It is a 
<pb id="watterson136" n="136"/>
gratification to me to know, and it ought to be some 
warrant both of my intelligence and fidelity for 
you to remember that that matter resulted in credit 
to the Administration and benefit to the public 
service.</p>
            <p>But to the point; I had at St. Louis in 1888 and 
at Chicago, the present year, to oppose what was 
represented as your judgment and desire in the 
adoption of a tariff plank in our national platform; 
successfully in both cases. The inclosed articles set 
forth the reasons forcing upon me a different 
conclusion from yours, in terms that may appear to 
you bluntly specific, but I hope not personally 
offensive; certainly not by intention, for, whilst I 
would not suppress the truth to please you or any 
man, I have a decent regard for the sensibilities 
and the rights of all men, particularly of men so 
eminent as to be beyond the reach of anything except 
insolence and injustice. Assuredly in your 
case, I am incapable of even so much as the covert 
thought of either, entertaining for you absolute 
respect and regard. But, my dear Mr. President, I 
do not think that you appreciate the overwhelming 
force of the revenue reform issue, which has made 
you its idol.</p>
            <p>
              <figure id="figure4" entity="watter136">
                <p>A CORNER OF “MASFIELD”—HOME OF HENRY WATTERSON</p>
              </figure>
            </p>
            <pb id="watterson137" n="137"/>
            <p>If you will allow me to say so, in perfect frankness 
and without intending to be rude or unkind, 
the gentlemen immediately about you, gentlemen 
upon whom you rely for material aid and energetic 
party management, are not, as to the Tariff, Democrats 
at all; and have little conception of the place 
in the popular mind and heart held by the Revenue 
Reform idea, or, indeed of any idea, except that of 
organization and money.</p>
            <p>Of the need of these latter, no man has a more 
realizing sense, or larger information and experience, 
than I have. But they are merely the brakes 
and wheels of the engine, to which principles and 
inspirations are, and must always be, the elements 
of life and motion. It is to entreat you therefore, 
in your coming letter and address, not to 
underestimate the tremendous driving power of this 
Tariff issue, and to beg you, not even to seem to 
qualify it, or to abridge its terms in a mistaken 
attempt to seem to be conservative.</p>
            <p>You cannot escape your great message of 1887 
if you would. I know it by heart, and I think that 
I perfectly apprehend its scope and tenor. Take 
it as your guiding star. Stand upon it. Reiterate 
<pb id="watterson138" n="138"/>
it. Emphasize it, amplify it, but do not subtract 
a thought, do not erase a word. For every vote 
which a bold front may lose you in the East you will 
gain two votes in the West. In the East, particularly 
in New York, enemies lurk in your very cupboard, 
and strike at you from behind your chair 
at table. There is more than a fighting chance for
Illinois, Iowa, and Minnesota, and next to a certainty
in Wisconsin, Michigan, and Indiana, if you 
put yourself personally at the head of the column 
which is moving in your name, supposing it to be 
another name for reduced taxes and freer 
exchanges.</p>
            <p>Discouraged as I was by the condition of things 
in New York and Indiana prior to the Chicago 
Convention, depressed and almost hopeless by your 
nomination, I can see daylight, if you will relax 
your grip somewhat upon the East and throw yourself 
confidently upon the West.</p>
            <p>I write warmly because I feel warmly. If you 
again occupy the White House, and it is my most 
constant and earnest prayer that you may, be sure 
that you will not be troubled by me. I cannot hope 
that my motives in opposing your nomination, 
<pb id="watterson139" n="139"/>
consistent as you know them to have been, or that my 
conduct during the post-convention discussion and 
canvass, free as I know it to have been of ill-feeling, 
or distemper, has escaped misrepresentation and 
misconception. I could not, without the loss of my 
self-respect, approach you on any private matter 
whatever; though it may not be amiss for me to say 
to you, that three weeks before the meeting of the 
National Convention, I wrote to Mr. Gorman and 
Mr. Brice urging the withdrawal of any opposition, 
and declaring that I would be a party to no 
movement to work the two-thirds rule to defeat the 
will of the majority.</p>
            <p>This is all I have to say, Mr. President, and you 
can believe it or not, as you please; though you 
ought to know that I would write you nothing except 
in sincere conviction, nor speak to you, or of 
you, except in a candid and kindly spirit.</p>

that this will find you hale, hearty, and happy, 
I am, dear sir, your fellow democrat and most 
faithful friend,</salute>

<salute>MY DEAR MR. WATTERSON:</salute></opener>
              <p>I have received your letter and the clippings you 
inclosed.</p>
              <p>I am not sure that I understand perfectly all
that they mean. One thing they demonstrate 
beyond any doubt, to-wit: that you have not - I think
I may say - the slightest conception of my disposition. 
It may be that I know as little about yours.
I am surprised by the last paragraph of The
Courier-Journal article of July 8 and amazed to
read the statements contained in your letter, that
you know the message of 1887 by heart. It is a
matter of very small importance, but I hope you
will allow me to say, that in all the platform smashing 
you ever did, you never injured nor inspired
me that I have ever seen or heard of, except that of
1888. I except that, so I may be exactly correct
		
<pb id="watterson141" n="141"/>
when I write, “seen or heard of,” - for I use the 
words literally.</p>
              <p>I would like very much to present some views to 
you relating to the tariff position, but I am afraid 
to do so.</p>
              <p>I will, however, venture to say this: If we are 
defeated this year, I predict a Democratic wandering 
in the dark wilds of discouragement for twenty-five 
years. I do not purpose to be at all responsible 
for such a result. I hope all others upon whom 
rests the least responsibility will fully appreciate it.</p>
              <p>The world will move on when both of us are dead. 
While we stay, and especially while we are in any 
way concerned in political affairs and while we are 
members of the same political brotherhood, let us 
both resolve to be just and modest and amiable.</p>

              <p>I do 
not see how you could misunderstand the spirit in 
<pb id="watterson142" n="142"/>
which I wrote, or be offended by my plain words. 
They were addressed as from one friend to another,  
as from one Democrat to another. If you entertain 
the idea that this is a false view of our relative 
positions, and that your eminence lifts you above
both comradeship and counsels, I have nothing to 
say except to regret that, in underestimating your 
breadth of character I exposed myself too contumely.</p>
              <p>You do, indeed, ride a wave of fortune and favor. 
You are quite beyond the reach of insult, real or 
fancied. You could well afford to be more tolerant.</p>
              <p>In answer to the ignorance of my service to the 
Democratic party, which you are at such pains to 
indicate - and, particularly, with reference to the 
sectional issue and the issue of tariff reform - I 
might, if I wanted to be unamiable, suggest to you 
a more attentive perusal of the proceedings of the 
three national conventions which nominated you for 
President.</p>
              <p>But I purpose nothing of the sort. In the last 
five national conventions my efforts were decisive 
in framing the platform of the party. In each of 
them I closed the debate, moved the previous question 
and was sustained by the convention. In all 
<pb id="watterson143" n="143"/>
of them, except the last, I was a maker, not a 
smasher. Touching what happened at Chicago, the 
present year, I had a right, in common with good 
Democrats, to be anxious; and out of that sense of 
anxiety alone I wrote you.</p>
              <closer> <salute>I am sorry that my 
temerity was deemed by you intrusive and, entering 
a respectful protest against a ban which I cannot 
believe to be deserved by me, and assuring you 
that I shall not again trouble you in that way, I 
am, your obedient servant,</salute>

            <p>This ended my personal relations with Mr. 
Cleveland. Thereafter we did not speak as we passed 
by. He was a hard man to get on with. Overcredulous, 
though by no means excessive, in his 
likes, very tenacious in his dislikes, suspicious 
withal, he grew during his second term in the White 
House, exceedingly “high and mighty,” suggesting 
somewhat the “stuffed prophet,” of Mr. Dana's 
relentless lambasting and verifying my insistence 
that he posed rather as an idol to be worshiped, 
<pb id="watterson144" n="144"/>
than a leader to be trusted and loved. He was in
truth a strong man, who, sufficiently mindful of
his limitations in the beginning, grew by unexampled
and continued success overconfident and overconscious 
in his own conceit. He had a real desire
to serve the country. But he was apt to think that
he alone could effectively serve it. In one of our
spats I remember saying to him, “You seem, Mr.
President, to think you are the only pebble on
the beach - the one honest and brave man in the
party - but let me assure you of my own knowledge
that there are others.” His answer was, “Oh,
you go to - !”</p>
            <p>He split his party wide open. The ostensible 
cause was the money issue. But, underlying this, 
there was a deal of personal embitterment. Had 
he been a man of foresight - or even of ordinary 
discernment - be might have held it together and 
with it behind him have carried the gold standard.</p>
            <p>I had contended for a sound currency from the 
outset of the fiscal contention, fighting first the
green-back craze and then the free silver craze 
against an overwhelming majority in the West and 
South, nowhere more radically relentless than in 
Kentucky. Both movements had their origin on 
<pb id="watterson145" n="145"/>
economic fallacies and found their backing in 
dishonest purpose to escape honest indebtedness.</p>
            <p>Through Mr. Cleveland the party of Jefferson, 
Jackson, and Tilden was converted from a Democrat 
into a Populist, falling into the arms of Mr. 
Bryan, whose domination proved as baleful in one 
way as Mr. Cleveland's had been in another, the 
final result shipwreck, with the extinguishment of 
all but the label.</p>
            <p>Mr. Bryan was a young man of notable gifts of 
speech and boundless self-assertion. When he 
found himself well in the saddle he began to rule 
despotically and to ride furiously. A party leader 
more short-sighted could hardly be imagined. None 
of his judgments came true. As a consequence the 
Republicans for a long time had everything their 
own way, and, save for the Taft-Roosevelt quarrel, 
might have held their power indefinitely. All 
history tells us that the personal equation must be 
reckoned with in public life. Assuredly it cuts no 
mean figure in human affairs. And, when politicians 
fall out - well - the other side comes in.</p>

          <head>STEPHEN FOSTER, THE SONG WRITER - A FRIEND 
<lb/>COMES TO THE RESCUE OF HIS ORIGINALITY -  
<lb/>“MY OLD KENTUCKY HOME” AND “OLD FOLKS 
<lb/>AT HOME” - GENERAL SHERMAN AND “MARCHING 
<lb/>THROUGH GEORGIA.”</head>
          <p><emph rend="bold">I HAVE</emph> received many letters touching what I 
said a little while ago of Stephen Collins 
Foster, the song writer. In that matter I had, and 
could have had, no unkindly thought or purpose. 
The story of the musical scrapbook rested not with 
me, but as I stated, upon the averment of Will S. 
Hays, a rival song writer. But that the melody of 
Old Folks at Home may be found in Schubert's 
posthumous Rosemonde admits not of contradiction 
for there it is, and this would seem to be in 
some sort corroborative evidence of the truth of 
Hays' story.</p>
          <p>Among these letters comes one from Young E. 
Allison which is entitled to serious consideration. 
<pb id="watterson147" n="147"/>
Mr. Allison is a gentleman of the first order of 
character and culture, an editor and a musician, 
and what he writes cannot fail to carry with it very 
great weight. I need make no apology for quoting 
him at length.</p>
          <p>“I have long been collecting material about 
Foster from his birth to his death,” says Mr.
Allison, “and aside from his weak and fatal love of 
drink, which developed after he was twenty-five, 
and had married, his life was one continuous 
devotion to the study of music, of painting, of poetry
and of languages; in point of fact, of all the arts 
that appeal to one who feels within him the stir of 
the creative. He was, quite singularly enough, a 
fine mathematician, which undoubtedly aided him 
in the study of music as a science, to which time and 
balance play such an important part. In fact, I 
believe it was the mathematical devil in his brain 
that came to hold him within such bare and 
primitive forms of composition and so, to some 
extent, to delimit the wider development of his genius.</p>
          <p>“Now as to Foster's drinking habits, however 
unfortunate they proved to him they did not affect 
the quality of his art as he bequeathed it to us. No 
one cares to recall the unhappy fortunes of Burns, 
<pb id="watterson148" n="148"/>
De Musset, Chopin or - even in our own time - of 
O. Henry, and others who might be named. In 
none of their productions does the hectic fever of 
over-stimulation show itself. No purer, gentler or 
simpler aspirations were ever expressed in the varying 
forms of music and verse than flowed from 
Foster' s pen, even as penetrating benevolence came 
from the pen of O. Henry, embittered and solitary 
as his life had been. Indeed when we come to 
regard what the drinkers of history have done for the 
world in spite of the artificial stimulus they craved, 
we may say with Lincoln as Lincoln said of Grant, 
‘Send the other generals some of the same brand.’</p>
          <p>“Foster was an aristocrat of aristocrats, both by 
birth and gifts. He inherited the blood of Richard 
Steele and of the Kemble family, noted in English 
letters and dramatic annals. To these artistic 
strains he added undoubtedly the musical temperament 
of an Italian grandmother or great-grandmother. 
He was a cousin of John Rowan, the 
distinguished Kentucky lawyer and senator. Of 
Foster's family, his father, his brothers, his sisters 
were all notable as patriots, as pioneers in 
engineering, in commerce and in society. One of his 
brothers designed and built the early Pennsylvania 
<pb id="watterson149" n="149"/>
Railroad system and died executive vice-president 
of that great corporation. Thus he was born to the 
arts and to social distinction. But, like many men 
of the creative temperament, he was born a solitary, 
destined to live in a land of dreams. The singular 
beauty and grace of his person and countenance, 
the charm of his voice, manner and conversation, 
were for the most part familiar to the limited circle 
of his immediate family and friends. To others he 
was reticent, with a certain hauteur of timidity, 
avoiding society and public appearances to the day 
of his death.</p>
          <p>“Now those are the facts about Foster. They 
certainly do not describe the ‘ne'er-do-well of a 
good family’ who hung round barrooms, colored-minstrel 
haunts and theater entrances. I can find 
only one incident to show that Foster ever went to 
hear his own songs sung in public. He was 
essentially a solitary, who, while keenly observant of 
and entering sympathizingly into the facts of life, 
held himself aloof from immediate contact with its 
crowded stream. He was solitary from sensitivity, 
not from bitterness or indifference. He made a 
large fortune for his day with his songs and was a 
popular idol.</p>
          <pb id="watterson150" n="150"/>
          <p>“Let us come now to the gravamen of my complaint. 
You charge on the authority of mere gossip 
from the late Will S. Hays, that Foster did not 
compose his own music, but that he had obtained 
a collection of unpublished manuscripts by an 
unnamed old ‘German musician and thus dishonestly, 
by pilfering and suppression’ palmed off upon the 
public themes and compositions which he could not 
himself have originated. Something like this has 
been said about every composer and writer, big and 
little, whose personality and habits did not impress 
his immediate neighbors as implying the possession 
of genius. The world usually expects direct 
inheritance and a theatric impressiveness of genius in 
its next-door neighbor before it accepts the proof 
of his works alone. For that reason Napoleon's 
paternity in Corsica was ascribed to General 
Maboeuf, and Henry Clay's in early Kentucky to 
Patrick Henry. That legend of the ‘poor, 
unknown German musician’ who composed in poverty 
and secrecy the deathless songs that have obsessed 
the world of music lovers, has been told of numberless 
young composers on their way to fame, but 
died out in the blaze of their later work. I have no 
doubt they told it of Foster, as they did also of 
<pb id="watterson151" n="151"/>
Hays. And Colonel Hays doubtless repeated it to 
you as the intimate gossip about Foster.</p>
          <p>“I have an article written by Colonel Hays and 
published in and cut from The Courier-Journal 
some twelve years after the composer's death, in 
which he sketches the life and work of Stephen Collins 
Foster. In that article he lays especial stress 
upon the surprising originality of the Foster 
themes and of their musical setting. He praises 
their distinct American or rather native inspiration 
and flavor, and describes from his own knowledge 
of Foster how they were ‘written from his heart.’ 
No mention or suggestion in it of any German or 
other origin for any of those melodies that the world 
then and now cherishes as American in costume, but 
universal in appeal. While you may have heard 
something in Schubert's compositions that suggested 
something in Foster's most famous song, 
still I venture to say it was only a suggestion, such 
as often arises from the works of composers of the 
same general type. Schubert and Foster were both 
young sentimentalists and dreamers who must have 
had similar dreams that found expression in their 
similar progressions.</p>
          <p>“The German musicians from whom Foster got
<pb id="watterson152" n="152"/>
inspiration to work were Beethoven, Glück, Weber, 
Mozart. He was a student of all of them and of 
the Italian school also, as some of his songs show. 
Foster's first and only music teacher - except in the 
‘do-re-mi’ exercises in his schoolboy life - testifies 
that Foster's musical apprehension was so quick, 
his intuitive grasp of its science so complete that 
after a short time there was nothing he could teach 
him of the theory of composition; that his pupil 
went straight to the masters and got illustration 
and discipline for himself.</p>
          <p>“This was to be expected of a precocious genius
who had written a concerted piece for flutes at
thirteen, who was trying his wings on love songs at
sixteen, and before he was twenty-one had 
composed several of the most famous of his American
melodies, among them Oh Susannah, Old Dog Tray
and Old Uncle Ned. As in other things he taught
himself music, but he studied it ardently at the
shrines of the masters. He became a master of the
art of song writing. If anybody cares to hunt up
the piano scores that Verdi made of songs from his
operas in the days of Foster he will find that the
great Italian composer's settings were quite as thin
as Foster's and exhibited not much greater art. It
		
<pb id="watterson153" n="153"/>
was the fault of the times on the piano, not of the 
composers. It was not till long afterward that the 
color capacities of the piano were developed. As 
Foster was no pianist, but rather a pure melodist, 
he could not be expected to surpass his times in the 
management of the piano, the only ‘orchestra’ he 
had. It will not do to regard Foster as a crude 
musician. His own scores reveal him as the most 
artful of ‘artless’ composers.</p>
          <p>“It is not even presumption to speak of him in 
the same breath with Verdi. The breadth and 
poignancy of Foster's melodies entitle them to the 
highest critical respect, as they have received worldwide 
appreciation from great musicians and plain 
music lovers. Wherever he has gone he has reached 
the popular heart. Here in the United States he 
has quickened the pulse beats of four generations. 
But this master creator of a country's only native 
songs has invariably here at home been apologized 
for as a sort of ‘cornfield musician,’ a mere banjo 
strummer, a hanger-on at barrooms where minstrel 
quartets rendered his songs and sent the hat round. 
The reflection will react upon his country; it will 
not detract from the real Foster when the 
constructive critic appears to write his brief and 
<pb id="watterson154" n="154"/>
unfortunate life. I am not contending that he was a 
genius of the highest rank, although he had the 
distinction that great genius nearly always achieves, of 
creating a school that produced many imitators and 
established a place apart for itself in the world's 
estimation. In ballad writing he did for the United 
States what Watteau did for painting in France. 
As Watteau found a Flemish school in France and 
left a French school stamped forever, so Foster 
found the United States a home for imitations of 
English, Irish, German and Italian songs, and left 
a native ballad form and melodic strain forever 
impressed upon it as pure American.</p>
          <p>“He was like Watteau in more than that. 
Watteau took the elegancies and fripperies of the 
corrupt French court and fixed them in art 
immortal, as if the moment had been arrested and held 
in actual motion. Foster took the curious and 
melancholy spectacle of African slavery at its 
height, superimposed by the most elegant and 
picturesque social manners this country has known, 
at the moment the institution was at its zenith. He 
saw the glamor, the humor, the tragedy, the 
contrasts, the emotional depths - that lay unplumbed 
beneath it all. He fixed it there for all time, for 
<pb id="watterson155" n="155"/>
all hearts and minds everywhere. His songs are not 
only the pictorial canvas of that time, they are the 
emotional history of the times. It was done by a 
boy who was not prophet enough to foresee the end, 
or philosopher enough to demonstrate the conditions, 
but who was born with the intuition to feel it 
all and set it forth deeply and truly from every 
aspect.</p>
          <p>“While Foster wrote many comic songs there is 
ever in them something of the melancholy 
undercurrent that has been detected under the laces and 
arabesques of Chopin's nominally frivolous dances. 
Foster's ballad form was extremely attenuated, but 
the melodic content filled it so completely that it 
seems to strain at the bounds and must be repeated 
and repeated to furnish full gratification to the ear. 
His form when compared with the modern ballad's 
amplitude seems like a Tanagra figurine beside a 
Michelangelo statue - but the figurine is as fine in 
its scope as the statue is in the greater.</p>
          <p>“I hope you will think Foster over and revise 
him ‘upward.’ ”</p>
          <p>All of us need to be admonished to speak no evil
of the dead. I am trying in Looking Backward to
square the adjuration with the truth. Perhaps I
		
<pb id="watterson156" n="156"/>
should speak only of that which is known directly 
to myself. It costs me nothing to accept this 
statement of Mr. Allison and to incorporate it as an 
essential part of the record as far as it relates to 
the most famous and in his day the most beloved 
of American song writers.</p>
          <p>Once at a Grand Army encampment General 
Sherman and I were seated together on the platform 
when the band began to play Marching 
Through Georgia, when the general said rather 
impatiently: “I wish I had a dollar for every time I 
have had to listen to that blasted tune.”</p>
          <p>And I answered: “Well, there is another tune 
about which I might say the same thing,” meaning 
My Old Kentucky Home.</p>
          <p>Neither of us was quite sincere. Both were 
unconsciously pleased to hear the familiar strains. At 
an open-air fiesta in Barcelona some American 
friends who made their home there put the bandmaster 
up to breaking forth with the dear old melody 
as I came down the aisle, and I was mightily 
pleased. Again at a concert in Lucerne, the band, 
playing a potpourri of Swiss songs, interpolated 
Kentucky's national anthem and the group of us 
stood up and sang the chorus.</p>
          <pb id="watterson157" n="157"/>
          <p>I do not wonder that men march joyously to 
battle and death to drum and fife squeaking and 
rattling The Girl I Left Behind Me. It may be a
long way to Tipperary, but it is longer to the end 
of the tether that binds the heart of man to the 
cradle songs of his nativity. With the cradle songs 
of America the name of Stephen Collins Foster 
“is immortal bound,” and I would no more dishonor 
his memory than that of Robert Burns or 
the author of The Star-Spangled Banner.</p>

            <p><emph rend="bold">IT</emph> is not an easy nor yet a wholly congenial task
to write - truthfully, intelligently and frankly 
to write - about Theodore Roosevelt. He belonged 
to the category of problematical characters. A 
born aristocrat, he at no time took the trouble to 
pose as a special friend of the people; a born leader, 
he led with a rough unsparing hand. He was the 
soul of controversy. To one who knew him from 
his childhood as I did, always loving him and rarely 
agreeing with him, it was plain to see how his most 
obvious faults commended him to the multitude and 
made for a popularity that never quite deserted 
him.</p>
            <p>As poorly as I rate the reign of majorities I 
<pb id="watterson159" n="159"/>
prefer it to the one-man power, either elective or 
dynastic. The scheme of a third term in the presidency 
for General Grant seemed to me a conspiracy 
though with many of its leaders I was on terms of 
affectionate intimacy. I fought and helped to kill 
in 1896 the unborn scheme to give Mr. Cleveland a 
third term. Inevitably as the movement for the 
retention of Theodore Roosevelt beyond the time 
already fixed began to show itself in 1907, my pen 
was primed against it and I wrote variously and 
voluminously.</p>
            <p>There appeared in one of the periodicals for
January, 1908, a sketch of mine which but for a
statement issued concurrently from the White
House would have attracted more attention than it
did. In this I related how at Washington just 
before the War of Sections I had a musical pal - the
niece of a Southern senator - who had studied in
Paris, been a protégée of the Empress Eugénie and
become an out-and-out imperialist. Louis Napoleon
was her ideal statesman. She not only hated the
North but accepted as gospel truth all the misleading 
theories of the South: that cotton was king;
that slavery was a divine institution; that in any
		
<pb id="watterson160" n="160"/>
enterprise one Southern man was a match for six 
Northern men.</p>
            <p>On these points we had many contentions. When 
the break came she went South with her family. 
The last I saw of her was crossing Long Bridge in 
a lumbering family carriage waving a tiny 
Confederate flag.</p>
            <p>Forty-five years intervened. I had heard of her 
from time to time wandering aimlessly over 
Europe, but had not met her until the preceding winter 
in a famous Southern homestead. There she led 
me into a rose garden, and seated beneath its clustered 
greeneries she said with an air of triumph, 
“Now you see, my dear old friend, that I was right 
and you were wrong all the time.”</p>
            <p>Startled, and altogether forgetful, I asked in 
what way.</p>
            <p>“Why,” she answered, “at last the South is coming 
to its own.”</p>
            <p>Still out of rapport with her thought I said something 
about the obliteration of sectionalism and the 
arrival of political freedom and general prosperity. 
She would none of this.</p>
            <p>“I mean,” she abruptly interposed, “that the son 
<figure id="figure5" entity="watter160"><p>HENRY WATTERSON (PHOTOGRAPH TAKEN IN FLORIDA)</p></figure>
<pb id="watterson161" n="161"/>
of Martha Bullock has come to his own and he will 
rescue us from the mudsills of the North.”</p>
            <p>She spoke as if our former discussions had been 
but yesterday. Then I gave her the right of way, 
interjecting a query now and then to give emphasis 
to her theme, while she unfolded the plan which 
seemed to her so simple and easy; God's own will; 
the national destiny, first a third term, and then 
life tenure à la Louis Napoleone for Theodore 
Roosevelt, the son of Martha Bullock, the nephew 
of our great admiral, who was to redress all the 
wrongs of the South and bring the Yankees to their 
just deserts at last.</p>
            <p>“If,” I ended my sketch, “out of the mouths of 
babes and sucklings, why not out of the brain of 
this crazed old woman of the South?”</p>
            <p>Early in the following April I came from my 
winter home in Florida to the national capital, and 
the next day was called by the President to the 
White House.</p>
            <p>“The first thing I want to ask,” said he, “is 
whether that old woman was a real person or a 
figment of your imagination?”</p>
            <p>“She was a figment of my imagination,” I answered, 
“but you put her out of business with a 
<pb id="watterson162" n="162"/>
single punch. Why didn't you hold back your 
statement a bit? If you had done so there was room 
for lots of sport ahead.”</p>
            <p>He was in no mood for joking. “Henry Watterson,” 
he said, “I want to talk to you seriously about 
this third-term business. I will not deny that I 
have thought of the thing - thought of it a great 
deal.” Then he proceeded to relate from his point 
of view the state of the country and the immediate 
situation. He spoke without reserve of his relations 
to the nearest associated public men, of what 
were and what were not his personal and party 
obligations, his attitude toward the political 
questions of the moment, and ended by saying, “What 
do you make of all this?”</p>
            <p>“Mr. President,” I replied, “you know that I am 
your friend, and as your friend I tell you that if 
you go out of here the fourth of next March placing 
your friend Taft in your place you will make 
a good third to Washington and Lincoln; but if you 
allow these wild fellows willy-nilly to induce you, 
in spite of your declaration, to accept the nomination, 
substantially for a third term, all issues will 
be merged in that issue, and in my judgment you 
will not carry a state in the Union.”</p>
            <pb id="watterson163" n="163"/>
            <p>As if much impressed and with a show of feeling 
he said: “It may be so. At any rate I will not do 
it. If the convention nominates me I will promptly 
send my declination. If it nominates me and adjourns 
I will call it together again and it will have 
to name somebody else.”</p>
            <p>As an illustration of the implacability which 
pursued him I may mention that among many leading 
Republicans to whom I related the incident most 
of them discredited his sincerity, one of them - a 
man of national importance - expressing the 
opinion that all along he was artfully playing for 
the nomination. This I do not believe. Perhaps he 
was never quite fixed in his mind. The presidency 
is a wondrous lure. Once out of the White House

            <head>II</head>
            <p>Upon his return from one of his several foreign 
journeys a party of some hundred or more of his 
immediate personal friends gave him a private dinner 
at a famous uptown restaurant. I was placed 
next him at table. It goes without saying that 
we had all sorts of a good time - he Cæsar and I 
<pb id="watterson164" n="164"/>
Brutus - the prevailing joke the entente between 
the two.</p>
            <p>“I think,” he began his very happy speech, “that 
I am the bravest man that ever lived, for here I 
have been sitting three hours by the side of Brutus 
- have repeatedly seen him clutch his knife - without 
the blink of an eye or the turn of a feature.”</p>
            <p>To which in response when my turn came I said: 
“You gentlemen seem to be surprised that there 
should be so perfect an understanding between our 
guest and myself. But there is nothing new or 
strange in that. It goes back, indeed, to his cradle 
and has never been disturbed throughout the intervening 
years of political discussion - sometimes 
acrimonious. At the top of the acclivity of his 
amazing career - in the very plenitude of his eminence 
and power - let me tell you that he offered 
me one of the most honorable and distinguished 
appointments within his gift.”</p>
            <p>“Tell them about that, Marse Henry,” said he.</p>
            <p>“With your permission, Mr. President, I will,” 
I said, and continued: “The centenary of the 
West Point Military Academy was approaching. 
I was at dinner with my family at a hotel in 
Washington when General Corbin joined us. ‘Will you,’ 
<pb id="watterson165" n="165"/>
he abruptly interjected, ‘accept the chairmanship 
of the board of visitors to the academy this coming 
June?’</p>
            <p>“ ‘What do you want of me?’ I asked.</p>
            <p>“ ‘It is the academy's centenary, which we propose 
to celebrate, and we want an orator.’</p>
            <p>“ ‘General Corbin,’ said I, ‘you are coming at 
me in a most enticing way. I know all about West 
Point. Here at Washington I grew up with it. 
I have been fighting legislative battles for the Army 
all my life. That you Yankees should come to a 
ragged old rebel like me for such a service is a 
distinction indeed, and I feel immensely honored. 
But which page of the court calendar made you a 
plural? Whom do you mean by “we”? ’</p>
            <p>“ ‘Why,’ he replied in serio-comic vein, ‘the 
President, the Secretary of War and Me, myself.’</p>
            <p>“I promised him to think it over and give him
an answer. Next day I received a letter from the
President, making the formal official tender and
expressing the hope that I would not decline it.
Yet how could I accept it with the work ahead of
me? It was certain that if I became a part of the
presidential junket and passed a week in the 
delightful company promised me, I would be unfit

party, and so reluctantly - more reluctantly than 
I can tell you - I declined, obliging them to send 
for Gen. Horace Porter and bring him over from 
across the ocean, where he was ably serving as 
Ambassador to France. I need not add how well 
that gifted and versatile gentleman discharged the 
distinguished and pleasing duty.”</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>III</head>
            <p>The last time I met Theodore Roosevelt was but 
a little while before his death. A small party of 
us, Editor Moore, of Pittsburgh, and Mr. Riggs, 
of the New York Central, at his invitation had a 
jolly midday breakfast, extending far into the 
afternoon. I never knew him happier or heartier. 
His jocund spirit rarely failed him. He enjoyed 
life and wasted no time on trivial worries, 
hit-or-miss, the keynote to his thought.</p>
            <p>The Dutch blood of Holland and the cavalier 
blood of England mingled in his veins in fair 
proportion. He was especially proud of the uncle, his 
mother's brother, the Southern admiral, head of the 
Confederate naval organization in Europe, who 
had fitted out the rebel cruisers and sent them to 
<pb id="watterson167" n="167"/>
sea. And well he might be, for a nobler American 
never lived. At the close of the War of Sections 
Admiral Bullock had in his possession some half 
million dollars of Confederate money. Instead of 
appropriating this to his own use, as without 
remark or hindrance he might have done, he turned 
it over to the Government of the United States, 
and died a poor man.</p>
            <p>The inconsistencies and quarrels in which Theodore 
Roosevelt was now and again involved were 
largely temperamental. His mind was of that 
order which is prone to believe what it wants to 
believe. He did not take much time to think. He 
leaped at conclusions, and from his premise his 
conclusion was usually sound. His tastes were 
domestic, his pastime, when not at his books, field 
sports.</p>
            <p>He was not what might be called convivial, 
though fond of good company - very little wine 
affecting him - so that a certain self-control became 
second nature to him.</p>
            <p>To be sure, he had no conscientious or doctrinal
scruples about a third term. He had found the
White House a congenial abode, had accepted the
literal theory that his election in 1908 would not
		
<pb id="watterson168" n="168"/>
imply a third but a second term, and he wanted to 
remain. In point of fact I have an impression that, 
barring Jackson and Polk, most of those who have 
got there were loath to give it up. We know that 
Grant was, and I am sure that Cleveland was. 
We owe a great debt to Washington, because if a 
third why not a fourth term? And then life tenure 
after the manner of the Cæsars and Cromwells of 
history, and especially the Latin-Americans - Bolivar, 
Rosas and Diaz?</p>
            <p>Away back in 1873, after a dinner, Mr. Blaine 
took me into his den and told me that it was no 
longer a surmise but a fact that the group about 
General Grant, who had just been reëlected by an 
overwhelming majority, was maneuvering for a 
third term. To me this was startling, incredible. 
Returning to my hotel I saw a light still burning 
in the room of Senator Morton, of Indiana, and 
rapping at the door I was bidden to enter. Without 
mentioning how it had reached me, I put the 
proposition to him. “Certainly,” he said, “it is 
true.”</p>
            <p>The next day, in a letter to the Courier-Journal, 
I reduced what I had heard to writing. Reading 
this over it seemed so sensational that I added a 
<pb id="watterson169" n="169"/>
closing paragraph, meant to qualify what I had 
written and to imply that I had not gone quite daft.</p>
            <p>“These things,” I wrote, “may sound queer to the 
ear of the country. They may have visited me in 
my dreams; they may, indeed, have come to me 
betwixt the sherry and the champagne, but nevertheless 
I do aver that they are buzzing about here in 
the minds of many very serious and not unimportant 
persons.”</p>
            <p>Never was a well-intentioned scribe so berated 
and ridiculed as I, never a simple news gatherer so 
discredited. Democratic and Republican newspapers 
vied with one another which could say crossest 
things and laugh loudest. One sentence especially 
caught the newspaper risibilities of the time, and it 
was many a year before the phrase “between the 
sherry and the champagne” ceased to pursue me. 
That any patriotic American, twice elevated to the 
presidency, could want a third term, could have the 
hardihood to seek one was inconceivable. My letter 
was an insult to General Grant and proof of 
my own lack of intelligence and restraint. They 
lammed me, laughed at me, good and strong. On 
each successive occasion of recurrence I have 
encountered the same criticism.</p>

<lb/>PERSONAL AND ARTISTIC CAREER - MODEST 
<lb/>CHARACTER AND RELIGIOUS BELIEF</head>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>I</head>
            <p><emph rend="bold">THE</emph> journalist and the player have some
things in common. Each turns night into
day. I have known rather intimately all the 
eminent English-speaking actors of my time from
Henry Irving and Charles Wyndham to Edwin
Booth and Joseph Jefferson, from Charlotte 
Cushman to Helena Modjeska. No people are quite so
interesting as stage people.</p>
            <p>During nearly fifty years my life and the life 
of Joseph Jefferson ran close upon parallel lines. 
He was eleven years my senior; but after the 
desultory acquaintance of a man and a boy we came 
together under circumstances which obliterated the 
<pb id="watterson171" n="171"/>
disparity of age and established between us a lasting 
bond of affection. His wife, Margaret, had 
died, and he was passing through Washington with 
the little brood of children she had left him.</p>
            <p>It made the saddest spectacle I had ever seen. 
As I recall it after more than sixty years, the scene 
of silent grief, of unutterable helplessness, has still 
a haunting power over me, the oldest lad not eight 
years of age, the youngest a girl baby in arms, the 
young father aghast before the sudden tragedy 
which had come upon him. There must have been 
something in my sympathy which drew him toward 
me, for on his return a few months later he sought 
me out and we fell into the easy intercourse of 
established relations.</p>
            <p>I was recovering from an illness, and every day 
he would come and read by my bedside. I had not 
then lost the action of one of my hands, putting an 
end to a course of musical study I had hoped to 
develop into a career. He was infinitely fond of 
music and sufficiently familiar with the old masters 
to understand and enjoy them. He was an artist 
through and through, possessing a sweet nor yet an 
uncultivated voice - a blend between a low tenor 
and a high baritone - I was almost about to write 
<pb id="watterson172" n="172"/>
a “contralto,” it was so soft and liquid. Its tones 
in speech retained to the last their charm. Who 
that heard them shall ever forget them?</p>
            <p>Early in 1861 my friend Jefferson came to me 
and said: “There is going to be a war of the 
sections. I am not a warrior. I am neither a 
Northerner nor a Southerner. I cannot bring myself to 
engage in bloodshed, or to take sides. I have near 
and dear ones North and South. I am going away 
and I shall stay away until the storm blows over. 
It may seem to you unpatriotic, and it is, I know, 
unheroic. I am not a hero; I am, I hope, an artist. 
My world is the world of art, and I must be true 
to that; it is my patriotism, my religion. I can do 
no manner of good here, and I am going away.”</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>II</head>
            <p>At that moment statesmen were hopefully estimating 
the chances of a peaceful adjustment and 
solution of the sectional controversy. With the 
prophet instinct of the artist he knew better. 
Though at no time taking an active interest in politics 
or giving expression to party bias of any kind, 
his personal associations led him into a familiar 
knowledge of the trend of political opinion and the 
<pb id="watterson173" n="173"/>
portent of public affairs, and I can truly say that 
during the fifty years that passed thereafter I never 
discussed any topic of current interest or moment 
with him that he did not throw upon it the side 
lights of a luminous understanding, and at the same 
time an impartial and intelligent judgment.</p>
            <p>His mind was both reflective and radiating. His 
humor though perennial was subdued; his wit keen 
and spontaneous, never acrid or wounding. His 
speech abounded with unconscious epigram. He 
had his beliefs and stood by them; but he was never 
aggressive. Cleaner speech never fell from the lips 
of man. I never heard him use a profanity. We 
once agreed between ourselves to draw a line across 
the salacious stories so much in vogue during our 
day; the wit must exceed the dirt; where the dirt 
exceeded the wit we would none of it.</p>
            <p>He was a singularly self-respecting man; genuinely 
a modest man. The actor is supposed to be 
so familiar with the <sic corr="public">publc</sic> as to be proof against 
surprises. Before his audience he must be master 
of himself, holding the situation and his art by the 
firmest grip. He must simulate, not experience 
emotion, the effect referable to the seeming, never 
to the actuality involving the realization.</p>
            <pb id="watterson174" n="174"/>
            <p>Mr. Jefferson held to this doctrine and applied 
it rigorously. On a certain occasion he was playing 
Caleb Plummer. In the scene between the old toymaker 
and his blind daughter, when the father discovers 
the dreadful result of his dissimulation - an 
awkward hitch; and, the climax quite thwarted, the 
curtain came down. I was standing at the wings.</p>
            <p>“Did you see that?” he said as he brushed by me, 
going to his dressing-room.</p>
            <p>“No,” said I, following him. “What was it?”</p>
            <p>He turned, his eyes still wet and his voice choked. 
“I broke down,” said he; “completely broke down. 
I turned away from the audience to recover myself. 
But I failed and had the curtain rung.”</p>
            <p>The scene had been spoiled because the actor had 
been overcome by a sudden flood of real feeling, 
whereas he was to render by his art the feeling of a 
fictitious character and so to communicate this to 
his audience. Caleb's cue was tears, but not 
Jefferson's.</p>
            <p>On another occasion I saw his self-possession 
tried in a different way. We were dining with a 
gentleman who had overpartaken of his own 
hospitality. Mr. Murat Halstead was of the company. 
There was also a German of distinction, whose
<pb id="watterson175" n="175"/>
knowledge of English was limited. The Rip Van 
Winkle craze was at its height. After sufficiently 
impressing the German with the rare opportunity 
he was having in meeting a man so famous as Mr. 
Jefferson, our host, encouraged by Mr. Halstead, 
and I am afraid not discouraged by me, began to 
urge Mr. Jefferson to give us, as he said, “a touch 
of his mettle,” and failing to draw the great comedian 
out he undertook himself to give a few descriptive 
passages from the drama which was carrying 
the town by storm. Poor Jefferson! He sat 
like an awkward boy, helpless and blushing, the 
German wholly unconscious of the fun or even 
comprehending just what was happening - Halstead 
and I maliciously, mercilessly enjoying it.</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>III</head>
            <p>I never heard Mr. Jefferson make a recitation 
or, except in the singing of a song before his voice 
began to break, make himself a part of any private 
entertainment other than that of a spectator and 
guest.</p>
            <p>He shrank from personal displays of every sort. 
Even in his younger days he rarely “gagged,” or 
interpolated, upon the stage. Yet he did not lack 
<pb id="watterson176" n="176"/>
for a ready wit. One time during the final act of 
Rip Van Winkle, a young countryman in the gallery 
was so carried away that he quite lost his bearings 
and seemed to be about to climb over the outer 
railing. The audience, spellbound by the actor, 
nevertheless saw the rustic, and its attention was 
being divided between the two when Jefferson 
reached that point in the action of the piece where 
Rip is amazed by the docility of his wife under the 
ill usage of her second husband. He took in the 
situation at a glance.</p>
            <p>Casting his eye directly upon the youth in the 
gallery, he uttered the lines as if addressing them 
directly to him, “Well, I would never have believed 
it if I had not seen it.”</p>
            <p>The poor fellow, startled, drew back from his 
perilous position, and the audience broke into a 
storm of applause.</p>
            <p>Joseph Jefferson was a Swedenborgian in his 
religious belief. At one time too extreme a belief in 
spiritualism threatened to cloud his sound, wholesome 
understanding. As he grew older and happier 
and passed out from the shadow of his early 
tragedy he fell away from the more sinister 
influence the supernatural had attained over his 
<pb id="watterson177" n="177"/>
imagination. One time in Washington I had him to 
breakfast to meet the Chief Justice and Mr. Justice 
Matthews and Mr. Carlisle, the newly-elected 
Speaker of the House. It was a rainy Sunday, and 
it was in my mind to warn him that our company 
was made up of hard-headed lawyers not apt to be 
impressed by fairy tales and ghost stories, and to 
suggest that he cut the spiritualism in case the 
conversation fell, as was likely, into the speculative. 
I forgot, or something hindered, and, sure enough, 
the question of second sight and mind reading came
up, and I said to myself: “Lord, now we'll have it.”
But it was my kinsman, Stanley Matthews, who
led off with a clairvoyant experience in his law 
practice. I began to be reassured. Mr. Carlisle 
followed with a most mathematical account of some
hobgoblins he had encountered in his law practice.
Finally the Chief Justice, Mr. Waite, related a
series of incidents so fantastic and incredible, yet
detailed with the precision and lucidity of a master
of plain statement, as fairly to stagger the most
believing ghostseer. Then I said to myself again:
“Let her go, Joe, no matter what you tell now you
will fall below the standard set by these professional
perfecters of pure reason, and are safe to do your 
	
<pb id="watterson178" n="178"/>
best, or your worst.” I think he held his own, 
however.</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>IV</head>
            <p>Joseph Jefferson came to his artistic spurs slowly 
but surely, being nearly thirty years of age when 
he got his chance, and therefore wholly equal to it 
and prepared for it.</p>
            <p>William E. Burton stood and had stood for 
twenty-five years the recognized, the reigning king 
of comedy in America. He was a master of his 
craft as well as a leader in society and letters. To 
look at him when he came upon the stage was to 
laugh; yet he commanded tears almost as readily 
as laughter. In New York City particularly he 
ruled the roost, and could and did do that which 
had cost another his place. He began to take too 
many liberties with the public favor and, truth to 
say, was beginning to be both coarse and careless. 
People were growing restive under ministrations 
which were at times little less than impositions upon 
their forbearance. They wanted something if possible 
as strong, but more refined, and in the person 
of the leading comedy man of Laura Keene's 
company, a young actor by the name of Jefferson, 
they got it.</p>
            <pb id="watterson179" n="179"/>
            <p>Both Mr. Sothern and Mr. Jefferson have told 
the story of Tom Taylor's extravaganza, “Our 
American Cousin,” in which the one as Dundreary, 
the other as Asa Trenchard, rose to almost instant 
popularity and fame. I shall not repeat it except 
to say that Jefferson's Asa Trenchard was unlike 
any other the English or American stage has 
known. He played the raw Yankee boy, not in 
low comedy at all, but made him innocent and 
ignorant as a well-born Green Mountain lad might be, 
never a bumpkin; and in the scene when Asa tells 
his sweetheart the bear story and whilst pretending 
to light his cigar burns the will, he left not a dry 
eye in the house.</p>
            <p>New York had never witnessed, never divined 
anything in pathos and humor so exquisite. Burton 
and his friends struggled for a season, but 
Jefferson completely knocked them out. Even had 
Burton lived, and had there been no diverting war 
of sections to drown all else, Jefferson would have 
come to his growth and taken his place as the first 
serio-comic actor of his time.</p>
            <p>Rip Van Winkle was an evolution. Jefferson's
half-brother, Charles Burke, had put together a
sketchy melodrama in two acts and had played in
		
<pb id="watterson180" n="180"/>
it, was playing in it when he died. After his 
Trenchard, Jefferson turned himself loose in all 
sorts of parts, from Diggory to Mazeppa, a famous 
burlesque, which he did to a turn, imitating the 
mock heroics of the feminine horse marines, so popular 
in the equestrian drama of the period, Adah 
Isaacs Menken, the beautiful and ill-fated, at their 
head. Then he produced a version of Nicholas 
Nickleby, in which his Newman Noggs took a more 
ambitious flight. These, however, were but the 
<foreign lang="fr">avant-couriers</foreign> of the immortal Rip.</p>
            <p>Charles Burke's piece held close to the lines of 
Irving's legend. When the vagabond returns 
from the mountains after the twenty years' sleep 
Gretchen is dead. The apex is reached when the 
old man, sitting dazed at a table in front of the 
tavern in the village of Falling Water, asks after 
Derrick Van Beekman and Nick Vedder and other 
of his cronies. At last, half twinkle of humor and 
half glimmer of dread, he gets himself to the point 
of asking after Dame Van Winkle, and is told that 
she has been dead these ten years. Then like a 
flash came that wonderful Jeffersonian change of 
facial expression, and as the white head drops upon 
the arms stretched before him on the table he says: </p>
            <pb id="watterson181" n="181"/>
            <p>“Well, she led me a hard life, a hard life, but she 
was the wife of my bosom, she was <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="de">meine frau!</foreign></hi>”</p>
            <p>I did not see the revised, or rather the 
newly-created and written, Rip Van Winkle until Mr. 
Jefferson brought it to America and was playing 
it at Niblo's Garden in New York. Between himself 
and Dion Boucicault a drama carrying all the 
possibilities, all the lights and shadows of his genius 
had been constructed. In the first act he sang a 
drinking song to a wing accompaniment delightfully, 
adding much to the tone and color of the situation. 
The exact reversal of the Lear suggestion 
in the last act was an inspiration, his own and not 
Boucicault's. The weird scene in the mountains 
fell in admirably with a certain weird note in the 
Jefferson genius, and supplied the needed element 
of variety.</p>
            <p>I always thought it a good acting play under 
any circumstances, but, in his hands, matchless. He 
thought himself that the piece, as a piece, and 
regardless of his own acting, deserved better of the 
critics than they were always willing to give it. 
Assuredly, no drama that ever was written, as he 
played it, ever took such a hold upon the public. 
He rendered it to three generations, and to a rising, 
<pb id="watterson182" n="182"/>
not a falling, popularity, drawing to the very last 
undiminished audiences.</p>
            <p>Because of this unexampled run he was sometimes 
described by unthinking people as a one-part 
actor. Nothing could be farther from the truth. 
He possessed uncommon versatility. That after 
twenty years of the new Rip Van Winkle, when he 
was past fifty years of age, he could come back to 
such parts as Caleb Plummer and Acres is proof 
of this. He need not have done so at all. Carrying 
a pension roll of dependents aggregating fifteen 
or twenty thousand a year for more than a quarter 
of a century, Rip would still have sufficed his 
requirements. It was his love for his art that took 
him to The Cricket and The Rivals, and at no 
inconsiderable cost to himself.</p>
            <p>I have heard ill-natured persons, some of them 
envious actors, say that he did nothing for the stage.</p>
            <p>He certainly did not make many contributions 
to its upholstery. He was in no position to 
emulate Sir Henry Irving in forcing and directing the 
public taste. But he did in America quite as much 
as Sir Charles Wyndham and Sir Henry Irving in 
England to elevate the personality, the social and 
intellectual standing of the actor and the stage, 
<pb id="watterson183" n="183"/>
effecting in a lifetime a revolution in the attitude 
of the people and the clergy of both countries to 
the theater and all things in it. This was surely 
enough for one man in any craft or country.</p>
            <p>He was always a good stage speaker. Late in 
life he began to speak elsewhere, and finally to 
lecture. His success pleased him immensely. The 
night of the Sunday afternoon charity for the 
Newsboys' Home in Louisville, when the promise 
of a talk from him had filled the house to 
overflowing, he was like a boy who had come off from a 
college occasion with all the honors. Indeed, the 
degrees of Harvard and Yale, which had reached 
him both unexpectedly and unsolicited, gave him a 
pleasure quite apart from the vanity they might 
have gratified in another; he regarded them, and 
justly, as the recognition at once of his profession 
and of his personal character.</p>
            <p>I never knew a man whose moral sensibilities 
were more acute. He loved the respectable. He 
detested the unclean. He was just as attractive off 
the stage as upon it, because he was as unaffected 
and real in his personality as he was sincere and 
conscientious in his public representations, his 
lovely nature showing through his art in spite of 
<pb id="watterson184" n="184"/>
him. His purpose was to fill the scene and forget 
himself.</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>V</head>
            <p>The English newspapers accompanied the tidings 
of Mr. Jefferson's death with rather sparing 
estimates of his eminence and his genius, though 
his success in London, where he was well known, 
had been unequivocal. Indeed, himself, alone with 
Edwin Booth and Mary Anderson, may be said to 
complete the list of those Americans who have 
attained any real recognition in the British metropolis. 
The Times spoke of him as “an able if not a 
great actor.” If Joseph Jefferson was not a great 
actor I should like some competent person to tell 
me what actor of our time could be so described.</p>
            <p>Two or three of the journals of Paris referred 
to him as “the American Coquelin.” It had been 
apter to describe Coquelin as the French Jefferson. 
I never saw Frederic Lemaître. But, him apart, 
I have seen all the eccentric comedians, the 
character actors of the last fifty years, and, in spell 
power, in precision and deftness of touch, in acute, 
penetrating, all-embracing and all-embodying 
intelligence and grasp, I should place Joseph Jefferson 
easily at their head.</p>
            <pb id="watterson185" n="185"/>
            <p>Shakespeare was his Bible. The stage had been 
his cradle. He continued all his days a student. 
In him met the meditative and the observing faculties. 
In his love of fishing, his love of painting, 
his love of music we see the brooding, contemplative 
spirit joined to the alert in mental force and 
foresight when he addressed himself to the activities 
and the objectives of the theater. He was a thorough 
stage manager, skillful, patient and upright. 
His company was his family. He was not gentler 
with the children and grandchildren he ultimately 
drew about him than he had been with the young 
men and young women who had preceded them in 
his employment and instruction.</p>
            <p>He was nowise ashamed of his calling. On the 
contrary, he was proud of it. His mother had 
lived and died an actress. He preferred that his 
progeny should follow in the footsteps of their 
forebears even as he had done. It is beside the 
purpose to inquire, as was often done, what might 
have happened had he undertaken the highest 
flights of tragedy; one might as well discuss the 
relation of a Dickens to a Shakespeare. Sir Henry 
Irving and Sir Charles Wyndham in England, M. 
Coquelin in France, his contemporaries - each had 
<pb id="watterson186" n="186"/>
his <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">métier</foreign></hi>. They were perfect in their art and 
unalike in their art. No comparison between them 
can be justly drawn. I was witness to the rise of 
all three of them, and have followed them in their 
greatest parts throughout their most brilliant and 
eminent and successful careers, and can say of each 
as of Mr. Jefferson:</p>
            <lb/>
            <lg type="verse">
              <l>

            </lg>
            <lb/>
            <p>There shall be Kings of Thule after kings are gone. 
The actor dies and leaves no copy; his deeds are 
writ in water, only his name survives upon tradition's 
tongue, and yet, from Betterton and Garrick 
to Irving, from Macklin and Quin to Wyndham 
and Jefferson, how few!</p>

            <p><emph rend="bold">TALLEYRAND</emph> was so impressed by the 
world-compelling character of the memoirs 
he had prepared for posterity that he fixed an 
interdict of more than fifty years upon the date set 
for their publication, and when at last the bulky 
tomes made their appearance, they excited no 
especial interest - certainly created no sensation - and 
lie for the most part dusty upon the shelves of the 
libraries that contain them. For a different reason, 
Henry Ward Beecher put a time limit upon the 
volume, or volumes, which will tell us, among other 
things, all about one of the greatest scandals of 
modern times; and yet how few people now recall 
it or care anything about the <foreign lang="la">dramatis personæ</foreign> and 
<pb id="watterson188" n="188"/>
the actual facts! Metternich, next after Napoleon 
and Talleyrand, was an important figure in a stirring 
epoch. He, too, indicted an autobiography, 
which is equally neglected among the books that 
are sometimes quoted and extolled, but rarely read. 
Rousseau, the half insane, and Barras, the wholly 
vicious, have twenty readers where Talleyrand and 
Metternich have one.</p>
            <p>From this point of view, the writing of memoirs, 
excepting those of the trivial French School or 
gossiping letters and diaries of the Pepys-Walpole 
variety, would seem an unprofitable task for a great 
man's undertaking. Boswell certainly did for 
Johnson what the thunderous old doctor could not 
have done for himself. Nevertheless, from the days 
of Cæsar to the days of Sherman and Lee, the 
captains of military and senatorial and literary 
industry have regaled themselves, if they have not edified 
the public, by the narration of their own stories; 
and, I dare say, to the end of time, interest in one's 
self, and the mortal desire to linger yet a little 
longer on the scene - now and again, as in the case 
of General Grant, the assurance of honorable 
remuneration making needful provision for others - will

            <p>Something like this occurs to me upon a reperusal 
of the unfinished memoirs of my old and dear 
friend, Carl Schurz. Assuredly few men had better 
warrant for writing about themselves or a livelier 
tale to tell than the famous German-American, 
who died leaving that tale unfinished. No man in 
life was more misunderstood and maligned. There 
was nothing either erratic or conceited about 
Schurz, nor was he more pragmatic than is common 
to the possessor of positive opinions along with 
the power to make their expression effectual.</p>
            <p>The actual facts of his public life do not anywhere 
show that his politics shifted with his own 
interests. On the contrary, he was singularly 
regardless of his interests where his convictions 
interposed. Though an alien, and always an alien, 
he possessed none of the shifty traits of the soldier 
of fortune. Never in his career did he crook the 
pregnant hinges of the knee before any worldly 
<pb id="watterson190" n="190"/>
throne of grace or flatter any mob that place might 
follow fawning. His great talents had only to lend 
themselves to party uses to get their full requital. 
He refused them equally to Grant in the White 
House and the multitude in Missouri, going his own 
gait, which could be called erratic only by the 
conventional, to whom regularity is everything and 
individuality nothing.</p>
            <p>Schurz was first of all and above all an orator. 
His achievements on the platform and in the 
Senate were undeniable. He was unsurpassed in 
debate. He had no need to exploit himself. The 
single chapter in his life on which light was desirable 
was the military episode. The cruel and false 
saying, “I fight mit Sigel und runs mit Schurz,” 
obviously the offspring of malignity, did mislead 
many people, reënforced by the knowledge that 
Schurz was not an educated soldier. How 
thoroughly he disposes of this calumny his memoirs 
attest. Fuller, more convincing vindication could 
not be asked of any man; albeit by those familiar 
with the man himself it could not be doubted that 
he had both courage and aptitude for military 
employment.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>II</head>
            <p>A philosopher and an artist, he was drawn by 
circumstance into the vortex of affairs. Except 
for the stirring events of 1848, he might have lived 
and died a professor at Bonn or Heidelberg. If 
he had pursued his musical studies at Leipsic he 
must have become a master of the piano keyboard. 
As it was, he played Schumann and Chopin creditably. 
The rescue of Kinkel, the flight from the 
fatherland, the mild Bohemianizing in Paris and 
London awakened within him the spirit of action 
rather than of adventure.</p>
            <p>There was nothing of the Dalgetty about him; 
too reflective and too accomplished. His early 
marriage attests a domestic trend, from which he never 
departed; though an idealist in his public aspirations 
and aims he was a sentimentalist in his home 
life and affections. Genial in temperament and 
disposition, his personal habit was moderation 
itself.</p>
            <p>He was a German. Never did a man live so long
in a foreign country and take on so few of its
thoughts and ways. He threw himself into the
anti-slavery movement upon the crest of the wave;
		
<pb id="watterson192" n="192"/>
the flowing sea carried him quickly from one 
distinction to another; the ebb tide, which found him 
in the Senate of the United States, revealed to his 
startled senses the creeping, crawling things 
beneath the surface; partyism rampant, tyrannous 
and corrupt; a self-willed soldier in the White 
House; a Blaine, a Butler and a Garfield leading 
the Representatives, a Cameron and a Conkling 
leading the Senate; single-minded disinterestedness, 
pure unadulterated conviction, nowhere.</p>
            <p>Jobs and jobbing flourished on every side. An 
impossible scheme of reconstruction was trailing its 
slow, putrescent length along. The revenue service 
was thick with thieves, the committees of Congress 
were packed with mercenaries. Money-making in 
high places had become the order of the day. Was 
it for this that oceans of patriotism, of treasure and 
of blood had been poured out? Was it for this that 
he had fought with tongue and pen and sword?</p>
            <p>There was Sumner - the great Sumner - who had
quarreled with Grant and Fish, to keep him 
company and urge him on. There was the Tribune,
the puissant Tribune - two of them, one in New
York and the other in Chicago - to give him countenance. 
There was need of liberalizing and loosening 
		
<pb id="watterson193" n="193"/>
things in Missouri, for which he sat in the 
Senate - they could not go on forever half the best 
elements in the State disfranchised.</p>
            <p>Thus the Liberal Movement of 1872.</p>
            <p>Schurz went to Cincinnati elate with hope. He 
was an idealist - not quite yet a philosopher. He 
had his friends about him. Sam Bowles - the first 
newspaper politician of his day, with none of the 
handicaps carried by Raymond and Forney - a man 
keen of insight and foresight, fertile of resources, 
and not afraid - stood foremost among them. Next 
came Horace White. Doric in his simplicity like a 
marble shaft, and to the outer eye as cold as marble, 
but below a man of feeling, conviction and tenacity, 
a working journalist and a doughty doctrinaire. A 
little group of such men formed itself about Schurz 
- then only forty-three years old - to what end? 
Why, Greeley, Horace Greeley, the bellwether of 
abolitionism, the king bee of protectionism, the man 
of fads and isms and the famous “old white hat.”</p>
            <p>To some of us it was laughable. To Schurz it 
was tragical. A bridge had to be constructed for 
him to pass - for retrace his steps he could not - 
and, as it were, blindfolded, he had to be backed 
upon this like a mule aboard a train of cars. I 
<pb id="watterson194" n="194"/>
sometimes wonder what might have happened if 
Schurz had then and there resigned his seat in the 
Senate, got his brood together and returned to 
Germany. I dare say he would have been welcomed 
by Bismarck.</p>
            <p>Certainly there was no lodgment for him thenceforward 
in American politics. The exigencies of 
1876-77 made him a provisional place in the Hayes 
Administration; but, precisely as the Democrats of 
Missouri could put such a man to no use, the 
Republicans at large could find no use for him. He 
seemed a bull in a china shop to the political 
organization he honored with a preference wholly 
intellectual, and having no stomach for either extreme, 
he became a Mugwump.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>III</head>
            <p>He was a German. He was an artist. By nature 
a doctrinaire, he had become a philosopher.
He could never wholly adjust himself to his 
environment. He lectured Lincoln, and Lincoln, 
perceiving his earnest truthfulness and genuine 
qualities, forgave him his impertinence, nor ceased to
regard him with the enduring affection one might
have for an ardent, aspiring and lovable boy. He
		
<pb id="watterson195" n="195"/>
was repellant to Grant, who could not and perhaps 
did not desire to understand him. . . . To him the 
Southerners were always the red-faced, swashbuckling 
slave-drivers he had fancied and pictured 
them in the days of his abolition oratory. More 
and more he lived in a rut of his own fancies, wise 
in books and counsels, gentle in his relations with 
the few who enjoyed his confidence; to the last a 
most captivating personality.</p>
            <p>Though fastidious, Schurz was not intolerant. 
Yet he was hard to convince - tenacious of his 
opinions - courteous but insistent in debate. He was a 
German; a German Herr Doktor of Music, of 
Letters and of Common Law. During an intimacy 
of more than thirty years we scarcely ever wholly 
agreed about any public matter; differing about 
even the civil service and the tariff. But I admired 
him hugely and loved him heartily.</p>
            <p>I had once a rather amusing encounter with him. 
There was a dinner at Delmonico's, from whose 
program of post-prandial oratory I had purposely 
caused my own name to be omitted. Indeed, I had 
had with a lady a wager I very much wished to win 
that I would not speak. General Grant and I went 
in together, and during the repast he said that the 
<pb id="watterson196" n="196"/>
only five human beings in the world whom he 
detested were actually here at table.</p>
            <p>Of course, Schurz was one of these. He was the 
last on the list of speakers and, curiously enough - 
the occasion being the consideration of certain ways 
and means for the development of the South - and 
many leading Southerners present - he composed 
his speech out of an editorial tour de force he was 
making in the Evening Post on The Homicidal 
Side of Southern Life. Before he had proceeded 
half through General Grant, who knew of my 
wager, said, “You'll lose your bet,” and, it being 
one o'clock in the morning, I thought so too, and 
did not care whether I won or lost it. When he 
finished, the call on me was spontaneous and 
universal. “Now give it to him good,” said General 
Grant.</p>
            <p>And I did; I declared - the reporters were long 
since gone - that there had not been a man killed 
amiss in Kentucky since the war; that where one 
had been killed two should have been; and, amid 
roars of laughter which gave me time to frame 
some fresh absurdity, I delivered a prose pæan to 
murder.</p>
            <p>Nobody seemed more pleased than Schurz himself, 
<pb id="watterson197" n="197"/>
and as we came away - General Grant having 
disappeared - he put his arm about me like a schoolboy 
and said: “Well, well, I had no idea you were 
so bloody-minded.”</p>

<lb/>POLITICS AND POLITICAL ISSUES</head>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>I</head>
            <p><emph rend="bold">THERE</emph> are tricks in every trade. The tariff 
being the paramount issue of the day, I 
received a tempting money offer from Philadelphia to 
present my side of the question, but when the time 
fixed was about to arrive I found myself billed for 
a debate with no less an adversary than William 
McKinley, protectionist leader in the Lower House 
of Congress. We were the best of friends and I 
much objected to a joint meeting. The parties, 
however, would take no denial, and it was arranged 
that we should be given alternate dates. Then it 
appeared that the designated thesis read: “Which 
political party offers for the workingman the best 
solution of the tariff problem?”</p>
            <pb id="watterson199" n="199"/>
            <p>Here was a poser. It required special preparation, 
for which I had not the leisure. I wanted the 
stipend, but was not willing - scarcely able - to pay 
so much for it. I was about to throw the engagement 
over when a lucky thought struck me. I had 
a cast-off lecture entitled Money and Morals. It 
had been rather popular. Why might I not put 
a head and tail to this - a foreword and a few 
words in conclusion - and make it meet the purpose 
and serve the occasion?</p>
            <p>When the evening arrived there was a great audience. 
Half of the people had come to applaud, the 
other half to antagonize. I was received, however, 
with what seemed a united acclaim. When the 
cheering had ceased, with the blandest air I began:</p>
            <p>“In that chapter of the history of Ireland which 
was reserved for the consideration of snakes, the 
historian, true to the solecism as well as the brevity 
of Irish wit, informs us that ‘there are no snakes in 
Ireland.’</p>
            <p>“I am afraid that on the present occasion I shall 
have to emulate this flight of the Celtic imagination. 
I find myself billed to speak from a Democratic 
standpoint as to which party offers the best practical 
means for the benefit of the workingmen of the
<pb id="watterson200" n="200"/>
country. If I am to discharge with fidelity the duty 
thus assigned me, I must begin by repudiating the 
text in toto, because the Democratic Party recognizes 
no political agency for one class which is not 
equally open to all classes. The bulwark and 
belltower of its faith, the source and resource of its 
strength are laid in the declaration, ‘Freedom for 
all, special privileges to none,’ which applied to 
practical affairs would deny to self-styled workingmen, 
organized into a coöperative society, any 
political means not enjoyed by every other organized 
cooperative society, and by each and every 
citizen, individually, to himself and his heirs and 
assigns, forever.</p>
            <p>“But in a country like ours, what right has any 
body of men to get together and, labelling themselves 
workingmen, to talk about political means 
and practical ends exclusive to themselves? Who 
among us has the single right to claim for himself, 
and the likes of him, the divine title of a workingman? 
We are all workingmen, the earnest plodding 
scholar in his library, surrounded by the 
luxury and comfort which his learning and his 
labor have earned for him, no less than the poor 
collier in the mine, with darkness and squalor closing 
<pb id="watterson201" n="201"/>
him round about, and want maybe staring him 
in the face, yet - if he be a true man - with a little 
bird singing ever in his heart the song of hope and 
cheer which cradled the genius of Stephenson and 
Arkwright and the long procession of inventors, 
lowly born, to whom the world owes the glorious 
achievements of this, the greatest of the centuries. 
We are all workingmen - the banker, the minister, 
the lawyer, the doctor - toiling from day to day, 
and it may be we are well paid for our toil, to represent 
and to minister to the wants of the time no less 
than the farmer and the farmer's boy, rising with 
the lark to drive the team afield, and to dally with 
land so rich it needs to be but tickled with a hoe to 
laugh a harvest.</p>
            <p>“Having somewhat of an audacious fancy, I have 
sometimes in moments of exuberance ventured upon 
the conceit that our Jupiter Tonans, the American 
editor, seated upon his three-legged throne and 
enveloped by the majesty and the mystery of his 
pretentious ‘we,’ is a workingman no less than the 
poor reporter, who year in and year out braves the 
perils of the midnight rounds through the slums of 
the city, yea in the more perilous temptations of 
the town, yet carries with him into the darkest dens 
<pb id="watterson202" n="202"/>
the love of work, the hope of reward and the fear 
only of dishonor.</p>
            <p>“Why, the poor officeseeker at Washington 
begging a bit of that pie, which, having got his own
slice, a cruel, hard-hearted President would eliminate 
from the bill of fare, he likewise is a workingman, 
and I can tell you a very hard-working man 
with a tough job of work, and were better breaking 
rock upon a turnpike in Dixie or splitting rails on 
a quarter section out in the wild and woolly West.</p>
            <p>“It is true that, as stated on the program, I am a 
Democrat - as Artemus Ward once said of the 
horses in his panorama, I can conceal it no longer 
- at least I am as good a Democrat as they have 
nowadays. But first of all, I am an American, and 
in America every man who is not a policeman or a 
dude is a workingman. So, by your leave, my 
friends, instead of sticking very closely to the text, 
and treating it from a purely party point of view, 
I propose to take a ramble through the highways 
and byways of life and thought in our beloved 
country and to cast a balance if I can from an American 
point of view.</p>
            <p>“I want to say in the beginning that no party can 
save any man or any set of men from the daily toil 
<pb id="watterson203" n="203"/>
by which all of us live and move and have our 
being.”</p>
            <p>Then I worked in my old lecture.</p>
            <p>It went like hot cakes. When next I met William 
McKinley he said jocosely: “You are a mean 
man, Henry Watterson!”</p>
            <p>“How so?” I asked.</p>
            <p>“I accepted the invitation to answer you because 
I wanted and needed the money. Of course I had 
no time to prepare a special address. My idea was 
to make my fee by ripping you up the back. But 
when I read the verbatim report which had been 
prepared for me there was not a word with which I 
could take issue, and that completely threw me out.”</p>
            <p>Then I told him how it had happened and we had 
a hearty laugh. He was the most lovable of men. 
That such a man should have fallen a victim to the 
blow of an assassin defies explanation, as did the 
murders of Lincoln and Garfield, like McKinley, 
amiable, kindly men giving never cause of personal 
offense.</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>II</head>
            <p>The murderer is past finding out. In one way 
and another I fancy that I am well acquainted with 
the assassins of history. Of those who slew Cæsar 
<pb id="watterson204" n="204"/>
I learned in my schooldays, and between Ravaillac, 
who did the business for Henry of Navarre, and 
Booth and Guiteau, my familiar knowledge seems 
almost at first hand. One night at Chamberlin's, 
in Washington, George Corkhill, the district 
attorney who was prosecuting the murderer of 
Garfield, said to me: “You will never fully understand 
this case until you have sat by me through one day's 
proceedings in court.” Next day I did this.</p>
            <p>Never have I passed five hours in a theater so 
filled with thrills. I occupied a seat betwixt 
Corkhill and Scoville, Guiteau's brother-in-law and 
voluntary attorney. I say “voluntary” because from 
the first Guiteau rejected him and vilely abused 
him, vociferously insisting upon being his own 
lawyer.</p>
            <p>From the moment Guiteau entered the trial room 
it was a theatrical extravaganza. He was in irons, 
sandwiched between two deputy sheriffs, came in 
shouting like a madman, and began at once railing 
at the judge, the jury and the audience. A very 
necessary rule had been established that when he 
interposed, whatever was being said or done 
automatically stopped. Then, when he ceased, the case 
went on again as if nothing had happened.</p>
            <pb id="watterson205" n="205"/>
            <p>Only Scoville intervened between me and 
Guiteau and I had an excellent opportunity to see, 
hear and size him up. In visage and voice he was 
the meanest creature I have, either in life or in 
dreams, encountered. He had the face and intonations 
of a demon. Everything about him was loathsome. 
I cannot doubt that his criminal colleagues 
of history were of the same description.</p>
            <p>Charlotte Corday was surely a lunatic. Wilkes 
Booth I knew. He was drunk, had been drunk all 
that winter, completely muddled and perverted by 
brandy, the inheritant of mad blood. Czolgosz, the 
slayer of McKinley, and the assassin of the Empress 
Elizabeth were clearly insane.</p>

            <p>McKinley and Protectionism, Cleveland, Carlisle 
and Free Trade - how far away they seem!</p>
            <p>With the passing of the old issues that divided 
parties new issues have come upon the scene. The 
alignment of the future will turn upon these. But 
underlying all issues of all time are fundamental 
ideas which live forever and aye, and may not be 
forgotten or ignored.</p>
            <pb id="watterson206" n="206"/>
            <p>It used to be claimed by the followers of Jefferson 
that Democracy was a fixed quantity, rising out 
of the bedrock of the Constitution, while Federalism, 
Whiggism and Republicanism were but the 
chimeras of some prevailing fancy drawing their 
sustenance rather from temporizing expediency and 
current sentiment than from basic principles and 
profound conviction. To make haste slowly, to look 
before leaping, to take counsel of experience - were 
Democratic axioms. Thus the fathers of Democracy, 
while fully conceiving the imperfections of 
government and meeting as events required the 
need alike of movement and reform, put the visionary 
and experimental behind them to aim at things 
visible, attainable, tangible, the written Constitution 
the one safe precedent, the morning star and the 
evening star of their faith and hope.</p>
            <p>What havoc the parties and the politicians have 
made of all these lofty pretenses! Where must an 
old-line Democrat go to find himself? Two issues, 
however, have come upon the scene which for the 
time being are paramount and which seem organic. 
They are set for the determination of the twentieth 
century: The sex question and the drink question.</p>
            <p>I wonder if it be possible to consider them in a 
<pb id="watterson207" n="207"/>
catholic spirit from a philosophic standpoint. I can 
truly say that the enactment of prohibition laws, 
state or national, is personally nothing to me. I 
long ago reached an age when the convivialism of 
life ceased to cut any figure in the equation of my 
desires and habits. It is the never-failing recourse 
of the intolerant, however, to ascribe an individual, 
and, of course, an unworthy, motive to contrariwise 
opinions, and I have not escaped that kind of 
criticism.</p>
            <p>The challenge underlying prohibition is twofold: 
Does prohibition prohibit, and, if it does, may it not 
generate evils peculiarly its own?</p>
            <p>The question hinges on what are called “sumptuary 
laws”; that is, statutes regulating the food and 
drink, the habits and apparel of the individual 
citizen. This in turn harks back to the issue of paternal 
government. That, once admitted and established, 
becomes in time all-embracing.</p>
            <p>Bigotry is a disease. The bigot pursuing his 
narrow round is like the bedridden possessed by his 
disordered fancy. Bigotry sees nothing but itself, 
which it mistakes for wisdom and virtue. But 
Bigotry begets hypocrisy. When this spreads over a 
sufficient area and counts a voting majority it sends 
<pb id="watterson208" n="208"/>
its agents abroad, and thus we acquire canting 
apostles and legislators at once corrupt and 
despotic.</p>
            <p>They are now largely in evidence in the national 
capital and in the various state capitals, where the 
poor-dog, professional politicians most do congregate 
and disport themselves.</p>
            <p>The worst of it is that there seems nowhere any 
popular realization - certainly any popular outcry. 
Do the people grow degenerate? Are they willfully 
dense?</p>

            <p>Mr. Cleveland was fond - not overfond - of 
cards. He liked to play the noble game at, say, a 
dollar limit - even once in a while for a little more 
- but not much more. And as Dr. Norvin Green 
was wont to observe of Commodore Vanderbilt, “he 
held them exceeding close to his boo-som.”</p>
            <p>Mr. Whitney, Secretary of the Navy in his first 
<pb id="watterson211" n="211"/>
administration, equally rich and hospitable, had 
often “the road gang,” as a certain group, mainly 
senators, was called, to dine, with the inevitable 
after-dinner soirée or séance. I was, when in 
Washington, invited to these parties. At one of 
them I chanced to sit between the President and 
Senator Don Cameron. Mr. Carlisle, at the time 
Speaker of the House - who handled his cards like 
a child and, as we all knew, couldn't play a little - 
was seated on the opposite side of the table.</p>
            <p>After a while Mr. Cameron and I began “bluffing” 
the game - I recall that the limit was five 
dollars - that is, raising and back-raising each other, 
and whoever else happened to be in, without much 
or any regard to the cards we held.</p>
            <p>It chanced on a deal that I picked up a pat flush, 
Mr. Cleveland a pat full. The Pennsylvania senator 
and I went to the extreme, the President of 
course willing enough for us to play his hand for 
him. But the Speaker of the House persistently 
stayed with us and could not be driven out.</p>
            <p>When it came to a draw Senator Cameron drew 
one card. Mr. Cleveland and I stood pat. But 
Mr. Carlisle drew four cards. At length, after 
much banter and betting, it reached a show-down 
<pb id="watterson212" n="212"/>
and, <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="la">mirabile dictu</foreign></hi>, the Speaker held four kings! </p>
            <p>“Take the money, Carlisle; take the money,” 
exclaimed the President. “If ever I am President 
again you shall be Secretary of the Treasury. But 
don't you make that four-card draw too often.”</p>
            <p>He was President again, and Mr. Carlisle was 
Secretary of the Treasury.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>III</head>
            <p>There had arisen a disagreeable misunderstanding 
between General Schenck and myself during 
the period when the general was Minister at the 
Court of St. James. In consequence of this we did 
not personally meet. One evening at Chamberlin's 
years after, a party of us - mainly the Ohio 
statesman's old colleagues in Congress - were playing 
poker. He came in and joined us. Neither of us 
knew the other even by sight and there was no 
presentation when he sat in.</p>
            <p>At length a direct play between the newcomer
and me arose. There was a moment's pause.
Obviously we were strangers. Then it was that
Senator Allison, of Iowa, who had in his goodness
of heart purposely brought about this very situation, 
introduced us. The general reddened. I was
		
<pb id="watterson213" n="213"/>
taken aback. But there was no escape, and carrying 
it off amiably we shook hands. It is needless to 
say that then and there we dropped our groundless 
feud and remained the rest of his life very good 
friends.</p>
            <p>In this connection still another poker story. Sam 
Bugg, the Nashville gambler, was on a Mississippi 
steamer bound for New Orleans. He came upon a 
party of Tennesseeans whom a famous card sharp 
had inveigled and was flagrantly robbing. Sam 
went away, obtained a pack of cards, and stacked 
them to give the gambler four kings and the brightest 
one of the Nashville boys four aces. After two 
or three failures to bring the cold deck into action 
Sam Bugg brushed a spider - an imaginary spider, 
of course - from the gambler's coat collar, for an 
instant distracting his attention - and in the 
momentary confusion the stacked cards were duly dealt 
and the betting began, the gambler confident and 
aggressive. Finally, all the money up, the four 
aces beat the four kings, and for a greater amount 
than the Nashvillians had lost and the gambler had 
won. Whereupon, without change of muscle, the 
gambler drawled: “Mr. Bugg, the next time you 
see a spider biting me let him bite on!”</p>
            <pb id="watterson214" n="214"/>
            <p>I was told that the Senate Game had been played 
during the War of Sections and directly after for 
large sums. With the arrival of the rebel brigadiers 
it was perforce reduced to a reasonable limit.</p>
            <p>The “road gang” was not unknown at the White 
House. Sometimes it assembled at private houses, 
but its accustomed place of meeting was first 
Welcker's and then Chamberlin's. I do not know 
whether it continues to have abiding place or even 
an existence. In spite of the reputation given me 
by the pert paragraphers I have not been on a race 
course or seen a horse race or played for other than 
immaterial stakes for more than thirty years.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>IV</head>
            <p>As an all-round newspaper writer and reporter 
many sorts of people, high and low, little and big, 
queer and commonplace, fell in my way; statesmen 
and politicians, artists and athletes, circus riders 
and prize fighters; the riffraff and the élite; the 
professional and dilettante of the world polite and 
the underworld.</p>
            <p>I knew Mike Walsh and Tim Campbell. I knew 
John Morrissey. I have seen Heenan - one of 
the handsomest men of his time - and likewise Adah 
<pb id="watterson215" n="215"/>
Isaacs Menken, his inamorata - many said his wife 
- who went into mourning for him and thereafter 
hied away to Paris, where she lived under the 
protection of Alexandre Dumas, the elder, who buried 
her in Père Lachaise under a handsome monument 
bearing two words, “Thou knowest,” beneath a 
carved hand pointed to heaven.</p>
            <p>I did draw the line, however, at Cora Pearl and 
Marcus Cicero Stanley.</p>
            <p>The Parisian courtesan was at the zenith of her 
extraordinary celebrity when I became a rustic 
boulevardier. She could be seen everywhere and 
on all occasions. Her gowns were the showiest, her 
equipage the smartest; her entourage, loud though 
it was and vulgar, yet in its way was undeniable. 
She reigned for a long time the recognized queen 
of the demi-monde. I have beheld her in her glory 
on her throne - her two thrones, for she had two - 
one on the south side of the river, the other at the 
east end - not to mention the race course - surrounded 
by a retinue of the disreputable. She did 
not awaken in me the least curiosity, and I declined 
many opportunities to meet her.</p>
            <p>Marcus Cicero Stanley was sprung from an 
aristocratic, even a distinguished, North Carolina
<pb id="watterson216" n="216"/>
family. He came to New York and set up for a 
swell. How he lived I never cared to find out, 
though he was believed to be what the police call 
a “fence.” He seemed a cross between a “con” 
and a “beat.” Yet for a while he flourished at 
Delmonico's, which he made his headquarters, and cut a 
kind of dash with the unknowing. He was a handsome, 
mannerly brute who knew bow to dress and 
carry himself like a gentleman.</p>
            <p>Later there came to New York another Southerner - 
a Far Southerner of a very different quality 
- who attracted no little attention. This was Tom 
Ochiltree. He, too, was well born, his father an 
eminent jurist of Texas; he, himself, a wit, <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">bon 
homme</foreign></hi> and raconteur. Travers once said: “We 
have three professional liars in America - Tom 
Ochiltree is one and George Alfred Townsend is 
the other two.”</p>
            <p>The stories told of Tom would fill a book. He 
denied none, however preposterous - was indeed 
the author of many of the most amusing - of how, 
when the old judge proposed to take him into law 
partnership he caused to be painted an office sign: 
Thomas P. Ochiltree and Father; of his reply to 
General Grant, who had made him United States 
<pb id="watterson217" n="217"/>
Marshal of Texas, and later suggested that it 
would be well for Tom to pay less attention to the 
race course: “Why, Mr. President, all that turf 
publicity relates to a horse named after me, not 
to me,” it being that the horse of the day had been 
so called; and of General Grant's reply: “Nevertheless, 
it would be well, Tom, for you to look in upon 
Texas once in a while” - in short, of his many sayings 
and exploits while a member of Congress from 
the Galveston district; among the rest, that having 
brought in a resolution tendering sympathy to the 
German Empire on the death of Herr Laska, the 
most advanced and distinguished of Radical Socialists, 
which became for the moment a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">cause célébre</foreign></hi>. 
Tom remarked, “Not that I care a damn about it, 
except for the prominence it gives to Bismarck.”</p>
            <p>He lived when in Washington at Chamberlin's. 
He and John Chamberlin were close friends. Once 
when he was breakfasting with John a mutual 
friend came in. He was in doubt what to order. 
Tom suggested beefsteak and onions.</p>
            <p>“But,” objected the newcomer, “I am about to 
call on some ladies, and the smell of onions on my 
breath, you know!”</p>
            <p>“Don't let that trouble you,” said Tom; “you 
<pb id="watterson218" n="218"/>
have the steak and onions and when you get your 
bill that will take your breath away!”</p>
            <p>Under an unpromising exterior - a stocky build 
and fiery red head - there glowed a brave, generous 
and tender spirit. The man was a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">preux chevalier</foreign></hi>. 
He was a knight-errant. All women - especially 
all good and discerning women who knew him and 
who could intuitively read beneath that clumsy 
personality his fine sense of respect - even of adoration 
- loved Tom Ochiltree.</p>
            <p>The equivocal celebrity he enjoyed was largely 
fostered by himself, his stories mostly at his own 
expense. His education had been but casual. But 
he had a great deal of it and a varied assortment. 
He knew everybody on both sides of the Atlantic, 
his friends ranging from the Prince of Wales, afterward 
Edward VII, Gladstone and Disraeli, Gambetta 
and Thiers, to the bucks of the jockey clubs. 
There were two of Tom - Tom the noisy on exhibition, 
and Tom the courtier in society.</p>
            <p>How he lived when out of office was the subject 
of unflattering conjecture. Many thought him the 
stipendiary of Mr. Mackay, the multimillionaire, 
with whom he was intimate, who told me he could 
never induce Tom to take money except for service 
<pb id="watterson219" n="219"/>
rendered. Among his familiars was Colonel North, 
the English money magnate, who said the same 
thing. He had a widowed sister in Texas to whom 
he regularly sent an income sufficient for herself 
and family. And when he died, to the surprise of 
every one, he left his sister quite an accumulation. 
He had never been wholly a spendthrift. Though 
he lived well at Chamberlin's in Washington and 
the Waldorf in New York he was careful of his 
credit and his money. I dare say he was not 
unfortunate in the stock market. He never married and 
when he died, still a youngish man as modern ages 
go, all sorts of stories were told of him, and the 
space writers, having a congenial subject, disported 
themselves voluminously. Inevitably most of their 
stories were apocryphal.</p>
            <p>I wonder shall we ever get any real truth out of 
what is called history? There are so many sides to 
it and such a confusing din of voices. How much 
does old Sam Johnson owe of the fine figure he cuts 
to Boswell, and, minus Boswell, how much would 
be left of him? For nearly a century the Empress 
Josephine was pictured as the effigy of the faithful 
and suffering wife sacrificed upon the altar of 
unprincipled and selfish ambition - lovelorn, deserted, 
<pb id="watterson220" n="220"/>
heartbroken. It was Napoleon, not Josephine, 
except in her pride, who suffered. Who shall tell us 
the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the 
truth, about Hamilton; about Burr; about Cæsar, 
Caligula and Cleopatra? Did Washington, when 
he was angry, swear like a trooper? What was the 
matter with Nero?</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>IV</head>
            <p>One evening Edward King and I were dining in
the Champs Elysées when he said: “There is a
new coon - a literary coon - come to town. He is
a Scotchman and his name is Robert Louis Stevenson.” 
Then he told me of Dr. Jekyll and Mr.
Hyde. At that moment the subject of our talk
was living in a kind of self-imposed penury not half
a mile away. Had we known this we could have
ended the poor fellow's struggle with his pride and
ambition then and there; have put him in the way
of sure work and plenty of it; perhaps have lengthened, 
certainly have sweetened, his days, unless it
be true that he was one of the impossibles, as he
may easily be conceived to have been from reading
his wayward biography and voluminous 
correspondence.</p>
            <pb id="watterson221" n="221"/>
            <p>To a young Kentuckian, one of “my boys,” was 
given the opportunity to see the last of him and to 
bury him in far-away Samoa, whither he had taken 
himself for the final adventure and where he died, 
having attained some measure of the dreams he had 
cherished, and, let us hope, happy in the consciousness 
of the achievement.</p>
            <p>I rather think Stevenson should be placed at the 
head of the latter-day fictionists. But fashions in 
literature as in dress are ever changing. Washington 
Irving was the first of our men of letters to obtain 
foreign recognition. While the fires of hate 
between Great Britain and America were still burning 
he wrote kindly and elegantly of England and 
the English, and was accepted on both sides of the 
ocean. Taking his style from Addison and Goldsmith, 
he emulated their charity and humor; he 
went to Spain and in the same deft way he pictured 
the then unknown byways of the land of dreams; 
and coming home again he peopled the region of the 
Hudson with the beings of legend and fancy which 
are dear to us.</p>
            <p>He became our national man of letters. He stood 
quite at the head of our literature, giving the lie 
to the scornful query, “Who reads an American 
<pb id="watterson222" n="222"/>
book?” As a pioneer he will always be considered; 
as a simple and vivid writer of things familiar and 
entertaining he will probably always be read; but 
as an originator literary history will hardly place 
him very high. There Bret Harte surely led him. 
The Tales of the Argonauts as works of creative 
fancy exceed the Sketches of Washington Irving 
alike in wealth of color and humor, in pathos and 
dramatic action.</p>
            <p>Some writers make an exception of the famous 
Sleepy Hollow story. But they have in mind the 
Rip Van Winkle of Jefferson and Boucicault, not 
the rather attenuated story of Irving, which - as far 
as the twenty years of sleep went - was borrowed 
from an old German legend.</p>
            <p>Mark Twain and Bret Harte, however, will 
always be bracketed with Washington Irving. Of 
the three I incline to the opinion that Mark Twain 
did the broadest and strongest work. His 
imagination had wider reach than Irving's. There is 
nowhere, as there is in Harte, the suspicion either of 
insincerity or of artificiality. Irving's humor was 
the humor of Sir Roger de Coverley and the Vicar 
of Wakefield. It is old English. Mark Twain's is 
his own - American through and through to the 
<pb id="watterson223" n="223"/>
bone. I am not unmindful of Cooper and Hawthorne, 
of Longfellow, of Lowell and of Poe, but 
speak of Irving as the pioneer American man of 
letters, and of Mark Twain and Bret Harte as 
American literature's most conspicuous and original 
modern examples.</p>

            <p><emph rend="bold">THE</emph> American newspaper has had, even in
my time, three separate and distinct epochs;
the thick-and-thin, more or less servile party 
organ; the personal, one-man-controlled, rather
blatant and would-be independent; and the timorous,	
corporation, or family-owned billboard of
such	news as the ever-increasing censorship of a
constantly centralizing Federal Government will
allow.</p>
            <p>This latter appears to be its present state. 
Neither its individuality nor its self-exploitation, 
scarcely its grandiose pretension, remains. There 
continues to be printed in large type an amount of 
<pb id="watterson225" n="225"/>
shallow stuff that would not be missed if it were 
omitted altogether. But, except as a bulletin of 
yesterday's doings, limited, the daily newspaper 
counts for little, the single advantage of the editor 
- in case there is an editor - that is, one clothed 
with supervising authority who “edits” - being that 
he reaches the public with his lucubrations first, 
the sanctity that once hedged the editorial “we” 
long since departed.</p>
            <p>The editor dies, even as the actor, and leaves no 
copy. Editorial reputations have been as ephemeral 
as the publications which gave them contemporary 
importance. Without going as far back 
as the Freneaus and the Callenders, who recalls 
the names of Mordecai Mannasseh Noah, of 
Edwin Crosswell and of James Watson Webb? In 
their day and generation they were influential and 
distinguished journalists. There are dozens of 
other names once famous but now forgotten; 
George Wilkins Kendall; Gerard Hallock; Erastus 
Brooks; Alexander Bullitt; Barnwell Rhett; 
Morton McMichael; George William Childs, even 
Thomas Ritchie, Duff Green and Amos Kendall. 
“Gales and Seaton” sounds like a trade-mark; but 
it stood for not a little and lasted a long time in 
<pb id="watterson226" n="226"/>
the National Capital, where newspaper vassalage 
and the public printing went hand-in-hand.</p>
            <p>For a time the duello flourished. There were
frequent “affairs of honor” - notably about 
Richmond in Virginia and Charleston in South 
Carolina - sometimes fatal meetings, as in the case of 
John H. Pleasants and one of the sons of Thomas 
Ritchie in which Pleasants was killed, and the yet 
more celebrated affair between Graves, of 
Kentucky, and Cilley, of Maine, in which Cilley was 
killed; Bladensburg the scene, and the refusal of 
Cilley to recognize James Watson Webb the 
occasion.</p>
            <p>I once had an intimate account of this duel with
all the cruel incidents from Henry A. Wise, a party 
to it, and a blood-curdling narrative it made. They 
fought with rifles at thirty paces, and Cilley fell 
on the third fire. It did much to discredit duelling 
in the South. The story, however, that Graves 
was so much affected that thereafter he could never 
sleep in a darkened chamber had no foundation 
whatever, a fact I learned from my associate in 
the old Louisville Journal and later in The Courier-Journal, 
Mr. Isham Henderson, who was a brother-in-law 
of Mr. Graves, his sister, Mrs. Graves,
<pb id="watterson227" n="227"/>
being still alive. The duello died at length. There 
was never sufficient reason for its being. It was 
both a vanity and a fad. In Hopkinson Smith's
“Col. Carter of Cartersville,” its real character is 
hit off to the life.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>II</head>
            <p>When very early, rather too early, I found 
myself in the saddle, Bennett and Greeley and 
Raymond in New York, and Medill and Storey in 
Chicago, were yet alive and conspicuous figures in the 
newspaper life of the time. John Bigelow, who 
had retired from the New York Evening Post, was 
Minister to France. Halstead was coming on, but, 
except as a correspondent, Whitelaw Reid had not 
“arrived.” The like was true of “Joe” McCullagh, 
who, in the same character, divided the newspaper 
reading attention of the country with George 
Alfred Townsend and Donn Piatt. Joseph Medill 
was withdrawing from the Chicago Tribune in 
favor of Horace White, presently to return and die 
in harness - a man of sterling intellect and character 
- and Wilbur F. Storey, his local rival, who was 
beginning to show signs of the mental malady that, 
developed into monomania, ultimately ended his life 
<pb id="watterson228" n="228"/>
in gloom and despair, wrecking one of the finest 
newspaper properties outside of New York. William 
R. Nelson, who was to establish a really great 
newspaper in Kansas City, was still a citizen of Ft. 
Wayne.</p>
            <p>James Gordon Bennett, the elder, seemed then 
to me, and has always seemed, the real founder of 
the modern newspaper as a vehicle of popular 
information, and, in point of apprehension, at least, 
James Gordon Bennett, the younger, did not fall 
behind his father. What was, and might have been 
regarded and dismissed as a trivial slander drove 
him out of New York and made him the greater 
part of his life a resident of Paris, where I was 
wont to meet and know much of him.</p>
            <p>The New York Herald, under father and son, 
attained enormous prosperity, prestige and real 
power. It suffered chiefly from what they call in 
Ireland “absentee landlordism.” Its “proprietor,” 
for he never described himself as its “editor,” was 
a man of exquisite sensibilities - a “despot” of 
course - whom nature created for a good citizen, a 
good husband and the head of a happy domestic 
fabric. He should have married the woman of his 
choice, for he was deeply in love with her and never 
<pb id="watterson229" n="229"/>
ceased to love her, forty years later leaving her in 
his will a handsome legacy.</p>
            <p>Crossing the ocean with the “Commodore,” as he 
was called by his familiars, not long after he had 
taken up his residence abroad, naturally we fell 
occasionally into shop talk. “What would you do,” 
he once said, “if you owned the Herald?” “Why,” 
I answered, “I would stay in New York and edit 
it;” and then I proceeded, “but you mean to ask me 
what I think you ought to do with it?” “Yes,” he 
said, “that is about the size of it.”</p>
            <p>“Well, Commodore,” I answered, “if I were you, 
when we get in I would send for John Cockerill and 
make him managing editor, and for John Young, 
and put him in charge of the editorial page, and 
then I would go and lose myself in the wilds of 
Africa.”</p>
            <p>He adopted the first two of these suggestions. 
John A. Cockerill was still under contract with 
Joseph Pulitzer and could not accept for a year or 
more. He finally did accept and died in the Bennett 
service. John Russell Young took the editorial 
page and was making it “hum” when a most 
unaccountable thing happened. I was amazed to 
receive an invitation to a dinner he had tendered 
<pb id="watterson230" n="230"/>
and was about to give to the quondam Virginian 
and just elected New York Justice Roger A. 
Pryor. “Is Young gone mad,” I said to myself, 
“or can he have forgotten that the one man of all 
the world whom the House of Bennett can never 
forget, or forgive, is Roger A. Pryor?”</p>
            <p>The Bennett-Pryor quarrel had been a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">cause 
célébre</foreign></hi> when John Young was night editor of the 
Philadelphia Press and I was one of its Washington 
correspondents. Nothing so virulent had ever 
passed between an editor and a Congressman. In 
one of his speeches Pryor had actually gone the 
length of rudely referring to Mrs. James Gordon 
Bennett.</p>
            <p>The dinner was duly given. But it ended John's 
connection with the Herald and his friendly 
relations with the owner of the Herald. The incident 
might be cited as among “The Curiosities of 
Journalism,” if ever a book with that title is written. 
John's “break” was so bad that I never had the 
heart to ask him how he could have perpetrated it.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>III</head>
            <p>The making of an editor is a complex affair. 
Poets and painters are said to be born. Editors 
<pb id="watterson231" n="231"/>
and orators are made. Many essential elements 
enter into the editorial fabrication; need to be 
concentrated upon and embodied by a single individual, 
and even, with these, environment is left to supply 
the opportunity and give the final touch.</p>
            <p>Aptitude, as the first ingredient, goes without 
saying of every line of human endeavor. We have 
the authority of the adage for the belief that it is 
not possible to make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. 
Yet have I known some unpromising tyros mature 
into very capable workmen.</p>
            <p>The modern newspaper, as we know it, may be 
fairly said to have been the invention of James 
Gordon Bennett, the elder. Before him there were 
journals, not newspapers. When he died he had 
developed the news scheme in kind, though not in 
the degree that we see so elaborate and 
resplendent in New York and other of the leading 
centers of population. Mr. Bennett had led a 
vagrant and varied life when he started the Herald. 
He had been many things by turns, including a 
writer of verses and stories, but nothing very 
successful nor very long. At length he struck a central

of Yesterday, fully and fairly, without fear 
or favor. He was followed by Greeley and 
Raymond - making a curious and very dissimilar 
triumvirate - and, at longer range, by Prentice and 
Forney, by Bowles and Dana, Storey, Medill and 
Halstead. All were marked men; Greeley a writer and 
propagandist; Raymond a writer, declaimer and 
politician; Prentice a wit and partisan; Dana a 
scholar and an organizer; Bowles a man both of 
letters and affairs. The others were men of all 
work, writing and fighting their way to the front, 
but possessing the “nose for news,” using the Bennett 
formula and rescript as the basis of their serious 
efforts, and never losing sight of it. Forney 
had been a printer. Medill and Storey were caught 
young by the lure of printer's ink. Bowles was 
born and reared in the office of the Springfield 
Republican, founded by his father, and Halstead, a 
cross betwixt a pack horse and a race horse, was 
broken to harness before he was out of his teens.</p>
            <p>Assuming journalism, equally with medicine and 
law, to be a profession, it is the only profession in 
which versatility is not a disadvantage. Specialism 
at the bar, or by the bedside, leads to perfection 
and attains results. The great doctor is the great

surgeon or the great prescriptionist - he cannot be 
great in both - and the great lawyer is rarely great, 
if ever, as counselor and orator.</p>
            <p>The great editor is by no means the great writer. 
But he ought to be able to write and must be a 
judge of writing. The newspaper office is a little 
kingdom. The great editor needs to know and does 
know every range of it between the editorial room, 
the composing room and the pressroom. He must 
hold well in hand everybody and every function, 
having risen, as it were, step-by-step from the 
ground floor to the roof. He should be level-headed, 
yet impressionable; sympathetic, yet self-possessed; 
able quickly to sift, detect and discriminate; 
of various knowledge, experience and interest; 
the cackle of the adjacent barnyard the noise 
of the world to his eager mind and pliant ear. 
Nothing too small for him to tackle, nothing too 
great, he should keep to the middle of the road and 
well in rear of the moving columns; loving his art 
- for such it is - for art's sake; getting his 
sufficiency, along with its independence, in the public 
approval and patronage, seeking never anything 
further for himself. Disinterestedness being the 
soul of successful journalism, unselfish devotion to 
<pb id="watterson234" n="234"/>
every noble purpose in public and private life, he 
should say to preferment, as to bribers, “get behind 
me, Satan.” Whitelaw Reid, to take a ready and 
conspicuous example, was a great journalist, but 
rather early in life he abandoned journalism for 
office and became a figure in politics and diplomacy 
so that, as in the case of Franklin, whose example
and footsteps in the main he followed, he will be 
remembered rather as the Ambassador than as the 
Editor.</p>
            <p>More and more must these requirements be fulfilled 
by the aspiring journalist. As the world 
passes from the Rule of Force - force of prowess, 
force of habit, force of convention - to the Rule 
of Numbers, the daily journal is destined, if it 
survives as a power, to become the teacher - the very 
Bible - of the people. The people are already 
beginning to distinguish between the wholesome and 
the meretricious in their newspapers. Newspaper 
owners, likewise, are beginning to realize the value 
of character. Instances might be cited where the 
public, discerning some sinister but unseen power 
behind its press, has slowly yet surely withdrawn 
its confidence and support. However impersonal it 
pretends to be, with whatever of mystery it affects 
<pb id="watterson235" n="235"/>
to envelop itself, the public insists upon some visible
presence. In some States the law requires it. Thus 
“personal journalism” cannot be escaped, and 
whether the “one-man power” emanates from the 
Counting Room or the Editorial Room, as they are 
called, it must be clear and answerable, responsive 
to the common weal, and, above all, trustworthy.</p>

            <p>John Weiss Forney was among the most conspicuous 
men of his time. He was likewise one of 
the handsomest. By nature and training a journalist, 
he played an active, not to say an equivocal, 
part in public life - at the outset a Democratic and 
then a Republican leader.</p>
            <p>Born in the little town of Lancaster, it was his 
mischance to have attached himself early in life to 
the fortunes of Mr. Buchanan, whom he long served 
with fidelity and effect. But when Mr. Buchanan 
came to the Presidency, Forney, who aspired first 
to a place in the Cabinet, which was denied him, 
and then to a seat in the Senate, for which he was 
beaten - through flagrant bribery, as the story ran 
- was left out in the cold. Thereafter he became 
something of a political adventurer.</p>
            <pb id="watterson236" n="236"/>
            <p>The days of the newspaper “organ” aproached 
their end. Forney's occupation, like Othello's, was 
gone, for he was nothing if not an organ grinder. 
Facile with pen and tongue, he seemed a born courtier - 
a veritable Dalgetty, whose loyal devotion to 
his knight-at-arms deserved better recognition than 
the cold and wary Pennsylvania chieftain was willing 
to give. It is only fair to say that Forney's 
character furnished reasonable excuse for this 
neglect and apparent ingratitude. The row between 
them, however, was party splitting. As the friend 
and backer of Douglas, and later along a brilliant 
journalistic soldier of fortune, Forney did as much 
as any other man to lay the Democratic party low.</p>
            <p>I can speak of him with a certain familiarity and 
authority, for I was one of his “boys.” I admired 
him greatly and loved him dearly. Most of the 
young newspaper men about Philadelphia and 
Washington did so. He was an all-around modern 
journalist of the first class. Both as a newspaper 
writer and creator and manager, he stood upon the 
front line, rating with Bennett and Greeley and 
Raymond. He first entertained and then cultivated 
the thirst for office, which proved the undoing of 
Greeley and Raymond, and it proved his undoing. 
<pb id="watterson237" n="237"/>
He had a passion for politics. He would shine in 
public life. If he could not play first fiddle he 
would take any other instrument. Thus failing of 
a Senatorship, he was glad to get the Secretaryship 
of the Senate, having been Clerk of the House.</p>
            <p>He was bound to be in the orchestra. In those 
days newspaper independence was little known. 
Mr. Greeley was willing to play bottle-holder to 
Mr. Seward, Mr. Prentice to Mr. Clay. James 
Gordon Bennett, the elder, and later his son, James 
Gordon Bennett, the younger, challenged this kind 
of servility. The Herald stood at the outset of its 
career manfully in the face of unspeakable obloquy 
against it. The public understood it and rose to it. 
The time came when the elder Bennett was to 
attain official as well as popular recognition. Mr. 
Lincoln offered him the French mission and Mr. 
Bennett declined it. He was rich and famous, 
and to another it might have seemed a kind of
crowning glory. To him it seemed only a coming 
down - a badge of servitude - a lowering of the flag
of independent journalism under which, and under
which alone, he had fought all his life.</p>
            <p>Charles A. Dana was not far behind the 
Bennetts in his independence. He well knew what 
	
<pb id="watterson238" n="238"/>
parties and politicians are. The most scholarly and 
accomplished of American journalists, he made the 
Sun “shine for all,” and, during the years of his 
active management, a most prosperous property. It 
happened that whilst I was penny-a-lining in New 
York I took a piece of space work - not very common 
in those days - to the Tribune and received a 
few dollars for it. Ten years later, meeting Mr. 
Dana at dinner, I recalled the circumstance, and 
thenceforward we became the best of friends. 
Twice indeed we had runabouts together in foreign 
lands. His house in town, and the island home 
called Dorsoris, which he had made for himself, 
might not inaptly be described as very shrines of 
hospitality and art, the master of the house a 
virtuoso in music and painting no less than in letters. 
One might meet under his roof the most diverse 
people, but always interesting and agreeable people. 
Perhaps at times he carried his aversions a 
little too far. But he had reasons for them, and a 
man of robust temperament and habit, it was not 
in him to sit down under an injury, or fancied 
injury. I never knew a more efficient journalist. 
What he did not know about a newspaper, was 
scarcely worth knowing.</p>
            <pb id="watterson239" n="239"/>
            <p>In my day Journalism has made great strides. It 
has become a recognized profession. Schools of 
special training are springing up here and there. 
Several of the universities have each its College of 
Journalism. The tendency to discredit these, which 
was general and pronounced at the start, lowers its 
tone and grows less confident.</p>
            <p>Assuredly there is room for special training 
toward the making of an editor. Too often the 
newspaper subaltern obtaining promotion through 
aptitudes peculiarly his own, has failed to acquire even 
the most rudimentary knowledge of his art. He has 
been too busy seeking “scoops” and doing “stunts” 
to concern himself about perspectives, principles, 
causes and effects, probable impressions and 
consequences, or even to master the technical details 
which make such a difference in the preparation 
of matter intended for publication and popular 
perusal. The School of Journalism may not be 
always able to give him the needful instruction. But 
it can set him in the right direction and better prepare 
him to think and act for himself.</p>

            <p><emph rend="bold">I DO</emph> not believe that the bully and braggart is 
more in evidence in Kentucky and Texas than 
in other Commonwealths of the Union, except that 
each is by the space writers made the favorite arena 
of his exploits and adopted as the scene of the comic 
stories told at his expense. The son-of-a-gun from 
Bitter Creek, like the “elegant gentleman” from 
the Dark and Bloody Ground, represents a certain 
type to be found more or less developed in each and 
every State of the Union. He is not always a
coward. Driven, as it were, to the wall, he will 
often make good.</p>
            <p>He is as a rule in quest of adventures. He enters 
<pb id="watterson241" n="241"/>
the village from the countryside and approaches the 
mêlée. “Is it a free fight?” says he. Assured that 
it is, “Count me in,” says he. Ten minutes later, 
“Is it still a free fight?” he says, and, again assured 
in the affirmative, says he, “Count me out.”</p>
            <p>Once the greatest of bullies provoked old Aaron 
Pennington, “the strongest man in the world,” who 
struck out from the shoulder and landed his victim 
in the middle of the street. Here he lay in a helpless 
heap until they carted him off to the hospital, 
where for a day or two be flickered between life and 
death. “Foh God,” said Pennington, “I barely 
teched him.”</p>
            <p>This same bully threatened that when a certain 
mountain man came to town he would “finish him.” 
The mountain man came. He was enveloped in an 
old-fashioned cloak, presumably concealing his 
armament, and walked about ostentatiously in the 
proximity of his boastful foeman, who remained as 
passive as a lamb. When, having failed to provoke 
a fight, he had taken himself off, an onlooker said: 
“Bill, I thought you were going to do him up?”</p>
            <p>“But,” says Bill, “did you see him?”</p>
            <p>“Yes, I saw him. What of that?”</p>
            <pb id="watterson242" n="242"/>
            <p>“Why,” exclaimed the bully, “that man was a 
walking arsenal.”</p>
            <p>Aaron Pennington, the strong man just mentioned, 
was, in his younger days, a river pilot. Billy 
Hite, a mite of a man, was clerk. They had a 
disagreement, when Aaron told Billy that if he caught 
him on “the harrican deck,” he would pitch him 
overboard. The next day Billy appeared whilst 
Aaron, off duty, was strolling up and down outside 
the pilot-house, and strolled offensively in his wake. 
Never a hostile glance or a word from Aaron. At 
last, tired of dumb show, Billy broke forth with a 
torrent of imprecation closing with “When are you 
going to pitch me off the boat, you blankety-blank 
son-of-a-gun and coward?”</p>
            <p>Aaron Pennington was a brave man. He was 
both fearless and self-possessed. He paused, gazed 
quizzically at his little tormentor, and says he: 
“Billy, you got a pistol, and you want to get a pretext 
to shoot me, and I ain't going to give it to you.”</p>

            <p>Among the hostels of Christendom the Galt 
House, of Louisville, for a long time occupied a 
foremost place and held its own. It was burned 
<pb id="watterson243" n="243"/>
to the ground fifty years ago and a new Galt House
as erected, not upon the original site, but upon
the same street, a block above, and, although one of 
the most imposing buildings in the world, it could 
never be made to thrive. It stands now a rather 
useless encumbrance - a whited sepulchre - a marble 
memorial of the Solid South and the Kentucky 
that was, on whose portal might truthfully appear 
the legend:</p>

            <p>Aris Throckmorton, its manager in the Thirties, 
the Forties and the Fifties, was a personality and 
a personage. The handsomest of men and the most 
illiterate, he exemplified the characteristics and 
peculiarities of the days of the river steamer and the 
stage coach, when “mine host” felt it his duty to
make the individual acquaintance of his patrons and 
each and severally to look after their comfort.
Many stories are told at his expense; of how he 
made a formal call upon Dickens - it was, in point
of fact, Marryatt - in his apartment, to be coolly 
told that when its occupant wanted him he would 
<pb id="watterson244" n="244"/>
ring for him; and of how, <sic corr="investigating">investiagting</sic> a strange 
box which had newly arrived from Florida, the 
prevailing opinion being that the live animal within 
was an alligator, he exclaimed, “Alligator, hell; it's 
a scorponicum.” He died at length, to be succeeded 
by his son John, a very different character. And 
thereby hangs a tale.</p>
            <p>John Throckmorton, like Aris, his father, was 
one of the handsomest of men. Perhaps because 
he was so he became the victim of one of the 
strangest of feminine whimsies and human freaks. 
There was a young girl in Louisville, named Ellen 
Godwin. Meeting him at a public ball she fell 
violently in love with him. As Throckmorton did 
not reciprocate this, and refused to pursue the 
acquaintance, she began to dog his footsteps. She 
dressed herself in deep black and took up a position 
in front of the Galt House, and when he came out 
and wherever he went she followed him. No matter 
how long he stayed, when he reappeared she was on 
the spot and watch. He took himself away to San 
Francisco. It was but the matter of a few weeks 
when she was there, too. He hied him thence to 
Liverpool, and as he stepped upon the dock there 
<pb id="watterson245" n="245"/>
she was. She had got wind of his going and, having 
caught an earlier steamer, preceded him.</p>
            <p>Finally the War of Sections arrived. John 
Throckmorton became a Confederate officer, and, 
being able to keep her out of the lines, he had a rest 
of four years. But, when after the war he returned 
to Louisville, the quarry began again.</p>
            <p>He was wont to call her “Old Hell's Delight.” 
Finally, one night, as he was passing the market, 
she rushed out and rained upon him blow after blow 
with a frozen rabbit.</p>
            <p>Then the authorities took a hand. She was 
arraigned for disorderly conduct and brought before 
the Court of Police. Then the town, which knew 
nothing of the case and accepted her goings on as 
proof of wrong, rose; and she had a veritable ovation, 
coming away with flying colors. This, however, 
served to satisfy her. Thenceforward she desisted 
and left poor John Throckmorton in peace.</p>
            <p>I knew her well. She used once in a while to 
come and see me, having some story or other to tell. 
On one occasion I said to her: “Ellen, why do you
pursue this man in this cruel way? What possible 
good can it do you?” She looked me straight in the 
eye and slowly replied: “Because I love him.”</p>
            <pb id="watterson246" n="246"/>
            <p>I investigated the case closely and thoroughly 
and was assured, as he had assured me, that he had 
never done her the slightest wrong. She had, on 
occasion, told me the same thing, and this I fully 
believed.</p>
            <p>He was a man, every inch of him, and a gentleman 
through and through - the very soul of honor 
in his transactions of every sort - most highly 
respected and esteemed wherever he was known - yet 
his life was made half a failure and wholly unhappy 
by this “crazy Jane,” the general public taking 
appearances for granted and willing to believe nothing 
good of one who, albeit proud and honorable, 
held defiantly aloof, disdaining self-defense.</p>
            <p>On the whole I have not known many men more 
unfortunate than John Throckmorton, who, but for 
“Old Hell's Delight,” would have encountered little 
obstacle to the pursuit of prosperity and happiness.</p>

            <p>Another interesting Kentuckian of this period 
was John Thompson Gray. He was a Harvard 
man - a wit, a scholar, and, according to old Southern 
standards, a chevalier. Handsome and gifted, 
he had the disastrous misfortune just after leaving 
<pb id="watterson247" n="247"/>
college to kill his friend in a duel - a mortal affair 
growing, as was usual in those days, out of a trivial 
cause - and this not only saddened his life, but, in 
its ambitious aims, shadowed and defeated it. His 
university comrades had fully counted on his making 
a great career. Being a man of fortune, he was 
able to live like a gentleman without public preferment, 
and this he did, except to his familiars aloof 
and sensitive to the last.</p>
            <p>William Preston, the whilom Minister to Spain 
and Confederate General, and David Yandell, the 
eminent surgeon, were his devoted friends, and a 
notable trio they made. Stoddard Johnston, Boyd 
Winchester and I - very much younger men - sat 
at their feet and immensely enjoyed their brilliant
conversation.</p>
            <p>Dr. Yandell was not only as proclaimed by Dr. 
Gross and Dr. Sayre the ablest surgeon of his day, 
but he was also a gentleman of varied experience 
and great social distinction. He had studied long 
in Paris and was the pal of John Howard Payne, 
the familiar friend of Lamartine, Dumas and 
Lemaître. He knew Béranger, Hugo and Balzac. It 
would be hard to find three Kentuckians less 
provincial, more unaffected, scintillant and worldly
	
<pb id="watterson248" n="248"/>
wise than he and William Preston and John 
Thompson Gray.</p>
            <p>Indeed the list of my acquaintances - many of 
them intimates - some of them friends - would be, 
if recounted, a long one, not mentioning the foreigners, 
embracing a diverse company all the way from 
Chunkey Towles to Grover Cleveland, from Wake 
Holman to John Pierpont Morgan, from John 
Chamberlin to Thomas Edison. I once served as 
honorary pall-bearer to a professional gambler who 
was given a public funeral; a man who had 
been a gallant Confederate soldier; whom nature 
intended for an artist, and circumstance diverted 
into a sport; but who retained to the last the poetic 
fancy and the spirit of the gallant, leaving behind 
him, when he died, like a veritable cavalier, chiefly 
debts and friends. He was not a bad sort in business, 
as the English say, nor in conviviality. But 
in fighting he was “a dandy.” The goody-goody 
philosophy of the namby-pamby takes an extreme 
and unreal view of life. It flies to extremes. There 
are middle men. Travers used to describe one of 
these, whom he did not wish particularly to 
emphasize, as “a fairly clever son-of-a-gun.”</p>

            <head>I</head>
            <p><emph rend="bold">I HAVE</emph> had a liberal education in party 
convocations, State and national. In those of 1860 
I served as an all-around newspaper reporter. A 
member of each National Democratic Convention 
from 1876 to 1892, presiding over the first, and in 
those of 1880 and 1888 chosen chairman of the 
Resolutions Committee, I wrote many of the 
platforms and had a decisive voice in all of them.</p>
            <p>In 1880 I had stood for the renomination of “the
Old Ticket,” that is, Tilden and Hendricks, making
the eight-to-seven action of the Electoral 
Tribunal of 1877 in favor of Hayes and Wheeler the
<pb id="watterson250" n="250"/>
paramount issue. It seems strange now that any 
one should have contested this. Yet it was stoutly 
contested. Mr. Tilden settled all dispute by sending 
a letter to the convention declining to be a 
candidate. In answer to this I prepared a resolution 
of regret to be incorporated in the platform. It 
raised stubborn opposition. David A. Wells and 
Joseph Pulitzer, who were fellow members of the 
committee, were with me in my contention, but the 
objection to making it a part of the platform grew 
so pronounced that they thought I had best not 
insist upon it.</p>
            <p>The day wore on and the latent opposition 
seemed to increase. I had been named chairman 
of the committee and had at a single sitting that 
morning written a completed platform. Each 
plank of this was severally and closely scrutinized. 
It was well into the afternoon before we reached the 
plank I chiefly cared about. When I read this the 
storm broke. Half the committee rose against it. 
At the close, with more heat than was either courteous 
or tactful, I said: “Gentlemen, I wish to do 
no more than bid farewell to a leader who four 
years ago took the Democratic party at its lowest 
fortunes and made it a power again. He is well 
<pb id="watterson251" n="251"/>
on his way to the grave. I would place a wreath 
of flowers on that grave. I ask only this of you. 
Refuse me, and by God, I will go to that mob 
yonder and, dead or alive, nominate him, and you 
will be powerless to prevent!”</p>
            <p>Mr. Barksdale, of Mississippi, a suave gentleman, 
who had led the dissenters, said, “We do not 
refuse you. But you say that we ‘regret’ Mr. Tilden's 
withdrawal. Now I do not regret it, nor do 
those who agree with me. Could you not substitute 
some other expression?”</p>
            <p>“I don't stand on words,” I answered. “What 
would you suggest?”</p>
            <p>Mr. Barksdale said: “Would not the words ‘We 
have received with the deepest sensibility Mr. 
Tilden's letter of withdrawal,’ answer your purpose?”</p>
            <p>“Certainly,” said I, and the plank in the platform, 
as it was amended, was adopted unanimously.</p>
            <p>Mr. Tilden did not die. He outlived all his 
immediate rivals. Four years later, in 1884, his party 
stood ready again to put him at its head. In nominating 
Mr. Cleveland it thought it was accepting 
his dictation reënforced by the enormous majority  
- nearly 200,000 - by which Mr. Cleveland, as 
candidate for Governor, had carried New York in the 
<pb id="watterson252" n="252"/>
preceding State election. Yet, when the votes in 
the presidential election came to be counted, he 
carried it, if indeed he carried it at all, by less than 
1,100 majority, the result hanging in the balance 
for nearly a week.</p>

            <p>In the convention of 1884, which met at Chicago, 
we had a veritable monkey-and-parrot time. It 
was next after the schism in Congress between the 
Democratic factions led respectively by Carlisle 
and Randall, Carlisle having been chosen Speaker 
of the House over Randall.</p>
            <p>Converse, of Ohio, appeared in the Platform 
Committee representing Randall, and Morrison, of 
Illinois, and myself, representing Carlisle. I was 
bent upon making Morrison chairman of the 
committee. But it was agreed that the chairmanship 
should be held in abeyance until the platform had 
been formulated and adopted. The subcommittee 
to whom the task was delegated sat fifty-one hours 
without a break before its work was completed. 
Then Morrison was named chairman. It was 
arranged thereafter between Converse, Morrison and 
myself that when the agreed report was made, 
Converse and I should have each what time he required
<pb id="watterson253" n="253"/>
to say what was desired in explanation, I to close 
the debate and move the previous question. At this 
point General Butler sidled up. “Where do I come 
in?” he asked.</p>
            <p>“You don't get in at all, you blasted old sinner,” 
said Morrison.</p>
            <p>“I have scriptural warrant,” General Butler said. 
“Thou shalt not muzzle the ox that treadeth the 
corn.”</p>
            <p>“All right, old man,” said Morrison, good-humoredly, 
“take all the time you want.”</p>
            <p>In his speech before the convention General Butler 
was not at his happiest, and in closing he gave 
me a particularly good opening. “If you adopt 
this platform of my friend Watterson,” he said, 
“God may help you, but I can't.”</p>
            <p>I was standing by his side, and, it being my turn, 
he made way for me, and I said: “During the last 
few days and nights of agreeable, though rather 
irksome, intercourse, I have learned to love General 
Butler, but I must declare that in an option 
between him and the Almighty I have a prejudice in 
favor of God.”</p>
            <p>In his personal intercourse, General Butler was 
the most genial of men. The subcommittee in 
<pb id="watterson254" n="254"/>
charge of the preparation of a platform held its 
meetings in the drawing-room of his hotel apartment, 
and he had constituted himself our host as 
well as our colleague. I had not previously met 
him. It was not long after we came together 
before he began to call me by my Christian name. At
one stage of the proceedings when by substituting 
one word for another it looked as though we might 
reach an agreement, he said to me: “Henry, what 
is the difference between ‘exclusively for public 
purposes’ and ‘a tariff for revenue only’?”</p>
            <p>“I know of none,” I answered.</p>
            <p>“Do you think that the committee have found 
you out?”</p>
            <p>“No, I scarcely think so.”</p>
            <p>“Then I will see that they do.” and he proceeded 
in his peculiarly subtle way to undo all that we 
had done, prolonging the session twenty-four hours.</p>
            <p>He was an able man and a lovable man. The 
missing ingredient was serious belief. Just after 
the nomination of the Breckinridge and Lane Presidential 
ticket in 1860, I heard him make an ultra-Southern 
speech from Mr. Breckinridge's doorway. 
“What do you think of that?” I asked Andrew 
Johnson, who stood by me, and Johnson answered 
<pb id="watterson255" n="255"/>
sharply, with an oath: “I never like a man to be 
for me more than I am for myself.” I have been 
told that even at home General Butler could never 
acquire the public confidence. In spite of his 
conceded mentality and manliness he gave the impression 
of being something of an intellectual sharper.</p>
            <p>He was charitable, generous and amiable. The 
famous New Orleans order which had made him 
odious to the women of the South he had issued to 
warn bad women and protect good women. 
Assuredly he did not foresee the interpretation that 
would be put upon it. He was personally popular 
in Congress. When he came to Washington he 
dispensed a lavish hospitality. Such radical 
Democrats as Beck and Knott did not disdain his 
company, became, indeed, his familiars. Yet, curious 
to relate, a Kentucky Congressman of the period 
lost his seat because it was charged and proven that 
he had ridden in a carriage to the White House 
with the Yankee Boanerges on a public occasion.</p>

            <p>Mere party issues never counted with me. I have 
read too much and seen too much. At my present 
time of life they count not at all. I used to think 
<pb id="watterson256" n="256"/>
that there was a principle involved between the dogmas 
of Free Trade and Protection as they were 
preached by their respective attorneys. Yet what 
was either except the ancient, everlasting scheme -</p>

            <p>How little wisdom one man may get from another 
man's counsels, one nation may get from 
another nation's history, can be partly computed 
when we reflect how often our personal experience 
has failed in warning admonition.</p>
            <p>Temperament and circumstance do indeed cut a 
prodigious figure in life. Traversing the older 
countries, especially Spain, the most illustrative, 
the wayfarer is met at all points by what seems not 
merely the logic of events, but the common law 
of the inevitable. The Latin of the Sixteenth 
century was a recrudescence of the Roman of the First. 
He had not, like the Mongolian, lived long enough 
to become a stoic. He was mainly a cynic and an 
adventurer. Thence he flowered into a sybarite. 
Coming to great wealth with the discoveries of 
<pb id="watterson257" n="257"/>
Columbus and the conquests of Pizarro and Cortes,
he proceeded to enjoy its fruits according to his 
fancy and the fashion of the times.</p>
            <p>He erected massive shrines to his deities. He
reared noble palaces. He built about his cathedrals 
and his castles what were then thought to be great 
cities, walled and fortified. He was, for all his 
self-sufficiency and pride, short-sighted; and yet, 
until they arrived, how could he foresee the developments 
of artillery? They were as hidden from him 
as three centuries later the wonders of electricity 
were hidden from us.</p>
            <p>I was never a Free Trader. I stood for a tariff 
for revenue as the least oppressive and safest 
support of Government. The protective system in the 
United States, responsible for our unequal distribution 
of wealth, took at least its name from Spain, 
and the Robber Barons, as I used to call the 
Protectionists of Pennsylvania, were not of immediate 
German origin.</p>
            <p>Truth to say, both on land and water Spain has 
made a deal of history, and the front betwixt 
Gibraltar and the Isle of San Fernando - Tangier on 
one side and the Straits of Tarifa on the other -
Cape Trafalgar, where Nelson fought the famous 
<pb id="watterson258" n="258"/>
battle, midway between them - has had its share. </p>
            <p>Tarifa! What memories it invokes! In the 
olden and golden days of primitive man, before 
corporation lawyers had learned how to frame pillaging 
statutes, and rascally politicians to bamboozle 
confiding constituencies - thus I used to put it - 
the gentle pirates of Tarifa laid broad and deep the 
foundations for the Protective System in the 
United States.</p>
            <p>It was a fruitful as well as a congenial theme, 
and I rang all the changes on it. To take by law 
from one man what is his and give it to another 
man who has not earned it and has no right to it, 
I showed to be an invention of the Moors, copied 
by the Spaniards and elevated thence into political 
economy by the Americans. Tarifa took its name 
from Tarif-Ben-Malik, the most enterprising Robber 
Baron of his day, and thus the Lords of Tarifa 
were the progenitors of the Robber Barons of the 
Black Forest, New England and Pittsburgh. 
Tribute was the name the Moors gave their 
robbery, which was open and aboveboard. The Coal 
Kings, the Steel Kings and the Oil Kings of the 
modern world have contrived to hide the process; 
but in Spain the palaces of their forefathers rise in 
<pb id="watterson259" n="259"/>
lonely and solemn grandeur just as a thousand 
years hence the palaces upon the Fifth Avenue side 
of Central Park and along Riverside Drive, not to 
mention those of the Schuylkill and the Delaware, 
may become but roosts for bats and owls, and the 
chronicler of the Anthropophagi, “whose heads do 
reach the skies,” may tell how the voters of the 
Great Republic were bought and sold with their 
own money, until “Heaven released the legions 
north of the North Pole, and they swooped down 
and crushed the pulpy mass beneath their avenging 
snowshoes.”</p>
            <p>The gold that was gathered by the Spaniards 
and fought over so valiantly is scattered to the four 
ends of the earth. It may be as potent to-day as 
then; but it does not seem nearly so heroic. A good 
deal of it has found its way to London, which a 
short century and a half ago “had not,” according 
to Adam Smith, “sufficient wealth to compete with 
Cadiz.” We have had our full share without fighting 
for it. Thus all things come to him who contrives 
and waits.</p>
            <p>Meanwhile, there are “groups” and “rings.” 
And, likewise, “leaders” and “bosses.” What do 
they know or care about the origins of wealth; about

Venice; about Cadiz; about what is said of Wall 
Street? the Spanish Main was long ago stripped 
of its pillage. The buccaneers took themselves off 
to keep company with the Vikings. Yet, away 
down in those money chests, once filled with what 
were pieces of eight and ducats and doubloons, who 
shall say that spirits may not lurk and ghosts walk, 
one old freebooter wheezing to another old 
freebooter: “They order these things better in the 
‘States.’ ”</p>

            <p>I have enjoyed hugely my several sojourns in 
Spain. The Spaniard is unlike any other European. 
He may not make you love him. But you 
are bound to respect him.</p>
            <p>There is a mansion in Seville known as The 
House of Pontius Pilate because part of the 
remains of the abode of the Roman Governor was 
brought from Jerusalem and used in a building 
suited to the dignity of a Spanish grandee who was 
also a Lord of Tarifa. The Duke of Medina Celi, 
its present owner, is a lineal scion of the old 
piratical crew. The mansion is filled with the fruits of 
many a foray. There are plunder from Naples, 
where one ancestor was Viceroy, and treasures from 
<pb id="watterson261" n="261"/>
the temples of the Aztecs and the Incas, where two 
other ancestors ruled. Every coping stone and 
pillar cost some mariner of the Tarifa Straits a 
pot of money.</p>
            <p>Its owner is a pauper. A carekeeper shows it 
for a peseta a bead. To such base uses may we 
come at last. Yet Seville basks in the sun and 
smiles on the flashing waters of the Guadalquivir, 
and Cadiz sits serene upon the green hillsides of 
San Sebastian, just as if nothing had ever 
happened; neither the Barber and Carmen, nor Nelson 
and Byron; the past but a phantom; the present 
the prosiest of prose-poems.</p>
            <p>There are canny Spaniards even as there are
canny Scots, who grow rich and prosper; but there
is never a Spaniard who does not regard the political 
fabric, and the laws, as fair game, the rule 
being always “devil take the hindmost,” community
of interests nowhere. “The good old vices of
Spain,” that is, the robbing of the lesser rogue by
the greater in regulated gradations all the way
from the King to the beggar, are as prevalent and
as vital as ever they were. Curiously enough, a
tiny stream of Hebraic blood and Moorish blood
still trickles through the Spanish coast towns. It
		
<pb id="watterson262" n="262"/>
may be traced through the nomenclature in spite of 
its Castilian prefigurations and appendices, which 
would account for some of the enterprise and 
activity that show themselves, albeit only by fits and 
starts.</p>

            <p><emph rend="bold">THE</emph> makers of the American Republic range 
themselves in two groups - Washington, 
Franklin and Jefferson - Clay, Webster and 
Lincoln - each of whom, having a genius peculiarly 
his own, gave himself and his best to the cause of 
national unity and independence.</p>
            <p>In a general way it may be said that Washington 
created and Lincoln saved the Union. But along 
with Washington and Lincoln, Clay makes a good 
historic third, for it was the masterful Kentuckian 
who, joining rare foresight to surpassing eloquence 
and leading many eminent men, including Webster, 
was able to hold the legions of unrest at bay during 
the formative period.</p>
            <p>There are those who call these great men “back

numbers,” who tell us we have left the past behind 
us and entered an epoch of more enlightened 
progress - who would displace the example of the 
simple lives they led and the homely truths they told, 
to set up a school of philosophy which had made 
Athens stare and Rome howl, and, I dare say, is 
causing the Old Continentals to turn over in their 
graves. The self-exploiting spectacle and bizarre 
teaching of this school passes the wit of man to 
fathom. Professing the ideal and proposing to 
recreate the Universe, the New Freedom, as it calls 
itself, would standardize it. The effect of that would 
be to desiccate the human species in human conceit. 
It would cheapen the very harps and halos in 
Heaven and convert the Day of Judgment into a 
moving picture show.</p>
            <p>I protest that I am not of its kidney. In point 
of fact, its platitudes “stick in my gizzard.” I 
belong the rather to those old-fashioned ones -</p>

            </lg>
            <pb id="watterson265" n="265"/>
            <p>I have many rights - birthrights - to speak of 
Kentucky as a Kentuckian, beside that of more 
than fifty years' service upon what may be fairly 
called the battle-line of the Dark and Bloody 
Ground.</p>
            <p>My grandmother's father, William Mitchell 
Morrison, had raised a company of riflemen in the 
War of the Revolution, and, after the War, 
marched it westward. He commanded the troops 
in the old fort at Harrodsburg, where my grandmother 
was born in 1784. He died a general. My 
grandfather, James Black's father, the Rev. James 
Black, was chaplain of the fort. He remembered 
the birth of the baby girl who was to become his 
wife. He was a noble stalwart - a perfect type of 
the hunters of Kentucky - who could bring down a 
squirrel from the highest bough and hit a bull's 
eye at a hundred yards after he was three score 
and ten.</p>
            <p>It was he who delighted my childhood with bear 
stories and properly lurid narrations of the braves 
in buckskin and the bucks in paint and feathers, 
with now and then a red-coat to give pungency and 
variety to the tale. He would sing me to sleep with 
hunting songs. He would take me with him afield 
<pb id="watterson266" n="266"/>
to carry the game bag, and I was the only one of 
many grandchildren to be named in his will. In my 
thoughts and in my dreams he has been with me all 
my life, a memory and an example, and an ever 
glorious inspiration.</p>
            <p>Daniel Boone and Simon Kenton were among 
my earliest heroes.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>II</head>
            <p>Born in a Democratic camp, and growing to 
manhood on the Democratic side of a political 
battlefield, I did not accept, as I came later to 
realize, the transcendent personal merit and 
public service of Henry Clay. Being of Tennessee 
parentage, perhaps the figure of Andrew Jackson 
came between; perhaps the rhetoric of Daniel 
Webster. Once hearing me make some slighting 
remark of the Great Commoner, my father, a life-long 
Democrat, who, on opposing sides, had served in 
Congress with Mr. Clay, gently rebuked me. “Do 
not express such opinions, my son,” he said, “they 
discredit yourself. Mr. Clay was a very great man 
- a born leader of men.”</p>
            <p>It was certainly he, more than any other man, 
who held the Union together until the time arrived 
for Lincoln to save it.</p>
            <pb id="watterson267" n="267"/>
            <p>I made no such mistake, however, with respect to 
Abraham Lincoln. From the first he appeared to
me a great man, a born leader of men. His death 
proved a blow to the whole country - most of all to 
the Southern section of it. If he had lived there 
would have been no Era of Reconstruction, with
its repressive agencies and oppressive legislation; 
there would have been wanting to the extremism of 
the time the bloody cue of his taking off to mount 
the steeds and spur the flanks of vengeance. For 
Lincoln entertained, with respect to the rehabilitation 
of the Union, the single wish that the Southern 
States - to use his homely phraseology - 
“should come back home and behave themselves,” 
and if he had lived he would have made this wish 
effectual as he made everything else effectual to 
which he addressed himself.</p>
            <p>His was the genius of common sense. Of 
perfect intellectual acuteness and aplomb, he
sprang from a Virginia pedigree and was born 
in Kentucky. He knew all about the South,
its institutions, its traditions and its peculiarities. 
He was an old-line Whig of the school of 
Henry Clay, with strong Emancipation leaning, 
never an Abolitionist. “If slavery be not wrong,” 
<pb id="watterson268" n="268"/>
he said, “nothing is wrong,” but he also said and 
reiterated it time and again, “I have no prejudice 
against the Southern people. They are just what 
we would be in their situation. If slavery did not 
now exist among them they would not introduce it. 
If it did now exist among us, we would not instantly 
give it up.”</p>
            <p>From first to last throughout the angry debates 
preceding the War of Sections, amid the passions 
of the War itself, not one vindictive, proscriptive 
word fell from his tongue or pen, whilst during its 
progress there was scarcely a day when he did not 
project his great personality between some Southern 
man or woman and danger.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>III</head>
            <p>There has been much discussion about what did 
and what did not occur at the famous Hampton 
Roads Conference. That Mr. Lincoln met and 
conferred with the official representatives of the 
Confederate Government, led by the Vice President of 
the Confederate States, when it must have been 
known to him that the Confederacy was nearing the 
end of its resources, is sufficient proof of the breadth 
both of his humanity and his patriotism. Yet he 
<pb id="watterson269" n="269"/>
went to Fortress Monroe prepared not only to make 
whatever concessions toward the restoration of 
Union and Peace he had the lawful authority to 
make, but to offer some concessions which could in 
the nature of the case go no further at that time 
than his personal assurance. His constitutional 
powers were limited. But he was in himself the 
embodiment of great moral power.</p>
            <p>The story that he offered payment for the slaves 
- so often affirmed and denied - is in either case 
but a quibble with the actual facts. He could not 
have made such an offer except tentatively, lacking 
the means to carry it out. He was not given 
the opportunity to make it, because the Confederate 
Commissioners were under instructions to treat 
solely on the basis of the recognition of the 
independence of the Confederacy. The conference 
came to nought. It ended where it began. 
But there is ample evidence that he went to 
Hampton Roads resolved to commit himself to that 
proposition. He did, according to the official 
reports, refer to it in specific terms, having already 
formulated a plan of procedure. This plan exists 
and may be seen in his own handwriting. It 
embraced a joint resolution to be submitted by the 
<pb id="watterson270" n="270"/>
President to the two Houses of Congress appropriating 
$400,000,000 to be distributed among the 
Southern States on the basis of the slave population 
of each according to the Census of 1860, and a 
proclamation to be issued by himself, as President, 
when the joint resolution had been passed by 
Congress.</p>
            <p>There can be no controversy among honest students 
of history on this point. That Mr. Lincoln 
said to Mr. Stephens, “Let me write Union at the 
top of this page and you may write below it 
whatever else you please,” is referable to Mr. Stephens' 
statement made to many friends and attested by a 
number of reliable persons. But that he meditated 
the most liberal terms, including payment for 
the slaves, rests neither upon conjecture nor hearsay, 
but on documentary proof. It may be argued 
that he could not have secured the adoption of any 
such plan; but of his purpose, and its genuineness, 
there can be no question and there ought to be no 
equivocation.</p>
            <p>Indeed, payment for the slaves had been all 
along in his mind. He believed the North equally 
guilty with the South for the original existence of 
slavery. He clearly understood that the Irrepressible 
<pb id="watterson271" n="271"/>
Conflict was a Conflict of systems, not a merely 
sectional and partisan quarrel. He was a just man, 
abhorring proscription: an old Conscience Whig, 
indeed, who stood in awe of the Constitution and 
his oath of office. He wanted to leave the South 
no right to claim that the North, finding slave labor 
unremunerative, had sold its negroes to the South 
and then turned about and by force of arms 
confiscated what it had unloaded at a profit. He fully 
recognized slavery as property. The Proclamation 
of Emancipation was issued as a war measure. In 
his message to Congress of December, 1862, he 
proposed payment for the slaves, elaborating a scheme 
in detail and urging it with copious and cogent 
argument. “The people of the South,” said he, 
addressing a Congress at that moment in the throes 
of a bloody war with the South, “are not more 
responsible for the original introduction of this 
property than are the people of the North, and, when it 
is remembered how unhesitatingly we all use cotton 
and sugar and share the profits of dealing in them, 
it may not be quite safe to say that the South has 
been more responsible than the North for its 
continuance.”</p>

a special pleader, rather than those of a statesman.
Every man, each of the nations, is for peace as an

But Mr. Wilson proposes to bind the hands
of a giant and take lottery chances on the future.
This, I think, the country will contest.</p>
            <p>He is obsessed by the idea of a League of Nations. 
If not his own discovery he has yet made 
himself its leader. He talks flippantly about 
“American ideals” that have won the war against 
Germany, as if there were no English ideals and 
French ideals.</p>
            <p>“In all that he does we can descry the schoolmaster 
who arrived at the front rather late in life. 
One needs only to go over the record and mark 
how often he has reversed himself to detect a 
certain mental and temperamental instability clearly 
indicating a lack of fixed or resolute intellectual 
purpose. This is characteristic of an excess in 
education; of the half baked mind overtrained. The 
overeducated mind fancies himself a doctrinaire 
when he is in point of fact only a disciple.”
<pb id="watterson274" n="274"/>
Woodrow Wilson was born to the rather sophisticated 
culture of the too, too solid South. Had 
he grown up in England a hundred years ago he 
would have been a follower of the Della Cruscans. 
He has what is called a facile pen, though it 
sometimes runs away with him. It seems to have done 
so in the matter of the League of Nations. Inevitably 
such a scheme would catch the fancy of one 
ever on the alert for the fanciful.</p>
            <p>I cannot too often repeat that the world we 
inhabit is a world of sin, disease and death. Men will 
fight whenever they want to fight, and no artificial 
scheme or process is likely to restrain them. It 
is mainly the costliness of war that makes most 
against it. But, as we have seen the last four years, 
it will not quell the passions of men or dull national 
and racial ambitions.</p>
            <p>All that Mr. Wilson and his proposed League of 
Nations can do will be to revamp, and maybe for 
a while to reimpress the minds of the rank and file, 
until the bellowing followers of Bellona are ready 
to spring.</p>
            <p>Eternal peace, universal peace, was not the purpose 
of the Deity in the creation of the universe.</p>
            <p>Nevertheless, it would seem to be the duty of 
<pb id="watterson275" n="275"/>
men in great place, as of us all, to proclaim the 
gospel of good will and cultivate the arts of 
fraternity. I have no quarrel with the President on  
this score. What I contest is the self-exploitation 
to which he is prone, so lacking in dignity and open 
to animadversion.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>V</head>
            <p>Thus it was that instant upon the appearance 
of the proposed League of Nations I made bold 
to challenge it, as but a pretty conceit having no 
real value, a serious assault upon our national 
sovereignty.</p>
            <p>Its argument seemed to me full of copybook 
maxims, easier recited than applied. As what I 
wrote preceded the debates and events of the last 
six months, I may not improperly make the following 
quotation from a screed of mine appearing in 
The Courier-Journal of the 5th of March, 1919:</p>
            <p>“The League of Nations is a fad. Politics, like 
society and letters, has its fads. In society they
call them fashion and in literature originality. 
Politics gives the name of ‘issues’ to its fads. A 
taking issue is as a stunning gown, or ‘a best seller.’
The President's mind wears a coat of many colors, 
<pb id="watterson276" n="276"/>
and he can change it at will, his mood being the 
objective point, not always too far ahead, or clear 
of vision. Carl Schurz was wont to speak of Gratz 
Brown as ‘a man of thoughts rather than of ideas.’ 
I wonder if that can be justly said of the President? 
‘Gentlemen will please not shoot at the pianiste,’ 
adjured the superscription over the music 
stand in the Dakota dive; ‘she is doing the best 
that she knows how.’</p>
            <p>“Already it is being proclaimed that Woodrow 
Wilson can have a third nomination for the presidency 
if he wants it, and nobody seems shocked by 
it, which proves that the people grow degenerate 
and foreshadows that one of these nights some fool 
with a spyglass will break into Mars and let loose 
the myriads of warlike gyascutes who inhabit that 
freak luminary, thence to slide down the willing 
moonbeam and swallow us every one!</p>
            <p>“In a sense the Monroe Doctrine was a fad. 
Oblivious to Canada, and British Columbia and the 
Spanish provinces, it warned the despots of Europe 
off the grass in America. We actually went to 
war with Mexico, having enjoyed two wars with 
England, and again and again we threatened to 
<pb id="watterson277" n="277"/>
annex the Dominion. Everything betwixt hell and 
Halifax was Yankee preëmpted.</p>
            <p>“Truth to say, your Uncle Samuel was ever a 
jingo. But your Cousin Woodrow, enlarging on 
the original plan, would stretch our spiritual boundaries 
to the ends of the earth and make of us the 
moral custodian of the universe. This much, no 
less, he got of the school of sweetness and light in 
which he grew up.</p>
            <p>“I am a jingo myself. But a wicked material 
jingo, who wants facts, not theories. If I thought 
it possible and that it would pay, I would annex the 
North Pole and colonize the Equator. It is, after 
the manner of the lady in the play, that the President 
‘doth protest too much,’ which displeases me 
and where, in point of fact, I ‘get off the 
reservation.’</p>
            <p>“That, being a politician and maybe a candidate, 
he is keenly alive to votes goes without saying. On 
the surface this League of Nations having the word 
‘peace’ in big letters emblazoned both upon its 
forehead and the seat of its trousers - or, should I say, 
woven into the hem of its petticoat? - seems an 
appeal for votes. I do not believe it will bear 
discussion. In a way, it tickles the ear without 
<pb id="watterson278" n="278"/>
convincing the sense. There is nothing sentimental 
about the actualities of Government, much as public 
men seek to profit by arousing the passions of the 
people. Government is a hard and fast and dry 
reality. At best statesmanship can only half do 
the things it would. Its aims are most assured when 
tending a little landward; its footing safest on its 
native heath. We have plenty to do on our own 
continent without seeking to right things on other 
continents. Too many of us - the President among 
the rest, I fear - miscalculate the distance between 
contingency and desire.</p>

            <lb/>
            <p>I am sorry to see the New York World fly off 
at a tangent about this latest of the Wilsonian 
hobbies. Frank Irving Cobb, the editor of the 
World, is, as I have often said, the strongest writer 
on the New York press since Horace Greeley. But 
<pb id="watterson279" n="279"/>
he can hardly be called a sentimentalist, as Greeley 
was, and there is nothing but sentiment - gush and 
gammon - in the proposed League of Nations.</p>
            <p>It may be all right for England. There are certainly 
no flies on it for France. But we don't need 
it. Its effects can only be to tie our hands, not keep 
the dogs away, and even at the worst, in stress of 
weather, we are strong enough to keep the dogs 
away ourselves.</p>
            <p>We should say to Europe: “Shinny on your 
own side of the water and we will shinny on our 
side.” It may be that Napoleon's opinion will come 
true that ultimately Europe will be “all Cossack or 
all republican.” Part of it has come true already. 
Meanwhile it looks as though the United States, 
having exhausted the reasonable possibilities of 
democracy, is beginning to turn crank. Look at 
woman suffrage by Federal edict; look at prohibition 
by act of Congress and constitutional amendment; 
tobacco next to walk on the plank; and then! - 
Lord, how glad I feel that I am nearly a hundred 
years old and shall not live to see it!</p>

<lb/>CONSTITUTIONAL SHORTCOMINGS.</head>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>I</head>
            <p><emph rend="bold">THE</emph> years intervening between 1865 and 1919 
may be accounted the most momentous in all 
the cycles of the ages. The bells that something 
more than half a century ago rang forth to welcome 
peace in America have been from that day to this 
jangled out of tune and harsh with the sounding 
of war's alarms in every other part of the world. 
We flatter ourselves with the thought that our 
tragedy lies behind us. Whether this be true or not, 
the tragedy of Europe is at hand and ahead. The 
miracles of modern invention, surpassing those of 
old, have made for strife, not for peace. Civilization 
has gone backward, not forward. Rulers, 
<pb id="watterson281" n="281"/>
intoxicated by the lust of power and conquest, have 
lost their reason, and nations, following after, like 
cattle led to slaughter, seem as the bereft of Heaven 
“that knew not God.”</p>
            <p>We read the story of our yesterdays as it unfolds 
itself in the current chronicle; the ascent to the 
bank-house, the descent to the mad-house, and, over 
the glittering paraphernalia that follows to the 
tomb, we reflect upon the money-zealot's progress; 
the dizzy height, the dazzling array, the craze for 
more and more and more; then the temptation and 
fall, millions gone, honor gone, reason gone - the 
innocent and the gentle, with the guilty, dragged 
through the mire of the prison, and the court - and 
we draw back aghast. Yet, if we speak of these 
things we are called pessimists.</p>
            <p>I have always counted myself an optimist. I 
know that I do not lie awake nights musing on the 
ingratitude either of my stars or my countrymen. 
I pity the man who does. Looking backward, I 
have sincere compassion for Webster and for Clay! 
What boots it to them, now that they lie beneath 
the mold, and that the drums and tramplings of 
nearly seventy years of the world's strifes and 
follies and sordid ambitions and mean repinings, 
<pb id="watterson282" n="282"/>
and longings, and laughter, and tears, have passed 
over their graves, what boots it to them, now, that 
they failed to get all they wanted? There is indeed 
snug lying in the churchyard; but the flowers 
smell as sweet and the birds sing as merry, and the 
stars look down as loving upon the God-hallowed 
mounds of the lowly and the poor, as upon the 
man-bedecked monuments of the Kings of men. 
All of us, the least with the greatest, let us hope and 
believe shall attain immortal life at last. What 
was there for Webster, what was there for Clay to 
quibble about? I read with a kind of wonder, and 
a sickening sense of the littleness of great things, 
those passages in the story of their lives where it 
is told how they stormed and swore, when tidings 
reached them that they had been balked of their 
desires.</p>
            <p>Yet they might have been so happy; so happy 
in their daily toil, with its lofty aims and fair 
surroundings; so happy in the sense of duty done; so 
happy, above all, in their own Heaven-sent genius, 
with its noble opportunities and splendid achievements. 
They should have emulated the satisfaction 
told of Franklin Pierce. It is related that an 
enemy was inveighing against him, when an alleged 
<pb id="watterson283" n="283"/>
friend spoke up and said: “You should not talk 
so about the President, I assure you that he is not 
at all the man you describe him to be. On the 
contrary, he is a man of the rarest gifts and virtues. 
He has long been regarded as the greatest orator 
in New England, and the greatest lawyer in New 
England, and surely no one of his predecessors 
ever sent such state papers to Congress.”</p>
            <p>“How are you going to prove it,” angrily retorted 
the first speaker.</p>
            <p>“I don't need to prove it,” coolly replied the 
second. “He admits it.”</p>
            <p>I cannot tell just how I should feel if I were 
President, though, on the whole, I fancy fairly 
comfortable, but I am quite certain that I would not 
exchange places with any of the men who have been 
President, and I have known quite a number of 
them.</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>II</head>
            <p>I am myself accused sometimes of being a “pessimist.” 
Assuredly I am no optimist of the Billy 
Sunday sort, who fancies the adoption of the 
prohibition amendment the coming of “de jubilo.” 
Early in life, while yet a recognized baseball 
<pb id="watterson284" n="284"/>
authority, Mr. Sunday discovered “pay dirt” in what 
Col. Mulberry Sellers called “piousness.” He 
made it an asset and began to issue celestial notes, 
countersigned by himself and made redeemable in 
Heaven. From that day to this he has been following 
the lead of the renowned Simon Suggs, who, 
having in true camp meeting style acquired “the 
grace of God,” turned loose as an exhorter shouting 
“Step up to the mourner's bench, my brethering, 
step up lively, and be saved! I come in on na 
'er par, an' see what I draw'd! Religion's the only 
game whar you can't lose. Him that trusts the 
Lord holds fo' aces!”</p>
            <p>The Billy Sunday game has made Billy Sunday 
rich. Having exhausted Hell-fire-and-brimstone, 
the evangel turns to the Demon Rum. Satan, 
with hide and horns, has had his day. Prohibition 
is now the trick card.</p>
            <p>The fanatic is never either very discriminating 
or very particular. As a rule, for him any taking 
“ism” will suffice. To-day, it happens to be 
“<sic corr="whiskey">whisky</sic>.” To-morrow it will be tobacco. Finally, 
having established the spy system and made 
house-to-house espionage a rule of conventicle, it will 
become a misdemeanor for a man to kiss his wife.</p>
            <pb id="watterson285" n="285"/>
            <p>From fakers who have cards up their sleeves, 
not to mention snakes in their boots, we hear a 
great deal about “the people,” pronounced by them 
as if it were spelled “pee-pul.” It is the unfailing 
recourse of the professional politician in quest
of place. Yet scarcely any reference, or referee, 
were faultier.</p>
            <p>The people en masse constitute what we call the 
mob. Mobs have rarely been right - never except
when capably led. It was the mob of Jerusalem 
that did the unoffending Jesus of Nazareth to
death. It was the mob in Paris that made the 
Reign of Terror. Mobs have seldom been tempted, 
even had a chance to go wrong, that they have not 
gone wrong.</p>
            <p>The “people” is a fetish. It was the people,
misled, who precipitated the South into the madness 
of secession and the ruin of a hopelessly unequal 
war of sections. It was the people backing if not
compelling the Kaiser, who committed hari-kari for 
themselves and their empire in Germany. It is
the people leaderless who are making havoc in 
Russia. Throughout the length and breadth of
Christendom, in all lands and ages, the people, 
when turned loose, have raised every inch of hell 
<pb id="watterson286" n="286"/>
to the square foot they were able to raise, often 
upon the slightest pretext, or no pretext at all.</p>
            <p>This is merely to note the mortal fallibility of 
man, most fallible when herded in groups and prone 
to do in the aggregate what he would hesitate to 
do when left to himself and his individual 
accountability.</p>
            <p>Under a wise dispensation of power, despotism, 
we are told embodies the best of all government. 
The trouble is that despotism is seldom, if ever, 
wise. It is its nature to be inconsiderate, being 
essentially selfish, grasping and tyrannous. As a 
rule therefore revolution - usually of force - has 
been required to change or reform it. Perfectibility 
was not designed for mortal man. That indeed 
furnishes the strongest argument in favor of 
the immortality of the soul, life on earth but the 
ante-chamber of eternal life. It would be a cruel 
Deity that condemned man to the brief and vexed 
span of human existence with nothing beyond the 
grave.</p>
            <p>We know not whence we came, or whither we 
go; but it is a fair guess that we shall in the end get 
better than we have known.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>III</head>
            <p>Historic democracy is dead.</p>
            <p>This is not to say that a Democratic party organization 
has ceased to exist. Nor does it mean that 
there are no more Democrats and that the Democratic 
party is dead in the sense that the Federalist 
party is dead or the Whig party is dead, or the 
Greenback party is dead, or the Populist party is 
dead. That which has died is the Democratic party 
of Jefferson and Jackson and Tilden. The principles 
of government which they laid down and advocated 
have been for the most part obliterated. 
What slavery and secession were unable to accomplish 
has been brought about by nationalizing sumptuary 
laws and suffrage.</p>
            <p>The death-blow to Jeffersonian democracy was 
delivered by the Democratic Senators and 
Representatives from the South and West who carried 
through the prohibition amendment. The <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">coup de 
grâce</foreign></hi> was administered by a President of the 
United States elected as a Democrat when he 
approved the Federal suffrage amendment to the 
Constitution.</p>
            <p>The kind of government for which the Jeffersonian
<pb id="watterson288" n="288"/>
democracy successfully battled for more than 
a century was thus repudiated; centralization was 
invited; State rights were assassinated in the very 
citadel of State rights. The charter of local 
self-government become a scrap of paper, the way is 
open for the obliteration of the States in all their 
essential functions and the erection of a Federal 
Government more powerful than anything of which 
Alexander Hamilton dared to dream.</p>
            <p>When the history of these times comes to be 
written it may be said of Woodrow Wilson: he 
rose to world celebrity by circumstance rather than 
by character. He was favored of the gods. He 
possessed a bright, forceful mind. His achievements 
were thrust upon him. Though it sometimes 
ran away with him, his pen possessed extraordinary 
facility. Thus he was ever able to put his 
best foot foremost. Never in the larger sense a 
leader of men as were Chatham and Fox, as were 
Washington, Clay and Lincoln; nor of ideas as were 
Rousseau, Voltaire and Franklin, he had the subtle 
tenacity of Louis the Eleventh of France, the keen 
foresight of Richelieu with a talent for the 
surprising which would have raised him to eminence 
<pb id="watterson289" n="289"/>
in journalism. In short he was an opportunist void 
of conviction and indifferent to consistency.</p>
            <p>The pen is mightier than the sword only when 
it has behind it a heart as well as a brain. He who 
wields it must be brave, upright and steadfast. We 
are giving our Chief Executive enormous powers. 
As a rule his wishes prevail. His name becomes 
the symbol of party loyalty. Yet it is after all a 
figure of speech not a personality that appeals to 
our sense of duty without necessarily engaging our 
affection.</p>
            <p>Historic Republicanism is likewise dead, as dead 
as historic Democracy, only in both cases the labels 
surviving.</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>IV</head>
            <p>We are told by Herbert Spencer that the political 
superstition of the past having been the divine
right of kings, the political superstition of the 
present is the divine right of parliaments and he might 
have said of peoples. The oil of anointing seems 
unawares, he thinks, to have dripped from the head 
of the one upon the heads of the many, and given 
sacredness to them also, and to their decrees.</p>
            <p>That the Proletariat, the Bolsheviki, the People 
are on the way seems plain enough. How far they 
<pb id="watterson290" n="290"/>
will go, and where they will end, is not so clear. 
With a kind of education - most men taught to 
read, very few to think - the masses are likely to 
demand yet more and more for themselves. They will 
continue strenuously and effectively to resent the 
startling contrasts of fortune which aptitude and 
opportunity have created in a social and political 
structure claiming to rest upon the formula “equality 
for all, special privilege for none.”</p>
            <p>The law of force will yield to the rule of numbers. 
Socialism, disappointed of its Utopia, may then 
repeat the familiar lesson and reproduce the 
man-on-horseback, or the world may drop into another 
abyss, and, after the ensuing “dark ages,” like those 
that swallowed Babylon and Tyre, Greece and 
Rome, emerge with a new civilization and religion.</p>
            <p>“Man never is, but always to be blessed.” We 
know not whence we came, or whither we go. Hope 
that springs eternal in the human breast tells us 
nothing. History seems, as Napoleon said, a series 
of lies agreed upon, yet not without dispute.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>V</head>
            <p>I read in an ultra-sectional non-partisan diatribe 
that “Jefferson Davis made Aaron Burr respectable,”
<pb id="watterson291" n="291"/>
a sentence which clearly indicates that the 
writer knew nothing either of Jefferson Davis or 
Aaron Burr.</p>
            <p>Both have been subjected to unmeasured abuse. 
They are variously misunderstood. Their chief sin 
was failure; the one to establish an impossible 
confederacy laid in human slavery, the other to achieve 
certain vague schemes of empire in Mexico and the 
far Southwest, which, if not visionary, were 
premature.</p>
            <p>The final collapse of the Southern Confederacy 
can be laid at the door of no man. It was doomed 
the day of its birth. The wonder is that sane leaders 
could invoke such odds against them and that 
a sane people could be induced to follow. The 
single glory of the South is that it was able to 
stand out so long against such odds.</p>
            <p>Jefferson Davis was a high-minded and 
well-intentioned man. He was chosen to lead the South
because he was, in addition, an accomplished 
soldier. As one who consistently opposed him in his
public policies, I can specify no act to the 
discredit of his character, his one serious mistake 
being his <sic corr="failure">failiure</sic> to secure the peace offered by
		
<pb id="watterson292" n="292"/>
Abraham Lincoln two short months before 
Appomattox.</p>
            <p>Taking account of their personalities and the 
lives they led, there is little to suggest comparison, 
except that they were soldiers and Senators, who, 
each in his day, filled a foremost place in public 
affairs.</p>
            <p>Aaron Burr, though well born and highly educated, 
was perhaps a rudely-minded man. But he 
was no traitor. If the lovely woman, Theodosia 
Prevost, whom he married, had lived, there is 
reason to believe that the whole course and tenor of 
his career would have been altered. Her death was 
an irreparable blow, as it were, a prelude to the 
series of mischances that followed. The death of 
their daughter, the lovely Theodosia Alston, 
completed the tragedy of his checkered life.</p>
            <p>Born a gentleman and attaining soldierly distinction 
and high place, he fell a victim to the lure 
of a soaring ambition and the devious experience 
of a man about town.</p>
            <p>The object of political proscription for all his 
intellectual and personal resources, he could not 
successfully meet and stand against it. There was 
nothing in the affair with Hamilton actually to 
<pb id="watterson293" n="293"/>
damn and ruin him. Neither morally nor politically 
was Hamilton the better man of the two. 
Nor was there treason in his Mexican scheme. He 
meant no more than Houston accomplished three 
decades later, with universal acclaim. To couple 
his name with Benedict Arnold's is historic sacrilege.</p>
            <p>Jefferson pursued him relentlessly. But even 
Jefferson could not have destroyed him. When, 
after an absence of four years abroad, he returned 
to America, there was still a future for him had he 
stood up like a man, but, instead, like one 
confessing defeat, he sank down, whilst the wave of 
obloquy rolled over him.</p>
            <p>His is one of the few pathetic figures in our 
national history. Mr. Davis has had plenty of 
defenders. Poor Burr has had scarcely an apologist. 
His offense, whatever it was, has been overpaid. 
Even the War of Sections begins to fade into the 
mist and become dreamlike even to those who bore 
an actual part in it.</p>
            <p>The years are gliding swiftly by. Only a little 
while, and there shall not be one man living who 
saw service on either side of that great struggle of 
systems and ideas. Its passions long ago vanished 
from manly bosoms. That has come to pass within

a single generation in America which in Europe 
required ages to accomplish.</p>
            <p>There is no disputing the verdict of events. Let 
us relate them truly and interpret them fairly. If 
the South would have the North do justice to its 
heroes, the South must do justice to the heroes of 
the North. Each must render unto Cæsar the 
things that are Cæsar's even as each would render 
unto God the things that are God's. As living men, 
standing erect in the presence of Heaven and the 
world, the men of the South have grown gray without 
being ashamed; and they need not fear that History 
will fail to vindicate their integrity.</p>
            <p>When those are gone that fought the battle, and 
Posterity comes to strike the balance, it will be 
shown that the makers of the Constitution left the 
relation of the States to the Federal Government 
and of the Federal Government to the States open 
to a double construction. It will be told how the 
mistaken notion that slave labor was requisite to 
the profitable cultivation of sugar, rice and cotton, 
raised a paramount property interest in the Southern 
section of the Union, whilst in the Northern 
section, responding to the trend of modern thought 
and the outer movements of mankind, there arose 
<pb id="watterson295" n="295"/>
a great moral sentiment against slavery. The 
conflict thus established, gradually but surely 
sectionalizing party lines, was as inevitable as it was 
irrepressible. It was fought out to its bitter and 
logical conclusion at Appomattox. It found us 
a huddle of petty sovereignties, held together by
a rope of sand. It made and it left us a Nation.</p>

            <p><emph rend="bold">IN</emph> bringing these desultory - perhaps too 
fragmentary - recollections to a close the writer may 
not be denied his final word. This shall neither be 
self-confident nor overstated; the rather a confession 
of faith somewhat in rejection of political and 
religious pragmatism. In both his experience has 
been ample if not exhaustive. During the period 
of their serial publication he has received many 
letters - suggestive, informatory and critical - now 
and again querulous - which he has not failed to 
consider, and, where occasion seemed to require, to 
pursue to original sources in quest of accuracy. In 
no instance has he found any essential error in his 
narrative. Sometimes he has been charged with
<pb id="watterson297" n="297"/>
omissions - as if he were writing a history of his 
own times - whereas he has been only, and he fears, 
most imperfectly, relating his immediate personal 
experience.</p>
            <p>I was born in the Presbyterian Church, baptized 
in the Roman Catholic Church, educated in the 
Church of England in America and married into 
the Church of the Disciples. The Roman Catholic 
baptism happened in this way: It was my second 
summer; my parents were sojourning in the household 
of a devout Catholic family; my nurse was a 
fond, affectionate Irish Catholic; the little life was 
almost despaired of, so one sunny day, to rescue 
me from that form of theologic controversy known 
as infant damnation, the baby carriage was trundled 
round the corner to Saint Matthew's Church 
- it was in the national capital - and the baby brow 
was touched with holy water out of a font blessed 
of the Virgin Mary. Surely I have never felt or 
been the worse for it.</p>
            <p>Whilst I was yet too young to understand I 
witnessed an old-fashioned baptism of the countryside. 
A person who had borne a very bad character 
in the neighborhood was being immersed. 
Some one, more humorous than reverent, standing 
<pb id="watterson298" n="298"/>
near me, said as the man came to the surface, 
“There go his sins, men and brethren, there go his 
sins”; and having but poor eyesight I thought I 
saw them passing down the stream never to trouble 
him, or anybody, more. I can see them still floating, 
floating down the stream, out and away from 
the sight of men. Does this make me a Baptist, I 
wonder?</p>
            <p>I fear not, I fear not; because I am unable to rid 
myself of the impression that there are many roads 
leading to heaven, and I have never believed in what 
is called close communion. I have not hated and 
am unable to hate any man because either in political 
or in religious opinion he differs from me and 
insists upon voting his party ticket and worshiping 
his Creator according to his conscience. Perfect 
freedom of conscience and thought has been my 
lifelong contention.</p>
            <p>I suppose I must have been born an insurrecto. 
Pursuing the story of the dark ages when men were 
burnt at the stake for the heresy of refusing to 
bow to the will of the majority, it is not the voice 
of the Protestant or the Catholic that issues from 
the flames and reaches my heart, but the cry of 
suffering man, my brother. To me a saint is a saint 
<pb id="watterson299" n="299"/>
whether he wears wooden shoes or goes barefoot, 
whether he gets his baptism silently out of a font 
of consecrated water or comes dripping from the 
depths of the nearest brook, shouting, “Glory 
hallelujah!” From my boyhood the persecution of 
man for opinion's sake - and no matter for what 
opinion's sake - has roused within me the only devil 
I have ever personally known.</p>
            <p>My reading has embraced not a few works which 
seek or which affect to deal with the mystery of life 
and death. Each and every one of them leaves a 
mystery still. For all their learning and research 
- their positivity and contradiction - none of the 
writers know more than I think I know myself, 
and all that I think I know myself may be abridged 
to the simple rescript, I know nothing. The wisest 
of us reek not whence we came or whither we 
go; the human mind is unable to conceive the eternal 
in either direction; the soul of man inscrutable 
even to himself.</p>

            <p>All that there is to religion, therefore, is faith; 
not much more in politics. We are variously told 
that the church is losing its hold upon men. If it 
be true it is either that it gives itself over to 
theology - the pride of opinion - or yields itself to the 
celebration of the mammon of unrighteousness.</p>
            <p>I do not believe that it is true. Never in the 
history of the world was Jesus of Nazareth so 
interesting and predominant. Between Buddha, 
teaching the blessing of eternal sleep, and Christ, 
teaching the blessing of eternal life, mankind has been 
long divided, but slowly, surely, the influence of the 
Christ has overtaken that of the Buddha until that 
portion of the world which has advanced most by 
process of evolution from the primal state of man 
now worships at the shrine of Christ and him risen 
from the dead, not at the sign of Buddha and total 
oblivion.</p>
            <p>The blessed birthright from God, the glory of 
heaven, the teaching and example of the Prince of 
<pb id="watterson301" n="301"/>
Peace - have been engulfed beneath oceans of 
ignorance and superstition through two thousand years 
of embittered controversy. During the dark ages 
coming down even to our own time the very light 
of truth was shut out from the eyes and hearts and 
minds of men. The blood of the martyrs we were 
assured in those early days was the seed of the 
church. The blood of the martyrs was the blood 
of man - weak, cruel, fallible man, who, whether he 
got his inspiration from the Tiber or the Rhine, 
from Geneva, from Edinburgh or from Rome, did 
equally the devil's work in God's name. None of 
the viceregents of heaven, as they claimed to be, 
knew much or seemed to care much about the word 
of the Gentle One of Bethlehem, whom they had 
adopted as their titular divinity much as men in 
commerce adopt a trade-mark.</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>II</head>
            <p>It was knock-down and drag-out theology, the 
ruthless machinery of organized churchism - the 
rank materialism of things temporal - not the teachings 
of Christ and the spirit of the Christian religion
- which so long filled the world with blood 
and tears.</p>
            <pb id="watterson302" n="302"/>
            <p>I have often in talking with intelligent Jews 
expressed a wonder that they should stigmatize the 
most illustrious Jew as an impostor, saying to them: 
“What matters it whether Jesus was of divine or 
human parentage - a human being or an immortal 
spirit? He was a Jew: a glorious, unoffending 
Jew, done to death by a mob of hoodlums in 
Jerusalem. Why should not you and I call him Master 
and kneel together in love and pity at his feet?”</p>
            <p>Never have I received any satisfying answer. 
Partyism - churchism - will ever stick to its fetish. 
Too many churches - or, shall I say, church fabrics 
- breeding controversy where there should be 
agreement, each sect and subdivision fighting phantoms 
of its fancy. In the city that once proclaimed 
itself eternal there is war between the Quirinal and 
the Vatican, the government of Italy and the papal 
hierarchy. In France the government of the 
republic and the Church of Rome are at daggers-drawn. 
Before the world-war England and Germany - 
each claiming to be Protestant - were looking 
on askance, irresolute, not as to which side 
might be right and which wrong, but on which side 
“is my bread to be buttered?” In America, where 
it was said by the witty Frenchmen we have fifty 
<pb id="watterson303" n="303"/>
religions and only one soup, there are people who 
think we should begin to organize to stop the threatened 
coming of the Pope, and such like! “O Liberty,” 
cried Madame Roland, “how many crimes 
are committed in thy name!” “O Churchism,” may 
I not say, “how much nonsense is trolled off in thy 
name!”</p>
            <p>I would think twice before trusting the wisest 
and best of men with absolute power; but I would 
trust never any body of men - never any 
Sanhedrim, consistory, church congress or party 
convention - with absolute power. Honest men are 
often led to do or to assent, in association, what they 
would disdain upon their conscience and responsibility 
as individuals. <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">En masse</foreign></hi> extremism generally 
prevails, and extremism is always wrong; it is 
the more wrong and the more dangerous because 
it is rarely wanting for plausible sophistries, 
furnishing congenial and convincing argument to the 
mind of the unthinking for whatever it has to 
propose.</p>
          </div2>
          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>III</head>
            <p>Too many churches and too much partyism! It 
is love - love through grace of God - truth where 
we can find it - which shall irradiate the life that is. 
<pb id="watterson304" n="304"/>
If when we have prepared ourselves for the life to 
come love be wanting, nothing else is much worth 
while. Not alone the love of man for woman, but 
the love of woman for woman and of man for man; 
the divine fraternity taught us by the Sermon on 
the Mount; the religion of giving, not of getting; 
of whole-hearted giving; of joy in the love and the 
joy of others.</p>
            <lb/>
            <lg type="verse">
              <l>

            </lg>
            <lb/>
            <p>For myself I can truthfully subscribe to the 
formula: “I believe in God the Father Almighty; 
Maker of heaven and earth. And Jesus Christ, 
his only Son, who was conceived by the Holy Ghost, 
born of the Virgin Mary, suffered under Pontius 
Pilate, was crucified, dead and buried; He 
descended into hell, the third day He rose again from 
the dead; He ascended into heaven, and sitteth at 
the right hand of God, the Father Almighty; from 
thence He shall come to judge the quick and the 
dead.”</p>
            <p>That is my faith. It is my religion. It was my 
cradle song. It may not be, dear ones of contrariwise
<pb id="watterson305" n="305"/>
beliefs, your cradle song or your belief, or your 
religion. What boots it? Can you discover 
another in word and deed, in luminous, far-reaching 
power of speech and example, to walk by the side 
of this the Anointed One of your race and of my 
belief?</p>
            <p>As the Irish priest said to the British prelate 
touching the doctrine of purgatory: “You may go 
further and fare worse, my lord,” so may I say to 
my Jewish friends - “Though the stars in their 
courses lied to the Wise Men of the desert, the 
bloody history of your Judea, altogether equal in 
atrocity to the bloody history of our Christendom, 
has yet to fulfill the promise of a Messiah - and 
were it not well for those who proclaim themselves 
God's people to pause and ask, ‘Has He not arisen 
already?’ ”</p>
            <p>I would not inveigh against either the church or 
its ministry; I would not stigmatize temporal 
preaching; I would have ministers of religion as 
free to discuss the things of this world as the 
statesmen and the journalists; but with this difference: 
That the objective point with them shall be the 
regeneration of man through grace of God and not 
the winning of office or the exploitation of parties 
<pb id="watterson306" n="306"/>
and newspapers. Journalism is yet too unripe to do 
more than guess at truth from a single side. The 
statesman stands mainly for political organism. 
Until he dies he is suspect. The pulpit remains 
therefore still the moral hope of the universe and 
the spiritual light of mankind.</p>
            <p>It must be nonpartisan. It must be nonprofessional. 
It must be manly and independent. But 
it must also be worldy-wise, not artificial, 
sympathetic, broad-minded and many-sided, equally 
ready to smite wrong in high places and to kneel 
by the bedside of the lowly and the poor.</p>
            <p>I have so found most of the clergymen I have 
known, the exceptions too few to remember. In 
spite of the opulence we see about us let us not 
take to ourselves too much conceit. May every 
pastor emulate the virtues of that village preacher 
of whom it was written that:</p>

            <head>IV</head>
            <p>I have lived a long life - rather a happy and a 
busy than a merry one - enjoying where I might, 
but, let me hope I may fairly claim, shirking no 
needful labor or duty. The result is some accretions 
to my credit. It were, however, ingratitude
and vanity in me to set up exclusive ownership of 
<pb id="watterson308" n="308"/>
these. They are the joint products and property 
of my dear wife and myself.</p>
            <p>I do not know just what had befallen if love had 
failed me, for as far back as I can remember love 
has been to me the bedrock of all that is worth 
living for, striving for or possessing in this 
cross-patch of a world of ours.</p>
            <p>I had realized the meaning of it in the beautiful 
concert of affection between my father and mother, 
who lived to celebrate their golden wedding. My 
wife and I have enjoyed now the like conjugal 
felicity fifty-four - counted to include two years of 
betrothal, fifty-six years. Never was a young 
fellow more in love than I - never has love been more 
richly rewarded - yet not without some heartbreaking 
bereavements.</p>
            <p>I met the woman who was to become my wife 
during the War of Sections - amid its turmoil and 
peril - and when at its close we were married, at 
Nashville, Tennessee, all about us was in mourning, 
the future an adventure. It was at Chattanooga, 
the winter of 1862-63, that fate brought us 
together and riveted our destinies. She had a fine 
contralto voice and led the church choir. Doctor 
Palmer, of New Orleans, was on a certain Sunday 
<pb id="watterson309" n="309"/>
well into the long prayer of the Presbyterian 
service. Bragg's army was still in middle Tennessee. 
There was no thought of an attack. Bang! Bang! 
Then the bursting of a shell too close for comfort. 
Bang! Bang! Then the rattle of shell fragments 
on the roof. On the other side of the river the 
Yankees were upon us.</p>
            <p>The man of God gave no sign that anything 
unusual was happening. He did not hurry. He 
did not vary the tones of his voice. He kept on 
praying. Nor was there panic in the congregation, 
which did not budge.</p>
            <p>That was the longest long prayer I ever heard. 
When it was finally ended, and still without changing 
a note the preacher delivered the benediction, 
the crowded church in the most orderly manner 
moved to the several doorways.</p>
            <p>I was quick to go for my girl. By the time we 
reached the street the firing had become general. 
We had to traverse quite half a mile of it before 
attaining a place of safety. Two weeks later we 
were separated for nearly two years, when, the war 
over, we found ourselves at home again.</p>
            <p>In the meantime her father had fallen in the fight, 
and in the far South I had buried him. He was 
<pb id="watterson310" n="310"/>
one of the most eminent and distinguished and 
altogether the best beloved of the Tennesseeans of his 
day, Andrew Ewing, who, though a Democrat, had 
in high party times represented the Whig Nashville 
district in Congress and in the face of assured 
election declined the Democratic nomination for 
governor of the state. A foremost Union leader in the 
antecedent debate, upon the advent of actual war 
he had reluctantly but resolutely gone with his state 
and section.</p>

          <div2 type="subsection">
            <head>V</head>
            <p>The intractable Abolitionists of the North and 
the radical Secessionists of the South have much 
historically to answer for. The racial warp and 
woof in the United States were at the outset of 
our national being substantially homogeneous. 
That the country should have been geographically 
divided and sectionally set by the ears over the 
institution of African slavery was the work of 
agitation that might have attained its ends by less 
costly agencies.</p>
            <p>How often human nature seeking its bent prefers 
the crooked to the straight way ahead! The 
North, having in its ships brought the negroes from 
Africa and sold them to the planters of the South, 
<pb id="watterson311" n="311"/>
putting the money it got for them in its pocket, 
turned philanthropist. The South, having bought 
its slaves from the slave traders of the North under 
the belief that slave labor was requisite to the profitable 
production of sugar, rice and cotton, stood by 
property-rights lawfully acquired, recognized and 
guaranteed by the Constitution. Thence arose an 
irrepressible conflict of economic forces and moral 
ideas whose doubtful adjustment was scarcely 
worth what it cost the two sections in treasure and 
blood.</p>
            <p>On the Northern side the issue was made 
to read freedom, on the Southern side, self-defense. 
Neither side had any sure law to coerce the other. 
Upon the simple right and wrong of it each was 
able to establish a case convincing to itself. Thus 
the War of Sections, fought to a finish so gallantly 
by the soldiers of both sides, was in its origination 
largely a game of party politics.</p>
            <p>The extremists and doctrinaires who started the 
agitation that brought it about were relatively few 
in number. The South was at least defending its 
own. That what it considered its rights in the 
Union and the Territories being assailed it should 
fight for aggressively lay in the nature of the situation
<pb id="watterson312" n="312"/>
and the character of the people. Aggression 
begot aggression, the unoffending negro, the 
provoking cause, a passive agent. Slavery is gone. 
The negro we still have with us. To what end?</p>
            <p>Life indeed is a mystery - a hopelessly unsolved 
problem. Could there be a stronger argument in 
favor of a world to come than may be found in the 
brevity and incertitude of the world that is? Where 
this side of heaven shall we look for the court of 
last resort? Who this side of the grave shall be sure 
of anything?</p>
            <p>At this moment the world having reached what 
seems the apex of human achievement is topsy-turvy 
and all agog. Yet have we the record of any 
moment when it was not so? That to keep what 
we call the middle of the road is safest most of us 
believe. But which among us keeps or has ever 
kept the middle of the road? What else and what 
next? It is with nations as with men. Are we on 
the way to another terrestrial collapse, and so on 
ad infinitum to the end of time?</p>

            <p>The home which I pictured in my dreams and

arrived with my marriage. Then children to bless 
it. But it was not made complete and final - a 
veritable Kentucky home - until the all-round, 
all-night work which had kept my nose to the 
grindstone had been shifted to younger shoulders I was 
able to buy a few acres of arable land far out in the 
county - the County of Jefferson! - and some ancient 
brick walls, which the feminine genius to which 
I owe so much could convert to itself and tear apart 
and make over again. Here “the sun shines bright”

everybody - even to Tigue and Bijou, the dogs -
