during an eventful life,” to be entitled, “Twenty Years a

        <p>Dear Sir:  -  The undersigned have heard with
pleasure, that you are about issuing a Book made up from incidents 
in the life of AUSTIN STEWARD. We have been the early
acquaintances and associates of Mr. Steward, while a business
man in Rochester in an early day, and take pleasure in bearing
testimony to his high personal, moral and Christian character.
In a world of vicissitude, Mr. Steward has received no ordinary
share, and we hope, while his book may do the world good, it
may prove a substantial benefit to him in his declining years.</p>

        <opener> <dateline>ROCHESTER, <date>JULY 1, 1856.</date></dateline>
<salute> A. STEWARD, ESQ.,</salute></opener>
        <p>Dear Sir:  -  In reply to your letter upon the
propriety of publishing your life, I answer, that there is not only no
objection to it, but it will be timely, and is demanded by every consideration 
of humanity and justice. Every tongue which speaks for
Freedom, which has once been held by the awful gag of Slavery, is
trumpet-tongued  -  and he who pleads against this monstrous oppression, 
if he can say, “here are the scars,” can do much.</p>
        <p>It is a great pleasure to me to run back to my boyhood, and stop at
that spot where I first met you. I recollect the story of your wrongs,
and your joy in the supposition that all were now ended in your
freedom; of your thirst for knowledge, as you gathered up from the
rudimental books  -  not then very plenty  -  a few snatches of the
elements of the language; of playing the school-master to you, in
“setting copies” for your writing-book; of guiding your mind and
pen. I remember your commencement in business, and the outrage
and indignity offered you in Rochester, by white competitors on no
other ground than that of color. <ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" target="note1">*</ref> I saw your bitter tears, and recollect
<note id="note1" n="1" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1">* The indignity spoken of was this: Mr. Steward had established a grocery and
provision store on Buffalo Street, in a part of Abner Wakelee's building, opposite
the Eagle Hotel. He put up his sign, a very plain and proper one, and at night,
some competitors, whom he knew, as well as he could know anything which he
could not prove, smeared his sign with black paint, utterly destroying it!  But the
misguided men who stooped to such an act  -  the victims of sensuality and excess  -  have years ago ended their journey, and passed to the bar of a higher adjudication.</note>
<pb id="stewardvi" n="vi"/>
assuring you  -  what afterwards proved true  -  that justice would
overtake the offenders, and that you would live to see these enemies
bite the dust!  I remember your unsullied character, and your prosperity, 
and when your word or endorsement was equal to that of any
other citizen. I remember too, when yourself, and others of your
kind, sunk all the gatherings of years of toil, in an unsuccessful
attempt to establish an asylum for your enslaved and oppressed
brethren  -  and, not to enumerate, which I might do much farther, I
remember when your “old master,” finding you had been successful,
while he himself had lost in the changes on fortune's wheel  -  came
here and set up a claim to yourself and your property  -  a claim which
might have held both, had not a higher power suddenly summoned 
him to a tribunal, where both master and slave shall one day answer
each for himself!</p>
        <p>But to the book. Let its plain, unvarnished tale be sent out, and the
story of Slavery and its abominations, again be told by one who has
felt in his own person its scorpion lash, and the weight of its grinding 
heel. I think it will do good service, and could not have been .
sent forth at a more auspicious period. The downfall of the hateful
system of Slavery, is certain. Though long delayed, justice is sure
to come at length; and he must be a slow thinker and a poor seer,
who cannot discern in the elements already at work, the mighty .
forces which must eventually crush this oppression. I know that 
you and I have felt discouraged at the long delay, years ago,  -  when
we might have kept up our hopes by the fact that every thing that is 
slow is <hi rend="italics">sure.</hi> Your book may be humble and your descriptions tame,
yet truth is always mighty; and you may furnish the sword for some
modern Sampson, who shall shout over more slain than his ancient
prototype. I close with the wish, that much success may attend
your labors, in more ways than one, and that your last days may be
your best  -  and am,</p>
        <closer><salute>Your old Friend,
<lb/>
And obed't serv't,</salute>

        <head>PREFACE.</head>
        <p>The author does not think that any apology is necessary for this
issue of his Life and History. He believes that American Slavery is
now the great question before the American People: that it is not
merely a political question, coming up before the country as the 
grand element in the making of a President, and then to be laid 
aside for four years; but that its moral bearings are of such a nature 
that the Patriot, the Philanthropist, and all good men agree that it is
an evil of so much magnitude, that longer to permit it, is to wink at 
sin, and to incur the righteous judgments of God. The late outrages 
and aggressions of the slave power to possess itself of new soil, and
extend the influence of the hateful and God-provoking  “Institution,” 
is a practical commentary upon its benefits and the moral qualities of
those who seek to sustain and extend it. The author is therefore
the more willing  -  nay, anxious, to lay alongside of such arguments
the history of his own life and experiences <hi rend="italics">as a slave</hi>, that those who
read may know what are some of the characteristics of that highly 
favored<sic> intitution,</sic> which is sought to be preserved and perpetuated.
“Facts are stubborn things,“  -  and this is the reason why all systems,
religious, moral, or social, which are founded in injustice, and supported 
by fraud and robbery, suffer so much by faithful exposition.</p>
        <p>The author has endeavored to present a true statement of the practical 
workings of the system of Slavery, as he has seen and <hi rend="italics">felt it himself.</hi>  He has intended  “nothing to extenuate, nor aught set down
<pb id="stewardxii" n="xii"/>                                      
in malice;” indeed, so far from believing that he has misrepresented
Slavery as an institution, he does not feel that he has the power to
give anything like a true picture of it in all its deformity and
wickedness; especially <hi rend="italics">that</hi> Slavery which is an institution among an
enlightened and Christian people, who profess to believe that all
men are born <hi rend="italics">free</hi> and <hi rend="italics">equal,</hi> and who have certain inalienable <hi rend="italics">rights,</hi>
among which are <hi rend="italics">life, liberty,</hi> and the pursuit of happiness.</p>
        <p>The author claims that he has endeavored since he had his
freedom, as much as in him lay, to benefit his suffering fellows in
bondage; and that he has spent most of his free life in efforts to
elevate them in manners and morals, though against all the opposing
forces of prejudice and pride, which of course, has made much of his
labor vain. In his old age he sends out this history-presenting as
it were his <hi rend="italics">own body,</hi> with the marks and scars of the tender mercies
of slave drivers upon it, and asking that these may plead in the
name of Justice, Humanity, and Mercy, that those who have the
power, may have the magnanimity to strike off the chains from the
enslaved, and bid him stand up, a Freeman and a Brother!</p>

        <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
        <head>SLAVE LIFE ON THE PLANTATION. </head>
        <p>I was born in Prince William County, Virginia.
At seven years of age, I found myself a slave on
the plantation of Capt. William Helm. Our family
consisted of my father and mother  -  whose names
were Robert and Susan Steward  -  a sister, Mary, 
and myself. As was the usual custom, we lived in
a small cabin, built of rough boards, with a floor of
earth, and small openings in the sides of the cabin
were substituted for windows. The chimney was
built of sticks and mud; the door, of rough boards;
and the whole was put together in the rudest possible
manner. As to the furniture of this rude dwelling,
it was procured by the slaves themselves, who were
occasionally permitted to earn a little money after
their day's toil was done. I never knew Capt. H.
to furnish his slaves with household utensils of any
description.</p>
        <pb id="steward14" n="14"/>
        <p>The amount of provision given out on the plantation 
per week, was invariably one peck of corn or
meal for each slave. This allowance was given in
meal when it could be obtained; when it could not,
they received corn, which they pounded in mortars
after they returned from their labor in the field. The
slaves on our plantation were provided with very
little meat. In addition to the peck of corn or meal,
they were allowed a little salt and a few herrings.
If they wished for more, they were obliged to earn it
by over-work. They were permitted to cultivate
small gardens, and were thereby enabled to provide
themselves with many trifling conveniences. But
these gardens were only allowed to some of the more
industrious. Capt. Helm allowed his slaves a small
quantity of meat during harvest time, but when the
harvest was over they were obliged to fall back on
the old allowance.</p>
        <p>It was usual for men and women to work side by
side on our plantation; and in many kinds of work,
the women were compelled to do as much as the men.
Capt. H. employed an overseer, whose business it was
to look after each slave in the field, and see that he
performed his task. The overseer always went around
with a whip, about nine feet long, made of the
toughest kind of cowhide, the but-end of which was
loaded with lead, and was about four or five inches in
circumference, running to a point at the opposite
<pb id="steward15" n="15"/>
extremity. This made a dreadful instrument of torture, 
and, when in the hands of a cruel overseer, it
was truly fearful. With it, the skin of an ox or a
horse could be cut through. Hence, it was no
uncommon thing to see the poor slaves with their
backs mangled in a most horrible manner. Our overseer, 
thus armed with his cowhide, and with a large
bull-dog behind him, followed the slaves all day; and,
if one of them fell in the rear from any cause, this
cruel weapon was plied with terrible force. He would
strike the dog one blow and the slave another, in
order to keep the former from tearing the delinquent
slave in pieces,  -  such was the ferocity of his canine
attendant.</p>
        <p>It was the rule for the slaves to rise and be ready
for their task by sun-rise, on the blowing of a horn or
conch-shell; and woe be to the unfortunate, who was
not in the field at the time appointed, which was in
thirty minutes from the first sounding of the horn. I
have heard the poor creatures beg as for their lives, of
the inhuman overseer, to desist from his cruel punishment. 
Hence, they were usually found in the field
“betimes in the morning,” (to use an old Virginia
phrase), where they worked until nine o'clock. They
were then allowed thirty minutes to eat their morning
meal, which consisted of a little bread. At a given
signal, all hands were compelled to return to their
work. They toiled until noon, when they were
<pb id="steward16" n="16"/>
permitted to take their breakfast, which corresponds
to our dinner.</p>
        <p>On our plantation, it was the usual practice to have
one of the old slaves set apart to do the cooking. All
the field hands were required to give into the hands
of the cook a certain portion of their weekly allowance, 
either in dough or meal, which was prepared in
the following manner. The cook made a hot fire
and rolled up each person's portion in some cabbage
leaves, when they could be obtained, and placed it in
a hole in the ashes, carefully covered with the same,
where it remained until done. Bread baked in this
way is very sweet and good. But cabbage leaves
could not always be obtained. When this was the
case, the bread was little better than a mixture of
dough and ashes, which was not very palatable. The
time allowed for breakfast, was one hour. At the
signal, all hands were obliged to resume their toil.
The overseer was always on hand to attend to all
delinquents, who never failed to feel the blows of his
heavy whip.</p>
        <p>The usual mode of punishing the poor slaves was,
to make them take off their clothes to the bare back,
and then tie their hands before them with a rope, pass
the end of the rope over a beam, and draw them up
till they stood on the tips of their toes. Sometimes
they tied their legs together and placed a rail between.
Thus prepared, the overseer proceeded to punish the
<pb id="steward17" n="17"/>
poor, helpless victim. Thirty-nine was the number
of lashes ordinarily inflicted for the most trifling
offence.</p>
        <p>Who can imagine a position more painful? Oh,
who, with feelings of common humanity, could look
quietly on such torture? Who could remain unmoved, 
to see a fellow-creature thus tied, unable to
move or to raise a hand in his own defence; scourged
on his bare back, with a cowhide, until the blood
flows in streams from his quivering flesh? And for
what? Often for the most trifling fault; and, as
sometimes occurs, because a mere whim or caprice
of his brutal overseer demands it. Pale with passion, 
his eyes flashing and his stalwart frame trembling
with rage, like some volcano, just ready to belch forth
its fiery contents, and, in all its might and fury, spread
death and destruction all around, he continues to
wield the bloody lash on the broken flesh of the poor,
pleading slave, until his arm grows weary, or he
sinks down, utterly exhausted, on the very spot where
already stand the pools of blood which his cruelty has
drawn from the mangled body of his helpless victim,
and within the hearing of those agonized groans and
feeble cries of “Oh do, Massa! Oh do, Massa!
Do, Lord, have mercy! Oh, Lord, have mercy!” &amp;c.</p>
        <p>Nor is this cruel punishment inflicted on the bare
backs of the male portion of slaves only. Oh no!
The slave husband must submit without a murmur, to
<pb id="steward18" n="18"/> 
see the form of his cherished, but wretched wife, not
only exposed to the rude gaze of a beastly tyrant, but
he must unresistingly see the heavy cowhide descend
upon her shrinking flesh, and her manacled limbs
writhe in inexpressible torture, while her piteous cries
for help ring through his ears unanswered. The wild
throbbing of his heart must be suppressed, and his
righteous indignation find no voice, in the presence of
the human monster who holds dominion over him.</p>
        <p>After the infuriated and heartless overseer had satiated 
his thirst for vengeance, on the disobedient or
delinquent slave, he was untied, and left to crawl
away as best he could; sometimes on his hands and
knees, to his lonely and dilapidated cabin, where,
stretched upon the cold earth, he lay weak and bleeding 
and often faint from the loss of blood, without a
friend who dare administer to his necessities, and
groaning in the agony of his crushed spirit. In his
cabin, which was not as good as many of our stables
at the North, he might lie for weeks before recovering
sufficient strength to resume the labor imposed upon
him, and all this time without a bed or bed clothing,
or any of the necessaries considered so essential to the
sick.</p>
        <p>Perhaps some of his fellow-slaves might come and.
bathe his wounds in warm water, to prevent his
clothing from tearing open his flesh anew, and thus
make the second suffering well nigh equal to the first;
<pb id="steward19" n="19"/>
or they might from their scanty store bring him such
food as they could spare, to keep him from suffering
hunger, and offer their sympathy, and then drag their
own weary bodies to their place of rest, after their
daily task was finished.</p>
        <p>Oh, you who have hearts to feel; you who have
kind friends around you, in sickness and in sorrow,
think of the sufferings of the helpless, destitute, and
down-trodden slave. Has sickness laid its withering
hand upon you, or disappointment blasted your fairest
earthly prospects, still, the outgushings of an affectionate 
heart are not denied you, and you may look
forward with hope to a bright future. Such a hope
seldom animates the heart of the poor slave. He toils
on, in his unrequited labor, looking only to the grave
to find a quiet resting place, where he will be free
from the oppressor.</p>

      <div1>
        <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
        <head>AT THE GREAT HOUSE.</head>
        <p>When eight years of age, I was taken to the
“great house,” or the family mansion of my
master, to serve as an errand boy, where I had to
stand in the presence of my master's family all the
day, and a part of the night, ready to do any thing
which they commanded me to perform.</p>
        <p>My master's family consisted of himself and wife,
and seven children. His overseer, whose name was
Barsly Taylor, had also a wife and five children.
These constituted the white population on the plantation. 
Capt. Helm was the owner of about one
hundred slaves, which made the residents on the plantation 
number about one hundred and sixteen persons 
in all. One hundred and seven of them, were
required to labor for the benefit of the remaining   
nine, who possessed that vast domain; and one hundred
of the number doomed to unrequited toil, under the
<pb id="steward21" n="21"/>
lash of a cruel task-master during life, with no hope
of release this side of the grave, and as far as the
cruel oppressor is concerned, shut out from hope
beyond it.</p>
        <p>And here let me ask, why is this practice of working 
slaves half clad, poorly fed, with nothing or
nearly so, to stimulate them to exertion, but fear of
the lash? Do the best interests of our common
country require it? I think not. Did the true interest 
of Capt. Helm demand it? Whatever may have
been his opinion, I cannot think it did. Can it be for
the best interest or good of the enslaved? Certainly 
not; for there is no real inducement for the slave-holder 
to make beasts of burden of his fellow men,
but that which was frankly acknowledged by Gibbs
and other pirates: “we have the power,”  -  the power
to rob and murder on the high seas!  -  which they
will undoubtedly continue to hold, until overtaken
by justice; which will certainly come some time, just
as sure as that a righteous God reigns over the earth
or rules in heaven.</p>
        <p>Some have attempted to apologize for the enslaving
of the Negro, by saying that they are inferior to the
Anglo-saxon race in every respect. This charge I
deny; it is utterly false. Does not the Bible inform
us that “God hath created of one blood all the nations
of the earth?” And certainly in stature and physical
force the colored man is quite equal to his white
<pb id="steward22" n="22"/>
brother, and in many instances his superior; but were
it otherwise, I can not see why the more favored class
should enslave the other. True, God has given to the
African a darker complexion than to his white brother:
still, each have the same desires and aspirations. The
food required for the sustenance of one is equally
necessary for the other. Naturally or physically,
they alike require to be warmed by the cheerful fire,
when chilled by our northern winter's breath; and
alike they welcome the cool spring and the delightful
shade of summer. Hence, I have come to the conclusion 
that God created all men free and equal, and
placed them upon this earth to do good and benefit
each other, and that war and slavery should be banished 
from the face of the earth.</p>
        <p>My dear reader will not understand me to say, that
all nations are alike intelligent, enterprising and industrious, 
for we all know that it is far otherwise; but to
man, and not to our Creator, should the fault be
charged. But, to resume our narrative,</p>
        <p>Capt. Helm was not a very hard master; but generally 
was kind and pleasant. Indulgent when in
good humor, but like many of the southerners, terrible
when in a passion. He was a great sportsman, and
very fond of company. He generally kept one or two
ace horses, and a pack of hounds for fox-hunting,
which at that time, was a very common and fashionable 
diversion in that section of country. He was not
<pb id="steward23" n="23"/>
only a sportsman, but a gamester, and was in the
habit of playing cards, and sometimes betting very
high and losing accordingly.</p>
        <p>I well remember an instance of the kind: it was
when he played cards with a Mr. W. Graham, who
won from him in one sweep, two thousand and seven
hundred dollars in all, in the form of a valuable horse,
prized at sixteen hundred dollars, another saddlehorse 
of less value, one slave, and his wife's gold
watch. The company decided that all this was fairly
won, but Capt. Helm demurred, and refused to give
up the property until an application was made to Gen.
George Washington, <sic>“(</sic>the father of his country,”)
who decided that Capt. Helm had lost the game, and
that Mr. Graham had fairly won the property, of
which Mr. G. took immediate possession, and conveyed 
to his own plantation.</p>
        <p>Capt. Helm was not a good business man, unless
we call horse-racing, fox-hunting, and card-playing,
business. His overseer was entrusted with every
thing on the plantation, and allowed to manage about
as he pleased, while the Captain enjoyed himself in
receiving calls from his wealthy neighbors, and in
drinking what he called “grog,” which was no more
nor less than whisky, of which he was extremely
fond, notwithstanding his cellar contained the choicest
wines and liquors. To show his partiality for his
favorite beverage, I will relate an incident which
<pb id="steward24" n="24"/>
occurred between Capt. Helm and Col. Charles
Williamson. The Colonel, believing wine to be
a healthier beverage than whisky, accepted a bet
made by Capt. Helm, of one thousand dollars, that he
would live longer and drink whisky, than the Colonel,
who drank wine. Shortly after, Col. Williamson was
called home by the British government, and while on
his way to England, died, and his body, preserved in
a cask of brandy, was taken home. The bet Capt.
Helm made considerable effort to get, but was unsuccessful.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Helm was a very industrious woman, and
generally busy in her household affairs  -  sewing, knitting, 
and looking after the servants; but she was a
great scold,  -  continually finding fault with some of
the servants, and frequently punishing the young
slaves herself, by striking them over the head with a
heavy iron key, until the blood ran; or else whipping
them with a cowhide, which she always kept by her
side when sitting in her room. The older servants
she would cause to be punished by having them
severely whipped by a man, which she never failed
to do for every trifling fault. I have felt the weight
of some of her heaviest keys on my own head, and for
the slightest offences. No slave could possibly escape
being punished  -  I care not how attentive they might
be, nor how industrious  -  punished they must be, and
punished they certainly were. Mrs. Helm appeared
<pb id="steward25" n="25"/>
to be uneasy unless some of the servants were under
the lash. She came into the kitchen one morning and
my mother, who was cook, had just put on the
dinner. Mrs. Helm took out her white cambric handkerchief, 
and rubbed it on the inside of the pot, and
it crocked it! That was enough to invoke the wrath
of my master, who came forth immediately with his
horse-whip, with which he whipped my poor mother
most unmercifully-far more severely than I ever
knew him to whip a horse.</p>
        <p>I once had the misfortune to break the lock of
master's shot gun, and when it came to his knowledge, 
he came to me in a towering passion, and
charged me with what he considered the <hi rend="italics">crime</hi> of carelessness. I denied it, and told him I knew
nothing about it; but I was so terribly frightened
that he saw I was guilty, and told me so, foaming 
with rage; and then I confessed the truth. But
oh, there was no escaping the lash. Its recollection
is still bitter, and ever will be. I was commanded 
to take off my clothes, which I did, and
then master put me on the back of another slave, my
arms hanging down before him and my hands clasped
in his, where he was obliged to hold me with a viselike 
grasp. Then master gave me the most severe
flogging that I ever received, and I pray God that I
may never again experience such torture. And yet
Capt. Helm was not the worst of masters.</p>
        <pb id="steward26" n="26"/>
        <p>Those cruelties are daily occurrences, and so degrading 
is the whole practice of Slavery, that it not only
crushes and brutalizes the wretched slave, but it
hardens the heart, benumbs all the fine feelings of
humanity, and deteriorates from the character of the
slave-holders themselves,  -  whether man or woman.
Otherwise, how could a gentle, and in other respects,
amiable woman, look on such scenes of cruelty, without 
a shudder of utter abhorrence? But slaveholding
ladies, can not only look on quietly, but with approbation; 
and what is worse, though very common, they
can and do use the lash and cowhide themselves, on
the backs of their slaves, and that too on those of
their own sex! Far rather would I spend my life in
a State's Prison, than be the slave of the best slave-holder 
on the earth!</p>
        <p>When I was not employed as an errand-boy, it was
my duty to stand behind my master's chair, which
was sometimes the whole day, never being allowed to
sit in his presence. Indeed, no slave is ever allowed
to sit down in the presence of their master or mistress.
If a slave is addressed when sitting, he is required to
spring to his feet, and instantly remove his hat, if he
has one, and answer in the most humble manner, or
lay the foundation for a flogging, which will not be
long delayed.</p>
        <p>I slept in the same room with my master and mistress. 
This room was elegantly furnished with damask
<pb id="steward27" n="27"/>
curtains, mahogany bedstead of the most expensive
kind, and every thing else about it was of the most
costly kind. And while Mr. and Mrs. Helm reposed
on their bed of down, with a cloud of lace floating
over them, like some Eastern Prince, with their slaves
to fan them while they slept, and to tremble when
they awoke, I always slept upon the floor, without a
pillow or even a blanket, but, like a dog, lay down
anywhere I could find a place.</p>
        <p>Slaves are never allowed to leave the plantation to
which they belong, without a written pass. Should
any one venture to disobey this law, he will most
likely be caught by the <hi rend="italics">patrol</hi> and given thirty-nine
lashes. This patrol is always on duty every Sunday,
going to each plantation under their supervision,
entering every slave cabin, and examining closely the
conduct of the slaves; and if they find one slave
from another plantation without a pass, he is immediately 
punished with a severe flogging.</p>
        <p>I recollect going one Sunday with my mother, to
visit my grand-mother; and while there, two or three
of the patrol came and looked into the cabin, and seeing 
my mother, demanded her pass. She told them
that she had one, but had left it in another cabin, from
whence she soon brought it, which saved her a whipping 
but we were terribly frightened.</p>
        <p>The reader will obtain a better knowledge of the
character of a Virginia patrol, by the relation of an
<pb id="steward28" n="28"/>
affair, which came off on the neighboring plantation
of Col. Alexander, in which some forty of Capt.
Helm's slaves were engaged, and which proved rather
destructive of human life in the end.</p>
        <p>But I must first say that it is not true, that slave
owners are respected for kindness to their slaves.
The more tyrannical a master is, the more will he be
favorably regarded by his neighboring planters; and
from the day that he acquires the reputation of a kind
and indulgent master, he is looked upon with suspicion, 
and sometimes hatred, and his slaves are
watched more closely than before.</p>
        <p>Col. Alexander was a very wealthy planter and
owned a great number of slaves, but he was very
justly suspected of being a kind, humane, and indulgent 
master.  His slaves were always better fed,
better clad, and had greater privileges than any I
knew in the Old Dominion; and of course, the patrol
had long had an eye on them, anxious to flog some of
“those pampered riggers, who were spoiled by the
indulgence of a weak, inefficient, but well-meaning
owner.”</p>
        <p>Col. A. gave his slaves the liberty to get up a grand
dance. Invitations were sent and accepted, to a large
number of slaves on other plantations, and so, for
miles around, all or many of the slaves were in high
anticipation of joining in the great dance, which was
to come off on Easter night. In the mean time, the
<pb id="steward29" n="29"/>
patrol was closely watching their movements, and
evinced rather a joyful expectancy of the many they
should find there without a pass, and the flogging
they would give them for that, if not guilty of any
other offence, and perhaps they might catch some of
the Colonel's slaves doing something for which they
could taught “to know their place,” by the application 
of the cowhide.</p>
        <p>The slaves on Col. A's plantation had to provide
and prepare the supper for the expected vast “turn
out,” which was no light matter; and as slaves like
on such occasions to pattern as much as possible after
their master's family, the result was, to meet the
emergency of the case, they <hi rend="italics">took,</hi> without saying, “by
your leave, Sir,” some property belonging to their
master, reasoning among themselves, as slaves often
do, that it can not be <hi rend="italics">stealing,</hi> because “it belongs to
massa, and so do <hi rend="italics">we,</hi> and we only use one part of his
property to benefit another. Sure, 'tis all massa's.”
And if they do not get detected in this removal
of “ massa's property” from one location to another,
they think no more of it.</p>
        <p>Col. Alexander's slaves were hurrying on with their
great preparations for the dance and feast; and as the
time drew near, the old and knowing ones might be
seen in groups, discussing the matter, with many a
wink and nod; but it was in the valleys and by-places
where the younger portion were to be found, rather
<pb id="steward30" n="30"/>               
secretly preparing food for the great time coming.
This consisted of hogs, sheep, calves; and as to
master's <hi rend="italics">poultry,</hi> that suffered daily. Sometimes it
was missed, but the disappearance was always easily
accounted for, by informing “massa” that a great number 
of hawks had been around of late; and their
preparation went on, night after night, undetected.
They who repaired to a swamp or other by-place to
cook by night, carefully destroyed everything likely
to detect them, before they returned to their cabins in
the morning.</p>
        <p>The night for the dance <hi rend="italics">came</hi> at last, and long
before the time, the road leading to Col. Alexander's
plantation presented a gay spectacle. The females
were seen flocking to the place of resort, with heads
adorned with gaudy bandanna turbans and new calico
dresses, of the gayest colors,  -  their whole attire
decked over with bits of gauze ribbon and other
fantastic finery. The shades of night soon closed over
the plantation, and then could be heard the rude
music and loud laugh of the unpolished slave. It
was about ten o'clock when the <hi rend="italics">aristocratic slaves</hi> began
to assemble, dressed in the cast-off finery of their
master and mistress, swelling out and putting on airs
in imitation of those they were forced to obey from
day to day.</p>
        <p>When they were all assembled, the dance commenced; 
the old fiddler struck up some favorite tune,
<pb id="steward31" n="31"/>
and over the floor they went; the flying feet of the
dancers were heard, pat, pat, over the apartment till
the clock warned them it was twelve at midnight, or
what some call “low twelve,” to distinguish it from
twelve o'clock at noon; then the violin ceased its
discordant sounds, and the merry dancers paused to
take breath.</p>
        <p>Supper was then announced, and all began to prepare 
for the sumptuous feast. It being the pride of 
slaves to imitate the manners of their master and
mistress, especially in the ceremonies of the table,
all was conducted with great propriety and good
order. The food was well cooked, and in a very
plentiful supply. They had also managed in some
way, to get a good quantity of excellent wine, which
was sipped in the most approved and modern style.
Every dusky face was lighted up, and every eye
sparkled with joy. However ill fed they might
have been, here, for once, there was plenty. Suffering 
and toil was forgotten, and they all seemed with
one accord to give themselves up to the intoxication
of pleasurable amusement.</p>
        <p>House servants were of course, “the stars” of the
party; all eyes were turned to them to see how they
conducted, for they, among slaves, are what a military
man would call “fugle-men.” The field hands, and
such of them as have generally been excluded from
the dwelling of their owners, look to the house
<pb id="steward32" n="32"/>          
servant as a pattern of politeness and gentility. And
indeed, it is often the only method of obtaining any
knowledge of the manners of what is called “genteel
society;” hence, they are ever regarded as a privileged
class; and are sometimes greatly envied, while others
are bitterly hated. And too often justly, for many of
them are the most despicable tale-bearers and mischief-makers, 
who will, for the sake of the favor of his
master or mistress, frequently betray his fellow-slave,
and by tattling, get him severely whipped; and for
these acts of perfidy, and sometimes downright falsehood, 
he is often rewarded by his master, who knows
it is for his interest to keep such ones about him;
though he is sometimes obliged, in addition to a
reward, to send him away, for fear of the vengeance
of the betrayed slaves. In the family of his master,
the example of bribery and treachery is ever set
before him, hence it is, that insurrections and stampedes 
are so generally detected. Such slaves are
always treated with more affability than others, for the
slave-holder is well aware that he stands over a volcano, 
that may at any moment rock his foundation to
the center, and with one mighty burst of its long
suppressed fire, sweep him and his family to destruction. 
When he lies down at night, he knows not but
that ere another morning shall dawn, he may be left
mangled and bleeding, and at the mercy of those
maddened slaves whom he has so long ruled with a
rod of iron.</p>
        <pb id="steward33" n="33"/>
        <p>But the supper, like other events, came to an end at
last. The expensive table service, with other things,
which had been secretly brought from the “great
house,” was hurriedly cleansed by the slaves, and carefully 
returned. The floor was again cleared, the violin
sounded, and soon they were performing another
“break down,” with all the wild abandon of the
African character,  -  in the very midst of which, the
music suddenly ceased, and the old musician assumed
a listening attitude. Every foot was motionless;
every face terrified, and every ear listening for the
cause of the alarm.</p>
        <p>Soon the slave who was kept on the “look-out,”
shouted to the listeners the single word “<hi rend="italics">patrol!</hi>” and then the tumult that followed that announcement,
is beyond the power of language to describe!
Many a poor slave who had stolen from his cabin, to
join in the dance, now remembered that they had no
pass! Many screamed in affright, as if they already
felt the lash and heard the crack of the overseer's
whip; others clenched their hands, and assumed an
attitude of bold defiance, while a savage frown contracted 
the brow of all. Their unrestrained merriment 
and delicious fare, seemed to arouse in them the
natural feelings of self-defence and defiance of their
oppressors. But what could be done? The patrol
was nearing the building, when an athletic, powerful
slave, who had been but a short time from his “fatherland,”
                                                   <pb id="steward34" n="34"/>               
whose spirit the cowardly overseer had labored
in vain to quell, said in a calm, clear voice, that we
had better stand our ground, and advised, the females
to lose no time in useless wailing, but get their things
and repair immediately to a cabin at a short distance,
and there remain quiet, without a light, which they
did with all possible haste. The men were terrified
at this bold act of their leader; and many with dismay
at the thought of resistance, began to skulk behind
fences and old buildings, when he opened the door
and requested every slave to leave who felt unwilling
to fight. None were urged to remain, and those
who stood by him did so voluntarily.</p>
        <p>Their number was now reduced to twenty-five men,
but the leader, a gigantic African, with a massive,
compact frame, and an arm of great strength, looked
competent to put ten common men to flight. He
clenched his powerful fist, and declared that he would
resist unto death, before he would be arrested by those
savage men, even if they promised not to flog him.
They closed the door, and agreed not to open it; and
then the leader cried, “Extinguish the lights and let
them come! we will meet them hand to hand!” Five
of the number he stationed near the door, with orders
to rush out, if the patrol entered, and seize their
horses, cut the bridles, or otherwise unfit them for
use. This would prevent them from giving an alarm
and getting a reinforcement from surrounding plantations
<pb id="steward35" n="35"/>
In silence they awaited the approach of the
enemy, and soon the tramping of horses' feet announced 
their approach, but when within a few yards of the
house they halted, and were overheard by one of the
skulking slaves, maturing their plans and mode of
attack. There was great hesitancy expressed by a
part of the company to engage in the affair at all.</p>
        <lg type="poem">
          <l>“Coming events cast their shadow before.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>The majority, however, seemed to think it safe enough,
and uttered expressions of triumph that they had got
the rascals at last.</p>
        <p>“Are you not afraid that they will resist?” said
the weaker party.</p>
        <p>“Resist?” was the astonished answer. “This old
fellow, the Colonel, has pampered and indulged his
slaves, it is true, and they have slipped through our
fingers whenever we have attempted to chastise them;
but they are not such fools as to dare resistance!
Those niggers know as well as we, that it is <hi rend="italics">death,</hi> by
 the law of the State, for a slave to strike a white man.”</p>
        <p>“Very true,” said the other, “but it is dark and
long past midnight, and beside they have been indulging 
their appetites, and we cannot tell what they may
attempt to do.”</p>
        <p>“Pshaw!” he answered, contemptuously, “they are
unarmed, and I should not fear in the least, to go in
among them <hi rend="italics">alone,</hi> armed only with my cowhide!”</p>
        <pb id="steward36" n="36"/>
        <p>“As you please, then,” he said, rather dubiously,
“but look well to your weapons; are they in order?”</p>
        <p>“In prime order, Sir.” And putting spurs to their
horses, were soon at the house, where they dismounted 
and requested one of the party to remain with the
horses.</p>
        <p>“What,” said he, “are you so chicken-hearted as to
suppose those d--d cowardly niggers are going to get
up an insurrection?”</p>
        <p>“Oh no,” he replied, carelessly, but would not consent 
to have the horses left alone. “Besides,” said he,
“they may forget themselves at this late hour; but if
they do, a few lashes of the cowhide will quicken their
memory, I reckon.”</p>
        <p>The slaves were aware of their movements, and
 prepared to receive them.</p>
        <p>They stepped up to the door boldly, and demanded
admittance, but all was silent; they tried to open it,
but it was fastened. Those inside, ranged on each side
of the door, and stood perfectly still.</p>
        <p>The patrol finding the slaves not disposed to obey, 
burst off the slight fastening that secured the door, and
the chief of the patrol bounded into their midst, followed 
by several of his companions, all in total darkness!</p>
        <p>Vain is the attempt to describe the tumultuous scene
which followed. Hand to hand they fought and struggled 
with each other, amid the terrific explosion of firearms,
  -  oaths and curses, mingled with the prayers of
<pb id="steward37" n="37"/>
the wounded, and the groans of the dying! Two of
the patrol were killed on the spot, and lay drenched in
the warm blood that so lately flowed through their
veins. Another with his arm broken and otherwise
wounded, lay groaning and helpless, beside the fallen
slaves, who had sold their lives so dearly. Another of
his fellows was found at a short distance, mortally
wounded and about to bid adieu to life. In the yard
lay the keeper of the horses, a stiffened corpse. Six
of the slaves were killed and two wounded.</p>
        <p>It would be impossible to convey to the minds of
northern people, the alarm and perfect consternation
that the above circumstance occasioned in that community. 
The knowledge of its occurrence was carried
from one plantation to another, as on the wings of the
wind; exaggerated accounts were given, and prophecies 
of the probable result made, until the excitement 
became truly fearful. Every cheek was blanched 
and every frame trembled when listening to the
tale, that “insurrection among the slaves had commenced 
on the plantation of Col. Alexander; that three or
four of the patrol had been killed, &amp;c.” The day after, 
people flocked from every quarter, armed to the
teeth, swearing vengeance on the <sic>defenceless</sic> slaves.
Nothing can teach plainer than this, the constant and
tormenting fear in which the slave-holder lives, and
yet he repents not of his deeds.</p>
        <p>The kind old Colonel was placed in the most difficult
<pb id="steward38" n="38"/>
and unenviable position. His warm heart was filled 
with sorrow for the loss of his slaves, but not alone,
as is generally the case in such instances, because he
had lost so much property. He truly regretted the
death of his faithful servants, and boldly rebuked the
occasion of their sudden decease. When beset and
<sic>harrassed</sic> by his neighbors to give up his slaves to be
tried for insurrection and murder, he boldly resisted,
contending for the natural right of the slaves, to act in
their own defence, and especially when on his own
plantation and in their own quarters. They contended, 
however, that as his slaves had got up a dance, and
had invited those of the adjoining plantations, the patrol 
was only discharging their duty in looking after
them; but the gallant old Colonel defended his slaves,
and told them plainly that he should continue to do so
to the extent of his ability and means.</p>
        <p>The poor slaves were sad enough, on the morning
after their merry meeting, and they might be seen
standing in groups, conversing with a very different
air from the one they had worn the day before.</p>
        <p>Their business was now to prepare the bodies of
their late associates for the grave. Robert, the brave
African, who had so boldly led them on the night before, 
and who had so judiciously provided for their escape, 
was calmly sleeping in death's cold embrace.
He left a wife and five slave children. Two of the
other slaves left families, whose pitiful cries it was
painful to hear.</p>
        <pb id="steward39" n="39"/>
        <p>The Colonel's family, deeply afflicted by what was
passing around them, attended the funeral. One of
the slaves, who sometimes officiated as a minister, read
a portion of Scripture, and gave out two hymns;  -  one
of which commences with</p>
        <lg>
          <l>“Hark! from the tomb a doleful sound.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>Both were sung with great solemnity by the congregation, 
and then the good old man offered a prayer,
after which he addressed the slaves on the shortness of 
human life and the certainty of death, and more than
once hinted at the hardness of their lot, assuring, however, 
his fellow-slaves, that if they were good and
faithful, all would be right hereafter. His master, Col.
Alexander, was deeply affected by this simple faith
and sincere regard for the best interests of all, both
master and slave.</p>
        <p>When the last look at their fellow-servants had been
taken, the procession was formed in the following
manner: First, the old slave minister, then the remains
of the dead, followed by their weeping relatives; then
came the master and his family; next the slaves
belonging to the plantation; and last, friends and
strangers, black and white; all moved on solemnly to
the final resting-place of those brave men, whose
descendants may yet be heard from, in defence of
right and freedom.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER III.</head>
        <head>HORSE-RACING AND ITS CONSEQUENCES.</head>
        <p>Capt. Helm had a race-course on his plantation,
on which he trained young horses for the fall
races. One very fine horse he owned, called <hi rend="italics">Mark Anthony</hi>, which he trained in the most careful manner
for several months previous to the races. He would
put him on the course every morning, sometimes
covering him with a blanket, and then put him to his
utmost speed, which he called “sweating him.” Mark
Anthony was to be put on the race-course in October
following, as a competitor for the purse of ten thousand 
dollars, which was the amount to be lost or gained 
on the first day of the fall races. Capt. H. had
also another young horse, called <hi rend="italics">Buffer</hi>, under a course
of training, which he designed to enter the lists for the
second day. His course of training had been about
the same as Mark Anthony's, but being a year or two
younger, it was thought that he had not sufficient
“bottom” to risk so much money on, as was at stake
on the first day.</p>
        <pb id="steward40a" n="40a"/>
        <p>
          <figure id="ill1" entity="stew41">
            <p>“Away they go, sweeping round the course with lightning speed, while every spectator's eye is strained, and every countenance flushed with intense anxiety.”<lb/>page 41.</p>
          </figure>
        </p>
        <pb id="steward41" n="41"/>
        <p>When the time for the races to commence came, all
was bustle and excitement in the house and on the
plantation. It was a fine October morning, and the
sun shed a mellow radiance on all around, when people
began to throng the race-course. Some came with
magnificent equipages, attended by their numerous
train of black servants, dressed in livery,  -  some in
less splendid array,  -  and others on foot, all hurrying
on to the exciting scene. There the noblest blood of
Old Virginia, of which many are wont to boast, was
fully represented, as was also the wealth and fashion
of the country for many miles around.</p>
        <p>All were in high spirits, and none seemed to fear
that they would be the losers in the amount of money
about to change hands. And for what, pray, is all
this grand outlay  -  this vast expenditure? Merely the
pleasure and gratification of witnessing the speed of a
fine horse, and the vanity of prejudging concerning it.</p>
        <p>The arrangements were at length completed,  -  the
horses regularly entered, Mark Anthony among the
rest, and then the word “go!” was given, when each
horse sprang as if for his life, each striving to take the
lead. Away they go, sweeping round the course with
lightning speed, while every spectator's eye is strained,
and every countenance flushed with intense anxiety.</p>
        <p>Some of the noble animals were distanced the first
heat, and others were taken away by their owners.</p>
        <p>The judges allowed twenty minutes to prepare the
<pb id="steward42" n="42"/>
horses for the second trial of their speed  -  a trial which
must enrich or <sic>empoverish</sic> many of the thousands
present. Already there were sad countenances to be
seen in the crowd.</p>
        <p>The horses were again in readiness, and the word
given,  -  away they flew with the fleetness of the wind,
to come in the second time.</p>
        <p>But who can describe the anxiety written on every
face, as they prepared for the third and last trial? I
cannot. Many had already lost all they had staked,
and others who had bet high began to fear for the result. 
Soon, however, all was again prepared and those
foaming steeds, after having exerted their animal power
to the utmost, have accomplished their task and come
in for the last time. The purse was won, <hi rend="italics">but not by Mark Anthony</hi>. Capt. Helm was more fortunate 
the second day. Buffer won the smaller purse,
but the Captain came from the races, a much poorer
man than when they commenced. These repeated
failures and heavy losses had the effect to arouse him
to a sense of his pecuniary position, and he soon after
began to think and talk about going to some new    
country.</p>
        <p>He resolved at last to visit the far-off “Genesee
Country,” which he shortly after put in practice, and
after an absence of about three weeks he returned in
good health, and delighted with the country; the more
so, doubtless, because he said, “the more slaves a man
<pb id="steward43" n="43"/>
possessed in that country the more he would be respected, 
and the higher would be his position in society.”</p>
        <p>Capt. Helm finally concluded to sell his plantation
and stock, except the slaves, and remove to the Genesee 
Country, where he designed to locate his future
residence.</p>
        <p>The plantation and stock (retaining the slaves) were
advertised for sale, and on a certain day named, all
would be disposed of at a public sale, or to the highest 
bidder.</p>
        <p>When the day of sale arrived, there flocked from all
parts of the surrounding country the largest assemblage 
of people I ever saw in that place. A large
number of wealthy and respectable planters were
present, whose gentlemanly behavior should have been
an example to others.</p>
        <p>The majority of that vast crowd, however, were a
rough, quarrelsome, fighting set, just such as might be
expected from slave-holding districts. There were
several regularly fought battles during the first day of
the sale.</p>
        <p>One Thomas Ford, a large, muscular, ferocious-looking 
fellow, a good specimen of a southern bully and
woman-whipper, had been victorious through the day
in numerous fights and brawls; but he had to pay dear
for it when night came. Some one or more of
the vanquished party, took advantage of the dark
<pb id="steward44" n="44"/>
night to stab him in both sides. The knife of the assassin 
had been thrust into his thigh, tearing the flesh
upward, leaving a frightful and dangerous wound;
but what is most singular, both sides were wounded in
nearly the same manner, and at the same time, for so
quickly was the deed committed that the offenders
made their escape, before an alarm could be raised for
their detection; nor have I ever heard of any one
being arrested for the crime.</p>
        <p>Ford's groans and cries were painful to hear, but his
brother acted like a madman; rushing hither and
thither, with a heavy bludgeon in his hand, with
which he indiscriminately beat the fences and whatever 
came in his way, crying “Oh my brother, my
poor brother! Who has murdered my poor brother?”</p>
        <p>Physicians came to the aid of the wounded man who
at first thought he might recover, but in a climate like
that of Virginia it was impossible. His friends did all
they could to save him, but the poor wretch lingered
a few days and died. Thus ended the life of a bad
man and a hard master.</p>
        <p>And who will wonder, if his slaves rejoiced to hear
of his death? If they must be sold to pay his debts,
they could not fall into the hands of a more heart
less tyrant. Who then can blame those feeble women
and helpless children, long held as chattels in his iron
grasp, if they are grateful that the man-stealer is no
more?</p>
        <pb id="steward45" n="45"/>
        <p>This Ford was a fair specimen of that class, known
in more modern parlance as a “Border Ruffian.'' Such
as are at this time endeavoring, by their swaggering
and bullying, to cast on the fair fields of Kansas that
deep curse of Slavery  -  a curse which, like the poison
of the deadly Upas, blights all within its influence:
the colored and the white man, the slave and the
master. We were thankful, however, that no more
lives were lost during the vendue, which was commenced 
with the stock; this occupied two days.</p>
        <p>The reader will see that we had cause to be grateful, 
when he takes into consideration that drinking and
fighting was the order of the day, and drunkenness 
and carousing the order of the night.</p>
        <p>Then too, the practice of dueling was carried on in
all its hideous barbarity. If a gentleman thought himself 
insulted, he would immediately challenge the
offender to mortal combat, and if he refused to do so,
then the insulted gentleman felt bound by that barbarous 
code of honor, to take his life, whenever or
wherever he might meet him, though it might be
in a crowded assembly, where the lives of innocent
persons were endangered.</p>
        <p>A case of this kind happened in Kentucky, where
the belligerent parties met in a large concourse of
people, the majority of them women and children;
but the combat ensued, regardless of consequences.
One woman was shot through the face, but that
<pb id="steward46" n="46"/>
was not worthy of notice, for she was only a <hi rend="italics">colored woman;</hi> and in that, as in other slave States, the
laws give to the white population the liberty to trample
under foot the claims of all such persons to justice.
Justly indignant ladies present remonstrated, but all to
no purpose. The Governor of the State was there
and was in danger of being wounded by their flying
bullets, and it is possible that if he had been in the
place of the poor African, some action would have
been taken, and laws made to protect the people
against such inhuman practices. But I must return to
Capt. Helm and the vendue.</p>
        <p>The sale continued for several days, during which
there was no such thing as rest or sleep or one quiet
moment on the premises. As was customary in that
State, Capt. Helm provided the food and drink for all
who came, and of course a great many came to drink
and revel and not to buy; and that class generally
took the night time for their hideous outbreaks, when
the more respectable class had retired to their beds or
to their homes. And many foul deeds and cruel outrages 
were committed; nor could the perpetrators be
detected or brought to justice. Nothing could be done
but to submit quietly to their depredations.</p>
        <p>One peaceable old slave was killed by having his
head split open with an ax. He was found in the
morning lying in the yard, with the bloody instrument
of death by his side. This <sic>occaisoned</sic> some excitement
<pb id="steward47" n="47"/>
among the slaves, but as the white people paid
but little attention to it, it soon passed off, and the sorrowful 
slaves put the old man's remains in a rough
box, and conveyed them to their last resting-place.</p>
        <p>After the sale was over, the slaves were allowed a
holiday, with permission to go and visit their friends
and relatives previous to their departure for their new
home in a strange land.</p>
        <p>The slaves generally on Capt. Helm's plantation
looked upon this removal as the greatest hardship they
had ever met; the severest trial they had ever endured ; 
and the separation from our old home and fellow-slaves, 
from our relatives and the old State of Virginia, 
was to us a contemplation of sorrowful interest.
Those who remained, thought us the most unfortunate
of human beings to be taken away off into the State
of New York, and, as they believed, beyond the
bounds of civilization, where we should in all probability 
be destroyed by wild beasts, devoured by cannibals, 
or scalped by the Indians. We never expected
to meet again in this life, hence our parting interviews
were as solemn as though we were committing our
friends to the grave. But He whose tender mercies
are over all his creatures, knew best what was for our
good.</p>
        <p>Little did Capt. Helm think when bringing his slaves
to New York that in a few short years, they would be
singing the song of deliverance from Slavery's thralldom;
 <pb id="steward48" n="48"/>
and as little thought he of the great and painful
change, to be brought about in his own circumstances.
Could any one have looked into futurity and traced the
difficult path, my master was to tread,  -  could any one
have foreseen the end to which he must soon come,
and related it to him in the days of his greatness and
prosperity, he would, I am certain, have turned from
such a narrator of misfortune in a greater rage than
did Namaan when the man of God told him “to go
and dip seven times in the Jordan.”</p>
        <p>He could not have believed, nor could I, that in a
few years the powerful, wealthy slave-holder, living in
luxury and extravagance, would be so reduced that
the <hi rend="italics">necessaries</hi> of life even, were beyond his means, and
that he must be supported by the town!</p>
        <p>But I anticipate. Let us return to the old plantation 
which seems dearer than ever, now that we are
about to leave it forever.</p>
        <p>We thought Capt. Helm's prospects pretty fair, and
yet we shuddered when we realized our condition as
slaves. This change in our circumstances was calculated 
to awaken all our fears that had been slumbering, 
and bring all the perilous changes to which we
might be subjected most vividly to mind.</p>
        <p>We were about to leave the land of our birth, the
home of our childhood, and we felt that untried scenes
were before us. We were slaves, it is true, but we
had heart-felt emotions to suppress, when we thought
<pb id="steward49" n="49"/>
of leaving all that was so familiar to us, and chose
rather to “bear the ills we had, than to fly to those
we knew not of.”  And oh, the terrible uncertainty of
the future, that ever rests on the slave, even the most
favored, was now felt with a crushing weight. To-day,
they are in the old familiar cabin surrounded by their
family, relatives and friends; to-morrow, they may be
scattered, parted forever. The master's circumstances,
not their own, may have assigned one to the dreadful
slave-pen, and another to the distant rice-swamp; and
it is this continual dread of some perilous future that
holds in check every joyous emotion, every lofty aspiration, 
of the most favored slave at the South. They
know that their owners indulge in high living, and
they are well aware also that their continual indulgences 
engender disease, which make them very liable
to sudden death; or their master may be killed in a
duel, or at a horse-race, or in a drunken brawl; then
his creditors are active in looking after the estate; and
next, the blow of the auctioneer's hammer separates
them perhaps for life.</p>
        <p>Now, after the lapse of so many years, when my
thoughts wander back, as they often do, to my native
State, I confess that painful recollections drive from
my mind those joyful emotions that should ever arise
in the heart of man, when contemplating the familiar
scenes of his youth, and especially when recurring to
the venerable shades and the sheltering roof under
<pb id="steward50" n="50"/>
which he was born. True, around the well-remembered 
spot where our childhood's years were spent,
recollection still loves to linger; yet memory, ever
ready with its garnered store, paints in glowing colors,
Virginia's crouching slaves in the foreground. Her
loathsome slave-pens and slave markets-chains,
whips and instruments of torture; and back of all
this is as truthfully recorded the certain doom, the retributive 
justice, that will sooner or later overtake her;
and with a despairing sigh I turn away from the imaginary 
view of my native State.</p>
        <p>What though she may have been justly styled,
“The Mother of Presidents?” What avails the honor
of being the birth-place of the brave and excellent
Washington, while the prayers and groans of the
down-trodden African daily ascend to heaven for redress? 
What though her soil be fertile, yielding a
yearly product of wealth to its possessors? And
what matter is it, that their lordly mansions are embowered 
in the shade of trees of a century's growth,
if, through their lofty and tangled branches, we espy
the rough cabin of the mangled bondman, and know
that the soil on which he labors has drunk his heart's
blood?</p>
        <p>Ah! to me, life's sweetest memories are all embittered.  
Slavery had cast its dark and fearful shadow
over my childhood, youth, and early manhood, and I
went out from the land of my birth, a fettered slave.
<pb id="steward51" n="51"/>
A land which I can regard only as “the house of
bondage and the grave of freedom.” But God forgive
me for having envied my master his fair prospects at
this time.</p>
        <p>After the sale of the plantation, Capt. Helm was in
possession of quite a large sum of money, and having
never paid much attention to his pecuniary interests,
he acted as if there could be no end of it. He realized
about forty thousand dollars from the sale of his estate
in Virginia, which would have been a pretty sum in
the hands of a man who had been accustomed to look
after his own interests; but under the management of
one who had all his life lived and prospered on the
unrequited toil of slaves, it was of little account. He
bought largely of every thing he thought necessary
for himself or the comfort of his family, for which he
always paid the most extravagant prices. The Captain
was not as well qualified to take care of himself and
family as some of his slaves were; but he thought
differently, and so the preparations for leaving the old
plantation for a home in the wilds of New York,
went on under his direction, and at last we bade a
final adieu to our friends and all we held dear in the
State of Virginia.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER IV.</head>
        <head>JOURNEY TO OUR NEW HOME IN NEW YORK.</head>
        <p>All things having been prepared for our departure
our last “Good-bye” spoken, and our last
look taken of the old plantation, we started, amid the
sobs and prolonged cries of separating families, in
company with our master, the overseer and another
white man named Davis, who went with us to take
back the five-horse “Pennsylvania team,” which was
provided for the conveyance of the food for the slaves,
and what little baggage they might have, and also
that of the overseer.</p>
        <p>Capt. Helm had determined to leave his family until
he could get his slaves settled in their future quarters,
and a home provided for himself, when they were
expected to join him.</p>
        <p>We traveled northward, through Maryland, Pennsylvania, 
and a portion of New York, to Sodus Bay,
where we halted for some time. We made about
<pb id="steward53" n="53"/>
twenty miles per day, camping out every night, and
reached that place after a march of twenty days.
Every morning the overseer called the roll, when
every slave must answer to his or her name, felling to
the ground with his cowhide, any delinquent who
failed to speak out in quick time. After the roll had
been called, and our scanty breakfast eaten, we
marched on again, our company presenting the appearance 
of some numerous caravan crossing the desert
of Sahara. When we pitched our tents for the night,
the slaves must immediately set about cooking not
their supper only, but their breakfast, so as to be
ready to start early the next morning, when the tents
were struck; and we proceeded on our journey in this
way to the end.</p>
        <p>At Sodus Bay there was then one small tavern,
kept by a man named Sill.</p>
        <p>The bay is ten miles in length and from a half to
two miles in breadth, and makes an excellent harbor.
The surrounding country then was almost an unbroken
wilderness.</p>
        <p>After Capt. Helm had rested a few days at Sodus,
he went six miles up the bay and purchased a large
tract of land lying on both sides of that beautiful
sheet of water, and put his slaves on to clear and cultivate 
it. Then came the “tug of war.” Neither the
overseer nor the slaves had the least knowledge of
<hi rend="italics">clearing</hi> land, and that was the first thing to be done.
<pb id="steward54" n="54"/>
It was useless to consult the Captain, for he knew still
less about matters of that kind. To obviate this
difficulty, our master bought out a Mr. Cummings,
who had some cleared land on the west side of the
bay. On this he put the overseer and a part of the
slaves, and then hired a Mr. Herrington to take charge
of the remainder. Herrington and his gang of slaves
was sent to the east side to chop down the heavy
timber and clear the land for cultivation, all of which
had first to be learned, for we knew nothing of felling
trees, and the poor slaves had rather a hard time of it.</p>
        <p>Provisions were scarce and could not be procured
for cash in that section. There was no corn to be had,
and we had but little left. We had no neighbors to
assist us in this trying time, and we came near starvation. 
True, the wild, romantic region in which we
were located abounded in game,  -  elk, deer, bear,
panther, and wolves, roamed abroad through the dense
forest, in great abundance, but the business of the
slaves was not hunting or fishing, but clearing the
land, preparatory to raising crops of grain the coming
season.</p>
        <p>At last Capt. Helm chartered a boat, and manned
it to go to the mouth of the Genesee River to buy
corn. They embarked under favorable auspices, but
soon there came on such a tremendous storm, that
the boat could no longer be managed, and the crew in
despair threw themselves on the bottom of the boat to
<pb id="steward55" n="55"/>
await their inevitable destruction, when one of their
number, a colored man named Dunbar, sprang to the
helm, and with great difficulty succeeded in running her
safely into a Canadian port, where they were obliged to
part with every thing in their possession to obtain the
means to return to their families in Sodus, who had
given them up as lost. But, to the great joy of all,
they came back at last with their lives, but with
nothing for the famishing slaves. Before another
boat could be sent for our relief, we were reduced to
the last extremity. We became so weak we could not
work, and it was difficult to drag ourselves about, as we
were now obliged to do, to gather up all the old bones
we could find, break them up fine and then boil them;
which made a sort of broth sufficient barely to sustain
life. This we drank, and merely existed, until at last,
the long looked for boat returned, loaded with provisions, 
which saved us from starvation and gave us
strength to pursue our labor.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER V.</head>
        <head>INCIDENTS AT SODUS BAY.</head>
        <p>About  this time two slaves who were laboring
in the forest, instead of returning to their
cabin as was expected, got lost, and wandered eight
days in the dense forest without provision, except
what they could procure from roots and the bark of
trees. Great exertion was made to find them; guns
were fired, horns blown, and shouts raised, but all to
no purpose. Finally, we gave them up, supposing
they had starved to death or had been killed by wild
beasts. One of them was an elderly man, named
Benjamin Bristol, and the other, Edmund Watkins, a
lad of about eighteen years of age. They wandered
in an easterly direction, a distance of some sixty or
seventy miles, through an unbroken wilderness, vainly
trying to find their way home. On the eighth day, to
their inexpressible joy, they came out on the shore of
Lake Ontario, near Oswego; but young Watkins was
<pb id="steward57" n="57"/>
so completely exhausted that he declared himself
incapable of further exertion, and begged to be left to
his fate. Bristol, however, who chewed tobacco,
which it was supposed kept him from sinking so low
as his companion, took him on his back, and carried
him home, which they reached in a famished state and
reduced to skeletons. All were thankful for the preservation 
of their lives, and, with the best we could
do for them, they soon recruited and became strong
as ever.</p>
        <p>One day, two others and myself thought we saw
some animal swimming across the bay. We got a
boat and went out to see what it was. After rowing
for some time we came near enough to perceive it was
a large bear. Those who watched us from the shore
expected to see our boat upset, and all on board
drowned, but it was not so to be; the bear was struck
on the nose with a blow that killed him instantly, and
he was hauled ashore in great triumph.</p>
        <p>While these things were transpiring on the east side
of the bay, the overseer on the west side determined
to punish one of the slaves who worked on the east
side. The name of the slave was Williams; a strong,
athletic man, and generally a good workman, but he
had unfortunately offended the overseer, for which
nothing could appease his wrath but the privilege of
flogging him. The slave, however, thought as he was
no longer in Virginia, he would not submit to such
<pb id="steward58" n="58"/>
chastisement, and the overseer was obliged to content
himself with threatening what he would do if he
caught him on the west side of the bay.</p>
        <p>A short time after, the overseer called at the cabin
of one of the slaves, and was not a little surprised to
find there the refractory slave, Williams, in company
with three other men. He immediately walked up to
him and asked him some question, to which Williams
made no reply. Attended, as he always was, by his
ferocious bull-dog, he flourished his cowhide in great
wrath and demanded an instant reply, but he received 
none, whereupon he struck the slave a blow with
the cowhide. Instantly Williams sprang and caught
him by the throat and held him writhing in his viselike 
grasp, until he succeeded in getting possession of
the cowhide, with which he gave the overseer such a
flogging as slaves seldom get. Williams was seized at
once by the dog who endeavored to defend his brutal
master, but the other slaves came to the rescue, and
threw the dog into a huge fire which was near by,
from which, after a singeing, he ran off, howling worse
than his master when in the hands of Williams. He
foamed and swore and still the blows descended; then
he commanded the slaves to assist him, but as none
obeyed, he commenced begging in the most humble
manner, and at last entreated them as “gentlemen” to
spare him; but all to no purpose. When Williams
thought he had thrashed him sufficiently, he let him
<pb id="steward58a" n="58a"/>
<figure id="ill2" entity="stew58"><p>“Instantly Williams sprang and caught him by the throat and held him writhing in his vise-like grasp, until he succeeded in getting possession of the cow-hide, with which he gave the overseer such a flogging as slaves seldom got.”<lb/>page 58.</p></figure>
<pb id="steward59" n="59"/>
go and hurried to his boat and rowed down the bay, 
instead of crossing it. The overseer no sooner found
himself at liberty than he ran out, calling to a servant
girl to bring his rifle, which was loaded. The rifle
was brought, but before he could get to the bay,
Williams had gone beyond his reach; but unfortunately 
another boat was at this moment crossing the
bay, which he, mad with rage, fired into. The men in
the boat immediately cried out to him not to repeat
the shot, but he was so angry that he swore he would
shoot somebody, and sent another bullet after them.
No one was hurt, however, but the brave overseer
was vanquished. Crest-fallen and unrevenged, he
shortly after called on Capt. Helm for a settlement,
which was granted, and bidding a final adieu to the
“Genesee Country,” he departed for Virginia, where
he could beat slaves without himself receiving a cowhiding. 
No one regretted his absence, nor do I think
any but the most heartless would cordially welcome
his return to the land of Slavery.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER VI.</head>
        <head>REMOVAL FROM SODUS TO BATH.</head>
        <p>Capt. Helm went to Virginia for his family, and
returning with them, concluded to locate his
future residence in the village of Bath, Steuben
County. He purchased a large tract of land near the
village, a large grist mill, and two saw mills; also,
two farms; one called the “Maringo,” east of the
village; end the other, called “Epsam,” north of it;
and a fine house and lot in the village. He also kept
a distillery, which in those days was well patronized,
for nearly every body drank whisky; and with Capt.
Helm it was a favorite beverage.</p>
        <p>The slaves were removed to Bath, where our master
was well suited, and was everywhere noted for his
hospitality. He had a great deal of land to cultivate,
and carried on a multiplicity of business.</p>
        <p>Soon after we were settled at Bath, Capt. Helm's
eldest daughter, Jenny, was married to Mr. John
<pb id="steward61" n="61"/>
Fitzhugh, her cousin, who had come from Virginia to
claim his bride.</p>
        <p>The wedding was a splendid affair. No pains were
spared to make it more imposing than any thing that
had ever happened in that country. Never before had
the quiet village of Bath seen such splendor. All
that wealth, power and ambition could do, was done
to make the event one of great brilliancy. Europe
contributed her full proportion; Turkey, the Indias,
East and West, were heavily taxed to produce their
finest fabrics to adorn the bride and bridal guests; and
contribute delicacies to add elegance to the festal scene.
Two days previous to the wedding, the invited guests
began to arrive with their retinue of servants, and on
the evening of the marriage the large mansion was
thrown open, and there was the most magnificent
assemblage I ever beheld. In the drawing-room,
where the ceremony took place, every thing was
surpassingly elegant. Costly chandeliers shed their
light on the rich tapestry, and beautiful dresses glittering 
with diamonds, and the large mirrors everywhere
reflecting the gay concourse. While the servants
were preparing supper it was announced that the hour
had arrived for the ceremony to commence. The
bridal pair took their place in the center of the apartment. 
Pearls, diamonds, and jewelry glittered on the
bride with such luster, that it was almost painful to
the eye to look upon her.</p>
        <pb id="steward62" n="62"/>
        <p>The minister, after asking God to bless the assembled
guests, and those he was about to unite in the holy
bonds of wedlock, proceeded in a very solemn and
impressive manner with the marriage service. The
ceremony concluded, and good wishes having been
expressed over the sparkling wine, the man of
God took his leave, two hundred dollars richer than
when he came. The company were all very happy,
or appeared so; mirth reigned supreme, and every
countenance wore a smile. They were seated at tables
loaded with luxuries of every description, and while
partaking, a band of music enlivened the scene.</p>
        <p>All business was suspended for several days, the
wedding party making a tour of ten days to Niagara
Falls. After a while, however, affairs assumed their
usual aspect, and business took its regular routine.</p>
        <p>The grist mill belonging to the Captain was the
only one for many miles around, and was a source of
great profit to him; the saw mills also, were turning
out a large quantity of lumber, which was in good
demand; and the distillery kept up a <hi rend="italics">steaming</hi> business. 
It yielded, however, a handsome income to
Capt. Helm, who was now, for the first time since I
knew him, overseeing his affairs himself, dispensing
altogether with the service of a regularly installed
overseer.</p>
        <p>The oldest son of our master had been absent from
home for sometime, nor did he return to attend his
<pb id="steward63" n="63"/>
sister's grand wedding. He had sought and obtained
a commission in the United States service as a Lieutenant. 
This had been his own choice; he had
preferred the service and hardships of a soldier, to a
plantation well stocked with slaves, and the quietude
of domestic life. He had cheerfully given up his
friends and prospects as a planter, and entered the
service of his country. Frank Helm, the second son,
soon followed the example of his older brother, Lina.
He obtained a like commission, but he did not, like
his brother, get along quietly. His prospects as an
officer were soon blighted, and all hope of being
serviceable to his country vanished forever.</p>
      </div1>
      <pb id="steward64" n="64"/>
      <div1>
        <head>CHAPTER VII.</head>
        <head>DUELING.</head>
        <p>Lina Helm was an easy, good-natured, clever fellow;
but his brother Frank was his opposite in
nearly every thing; proud, fractious and unyielding.
As might be expected, Frank, soon after entering the
army, got into an “affair of honor,” according to the
duelist's code of laws. He was not, however, the
principal in the difficulty. One of his friends and a
brother officer, had a quarrel with a gentleman whom
he challenged to mortal combat. Frank was the
bearer of his friend's challenge, and on presenting it,
the gentleman refused to accept it, saying that the
challenger “was no gentleman.” Then, according to
the rules of dueling, no alternative was left for Frank,
but to take his brother officer's place, and fight. This
he did and came from the bloody field disabled for life.
In consequence of his lameness, he was under the necessity 
of resigning his commission in the army, which
<pb id="steward65" n="65"/>
he did, and came home a cripple, and nearly unfitted
for any kind of business whatever</p>
        <p>While on the subject of dueling, permit me to
record some of the incidents of another “affair of
honor,” which occurred in the District of Columbia,
between Gen. Mason and Mr. M'Carter, two antagonistic 
politicians.</p>
        <p>M'Carter offered his vote to the inspectors, and Mason 
challenged it. M'Carter offered to swear it in,
when Mason said if he did so he would perjure himself.  
This blew what appeared to be but a spark into
an angry blaze, and a duel was momentarily expected;
but their warlike propensities subsided into a newspaper 
combat, which was kept up for several weeks,
each party supposing they had the advantage of their
adversary. In this stage of the quarrel, Gen. Jackson,
with one of his aid-de-camps, Dr. Bruno, visited Washington. 
Dr. Bruno was a friend of Gen. Mason's, and
to him the General submitted the correspondence,
desiring his opinion relative to the advantage one had
obtained over the other. Dr. Bruno decided against
his friend, which probably exasperated him still more,
and the General expressed his determination to fight
his antagonist. Dr. Bruno wrote to M'Carter to come
to Washington, and he came immediately, and was as
readily waited upon by the Doctor, who inquired if he
would receive a communication from his friend, Gen.
Mason. M'Carter replied, that he “would receive no
<pb id="steward66" n="66"/>
communication from Gen. Mason, except a challenge
to fight.” The challenge was therefore sent, and
accepted, and the Doctor appointed to make the necessary 
arrangements for the duel. He proposed the
weapons to be pistols, and the distance, ten paces, to
which M'Carter objected, because he said, “the General 
was a dead shot with the pistol, while he hardly
knew how to use one.” Then it was left to M'Carter
to choose the mode of warfare. He proposed muskets
and ten paces distance. This was agreed upon, and
finally the morning arrived for the conflict, and people
began to assemble in great numbers to witness this
murderous scene.</p>
        <p>The belligerent parties unflinchingly took their
place, each with his loaded musket at his shoulder,
and gazing in each other's face, with feelings of the
most bitter hatred, while their eyes flashed vengeance.</p>
        <p>Oh! what a state of mind was this in which to
meet inevitable death? How could intelligent men,
or gentlemen, if you please so to term them, look
placidly on such a horrid scene? Was there no heart
of humanity to interfere and arrest the murderous
designs of these madmen? Alas, no!  The slave-holder's 
“code of honor” must be acknowledged,
though it outrage the laws of God and his country.</p>
        <p>Dr. Bruno asks, “Gentlemen, are you ready?” and
the duelists take their deadly aim at each other. The
signal to fire is given, and both weapons are discharged,
<pb id="steward67" n="67"/>
and when the smoke had cleared away, what a spectacle 
was there presented to the duellist and spectator?
Gen. Mason, a husband, a father, a statesman, and a
kind friend, lies bleeding, and gasping for breath.
He is no more!  Who will bear to his loving and
unsuspecting wife, the sad intelligence of her sudden
bereavement? Who will convey his lifeless body to
his late residence, and throw grief and consternation
into the bosom of his family, and drape in sadness his
whole household? And yet this painful task must be
performed. The family of General Mason remained
entirely ignorant of what was transpiring regarding
the duel, until his mangled <sic>corps</sic> was brought into his
dwelling, from which he had so recently gone forth in
all the vigor of life and manhood. And here let us
drop the curtain, nor intrude on that scene of domestic
affliction around the deserted hearth-stone of the
bereaved family of General Mason.</p>
        <p>But where is Mr. McCarter, the more fortunate party
in the duel? Hurrying away from the frightful scene,
his hands dripping with the blood of his fellow-man,
he skulks about, until an opportunity is given him to
step on board a vessel bound to a foreign port; he
leaves home, friends and country, in the vain hope of
finding peace of mind, and ridding himself of that guilt
and censure which must attach itself to a crime so
heinous as that of taking the life of another.
I can but regard the inhuman practice of dueling
as the legitimate fruit of Slavery.</p>
        <pb id="steward68" n="68"/>
        <p>Men who have been raised in the Slave States,
where, if the laws do not give them the power, they
do not restrain them from cruelly punishing every
offender with personal violence, even unto death, if
their insulted dignity seems to demand it. It is, however, 
encouraging to know that for a few years past
the practice of dueling has somewhat fallen into disrepute 
among the more humane and candid class of
community.</p>

      <div1>
        <head>CHAPTER VIII.</head>
        <head>HORSE-RACING AND GENERAL TRAINING.</head>
        <p>After the return of the wedding party, Mr. Fitzhugh
purchased a tract of land near that of
Capt. Helm, on which the newly-married couple commenced 
keeping house. They, however, became
dissatisfied with their location, and soon after sold
their possessions and returned to the South.</p>
        <p>Capt. Helm still continued to take the oversight of
his slaves, and was out every day, superintending his
business, just as his overseer used to do.</p>
        <p>About this time a man named Henry Tower came
to Bath to hire “slave boys,” as we were called.
The Captain hired to him Simon and myself, and a
Mr. Baker also hired to him one slave named Vol.
McKenzie. We three started for Dresden, Ontario
County, where we arrived in due time.</p>
        <p>Mr. Tower had just bought a tract of land, three
miles this side of the village of Lyons, on the Canandaigua 
outlet. Here Mr. Tower contemplated making
<pb id="steward70" n="70"/>
great improvements, building mills, opening stores
&amp;c. This tract of land was comparatively wild, there
being but a small frame house for a dwelling, one for
a store, and another for a blacksmith shop. Mr.
Tower had two brothers; James, the eldest, who took
charge of the store, and John, the younger, who took
charge of the hands who worked on the farm;  Henry
himself superintending the building of the mills. This
firm had a great number of men in their employ that
year. I was kept busy helping the women about the
cooking and house-work. And here, for the first time
in my life, I had a comfortable bed to sleep on, and
plenty of wholesome food to eat; which was something 
both new and strange to me.</p>
        <p>The Towers were thorough-going business-men;
they built a large grist mill, with four run of stone,
and also a distillery. In those days it was customary
for nearly all classes to drink spirituous liquors; hence,
the distilleries were sources of great pecuniary interest
to those who owned them. But having lived to see
the dreadful evils which the drinking of alcoholic
beverages have produced on community, I can hardly
speak of distilleries in the favorable light in which
they were then regarded.</p>
        <p>The Towers, with commendable enterprize, cleared
a great number of acres of land during the first year
I lived with them, besides doing a heavy business in
the mill, store and distillery.</p>
        <pb id="steward71" n="71"/>
        <p>It was customary then for men to assemble at some
public place for the purpose of drinking whisky and
racing horses.</p>
        <p>One Saturday afternoon there was to be a race, and
all was excitement. Being young, I wished to go
with the rest. I hurried through my work as fast as
possible, and then, with a trembling heart, set off in
search of my master, fearing lest he would refuse me
the simple request. But he happened to be in uncommon 
good humor, and readily gave his consent; and
away I went, “as happy as a lark.” When I reached
the race-ground, they were just preparing to run the
horses. Seeing me, they knew me to be a poor friendless 
little slave boy, helpless and unprotected, and they
could therefore do with me as they pleased, and have
some fine sport at my expense.</p>
        <p>When I was asked to ride one of the fast horses, I
felt proud of the honor conferred, and was assisted to
mount, feeling highly elated with the lofty position I
had gained.</p>
        <p>The word “go,” was shouted, and the horse whirled
off, and it seemed to me as if he flew with the speed of
lightning. My hat fell off the first thing; and there
I was, clinging with might and main to the neck of
the fiery animal, my head bare, my feet bootless, and
my old stripped shirt blown from my back, and
streaming out behind, and fluttering like a banner in
the breeze; my ragged pants off at the knees, and my
<pb id="steward72" n="72"/>
long legs dangling down some length below; and at
the same time crying “Whoa! Whoa!” as loud as I
could. Nor was this all; frightened as I was, nearly
to death, I cast a despairing look behind me, and the
loud, derisive laugh of the bystanders rung in my
ears.</p>
        <p>Ludicrous as I must have appeared, this was too
much,  -  I felt a giddiness coming over me, my brain
reeled, my hold relaxed, and the next instant I had
fallen to the ground, where all consciousness left me.
When I came to my senses I was lying in bed, surrounded 
by all the appurtenances of a dying person.</p>
        <p>The first thing I heard was Mr. Tower scolding the
men who put me on the horse, and threatening them
with a law-suit for presuming to do such a thing
without his permission. Mr. Tower considered himself
holden to Capt. Helm for my safe return, and was
therefore justly indignant at their placing my life in
such peril. It was indeed a narrow escape, for the
horse was running with all his speed when I fell. My 
bones were unbroken, however, and I suppose it must
have been the tremendous jar I got when I fell that
rendered me unconscious; nor do I think it impossible
that the fright may not have contributed somewhat to
the catastrophe.</p>
        <p>It was while I was living with that gentleman that
the greatest “general training” ever known in Western
New York, came off at “Oak's Corners,” in the town
<pb id="steward73" n="73"/>
of Phelps. It really seemed to me that the whole
world were going to the training, and I, of-course, felt
a great curiosity to go where “all creation” appeared to
be going. Mr. Tower permitted me to go, and I
started off in high spirits. When I arrived within
two or three miles of the place the road was almost
blocked up with people, and when I got to Oak's
Corners the crowd beggared all description; carriages
of all sorts were there, containing eatables of all kinds,
and tents of all dimensions were on the road-side, for
the houses could not begin to accommodate the people.
The entire brigade was to meet at that place, and Gov.
Lewis was expected to review the different companies,
and all were anxious to see the Governor, for, in those
days, it was a rare thing to see so high a dignitary in
Western New York; the eastern portion of the State
having had every thing of that kind their own way.</p>
        <p>Nor was the means and mode of traveling brought
to such perfection as now. The roads were new and
rough, and our best public conveyances only the slow
lumbering, stage-coach; yet, notwithstanding these
inconveniences, there was an innumerable crowd
gathered at that place. I spent the day in walking
about the encampment, and seeing what was to be
seen, for it was all new to me.</p>
        <p>Officers were riding over the ground, dressed in
uniform, and mounted on their splendid steeds; their
plumes waving over their cocked-hats in true military
<pb id="steward74" n="74"/>
array. A band of music, as is usual, accompanied the
soldiers. There was also a “sham-fight,” before the
breaking up of the encampment, and it was really terrifying 
to me, who had never seen a battle fought, to
witness two columns of troops drawn up, and, at the
roll of the drum, behold them engage in deadly conflict, 
to all appearance, and the smoke curling up in
a blackened mass toward heaven; and, above all, the
neighing of horses, with the feigned groans of the
wounded and dying. I inwardly prayed to God that
those men might ever draw their weapons in a feigned
encounter.</p>
        <p>The first night I spent at the encampment was one
long to be remembered; it was like the confusion of
Babel. Of all the hideous noises I ever heard
none could exceed those made there that night. They
fired guns, quarreled, drank, and swore, till day light.
There was such a crowd at the tavern that I did not
suppose I could get a bed, so I threw myself down
upon a door-step, and began to compose myself to
sleep, when a man came and wakened me, inquiring
at the same time whose boy I was. I replied that I
lived with Mr. Tower. “Follow me,” said he; I
arose and followed him into the house, where he procured 
for me a bed, to be shared with another “boy,”
who had already occupied it.</p>
        <p>I had just began to dose, when the explosion of firearms 
startled all in the house. The keeper of the
<pb id="steward75" n="75"/>
tavern ran up stairs in great alarm, and when an examination 
was made, we found that a drunken fellow
had discharged his musket in the room below the one
where we were sleeping, and that the ball had passed
up through the second floor and completely through
the bed on which I slept, to the roof, where, having
passed through that also, rolled from thence to the
ground! And yet, strange as it may appear, no one
was injured, though the house was filled to overflowing 
with guests.</p>
        <p>There were groups of disorderly and drunken men
continually roaming over the camp-ground at night,
who seemed to have no other object than to annoy
others, and torment any one they might find sleeping,
by shaking them, or, if soundly asleep, dragging them
out of their beds by their feet. Among these thus
annoyed by them was a physician from Canandaigua.
Being a passionate man, they seemed to think it fine
sport to arouse him from sleep and hear him scold.
The first time they dragged him from his tent he
merely remonstrated in a very gentlemanly manner,
and quietly crept back again. The rowdies were disappointed; 
they had expected a “scene.” As soon as
he was asleep they attacked him again, dragging him
out by the heels; then he was angry, and told them
if they repeated the offence it would be at the peril of
their lives, and a third time retired to his tent; but a
third party soon came, and one, more bold than the

rest, entered the tent and laid hold of the Doctor. He
sprang to his feet and drew his sword, which he ran
through the body of a man supposed to be that of his
tormentor; but oh! what sorrow and consternation possessed 
him when he found he had taken the life of a
quiet, unoffending person who happened to be standing
by, attracted to the spot probably by the noise of the
revelers. The unhappy Doctor was obliged to flee from
his country for a time, but after a while the shadows
which had so suddenly fallen on his fair prospects
were cleared away, and he returned to his home
and country.</p>
        <p>The second day of the encampment was one of surpassing 
beauty. The sun shone in all its softened
radiance on that vast concourse of human beings.
The field presented a spectacle which must have been
imposing to those of more experienced vision than
mine; but to me, in my ignorant simplicity, it was
superbly grand; <sic>facinating</sic> beyond my power of resistance, 
and made an impression on my mind never to
be effaced.</p>
        <p>The brigade was drawn up in a line, each colonel
stationed just so many paces in front of the line, and
all the other officers, such as majors, quarter-masters,
 &amp;c., were stationed at an equal distance in the rear.
When all were paraded, the Governor of the State
made his appearance, dressed in full uniform, his hat
being one of the Bonaparte style, attended by his
<pb id="steward77" n="77"/>
aid-de-camp, who was dressed much in the same manner 
as his Excellency Governor Lewis, who, after the
salute, took his place at the head of the brigade, and
the military exercises commenced. When the Governor 
issued his orders, they were first given to his aid,
who passed them to the officers, and they gave the
word of command to the soldiers; for instance if the
Governor wished the brigade to “shoulder arms,”  -  
the order went to the officer who commanded the first
regiment, and he repeated the order, and was obeyed;
then the same order passed to the next, and so on,
until the whole brigade had complied with the order
of his Excellency.</p>
        <p>But this, I believe, was the first and last time that
the military were ever called out on so large a scale,
in the State of New York. It was supposed that the
effect would be decidedly injurious to a community
and the idea was abandoned. Young men were so liable
to be fascinated by the magnificent spectacle, that not
the rabble only were attracted by the “trappings of
war,” but they have a tendency to induce young, and
<hi rend="italics">old men even,</hi> of fair prospects, to neglect <hi rend="italics">their agricultural interests</hi> for military pursuits, which, in a new
country, were certainly of paramount importance, if
not the greater of the two.</p>
        <p>I know that it became very hard for me to content
myself to labor as I had done, after witnessing this
grand display. I was completely intoxicated with a
<pb id="steward78" n="78"/>
military spirit, and sighed for the liberty to go out
“on the lines” and fight the British.</p>
        <p>The martial music, the waving plumes, and magnificent 
uniform, had driven from my mind entirely the
bloodshed and carnage of the battle field; beside, I was
sick and tired of being a slave, and felt ready to do
almost any thing to get where I could act and feel like
a free man.</p>
        <p>I became acquainted with a Mr. McClure, a merchant 
in Bath, who, while on a journey to Philadelphia, 
to purchase goods, was taken suddenly ill and
died; when his brother, George McClure, came on to
attend to his diseased brother's business. He was a
fine, persevering kind of man, and very soon got to be
General McClure, and commanded the brigade in
Steuben County, and, as such, was liable to be called
at any time when his services were required, to go to
the frontier and guard our lines from the invasion of
the English army.</p>
        <p>To him I applied for a situation as waiter, which he
readily agreed to give me if I could get the consent of
Captain Helm. I thought there would be no trouble
about that; and oh! how I dreamed of and anticipated
the happiness of being <hi rend="italics">something</hi> beside a slave, for a
<hi rend="italics">little while at least.</hi> Almost every day I went to the
store to talk to Gen. McClure of this greatest happiness
imaginable, “going to the lines!” and was impatient
for the chance to arrive that would send me there.</p>
        <pb id="steward79" n="79"/>
        <p>At last Gen. McClure wrote to Gen. Armstrong, to
say that he was ready to obey any order that he might
send him, and march to “the lines,” if his services
were needed; and, to <hi rend="italics">my</hi> inexpressible joy, marching
orders were returned. I nearly flew in search of Capt.
Helm, never once suspecting that he would object;
because I knew that he did not then require my services
himself, and the pay would be quite as good as he had
been receiving for my time; besides I had so completely 
set my heart on going, that it was impossible
for me to dream of a disappointment so bitter as that
of being denied going “to the lines.”</p>
        <p>Oh! how then were my high hopes fallen, and how
much more hateful appeared that slavery which had
blighted all my military prospects? Nor was Capt.
Helm's heartless and mercenary reply to my humble
pleading any antidote to my disappointed feelings and
desire for freedom. He said, “you shall not go; I
will permit nothing of the kind, so let there be an end
to it. The <hi rend="italics">pay</hi> is all well enough, I know, but if you
get killed your wages will stop; and then who, do
you suppose, will indemnify me for the loss? Go
about your business, and let me hear no more of such
nonsense!”</p>
        <p>There was an emergency I had not provided for;
and, as I then believed, the master could make no
demand on or for the slaves beyond the grave, I was
silent; but both master and myself were mistaken on
<pb id="steward80" n="80"/>
that point; for I have since learned numerous instances
where slaves have fought and died in the service of
their master's country, and the slave-owner received
his wages up to the hour of his death, and then
recovered of the United States the full value of his
person as property!</p>
        <p>Gen. McClure left soon after for the frontier; my
saddened heart followed him, and that was all; my
body was in slavery still, and painful though it was,
I must quietly submit.</p>
        <p>The General, however, reaped but few if any
laurels in that campaign; he burned the small village
of Newark, in Canada, for which he got very little
credit on either side of the lake; so I comforted myself 
as well as I could with the reflection, that all who
“went to the wars” did not return covered with glory
and laurels of victory.</p>
        <p>I continued to live with the Towers; and in the
fall of that year, I had the misfortune to cut my foot
badly. While chopping fire wood at the door, I accidentally 
struck my ax against a post, which glanced
the blow in such a manner that it came down with
sufficient force to nearly sever my great toe from
my left foot, gashing upward completely through
the large joint, which made a terrible wound. Dr.
Taylor was immediately called, and sewed the flesh
together, taking two stitches on the upper, and one
on the under, side of the foot, before it began to swell;
<pb id="steward81" n="81"/>
but when the swelling came on, the stitches on the
upper side gave way, which occasioned the toe to fall
over so much, that I have been slightly lame from
that day to this. For several weeks I was unable to
be moved, and was regularly attended by Dr. Taylor,
but as soon as it could be done without danger, I was
taken back to Capt. Helm's, where I found things in
much the same condition as when I left them over
a year before.</p>
        <p>On leaving the family of Mr. Tower, I endeavored
to express to them as well in my power the gratitude
I felt for their kindness, and the attention I had received 
during my lameness.</p>
        <p>We returned to Bath in a sleigh, and arrived without 
accident or any great suffering. But the kind
treatment I had always received from the Messrs.
Tower and family, made it very hard for me to
reconcile myself to my former mode of living;
especially now that I was lame and weak, from sickness 
and long confinement; besides, it was cold
weather. Oh! how hard it did seem to me, after
having a good bed and plenty of bed clothes every
night for so long time, to now throw myself down,
like a dog, on the “<hi rend="italics">softest side</hi>” of a rough board, without 
a pillow, and without a particle of bedding to
cover me during the long cold nights of winter. To
be reduced from a plentiful supply of good, wholesome 
food, to the mere pittance which the Captain
allowed his slaves, seemed to me beyond endurance.
<pb id="steward82" n="82"/> 
And yet I had always lived and fared thus, but I
never felt so bitterly these hardships and the cruelties
of Slavery as I did at that time; making a virtue of
necessity, however, I turned my thoughts in another
direction.</p>
        <p>I managed to purchase a spelling book, and set
about teaching myself to read, as best I could. Every
spare moment I could find was devoted to that employment, 
and when about my work I could catch
now and then a stolen glance at my book, just to
refresh my memory with the simple lesson I was
trying to learn. But here Slavery showed its cloven
foot in all its hideous deformity. It finally reached the
ears of my master that I was learning to read; and then,
if he saw me with a book or a paper in my hand, oh,
how he would swear at me, sending me off in a hurry,
about some employment. Still I persevered, but was
more careful about being seen making any attempt to
learn to read. At last, however, I was discovered,
and had to pay the penalty of my determination.</p>
        <p>I had been set to work in the sugar bush, and I
took my spelling book with me. When a spare
moment occurred I sat down to study, and so absorbed
was I in the attempt to blunder through my lesson,
that I did not hear the Captain's son-in-law coming
until he was fairly upon me. He sprang forward,
caught my poor old spelling book, and threw it into
the fire, where it was burned to ashes; and then came
<pb id="steward83" n="83"/>
my turn. He gave me first a severe flogging, and
then swore if he ever caught me with another book,
he would “whip every inch of skin off my back,” &amp;c. </p>
        <p>This treatment, however, instead of giving me the
least idea of giving it up, only made me look upon it
as a more valuable attainment. Else, why should my
oppressors feel so unwilling that their slaves should
possess that which they thought so essential to
themselves? Even then, with my back bleeding and
smarting from the punishment I had received, I
determined to learn to read and write, at all hazards,
if my life was only spared. About this time Capt.
Helm began to sell off his slaves to different persons, 
as he could find opportunity, and sometimes
at a great sacrifice. It became apparent that the
Captain, instead of prospering in business, was getting
poorer every day.</p>
      </div1>
      <pb id="steward84" n="84"/>
      <div1>
        <head>CHAPTER IX.</head>
        <head>DEATH BED AND BRIDAL SCENES.</head>
        <p>Neither Capt. Helm nor his wife made any
religious pretensions. I hardly know whether
or not they were avowed infidels; but they alike
ridiculed all religious professions and possessed some
very singular notions regarding life and death.</p>
        <p>I have often heard the Captain say, that no person
need die unless they choose to do so; and his wife
was of the same belief. I have frequently heard her
remark that if mankind would firmly resist death it
would flee from them.</p>
        <p>An opportunity, however, was soon after given to
test the truth of this strange dogma. Mrs. Helm's
health began to decline, but she would pay no attention 
to it, following her usual course and regular
routine of household duties; but all in vain; she was
taken down, alarmingly ill, and it became apparent to
all, that the “king of terrors” had chosen his victim.
<pb id="steward84a" n="84a"/>
<figure id="ill3" entity="stew85"><p>“If any one had ever envied Mrs. Helm in her drawing-room, richly attired and sparkling with jewels, or as she moved with the stately step of a queen among her trembling slaves, they should have beheld her on her death-bed!” page 85.</p></figure>
<pb id="steward85" n="85"/>
She tried with all her natural energy of character, to
baffle his pursuit and escape his steady approach, but 
all to no purpose. “The valley and the shadow of 
death” were before her, and she had no assurance that
the “rod and staff ” of the Almighty would sustain
and comfort her through the dark passage. She
shrank with perfect horror from the untried scenes of
the future.</p>
        <p>If any one had ever envied Mrs. Helm in her
drawing-room, richly attired and sparkling with jewels,
or as she moved with the stately step of a queen
among her trembling slaves, they should have beheld
her on her death bed! They should have listened to
her groans and cries for help, while one piercing
shriek after another rang through the princely mansion 
of which she had been the absolute mistress!</p>
        <p>Surrounded as she was with every elegance and
luxury that wealth could procure, she lay shrieking
out her prayers for a short respite, a short lengthening
out of the life she had spent so unprofitably; her eyes
wandering restlessly about the apartment, and her
hands continually clinching the air, as if to grasp
something that would prevent her from sinking into
the embrace of death! There was not a slave present,
who would have exchanged places with her. Not
one of those over whom she had ruled so arbitrarily
would have exchanged their rough, lowly cabin and
quiet conscience, for all the wealth and power she had
ever possessed.</p>
        <pb id="steward86" n="86"/>
        <p>Nothing of all she had enjoyed in life, nor all that
she yet called her own, could give her one hour of life
or one peaceful moment in death!</p>
        <p>Oh! what a scene was that! The wind blew, and 
great drops of rain fell on the casements. The room 
lighted only with a single taper; the wretched wife
mingles her dying groans with the howling of the
storm, until, as the clock struck the hour of midnight
she fell back upon her pillow and expired, amid the
tears and cries of her family and friends, who not only
deplored the loss of a wife and mother, but were
grieved by the manner in which she died.</p>
        <p>The slaves were all deeply affected by the scene;
some doubtless truly lamented the death of their
mistress; others rejoiced that she was no more, and all
were more or less frightened. One of them I remember 
went to the pump and wet his face, so as to appear
to weep with the rest.</p>
        <p>What a field was opened for reflection, by the
agonizing death of Mrs. Helm? Born and reared in
affluence; well educated and highly accomplished,
possessed of every means to become a useful woman
and an ornament to her sex; which she most likely
would have been, had she been instructed in the
Christian religion, and had lived under a different
influence. As infidelity ever deteriorates from the
female character, so Slavery transforms more than one,
otherwise excellent woman, into a feminine monster.
<pb id="steward87" n="87"/>
Of Mrs. Helm, with her active intellect and great
force of character, it made a tyrannical demon. Her
race, however is ended; her sun gone down in darkness, 
and her soul we must leave in the keeping of a
righteous God, to whom we must all give an account
for the deeds done in the body. But in view of the
transitory pleasures of this life; the unsatisfactory
realization of wealth, and the certainty of death, we
may well inquire, “What shall it profit a man to gain
the whole world and lose his own soul?”</p>
        <p>Some little time after the scene just recorded, there
came to Bath a young physician named Henry, who
commenced practice under very flattering prospects.
He was an accomplished young man, well educated
and very skillful in his profession. He was affable
and gay in his manners, and very fond of company.
An intimate acquaintance was soon formed with
Capt. Helm and family, and he called almost daily to
chat and drink wine with the Captain,  -  both being
quite fond of a social glass.</p>
        <p>One night in the depth of winter, the Doctor was
called to see a patient who lived six miles down the
Conhocton river. Previous, however, to the call, he
had accepted an invitation to attend a party at Capt.
Helm's, and there he was found. They had music and
dancing, while the wine passed around very freely.
None seemed to join in the dance and other amusements 
of the evening with more enjoyment than did
<pb id="steward88" n="88"/>
Dr. Henry; but after he was sent for, it being a most
bitter cold night, he asked the Captain for a horse to
ride to see his patient, to which he readily assented,
and had his fine <hi rend="italics">race-horse</hi> (for the Captain had not left
off all his old habits), brought out from the stable, and
the Doctor sprang lightly into the saddle. Unfortunately 
his way led by the race-course, and when the
trained animal came to it he started with such speed
as to throw the Doctor to the ground, where he lay
all that terrible cold night. In the morning, some
person going after wood, came in sight of the Doctor
as he was trying to creep away on his frozen hands
and feet. He was put into the sleigh and taken to the
village with all possible speed. All was done for him
that could be, but his feet and legs were frozen solid.
His uncle, Dr. Henry, was brought as soon as possible,
who decided that nothing could save his life but the
amputation of both legs, just below the knee. This
was done; but what a change in the prospects of this
promising young man! Instead of stepping lightly
about as he used to do, with a smiling countenance,
he at last came forth after a tedious confinement, a
cripple for life, hobbling about on his knees, sad and
dejected. And what, think you, was the cause of
this terrible calamity? What prevented the Doctor
from an exertion to save his life? Wine, intoxicating
wine, was undoubtedly the occasion of the heedless
and reckless conduct of both himself and Capt. Helm.
<pb id="steward89" n="89"/>
And should not this circumstance be a warning to
parents and guardians, to young men and children, “to
look not upon the wine when it is red,” and remember
that at last “it will bite like a serpent and sting like an
adder?” Should it not also remind those who have
guests to entertain, of the sinfulness of putting the
cup to their neighbor's lips? Certainly it should. But
I must resume my story.</p>
        <p>About this time Major Thornton of Bath, died. He
had long been an intimate friend and acquaintance of
Capt. Helm, and as the reader is already informed of
the death of Mrs. Helm, they will not be surprised to
know that he began to look earnestly after the widow
of his late friend. It become apparent that his solicitude 
for the loneliness of Madam Thornton was not so
much as a disconsolate widow, as that of making her
the future Mrs. Helm; nor was it less observable that
the new-made widow accepted the Captain's attentions 
with great favor, and more as a lover than
comforter.</p>
        <p>The result was, after the Major had been dead six
weeks, Capt. Helm was married to his widow, and
brought her and her servants in great triumph to his
house, giving her the charge of it. His own servants
were discharged, and hers took their places.</p>
        <p>All went on pleasantly for a while; then the slaves
began to grow sullen and discontented; and two of
them ran away. Capt. Helm started a man named
<pb id="steward90" n="90"/>
Morrison, a Scotchman, in pursuit, who hunted them
ten days, and then returned without any tidings of
the absconding slaves. They made good their escape
and were never heard from afterwards, by those whose
interest suffered by the loss.</p>
        <p>I was one afternoon at a neighbor's house in the
village, when I was suddenly taken so violently ill
with pain in my head and side, that I had to be carried
home. When we arrived there, I was allowed a
pallet of straw to lie on, which was better than
nothing. Day after day, my disease increased in
violence, and my master employed a physician to
attend me through my illness, which brought me very
low indeed. I was constantly burning with fever,
and so thirsty that I knew not what I would have
given for a draught of cold water, which was denied
me by the physician's direction. I daily grew weaker
until I was reduced to helplessness, and was little else
than “skin and bones.” I really thought my time had
come to die; and when I had strength to talk, I tried
to arrange the few little business affairs I had, and
give my father direction concerning them. And then
I began to examine my own condition before God.
and to determine how the case stood between Him and
my poor soul. And “there was the rub.” I had
often excused myself, for frequent derelictions in duty,
and often wild and passionate outbreaks, on account
of the hardness of my lot, and the injustice with
<pb id="steward91" n="91"/>
which I was treated, even in my best endeavors to do
as well as I knew how. But now, with death staring
me in the face, I could see that though I was a friendless 
“slave-boy,” I had <hi rend="italics">not</hi> always done as well as I
knew how; that I had <hi rend="italics">not</hi> served God as I knew I
ought, nor had I always set a good example before my
fellow-slaves, nor warned them as well as I might, “to
flee the wrath to come.” Then I prayed my Heavenly
Father to spare me a little longer, that I might
serve Him better; and in His mercy and gracious
goodness, He did so; though when the fever was
turning they gave me up; and I could hear them say,
when they came to feel my pulse, “he is almost gone,”
“it will soon be over,<sic>’</sic> &amp;c., and then inquire if I
knew them. I did, but was too weak to say so. I
recollect with gratitude, the kindness of Mrs. H. A.
Townsend, who sent me many delicacies and cooling
drinks to soften the rigor of my disease; and though
I suppose she has long since “passed away” and gone
to her reward, may the blessing of those who are
ready to perish, rest upon the descendants of that
excellent woman.</p>
        <p>Capt. Helm was driving on in his milling, distillery
and farming business. He now began to see the
necessity of treating his slaves better by far than he
had ever done before, and granted them greater
privileges than he would have dared to do at the
South. Many of the slaves he had sold, were getting
their liberty and doing well.</p>

      <pb id="steward92" n="92"/>
      <div1>
        <head>CHAPTER X.</head>
        <head>HIRED OUT TO A NEW MASTER.</head>
        <p>While I was staying with my master at Bath, he 
having little necessity for my services, hired me
out to a man by the name of Joseph Robinson, for
the purpose of learning me to drive a team.  Robinson 
lived about three miles from the village of Bath, on a 
small farm, and was not only a poor man but a very 
mean one. He was cross and heartless in his family, 
as well as tyrannical and cruel to those in his employ; 
and having hired me as a “slave boy,” he appeared 
to feel at full liberty to wreak his brutal passion on
me at any time, whether I deserved rebuke or not; 
nor did his terrible outbreaks of anger vent themselves 
in oaths, curses and threatening only, but he 
would frequently draw from the cart-tongue a heavy 
iron pin, and beat me over the head with it, so unmercifully 
that he frequently sent the blood flowing over 
my scanty apparel, and from that to the ground, 
before he could feel satisfied.</p>
        <pb id="steward93" n="93"/>
        <p>These kind of beatings were not only excessively
painful, but they always reminded me of the blows 
I had so often received from the key, in the hand of
Mrs. Helm, when I was but a little waiter lad; and in
truth I must say that the effect of these heavy blows
on the head, have followed me thus far through life;
subjecting me to frequent and violent head-aches, from
which I never expect to be entirely free. Even to 
this day I shudder at the thought, when I think how
Robinson used to fly at me, swearing, foaming, and
seeming to think there was no weapon too large or
too heavy to strike me with.</p>
        <p>He and I were at one time logging with a yoke of
oxen, which it was my business to drive. At that time
rattle-snakes were numerous, and a great terror to
the inhabitants. To be bitten by one of these
poisonous reptiles was certain and almost instant
death; hence, the greatest caution and constant vigilance 
was necessary to avoid them while at work. I 
had been sent with the oxen to draw a log to the pile, 
and when I came up to it, I observed that it appeared 
to be hollow; but stepping forward, with the chain in 
my hand, ready to attach it to the log, when, oh, horror! 
the warning rattle of a snake sounded like a 
death knell in my ears, proceeding from the log I was 
about to lay hold of. I was so much frightened by 
the sound, that I dropped the chain as though it were 
red hot, left my team, and ran with all the speed in
<pb id="steward94" n="94"/>
my power, screaming “murder, murder!” as loud as I 
could.</p>
        <p>This proceeding, which was the fearful impulse of
the moment, offended Robinson, and gave him another 
opportunity to beat me most cruelly. He was himself 
as much afraid of rattle-snakes as I; but he
was the master and I the “slave boy,” which made a
vast difference. He caught hold of me, and, with
horrid oaths, beat me with his fist again and again;
threatening me with awful punishment if I did not
instantly return and bring the log to the desired spot. I
never can forget the mortal agony I was in, while
compelled by his kicks and blows to return and fasten
the chain around the log containing the deadly
serpent. I, however, succeeded with trembling hands,
and drove the oxen, but keeping myself at the <sic>fartherest</sic> possible distance from them and the log.
When I finally arrived at the pile, Mr. Robinson and
some other men, cut a hole with an ax in the log, and
killed the large, venomous rattle-snake that had occasioned 
me so much alarm and such a cruel beating. 
Nor was the <sic>uncontrolable</sic> and brutal passion of Robinson 
his only deficiency; he was mean as he was
brutal.</p>
        <p>He had, at one time, borrowed a wagon of a neighbor 
living two miles distant, through a dense forest. 
On the day of the total eclipse of the sun, it entered 
his head that it would be fine sport, knowing
<pb id="steward95" n="95"/>
my ignorance and superstition, to send me, just as 
the darkness was coming on, to return the borrowed
wagon. I accordingly hitched the ox-team to it and
started. As I proceeded through the wood, I saw,
with astonishment and some alarm, that it was growing 
very dark, and thought it singular at that hour of 
the day. When I reached the place of my destination 
it was almost total darkness, and some persons, ignorant 
as myself, were running about, wringing their 
hands, and declaring that they believed the Day of 
Judgment had come, and such like expressions.</p>
        <p>The effect of all this was, however, very different
from what my master had expected. I thought, 
of course, if the judgment day had come, I should 
be no longer a slave in the power of a heartless 
tyrant. I recollect well of thinking, that if indeed all 
things earthly were coming to an end, I should be 
free from Robinson's brutal force, and as to meeting 
my Creator, I felt far less dread of that than of meeting 
my cross, unmerciful master. I felt that, sinful as 
I had been, and unworthy as I was, I should be far
better off than I then was; driven to labor all day,
without compensation; half starved and poorly clad,
and above all, subjected to the whims and caprices of
any heartless tyrant to whom my master might give
the power to rule over me. But I had not much time
for reflection, I hurried home; my mind filled with the
calm anticipation that the end of all things was at
<pb id="steward96" n="96"/>
hand; which greatly disappointed my expectant master, 
who was looking for me to return in a great fright, 
making some very ludicrous demonstration of fear and 
alarm. But after a few months more of hardship I 
was permitted to return to Capt. Helm's, where I was 
treated much better than at Robinson's, and much 
better than the Captain used to treat his slaves.</p>
        <p>Capt. Helm, not having demand for slave labor as 
much as formerly, was in the practice of hiring out 
his slaves to different persons, both in and out of the 
village; and among others, my only sister was hired 
out to a <hi rend="italics">professed</hi> gentleman living in Bath. She had 
become the mother of two or three children, and was 
considered a good servant.</p>
        <p>One pleasant Sabbath morning, as I was passing the
house where she lived, on my way to the Presbyterian
church, where I was sent to ring the bell as usual, I 
heard the most piteous cries and earnest pleadings 
issuing from the dwelling. To my horror and the 
astonishment of those with me, my poor sister made her 
appearance, weeping bitterly, and followed by her 
inhuman master, who was polluting the air of that 
clear Sabbath morning, with the most horrid imprecations 
and threatenings, and at the same time flourishing 
a large raw-hide. Very soon his bottled wrath 
burst forth, and the blows, aimed with all his strength,
descended upon the unprotected head, shoulders and 
back of the helpless woman, until she was literally cut
<pb id="steward97" n="97"/>
to pieces. She writhed in his powerful grasp, while 
shriek after shriek cried away in heart-rending moanings; 
and yet the inhuman demon continued to beat 
her, though her pleading cries had ceased, until
obliged to desist from the exhaustion of his own 
strength.</p>
        <p>What a spectacle was that, for the sight of a brother?  
The God of heaven only knows the conflict of 
feeling I then endured; He alone witnessed the tumult 
of my heart, at this outrage of manhood and kindred 
affection. God knows that my will was good enough 
to have wrung his neck; or to have drained from 
his heartless system its last drop of blood!  And yet I 
was obliged to turn a deaf ear to her cries for assistance, 
which to this day ring in my ears. Strong and 
athletic as I was, no hand of mine could be raised in 
her defence, but at the peril of both our lives;  -  nor
could her husband, had he been a witness of the scene, 
be allowed any thing more than unresisting submission 
to any cruelty, any indignity which the master 
saw fit to inflict on <hi rend="italics">his wife,</hi> but the other's <hi rend="italics">slave.</hi></p>
        <p>Does any indignant reader feel that I was wanting 
in courage or brotherly affection, and say that he 
would have interfered, and, at all hazards, rescued his 
sister from the power of her master; let him remember 
that he is a <hi rend="italics">freeman</hi>; that he has not from his 
infancy been taught to cower beneath the white man's 
frown, and bow at his bidding, or suffer all the rigor 
<pb id="steward98" n="98"/>
of the slave laws. Had the gentlemanly woman-whipper 
been seen beating his horse, or his ox, in the 
manner he beat my poor sister, and that too for no
fault which the law could recognize as an offence, he 
would have been complained of most likely; but as it 
was, she was but a “slave girl,”  -  with whom the 
slave law allowed her master to do what he pleased.</p>
        <p>Well, I finally passed on, with a clinched fist and
contracted brow, to the church, and rung the bell, 
I think rather furiously, to notify the inhabitants of
Bath, that it was time to assemble for the worship of
that God who has declared himself to be “no respecter 
of persons.”  With my own heart beating wildly 
with indignation and sorrow, the kind reader may 
imagine my feelings when I saw the smooth-faced 
hypocrite, the inhuman slave-whipper, enter the church, 
pass quietly on to his accustomed seat, and then 
meekly bow his hypocritical face on the damask
cushion, in the reverent acknowledgment of that religion 
which teaches its adherents “to do unto others
as they would be done by,” just as if nothing
unusual had happened on that Sabbath morning. 
Can any one wonder that I, and other slaves, often
doubted the sincerity of every white man's religion?
Can it be a matter of astonishment, that slaves often
feel that there is no just God for the poor African?
Nay, verily; and were it not for the comforting and
sustaining influence that these poor, illiterate and suffering    
<pb id="steward99" n="99"/>
creatures feel as coming from an unearthly 
source, they would in their ignorance all become infidels. 
To me, that beautiful Sabbath morning 
was clouded in midnight darkness, and I retired to ponder 
on what could be done.</p>
        <p>For some reason or other, Capt. Helm had supplied 
every lawyer in that section of country with slaves, 
either by purchase or hire; so when I thought of seeking 
legal redress for my poor, mangled sister, I saw at 
once it would be all in vain. The laws were in favor 
of the slave owner, and besides, every legal gentleman 
in the village had one or more of the Captain's slaves, 
who were treated with more or less rigor; and of course 
they would do nothing toward censuring one of their 
own number, so nothing could be done to give the 
slave even the few privileges which the laws of the 
State allowed them.</p>
        <p>The Captain sold my aunt Betsy Bristol to a distinguished 
lawyer in the village, retaining her husband,
Aaron Bristol, in his own employ; and two of her 
children he sold to another legal gentleman named 
Cruger. One day Captain Helm came out where 
the slaves were at work, and finding Aaron was not 
there, he fell into a great rage and swore terribly. He 
finally started off to a beach tree, from which he cut 
a stout limb, and trimmed it so as to leave a knot on 
the but end of the stick, or bludgeon rather, which 
was about two and a half feet in length. With this
<pb id="steward100" n="100"/> 
formidable weapon he started for Aaron's lonely cabin. 
When the solitary husband saw him coming he suspected 
that he was angry, and went forth to meet him 
in the street. They had no sooner met than my master 
seized Aaron by the collar, and taking the limb he 
had prepared by the smaller end, commenced beating 
him with it, over the head and face, and struck him 
some thirty or more terrible blows in quick succession; 
after which Aaron begged to know for what he was
so unmercifully flogged.</p>
        <p>“Because you deserve it,” was the angry reply. 
Aaron said that he had ever endeavored to discharge
his duty, and had done so to the best of his ability;
and that he thought it very hard to be treated in that
manner for no offence at all. Capt. Helm was astonished 
at his audacity; but the reader will perceive 
that the slaves were not blind to the political condition 
of the country, and were beginning to feel that they 
had some rights, and meant to claim them.</p>
        <p>Poor Aaron's face and head, however, was left in a
pitiable condition after such a <sic>pummelling</sic> with a
knotty stick. His face, covered with blood, was so
swollen that he could hardly see for some time; but
what of that? Did he not belong to Capt. Helm, soul
and body; and if his brutal owner chose to destroy his
own property, certainly had he not a right to do so,
without let or hindrance? Of course; such is the
power that Slavery gives one human being over
another.</p>
        <pb id="steward101" n="101"/>
        <p>And yet it must be confessed that among the poor, 
degraded and ignorant slaves there exists a foolish 
pride, which loves to boast of their master's  wealth 
and influence.  A white person, too poor to own 
slaves, is as often looked upon with as much disdain 
by the miserable slave as by his wealthy owner.  
This disposition seems to be instilled into the mind of 
every slave at the South, and indeed, I have heard 
slaves object to being sent in very small companies to
labor in the field, lest that some passer-by should
think that they belonged to a poor man, who was
unable to keep a large gang. Nor is this ridiculous 
sentiment maintained by the slaves only; the rich
planter feels such a contempt for all white persons 
without slaves, that he does not want them for his
neighbors. I know of many instances where such
persons have been under the necessity of buying or
hiring slaves, just to preserve their reputation and 
keep up appearances; and even among a class of people 
who profess to be opposed to Slavery, have I 
known instances of the same kind, and have heard 
them apologize for their conduct by saying that 
“when in Rome, we must do as the Romans do.”</p>
        <p>Uncle Aaron Bristol was one of Capt. Helm's slaves 
who lad a large amount of this miserable pride; and
for him to be associated with a white man in the same
humble occupation, seemed to give him ideas of great 
superiority, and full liberty to treat him with all the
<pb id="steward102" n="102"/>
scorn and sarcasm he was capable of, in which my 
uncle was by no means deficient.</p>
        <p>At this time the Captain owned a fine and valuable
horse, by the name of <hi rend="italics">Speculator.</hi> This horse, 
groomed by uncle Aaron, stood sometimes at Bath 
and sometimes at Geneva; and at the latter village 
another horse was kept, groomed by a white man. 
The white groom was not very well pleased with 
Aaron's continual disparagement of the clumsy animal 
which my uncle called “a great, awkward plow-horse;” 
and then he would fling out some of his 
proud nonsense about “<hi rend="italics">poor white people</hi> who were 
obliged to groom their own old dumpy horses,” &amp;c.</p>
        <p>Well, things went on in this unpleasant manner for
several weeks, when at last the white groom and 
Aaron met at Geneva, and the horse belonging to the 
former, designedly or accidentally, escaped from his 
keeper, and came with full speed, with his mouth 
wide open, after Speculator. When the fiery fellow 
had overtaken uncle Aaron he attempted to grasp the 
wethers of Speculator with his teeth, instead of which 
he caught Aaron on the inside of his thigh, near the 
groin, from whence he bit a large piece of flesh, laying 
the bone entirely bare; at the same moment flinging 
Aaron to the ground, some rods off; and the next 
instant he kicked Speculator down a steep embankment. 
Aaron was taken up for dead, and Dr. Henry
sent for, who dressed his wounds; and after several
<pb id="steward103" n="103"/>
mouths' confinement he finally recovered. It is probable 
that the biting and overthrow of Aaron saved 
his life, as he must have otherwise been killed in the 
encounter of the two horses.</p>
        <p>A while after his recovery, uncle Aaron succeeded 
in procuring a team and some kind of vehicle, in 
which he put his wife and children, and between two 
days, took “French leave” of his master as well as of 
the lawyer to whom his wife belonged.</p>
        <p>The lawyer, however, was far from being pleased 
when he missed his property, and immediately set his 
wits to work to reclaim her. All was kept secret as 
possible, but it was whispered about that it was to be 
done by a State's warrant, for removing the clothing 
and furniture they had taken, and so, being thus 
arrested, “Madam Bristol” would be glad to return to 
her work in the lawyer's kitchen. But Aaron was a 
smart, shrewd man, and kept out of their reach, where
he soon found friends and employment, and could go 
where he pleased, without having an infuriated master 
to beat and disfigure him with a knotted stick, until
his clothes were bespattered with blood. They appreciated 
their liberty, and lived and died in peace and 
freedom.</p>
        <p>Capt. Helm continued his old manner of treating 
slaves, dealing out their weekly allowance of corn or 
meal; but living as we now did, so much more intimately 
with white inhabitants, our condition was materially    
<pb id="steward104" n="104"/>
improved. The slaves became more refined in 
manners and in possession of far greater opportunities 
to provide for themselves, than they had ever before 
enjoyed, and yet it was <hi rend="italics">Slavery.</hi> Any reverse in the 
fortunes of our master would be disadvantageous to 
us. Oh, how this fearful uncertainty weighed upon 
us as we saw that our master was not prospering and 
increasing in wealth; but we had not the dismal fears 
of the loathsome slave-pen, rice swamps, and many 
other things we should have to fear in Virginia. We 
were still <hi rend="italics">slaves,</hi> and yet we had so much greater chance 
to learn from the kind, intelligent people about us, so 
many things which we never knew before, that I 
think a slave-trader would have found it a difficult 
task to take any one of us to a Southern slave market, 
if our master had so ordered it.</p>
        <p>The village of Bath is rather an out of-the-way 
place, hemmed in on all sides by mountains of considerable 
height, leaving an opening on the north, 
through a pleasant valley, to the head of Crooked 
Lake. Produce of every kind, when once there, met 
a ready sale for the New York market.</p>
        <p>In the first settlement of the country this was the 
only outlet for the country produce, which was transported 
in rude boats or vessels called <hi rend="italics">arks,</hi> built during 
the winter season to await the spring freshet; then 
they loaded thorn with wheat or other produce, and 
sent them to Baltimore or elsewhere. They used also
<pb id="steward105" n="105"/>
to obtain great quantities of fine lumber, and floated 
it through the same rivers every spring; but it was
attended with great loss of life and property.</p>
        <p>Bath assumed a warlike appearance during the last
war with Great Britain; the public square was dotted
all over with officers, marquees, and soldiers' tents.
Some of these soldiers were unprincipled and reckless 
men, who seemed to care very little what they did.</p>
        <p>One evening I was walking around the encampment 
in company with a Mr. James Morrison, a clerk in 
the land office, looking at the soldiers, until we came 
near a sentinel on duty. He kept his gun to his 
shoulder until we came near enough, and then he 
attempted to run me through with his bayonet. 
Young Morrison sprang forward, and seizing the musket, 
told me to run; I did so, which probably saved 
my life.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XI.</head>
        <head>THOUGHTS ON FREEDOM.</head>
        <p>After living sometime in Bath, and having the
privilege of more enlightened society, I began 
to think that it was possible for me to become a free 
man in some way besides going into the army or 
running away, as I had often thought of doing. 
I had listened to the conversation of others, and 
determined to ask legal counsel on the subject the 
first opportunity I could find. Very soon after, as I 
was drawing wood, I met on the river bridge, Mr. D. 
Cruger, the eminent lawyer before mentioned, and I 
asked him to tell me if I was not free, by the laws of 
New York. He started, and looked around him as if 
afraid to answer my question, but after a while told 
me I was not free. I passed on, but the answer to my 
question by no means satisfied me, especially when I 
remembered the hesitancy with which it was given.</p>
        <p>I sought another opportunity to speak with Mr.
<pb id="steward107" n="107"/>
Cruger, and at last found him in his office alone; then 
he conversed freely on the subject of Slavery, telling 
me that Capt. Helm could not hold me as a slave in 
that State, if I chose to leave him, and then directed 
me to D. Comstock and J. Moore; the first being at 
the head of a manumission society, and the last named 
gentleman one of its directors.</p>
        <p>Our condition, as I have said before, was greatly
improved; and yet the more we knew of freedom the 
more we desired it, and the less willing were we to 
remain in bondage. The slaves that Capt. Helm had 
sold or hired out, were continually leaving him and the 
country, for a place of freedom; and I determined to 
become my own possessor.</p>
        <p>There is no one, I care not how favorable his condition, 
who desires to be a slave, to labor for nothing 
all his life for the benefit of others. I have often 
heard fugitive slaves say, that it was not so much the 
cruel beatings and floggings that they received which 
induced them to leave the South, as the idea of dragging 
out a whole life of unrequited toil to enrich their 
masters.</p>
        <p>Everywhere that Slavery exists, it is nothing but 
<hi rend="italics">slavery.</hi> I found it just as hard to be beaten over the 
head with a piece of iron in New York as it was in Virginia. 
Whips and chains are everywhere necessary to 
degrade and brutalize the slave, in order to reduce 
him to that abject and humble state which Slavery
<pb id="steward108" n="108"/>
requires. Nor is the effect much less disastrous on the 
man who holds supreme control over the soul and 
body of his fellow beings. Such unlimited power, 
in almost every instance transforms the man into a 
tyrant; the brother into a demon.</p>
        <p>When the first of our persecuted race were brought 
to this country it was to teach them to reverence the 
only true and living God; or such was the answer of 
Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth of England, when her 
subjects desired the liberty to bring from their native 
land the poor, ignorant African. “Let them,” said the 
Queen, “be brought away only by their own consent, 
otherwise the act will be detestable, and bring down 
the vengeance of heaven upon us.” A very different 
position truly, from the one assumed at the present 
day by apologists for the traffic in human flesh. But, 
to return to myself.</p>
        <p>I had determined to make an effort to own myself, 
and as a preliminary step, I obtained permission of 
Capt. Helm to visit some friends living in Canandaigua 
and Geneva. This was in the winter of 1814. I 
went first to Geneva; from there to Canandaigua. 
Between the two villages I met a company of United 
States' troops, returning from Buffalo, where they had 
been to repel an invasion of the British.</p>
        <p>The two villages above named, were small but very
pretty, having been laid out with taste and great care. 
Some wealthy and enterprising gentlemen had come
<pb id="steward109" n="109"/>
from the East into this great Western country, who
were making every improvement in their power. The 
dense forest had long since fallen under the stroke of 
the woodman's ax, and in that section, flourishing 
villages were springing up as if by magic, where so 
lately roamed wild beasts and rude savages, both 
having fallen back before the march of civilization.</p>
        <p>I called on James Moore, as directed by Mr. Cruger, 
and found he was one of the directors of the “Manumission 
Society,” as it was then called. This was an 
association of humane and intelligent gentlemen 
whose object it was to aid any one who was illegally 
held in bondage. The funds of the society were 
ample; and able counsel was employed to assist those 
who needed it. The late lamented John C. Spencer, 
one of the most eminent lawyers in Western New 
York, was then counsel for that society.</p>
        <p>I soon got an interview with Mr. Moore, to whom I
related the history of my life,  -  the story of my 
wrongs and hardships. I told him about my having 
been hired out by Capt. Helm, which he said was 
sufficient to insure my freedom! Oh! how my heart 
leaped at the thought! The tears started, my breast 
heaved with a mighty throb of gratitude, and I could 
hardly refrain from grasping his hand or falling down 
at his feet; and perhaps should have made some 
ludicrous demonstration of my feelings, had not the
kind gentleman continued his conversation in another
direction.</p>
        <pb id="steward110" n="110"/>
        <p>He said that indispensable business called him to
Albany, where he must go immediately, but assured 
me that he would return in March following; then I 
must come to him and he would see that I had what 
justly belonged to me  -  my freedom from Slavery. 
He advised me to return to Bath and go on with my 
work as usual until March, but to say nothing of my 
intentions and prospects. I returned according to his 
directions, with a heart so light, that I could not 
realize that my bonds were not yet broken, nor the 
yoke removed from off my neck. I was already free 
in spirit, and I silently exulted in the bright prospect 
of liberty.</p>
        <p>Could my master have felt what it was to be relieved 
of such a crushing weight, as the one which was but 
partially lifted from my mind, he would have been a 
happier man than he had been for a long time.</p>
        <p>I went cheerfully back to my labor, and worked 
with alacrity, impatient only for March to come; and 
as the time drew near I began to consider what kind 
of an excuse I could make to get away. I could 
think of none, but I determined to go without one, 
rather than to remain.</p>
        <p>Just before the time appointed for me to meet 
Mr. Moore, a slave girl named Milly, came secretly to 
Bath. She had been one of Capt. Helm's slaves, and 
he had a while before sold her to a man who lived 
some distance west of the village. Milly had now
<pb id="steward111" n="111"/>
taken the matter into her own hands. She had left 
her master to take care of himself, and was in short, 
“running away,” determined as myself, that she 
would be a slave no longer; resolved on death, or 
freedom from the power of the slaveholder.</p>
        <p>The time I had set for my departure was so near at 
hand, that I concluded to accompany her in her flight. 
When the dark night came on, we started together, 
and traveled all night, and just as the day dawned 
we arrived at Manchester, where we stopped a short 
time with one Thomas Watkins.</p>
        <p>But I was not to be let go so easily. I had been 
missed at Capt. Helm's, and several men started in
immediate pursuit. I was weary, and so intent on 
getting a little rest that I did not see my pursuers 
until they had well nigh reached the house where I 
was; but I <hi rend="italics">did</hi> see them in time to spring from the 
house with the agility of a deer, and to run for the
woods as for life. And indeed, I so considered it. I 
was unarmed to be sure, and not prepared to defend 
myself against two or three men, armed to the teeth; 
but it would have gone hard with me before I surrendered 
myself to them, after having dreamed as I 
had, and anticipated the blessings of a free man. I 
escaped them, thank God, and reached the woods, 
where I concealed myself for some time, and where I 
had ample opportunity to reflect on the injustice and 
cruelty of my oppressors, and to ask myself why it
<pb id="steward112" n="112"/>
was that I was obliged to fly from my home. Why 
was I there panting and weary, hungry and destitute  -  
skulking in the woods like a thief, and concealing 
myself like a murderer? What had I done? For 
what fault, or for what crime was I pursued by armed 
men, and hunted like a beast of prey? God only 
knows how these inquiries harrowed up my very soul, 
and made me well nigh doubt the justice and mercy 
of the Almighty, until I remembered my narrow 
escape, when my doubts dissolved in grateful tears.</p>
        <p>But why, oh why, had I been forced to flee thus 
from my fellow men? I was guilty of no crime; I 
had committed no violence; I had broken no law of 
the land; I was not charged even with a fault, except 
of <hi rend="italics">the love of liberty</hi> and a desire to be <hi rend="italics">free!</hi>  I had 
claimed the right to possess my own person, and 
remove it from oppression. Oh my God, thought I, 
can the American People, who at this very hour are 
pouring out their blood in defence of their country's
liberty; offering up as a sacrifice on the battle field 
their promising young men, to preserve their land and
hearthstones from English oppression; can they, 
will they, continue to hunt the poor African slave 
from their soil because he desires that same liberty, so 
dear to the heart of every American citizen? Will 
they not blot out from their  fair escutcheon the foul 
stain which Slavery has cast upon it? Will they not 
remember the Southern bondman, in whom the love
<pb id="steward113" n="113"/>
of freedom is as inherent as in themselves; and will
they not, when contending for equal rights, use their
mighty forces “to break <hi rend="italics">every yoke,</hi> and let the
oppressed go free?” God grant that it may be so!</p>
        <p>As soon as I thought it prudent, I pursued my
journey, and finally came out into the open country,
near the dwelling of Mr. Dennis Comstock, who, as I
have said, was president of the Manumission Society.
To him I freely described my situation, and found 
him a friend indeed. He expressed his readiness to 
assist me, and wrote a line for me to take to his 
brother, Otis Comstock, who took me into his family 
at once.  I hired to Mr. Comstock for the season, and 
from that time onward lived with him nearly four
years.</p>
        <p>When I arrived there I was about twenty-two years 
of age, and felt for the first time in my life, that I was 
my own master. I cannot describe to a free man, what 
a proud manly feeling came over me when I hired 
to Mr. C. and made my first bargain, nor when I 
assumed the dignity of collecting my own earnings. 
Notwithstanding I was very happy in my freedom 
from Slavery, and had a good home, where for the 
first time in my life I was allowed to sit at table with 
others, yet I found myself very deficient in almost 
every thing which I should have learned when a boy.</p>
        <p>These and other recollections of the past often saddened 
my spirit; but <hi rend="italics">hope,</hi>  -  cheering and bright, was
<pb id="steward114" n="114"/>         
now mine, and it lighted up the future and gave me
patience to persevere.</p>
        <p>In the autumn when the farm work was done, I 
called on Mr. Comstock for some money, and the first 
thing I did after receiving it I went to Canandaigua 
where I found a book-store kept by a man named 
J. D. Bemis, and of him I purchased some school 
books.</p>
        <p>No king on his throne could feel prouder or grander 
than I did that day. With my books under my arm, 
and money of my own earning in my pocket, I stepped 
loftily along toward Farmington, where I determined 
to attend the Academy. The thought, however, that 
though I was twenty-three years old, I had yet to 
learn what most boys of eight years knew, was rather 
a damper on my spirits. The school was conducted 
by Mr. J. Comstock, who was a pleasant young man 
and an excellent teacher. He showed me every kindness 
and consideration my position and ignorance
demanded; and I attended his school three winters, 
with pleasure and profit to myself at least.</p>
        <p>When I had been with Mr. Comstock about a year, we
received a visit from my old master, Capt. Helm, 
who had spared no pains to find me, and when he 
learned where I was he came to claim me as “his 
boy,” who, he said he “wanted and must have.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Comstock told him I was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> “his boy,” and as 
such he would not give me up; and further, that I was
<pb id="steward115" n="115"/>
free by the laws of the State. He assured the Captain
that his hiring me out in the first instance, to Mr.
Tower, forfeited his claim to me, and gave me a right
to <sic>freedem</sic>,  -  but if he chose to join issue, they would
have the case tried in the Supreme Court; but this
proposition the Captain declined: he knew well
enough that it would result in my favor; and after
some flattery and coaxing, he left me with my friend,
Mr. Comstock, in liberty and peace!</p>

        <p>The business affairs of Capt. Helm had for some
time been far from prosperous; and now he was 
quite poor. His slave property proved a bad investment, 
and Madam Thornton a far worse one. She 
had already applied for a divorce, and a good share of 
the estate as alimony; both of which she succeeded in 
getting, the Captain allowing her to take pretty much 
her own course. These troubles, with costs of lawsuits, 
bad management, &amp;c., had now emptied the 
coffers of my old master almost to the last farthing; 
and he began to cast about him for some way to 
replenish his purse, and retrieve his fallen fortunes.</p>
        <p>Had Capt. Helm been brought up to honorable
industry, and accustomed to look after his own pecuniary 
interests, he doubtless would have sustained his 
position; or if reverses were unavoidable, he would 
have by persevering industry, regained what he had
<pb id="steward117" n="117"/>
lost. But he had been raised in a slave State, and 
Southern principles were as deeply instilled into his 
mind, as Southern manners were impressed on his life 
and conduct.</p>
        <p>He had no partiality for labor of any kind; horse-racing 
and card-playing were far more congenial to his 
tastes;  reduced as he now was, he would deny himself 
no luxury that his means or credit would procure. 
His few remaining slaves were given into the hands 
of an idle, brutal overseer  -  while they, half fed, half 
clothed, grew more and more discontented, and ran 
away on every opportunity that offered.</p>
        <p>The Captain at last hit upon a method of making 
money, which, if it had been carried into operation on 
the high seas, would in all probability have been 
called by its right name, and incurred the penalty of 
the gallows  -  as piracy. Ought it then to be deemed 
less criminal because transpiring on the free soil of the 
American Republic?  I think not. Nor was it less 
censurable on account of its failure.</p>
        <p>The Captain's plan was to collect all the slaves 
he had once owned, many of whom had escaped 
to the surrounding villages, and when once in his 
grasp, to roll them speedily into a slave State, and 
there sell them for the Southern market. To carry 
forward this hellish design, it was necessary to have 
recourse to stratagem. Some person must be found to 
lure the unsuspecting slaves into the net he was
<pb id="steward118" n="118"/>
spreading for them. At last he found a scoundrel
named Simon Watkins, who for the consideration of
fifty dollars, was to collect as many of the slaves as he 
could at one place; and when he had done so, he was 
to receive the money, leaving Capt. Helm to do the 
rest.</p>
        <p>Simon set immediately about the business, which
was first to go to Palmyra, and in great kindness and
generosity, give a large party to the colored people,  -  
desiring that all Capt. Helm's former slaves, <hi rend="italics">in particular,</hi>
should be present to have a joyous re-union,
and celebrate their freedom in having a fine time
generally.</p>
        <p>Invitations were sent to all, and extensive preparation 
made for a large “social party,” at Palmyra, at  
the house of Mrs. Bristol. My parents were invited;  
and Simon took the pains to come to Farmington to  
give me a special invitation. When the time arrived  
for the party, I went to Palmyra with the intention 
of attending. I had not the least suspicion of any 
thing wrong; yet, by some mysterious providence, or 
something for which I can not account, a presentiment 
took possession of my mind that all was not right. I 
knew not what I feared, and could in no way define 
my apprehensions; but I grew so uneasy, that I 
finally gave up the party and returned home, before 
the guests were assembled.</p>
        <p>Capt. Helm and his assistants came on to Palmyra
<pb id="steward119" n="119"/>
in disguise, before evening, and secreted themselves in 
one of the hotels to await the arrival of their victims.</p>
        <p>At the appointed hour the slaves began to assemble 
in large numbers and great glee, without the least 
suspicion of danger. They soon began their amusements, 
and in the midst of their mirth, Capt. Helm 
and party stealthily crept from their hiding place and 
surrounded the house; then bursting in suddenly upon 
the revelers, began to make arrests. Such a tumult, 
such an affray as ensued would be hard to describe.</p>
        <p>The slaves fought for their lives and their liberty, 
and the Captain's party for their property and power. 
Fists, clubs, chairs, and any thing they could get hold 
of, was freely used with a strength and will of men 
who had tasted the joys of freedom. Cries and curses 
were mingled, while blows fell like hail on both sides. 
Commands from our old master were met with shouts 
of bold defiance on the part of the Negroes, until 
the miserable kidnappers were glad to desist, and 
were driven off  -  not stealthily as they came, but in 
quick time and in the best way they could, to escape
the threatened vengeance of the slaves, who drove 
them like “feathers before the wind.” But it was 
a terrible battle and many were severely wounded;
among them was my father. He was taken to his
home, mangled and bleeding, and from the effects of
that night's affray he never recovered. He lingered 
on in feeble health until death finally released him
<pb id="steward120" n="120"/>
from suffering, and placed him beyond the reach of
kidnappers and tyrants.</p>
        <p>The Captain and his party, enraged and disappointed 
in their plans at Palmyra, returned to Bath to 
see what could be done there toward success, in getting 
up a gang of slaves for the Southern market. When 
they came among the colored people of Bath, it was 
like a hawk alighting among a flock of chickens at 
noon-day. They scattered and ran in every direction, 
some to the woods, some hid themselves in cellars, 
and others in their terror plunged into the Conhocton 
River. In this manner the majority of the negroes 
escaped, but not all; and those were so unfortunate as 
to get caught were instantly thrown into a large 
covered “Pennsylvania wagon,” and hurried off, 
closely guarded, to Olean Point. Among those taken 
were Harry Lucas, his wife, Lucinda, and seven 
children; Mrs. Jane Cooper and four children, with 
some others, were also taken.</p>
        <p>When Capt. Helm arrived at Olean Point with his
stolen freight of human beings, he was unexpectedly
detained until he could build a boat,  -  which, to his
great dismay took him several days.</p>
        <p>The sorrow and fearful apprehension of those
wretched recaptured slaves can not be described nor
imagined by any one except those who have experienced 
a like affliction. They had basked for a short 
season in the sunshine of liberty, and thought themselves    
<pb id="steward121" n="121"/>
secure from the iron grasp of Slavery, and the 
heel of the oppressor, when in the height of their 
exultation, they had been thrust down to the lowest 
depths of misery and despair, with the, oppressor's 
heel again upon their necks. To be snatched without 
a moment's warning from their homes and friends,  -  
hurried and crowded into the close slave wagon,  
regardless of age or sex, like sheep for the slaughter, 
to be carried they knew not whither; but, doubtless 
to the dismal rice swamp of the South,  -  was to them 
an agony too great for endurance. The adult portion
of the miserable company determined at last to go no
farther with their heartless master, but to resist unto 
death if need be, before they surrendered themselves 
to the galling chains they had so recently broken, or 
writhed again under the torturing lash of the slave-driver.</p>
        <p>Harry Lucas and wife, and Jane Cooper, silently 
prepared themselves for the conflict, determined to sell 
their lives as dearly as possible. When they were 
nearly ready to start, Jane Cooper sent her oldest 
daughter and younger sister, (she who is now our 
worthy friend Mrs. P. of Bath), into the woods, and 
then when the men undertook to get Lucas and the 
two women on board the boat the struggle commenced.
The women fought the Captain and his confederates 
like a lioness robbed of her whelps! They ran and 
dodged about, making the woods ring with their
<pb id="steward122" n="122"/>
screams and shouts of “Murder! Murder! Help! 
Help! Murder!” until the Captain's party, seeing 
they could do nothing to quell them, became so 
exceedingly alarmed lest they should be detected in 
their illegal proceedings, that they ran off at full 
speed, as if they thought an officer at their heels. 
In their hurry and fright they caught two of Harry's 
children, and throwing them into the boat, pushed off 
as quick as possible, amid the redoubled cries of the 
agonized parents and sympathizing friends, all trying 
in every way possible, to recover from the merciless 
grasp of the man-stealer, the two frightened and 
screaming children. Guns were fired and horns 
sounded, but all to no purpose-they held tightly the 
innocent victims of their cupidity, and made good 
their escape.</p>
        <p>Mr. D. C----, a gentleman of wealth and high
standing in Steuben County, became responsible for
the fifty dollars which Capt. Helm promised to pay
Simon Watkins for his villainy in betraying, Judas-like,
those unsuspecting persons whom it should have been
his pleasure to protect and defend against their common 
oppressor,  -  his own as well as theirs.</p>
        <p>In addition to this rascality, it can not appear very
creditable to the citizens of Steuben County, that
Capt. Helm and Thomas McBirney should both hold
high and important offices at the time, and <hi rend="italics">after</hi> they had been tried and convicted of the crime of
<pb id="steward123" n="123"/>
kidnapping. Both of these gentlemen, guilty of a 
State's prison offence, were judges of the common 
pleas. T. McBirney was first judge in the county, 
and Capt. Helm was side judge; and notwithstanding 
their participation in, and conviction of, a flagrant 
outrage on the laws of God and man, they managed 
not only to escape the penalty, but to retain their 
offices and their respectable standing in community 
for years after.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XIII.</head>
        <head>LOCATE IN THE VILLAGE OF ROCHESTER.</head>
        <p>I continued to labor in the employ of Mr. O. 
Comstock, whose son, Zeno, was married during 
the year 1816, and purchased a farm on the site of the 
present flourishing village of Lockport, to which he 
moved his family and effects; but from a mistaken 
supposition that the Erie Canal, which was then under 
contemplation, would take a more southern route, he 
was induced to sell his farm in Hartland, which has 
proved a mine of wealth to the more fortunate purchaser.</p>
        <p>In the winter of that year, I was sent by my employer 
to Hartland with a sleigh-load of produce, and 
passed through the village of Rochester, which I had 
never before seen. It was a very small, forbidding 
looking place at first sight, with few inhabitants, and 
surrounded by a dense forest.</p>
        <p>I recollect that while pursuing my journey, I overtook
<pb id="steward125" n="125"/>
a white man driving a span of horses, who contended 
that I had not a right to travel the public highway 
as other men did, but that it was my place to keep 
behind him and his team. Being in haste I endeavored 
to pass him quietly, but he would not permit it and 
hindered me several hours, very much to my annoyance 
and indignation. This was, however, but a slight 
incident indicating the bitter prejudice which every 
man seemed to feel against the negro. No matter how 
industrious he might be, no matter how honorable in 
his dealings, or respectful in his manners,  -  he was a 
“nigger,” and as such he must be treated, with a 
few honorable exceptions.</p>
        <p>This year also, my father died in the village of Palmyra, 
where, as I have before mentioned, he received 
injuries from which he never entirely recovered.
After about six months severe illness which he bore 
with commendable patience and resignation, his spirit 
returned to God who gave it; and his sorrowing 
friends and bereaved family followed his remains to 
their final abode, where we laid him down to rest 
from unrequited labor and dire oppression, until “all 
they who are in their graves shall hear the voice of 
the Son of God, and they that hear shall live forever,”
where the “tears shall be wiped from off all faces”  -  
and where the righteous bondman shall no longer fear 
the driver's lash or master's frown, but freely join in 
the song of “Alleluia! The Lord God Omnipotent
reigneth!”</p>
        <pb id="steward126" n="126"/>
        <p>My father had a good reputation for honesty and
uprightness of character among his employers and
acquaintances, and was a kind, affectionate husband 
and a fond, indulgent parent. His, I believe was the 
life and death of a good man. “Peace be to his 
ashes.”</p>
        <p>The following season I commenced a new business  -  
that of peddling in the village of Rochester such 
articles as my employer, Mr. Comstock, desired to sell: 
the products of his farm,  -  wheat, corn, oats, butter, 
cheese, meat, and poultry  -  all of which met a ready 
sale, generally for cash at liberal prices. That market 
was then but little known to the generality of farmers, 
and the enterprising gentlemen of that place, were 
desirous of encouraging commerce with the surrounding 
country, offered every encouragement in their 
power. Hence, we found it a profitable business,
which I continued in for several months.</p>
        <p>The present flourishing city of Rochester was then, 
as I have said, but a village in its infancy, situated 
near the upper falls of the Genesee River, and about 
seven miles from its mouth. Here, some time previously, 
three gentlemen from Maryland bought a 
large tract of land, and as no business man could fail 
to observe and appreciate its rare advantages they 
commenced laying out a village. Sirs Fitzhugh, Carroll, 
and Rochester, composed the company; but the  
management of the business devolved almost wholly
<pb id="steward127" n="127"/>
on Col. Rochester, whose wealth, enterprise, and intelligence 
well qualified him for the undertaking; and 
as it had been assigned him to cognominate the new 
village, I have heard it said that he jocularly gave his 
reason for selecting its present title, as follows: 
“Should he call it <hi rend="italics">Fitzhugh</hi> or <hi rend="italics">Carroll,</hi> the slighted 
gentleman would certainly feel offended with the 
other; but if he called it by his own name, they would 
most likely <hi rend="italics">both</hi> be angry with him; so it was best to 
serve them alike.”</p>
        <p>There was then two grist mills,  -  one owned by Mr.
Ely, and the other by Mr. Brown; one small building 
for religious worship, occupied by the Presbyterians 
on Carroll street (now State street); and but two stone
buildings within what now comprises that beautiful 
city. There were then no brick buildings at all, but 
business was good; merchants and mechanics from 
the East soon began to settle there and give it a thriving 
aspect.</p>
        <p>About this time another company was formed, 
whose moving spirit was Mr. E. Stone, a man of 
worth and talent; the object of which was to locate 
another village at the head of navigation and about 
half way between the mouth of the river and Rochester, 
which they called <hi rend="italics">Carthage.</hi></p>
        <p>The company commenced building and improving the
place so rapidly' that many who came to purchase
residences and business stations were at a loss to decide
<pb id="steward128" n="128"/>
which of the two places would finally become the 
center of business. It, however, was soon perceivable 
that the advantage of water privileges, stone, and 
access to both, was greatly in favor of Rochester. At 
Carthage the Genesee is narrow and its banks steep 
and abrupt, rising in many places three hundred feet 
above the bed of the river, which of course render 
the privileges and business on it far less easy of 
access for building purposes. I may have occasion to 
speak hereafter of the expensive and magnificent 
bridge at Carthage, which was the wonder and admiration 
of the times.</p>
        <p>The following year I concluded to go into business 
for myself, and was as much at loss as others, 
whether to locate at Rochester or Carthage; but 
after considering the matter in all its bearings, and 
closely watching the progress of events, my choice 
preponderated in favor of Rochester, and to that place 
I went, designing to enter into business on my own 
account.</p>
        <p>It was indeed painful to my feelings to leave the 
home and family of Mr. Comstock, where I had 
experienced so much real comfort and happiness, 
where I had ever been treated with uniform kindness, 
where resided those kind friends to whom I felt under 
the greatest obligation for the freedom and quietude I 
then enjoyed, as well as for the little knowledge of 
business and of the world that I then possessed.
<pb id="steward129" n="129"/>
Thinking, however, that I could better my condition, 
I subdued, as well as I could, my rising emotions, and 
after sincerely thanking them for their goodness and
favors  -  wishing them long life and prosperity,  -  I took 
my departure for the chosen place of my destination.</p>
        <p>Soon after I left Mr. Comstock's, that gentleman 
sent his hired man, named John Cline, to Rochester 
with a wagon load of produce to sell, as had been his 
custom for some time. In vain the family looked for 
his return at the usual hour in the evening, and began 
to wonder what had detained him; but what was their 
horror and surprise to find, when they arose the next 
morning, the horses standing at the door, and the poor 
unfortunate man lying in the wagon, <hi rend="italics">dead!</hi> How long they had been there nobody knew; no one had 
heard them come in; and how the man had been 
killed was a matter of mere conjecture. The coroner 
was sent for and an inquest held, and yet it was difficult 
to solve the whole mystery.</p>
        <p>The most probable explanation was, that he was 
sitting in the back part of the wagon, and fell over on
is left side, striking his neck on the edge of the 
wagon box, breaking it instantly.</p>
        <p>The verdict of the jury was, in accordance with 
these facts, “accidental death,” &amp;c.   </p>
        <p>When I left Mr. Comstock's I had acquired quite a
knowledge of reading, writing, arithmetic, and had 
made a small beginning in English grammar.</p>
        <pb id="steward130" n="130"/>
        <p>It had been for some time a question which I found 
hard to decide, whether or not I should pursue my 
studies as I had done. If I went into business as I 
contemplated, I knew it would end my proficiency 
in the sciences; and yet I felt a desire to accumulate 
more of the wealth that perisheth. Considering 
too that I was advancing in age, and had no means of 
support but by my own labor, I finally concluded
to do what I have from that time to this deeply 
regretted,  -  give up the pursuit of an education, 
and turn my attention wholly to business. I 
do not regret having desired a competency, nor for 
having labored to obtain it, but I <hi rend="italics">do</hi> regret not having 
spared myself sufficient leisure to pursue some regular 
system of reading and study; to have cultivated my 
mind and stored it with useful knowledge.</p>
        <p>Truly has it been said, “knowledge is power.” 
But it is not like the withering curse of a tyrant's 
power; not like the degrading and brutalizing power 
of the slave-driver's lash, chains, and thumb-screws; 
not like the beastly, demonical power of rum, nor like 
the brazen, shameless power of lust; but a power that 
elevates and refines the intellect; directs the affections; 
controls unholy passions; a power so God-like in its 
character, that it enables its possessor to feel for the 
oppressed of every clime, and prepares him to defend
the weak and down-trodden.</p>
        <p>What but ignorance renders the poor slave so weak
<pb id="steward131" n="131"/>
and inefficient in claiming his right to liberty, and the
possession of his own being! Nor will that God who 
is “no respecter of persons,” hold him guiltless who 
assumes unlimited control over his fellow. The chain 
of Slavery which fetters every slave south of Mason 
and Dixon's Line, is as closely linked <sic>arounb</sic> the master 
as the slave. The time has passed by when African 
blood alone is enslaved. In Virginia as well as in 
some other slave States, there is as much European 
blood in the veins of the enslaved as there is African; 
and the increase is constantly in favor of the white 
population. This fact alone speaks volumes, and 
should remind the slave-breeding Southerner of that 
fearful retribution which must sooner or later overtake 
him.</p>
        <p>In September, 1817, I commenced business in 
Rochester. Having rented a room of Mr. A. Wakely, 
I established a meat market, which was supplied 
mostly by my former employer, Mr. Comstock, and 
was liberally patronized by the citizens; but there were 
butchers in the village who appeared to be unwilling 
that I should have any share in public patronage. 
Sometimes they tore down my sign, at others painted 
it black, and so continued to annoy me until after I 
had one of their number arrested, which put a stop to
their unmanly proceedings.</p>
        <p>The village was now rapidly increasing, and yet the
surrounding country was mostly a wilderness. Mr.
<pb id="steward132" n="132"/>
E. Stone, who then owned the land on the east side of 
the river, thought his farm a very poor one; he, 
however, commenced clearing it in the midst of wild 
beasts and rattlesnakes, both of which were abundant, 
and in a few years was richly rewarded for his labor, 
in the sale of village lots, which commanded high
prices.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 1818, I commenced teaching a 
Sabbath School for the neglected children of our 
oppressed race.  For a while it was well attended, and 
I hoped to be able to benefit in some measure the poor 
and despised colored children, but the parents interested 
themselves very little in the undertaking, and it 
shortly came to nought. So strong was the prejudice 
then existing against the colored people, that very few 
of the negroes seemed to have any courage or ambition 
to rise from the abject degradation in which the 
estimation of the white man had placed him.</p>
        <p>This year, also, I purchased a lot of land, eighteen 
by fifty feet, situated on Main street, for which I was 
to pay five hundred dollars. Having secured my 
land, I began making preparations for building, and 
soon had a good two story dwelling and store, into 
which I moved my effects, and commenced a more 
extensive business.</p>
        <p>Some disadvantage as well as sport was occasioned 
<sic>On</sic> business men, who resided on the confines of Ontario 
and Genesee Counties. It was indeed laughable
<pb id="steward133" n="133"/>
to witness the races and maneuvering of parties in those
days when men were imprisoned for debt. If a 
man in Ontario County had a suspicion that an officer 
was on his track, he had only to step over the line into 
Genesee, to be beyond the power of an officer's 
precept.</p>
        <p>A great deal of trouble as well as unpleasant feeling 
was engendered by the exercise of that law, which 
allowed the creditor so great advantage over the 
debtor. This, together with the fact that very many 
of the citizens of Rochester were men of small means, 
the more wealthy portion felt called upon to protect 
their interests, by forming themselves into what was 
called a “Shylock Society,” the object of which was 
to obtain a list of all the names of persons who had 
been, or were then, on “the limits” for debt. This 
list of names was printed, and each member of the 
society furnished with a copy, which enabled him to
decide whether or not to trust a man when he came to
trade. The formation of this society gave rise to 
another, whose members pledged themselves to have 
no dealing with a member of the “Shylock Society,” 
and also to publish all defaulters in “high life,” which 
served to check these oppressive measures and restore 
harmony.</p>
        <p>Among others who came to settle in the thriving 
village of Rochester, was a colored man named Daniel 
Furr, who came from the East. He soon became
<pb id="steward134" n="134"/>
acquainted with a very respectable young white lady, 
of good family, who after a short acquaintance 
appeared to be perfectly enamored of her dusky 
swain, and notwithstanding the existing prejudice, 
she did not scruple to avow her affection for him,  -   
a devotion which appeared to be as sincerely returned 
by the young “Othello.” They resolved to marry; 
but to this, serious objections arose, and all that the 
lady's family and friends could do to break off the 
match was done, but without effect. They could,
however, prevail on no one to perform the marriage
ceremony in the village, and finally concluded to go to 
a magistrate in the town of Brighton, four miles 
distant. At this stage of the proceedings I was 
appealed to, to accompany them. I took the matter 
into consideration and came to the conclusion that I 
could take no active part in the affair, nor bear any 
responsible station in the unpleasant occurrence. Is it 
no sin in the sight of the Almighty, for Southern 
gentlemen (?) to mix blood and amalgamate the races? 
And if allowed to them, is it not equally justifiable 
when the commerce is prompted by affection rather 
than that of lust and force? But I at length consented 
to accompany them, after learning that all the mischief 
was already done that could be feared, and that the 
gallant lover desired to marry the lady as the only
atonement he could make for the loss of her reputation.</p>
        <pb id="steward135" n="135"/>
        <p>We arrived at the house of the magistrate about one
o'clock at night, and all were soundly sleeping. They 
were, however, aroused, and when our business was 
made known, an exciting scene followed. The magistrate 
refused at first to marry them; and the lady the 
house took aside the intended bride, spending two 
hours in endeavoring to dissuade her from the contemplated 
union; assuring her that her house should be 
freely opened to her, that no attention should be 
spared during her expected confinement, &amp;c.; but all 
to no purpose. They returned to the parlor where the 
magistrate again tried his power of persuasion, but 
with as little success as his lady had met: and then he 
reluctantly married them. The newly-made husband 
paid a liberal fee, and we took our leave. I returned
to my home to reflect on the scenes of the past night, 
and Mr. and Mrs. Furr to the house of a friend of the 
bride in Penfield.</p>
        <p>The report soon reached the village that the marriage 
had been consummated, which produced a great
excitement. Threats of an alarming character were 
openly made against the “nigger” who had dared to 
marry a white woman, although at her own request. 
And there was also a class of persons who associated 
together, professing great friendship for the persecuted 
husband, and often drew him into their company, pretending 
to defend his cause while they were undoubtedly 
plotting his destruction.</p>
        <pb id="steward136" n="136"/>
        <p>One day, after Furr had been drinking rather freely 
with his pretended friends, he was taken so violently 
ill, that a physician was immediately called. I was 
with him when the doctor arrived. He gazed upon 
the suffering man with an angry expression, 
and inquired in a tone of command, “Daniel, what have 
you been doing?” In vain the poor creature begged 
for relief, the doctor merely repeating his question. 
After looking at him for some time, he finally administered 
a potion and hastily left the room, saying as he 
did so, “that Furr was as sure to die as though his 
head had been cut off.” And so it proved, though not 
so speedily as the medical man had predicted; nor did 
he ever visit him again, notwithstanding he lingered 
for several days in the most intense agony. It was a 
strong man grappling with disease and death, and the 
strife was a fearful one. But death at last ended the 
scene, with none of all his professed friends, except 
his faithful but heart-broken wife, to administer to his 
necessities. No sound save that of the moaning 
widow broke the stillness of his death-chamber. A
few friends collected, who prepared the emaciated 
body for the grave; enclosing it in a rude board 
coffin it was conveyed to its last resting place, followed 
by three or four men, just as the shades of evening had 
fallen upon this sin-cursed world; there in darkness 
and silence we lowered his remains, and left the 
gloomy spot to return to his disconsolate wife, who 
had been too ill to join the meager procession.</p>
        <pb id="steward137" n="137"/>
        <p>It has ever been my conviction that Furr was 
poisoned, most likely by some of his false friends who 
must have mingled some deadly drug with his drinks 
or food; nor do I believe that the medicine administered 
by the physician was designed to save his life. 
But to Him who knoweth all things, we leave the
matter.</p>
        <p>His despised, forsaken, and bereaved wife soon followed 
him to the grave, where she sleeps quietly with 
her innocent babe by her side; and where probably this 
second Desdemonia finds the only refuge which would 
have been granted her by a heartless and persecuting 
world.</p>
        <p>Oh, when will this nation “cease to do evil and 
learn to do well?”  When will they judge character 
in accordance with its moral excellence, instead of the 
complexion a man unavoidably bears to the world?</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XIV.</head>
        <head>INCIDENTS IN ROCHESTER AND VICINITY.</head>
        <p>After long petitioning, the inhabitants of that 
section succeeded in having the new County of 
Monroe set off from Genesee and Ontario Counties, in 
1821, which gave a new impulse to the business 
interests of the already flourishing town, which had 
heretofore labored under some disadvantages in consequence 
of having all public business done at Canandaigua 
or Batavia.</p>
        <p>About this time, too, was the Carthage bridge 
built by a company of enterprising gentlemen of that
village which at that day was considered one of the
wonders of the age; but as its history is well known
to all interested in the enterprises of those days, it is
only necessary to say, that the magnificent structure,
so grand in its appearance, such a pattern of mechanical 
ingenuity, exhibiting in all its vast proportions, 
both strength and beat, combined with utility and
<pb id="steward139" n="139"/>
grandeur; and erected at such an enormous expense
of time, labor, and cash, was destined soon to fall. 
It had cost some ten thousand dollars; and had 
been warranted by the builders to stand one year. 
How great then must have been the loss and disappointment 
when in a little more than twenty-four
hours after the time specified, the ruins of that beautiful 
structure were found floating on the broad bosom 
of the Genesee! And yet when we take into consideration 
the vast amount of human life which hourly 
passed over its solid surface, we can but wonder at the 
intervention of a kind Providence which prevented 
any loss of life at the time of its fall. A child had 
but just passed over it, when with one general crash it 
sank to the waters below; mocking in its rapid 
flight, the wisdom of the architect and foresight of 
frail humanity. The fall of Carthage bridge was 
indeed a calamity felt by the public generally, 
and sounded the death-knell of all future greatness to 
Carthage, or at least for some years to come.</p>
        <p>About this time the village was thrown into a state
of excitement by the arrest of a colored woman named 
Ellen, who it was charged had escaped from service 
due to a Mr. D., south of Mason and Dixon's Line. 
She had been arrested in accordance with a law passed 
by Congress in 1793, which forbids persons owing 
service in one State to flee to another; and which also 
obliges those receiving such service, to render to the
<pb id="steward140" n="140"/>
claimant any fugitive from labor due, &amp;c. Poor 
Ellen! She had many friends and able counsel, but 
nothing short of an open violation of the law of the 
land, could prevent her return to the house of bondage. 
She was tried and given up to him who claimed 
dominion over her. Hopeless and heart- broken, she 
was escorted from the boasted land and village of 
freedom, by a company of the “Light Horse,” under 
the command of Capt. Curtis. One poor, persecuted 
slave woman, upon whose heart had fallen a shadow 
darker than death's; driving every earthly hope of 
liberty from her wounded spirit; helpless and forlorn! 
She indeed must have required this military parade  -  
this show of power! And that too, by men who 
throw up their caps with a shout for freedom and 
equal rights! Oh, “consistency, thou art a jewel!”</p>
        <p>As I recollect but one other incident of the kind
occurring in Rochester, I will now name it.</p>
        <p>A colored man named Davis, generally known as
“Doctor Davis,” with a reputation unsullied for industry, 
truth and sobriety, was arrested as a fugitive from 
slave labor in Kentucky. Two men came on from that 
State, acting in the double capacity of agents for the 
claimant and witnesses against the slave. They employed 
Mr. L. as counsel, and hastened on the trial of 
the afflicted African. When it became generally 
known that Davis was arrested, and about to be tried, 
the excitement grew intense among all classes; but
<pb id="steward141" n="141"/>
more particularly among the colored people. When 
the trial came on, the Court room was crowded to 
overflowing, and every avenue leading to it densely 
thronged with deeply anxious persons, assembled to 
witness the result. It became evident, however, that 
the poor man must be given up to his grasping master, 
unless some means were devised to rescue him from 
the power of an unjust law. His friends were on the 
alert, and as the trial proceeded, the colored men found 
an opportunity to get him into a corner of the crowded 
apartment; where, while the officers stood at the door, 
they dressed him in disguise, and otherwise so completely 
changed his personal appearance, that he
passed out of the Court room, undetected by the 
officers, and as all supposed was safely pursuing his 
way to Canada.</p>
        <p>The hawk-eyed counsel for the Kentuckians, however, 
too soon observed exultation written on every 
dusky countenance, to keep quiet. Starting to his feet 
in great alarm, he cried out “Where is Davis?” And 
oh, how that question startled every one present. 
Every eye gazed hither and thither, and every ear 
intently listened for the answer. After a moment of 
breathless silence, the excited counsellor was assured 
that the “bird had flown,” which announcement was 
received with a rapturous shout of joy by the audience, 
greatly, however, to the discomfiture of the 
gentlemen from Kentucky, who had thought themselves
<pb id="steward142" n="142"/>
so sure of their prize. Nor would they be
thwarted now. It was not yet too late to overtake
their victim, and slavery required at their hands a
sacrifice which they were ready to make. Hand-bills
were in immediate circulation, offering a reward of
fifty dollars for the apprehension of the flying fugitive.
Fifty dollars, for the body and soul of a man to plunge
into the degradation of Slavery! Fifty dollars for the
ruin of a fellow being, for whom Christ gave his
precious life! Yes, fifty dollars are offered to any
human blood-hound who will hunt and worry the poor
slave, who must fly from this boasted land of 
liberty, to seek protection in the dominion of England's 
Queen!</p>
        <p>Unfortunately for Davis, some of these hand-bills 
were thrown on board the very packet on which he 
had embarked for Buffalo; nor was this all. The bills 
would have left him uninjured, but a scoundrel  -  an 
apology for a man  -  was there also, who, for the consideration 
of fifty dollars was willing to compromise 
all pretensions to manhood and humanity, and drag 
from the boat the panting slave, whom he cast beneath 
the heel of his oppressor. When Davis was finally 
retaken, those Kentucky dealers in human chattels, 
held him with a grasp that banished all hope of escape 
by flight; and then in his sorrow and despair the 
wretched, hopeless man cried out “Oh, my God, must 
I return to the hell of Slavery? Save me, Oh, dear
<pb id="steward143" n="143"/>
Lord, save this, thy helpless, friendless servant, from 
a fate so dreadful! Oh, Christian friends and neighbors, 
I appeal to you to rescue me from a life far more 
terrible than death in any form! Oh, God, is there no 
protection for me in the laws of New York? I claim 
it, by all that is sacred in her past history! Give me 
liberty or death! or death!” he repeated, with a 
shudder; then casting one glance of hopeless agony 
on his persecutors, he secretly drew from his pocket a 
razor, and before he could be prevented he drew it 
across his throat, and fell gasping in the midst of his 
slave-hunting tormentors, while a collection of bystanders 
cried “Shame! shame! on the institution 
of Slavery!”</p>
        <p>Poor Davis was not dead, but supposing he soon 
would be, these gentlemen were requested to give 
security, and indemnify the town for all expenses it 
might incur on Davis' account. But instead of giving 
their bond as requested, they took a sudden start 
for Kentucky, where it was very generally desired 
they might remain.</p>
        <p>With good treatment, Davis, after a long time, recovered 
sufficiently to be removed by his friends to a
place of safety; and when so far restored as to be able 
he returned to Rochester, where he received assistance
which enabled him to reach Canada. I have often 
heard from him during his residence in that country, 
where no slaves exist and he has done well, having
<pb id="steward144" n="144"/>
quite an extensive practice in medicine, and lives in the
quiet enjoyment of that liberty which he struggled so 
hard to obtain and came so near losing; yet, to this 
day he prefers death to Slavery. And who does not? 
None, who have breathed the air of freedom after an 
experience of unrequited toil to enrich a brutal and 
selfish master. Truly is it said, “a contented slave is 
a degraded being.”</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XV.</head>
        <head>SAD REVERSES OF CAPT. HELM.</head>
        <p>I must again introduce to the kind reader my 
old master, Capt. Helm, who we left residing in 
Bath, several years ago. And as I have before intimated 
he had now become a very poor man; indeed 
so reduced was he now that he lived with one of his 
slave women, and was supported by public charity!
Learning, too, that I had saved by my industry a few
hundred dollars, it seemed very congenial with his
avaricious habits to endeavor to obtain what I possessed. 
In accordance with his plan he employed a
lawyer named Lewland to come to my place of business, 
which he did, and demanded of me to pay Capt. 
Helm two hundred dollars. He also left a notice,
forbidding all persons to take or destroy any property
in my possession; and then impudently inquired how 
I expected to gain my freedom; if I thought of 
applying for a writ of <hi rend="italics">habæus corpus;</hi> and many
<pb id="steward146" n="146"/>
other questions; to which I replied that I should pay 
no money on the order of Capt. Helm; apply for no 
writ; but should continue to maintain my personal 
rights and enjoy the freedom which was already mine, 
and which I designed to keep, assuring him that the 
Captain had forfeited his claim, if he had any, to me or 
my services, when he hired me to Mr. Tower.</p>
        <p>He hung about me for a day or two, and then left 
me to pursue my business  -  I saw no more of him. 
Some time afterward Mr. H. E. Rochester informed me 
that he had a <hi rend="italics">subpæna</hi> for me, which I found was 
issued by the direction of Capt. Helm. By Mr. 
Rochester's counsel, I took it to Mr. A. Sampson, who 
assured me that my old master had commenced a suit 
against me in the Court of Equity, and the case would 
be tried before Wm. B. Rochester, Esq., who was one 
of the circuit judges. Capt. Helm claimed every 
particle of property I possessed; a claim that occasioned 
me great anxiety and some cost.</p>
        <p>Mr. Sampson encouraged me to hope, however, 
that the case would be dismissed as two other cases of 
that kind had been.</p>
        <p>I labored to the best of my ability to prepare 
myself for the trial, which was to decide whether I 
had a right to possess myself and command my own 
services and earnings, or whether all belonged to Capt. 
Helm. As I looked forward with anxious forebodings 
to the day appointed for the suit to commence, I was
<pb id="steward147" n="147"/>
startled by the announcement of my old master's 
<hi rend="italics">death!</hi>  Yes, Capt. Helm was dead; and with him 
died the law suit. He who had so wronged me, who 
had occasioned me so much suffering and sorrow had 
gone to his account. He who had once been thought 
to be one of the wealthiest as well as one of the 
greatest men in the county, died a pauper  -  neglected 
and despised, and scarcely awarded a decent burial. 
Like his wife, who died such a horrid death, he had 
been reared in affluence and was an inheritor of vast
possessions, but his home was in a slave State; he was
raised on a plantation, and nurtured in the atmosphere 
of Slavery.</p>
        <p>In his youth he had contracted the habit of drinking 
to excess, beside that of gambling, horse-racing and 
the like, which followed him through life. Forgotten 
and scorned in his poverty by many who had partaken 
of his abundance, sipped his wine, and rode his fast 
horses.</p>
        <p>During the last war his princely mansion was ever 
open to the officers of the army, and many a wounded 
soldier has been cheered and comforted by his hospitality. 
But now he is regarded as no better than his 
poorest slave, and lies as lowly as they, in the narrow 
house appointed for all the living.</p>
        <p>My old master had two brothers: the oldest, Thomas
Helm, was a Captain in the United States Army, and 
had been in many hard-fought battles. His younger
<pb id="steward148" n="148"/>
brother, William, was a Captain also; but Thomas 
was the man to awaken curiosity. I have lived with 
him, but never knew of his going unarmed for an 
hour, until he left Virginia and came to Steuben 
County, where he died. When at the South, I have 
seen strangers approach him, but they were invariably 
commanded to “stand” and to “approach him at their 
peril.” He finally came to the State of New York, 
bringing with him his “woman” with whom he lived, 
and two children, with whom he settled on a piece of 
land given him by my old master, where the old 
soldier lived, died, and was buried on one of his small 
“clearings” under an old apple tree. He owned a few 
slaves, but at his death his “woman” collected every 
thing she could, and among the rest, two or three 
slave children, to whom she had no right or claim 
whatever, and made her way to Kentucky. About a 
year ago I visited the spot where the brave old 
defender of his country had been buried, but found 
very little to mark the resting place of the brother of 
my old master. They had passed away. Their wealth, 
power and bravery had come to nought; and no 
tribute was now paid to the memory of one of “Old 
Virginia's best families.” The <hi rend="italics">blood</hi> of which they 
were wont to boast, was now no more revered 
than that which commingled with the African and
circulated in the veins of his despised and downtrodden 
slaves.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XVI.</head>
        <head>BRITISH EMANCIPATION OF SLAVERY.</head>
        <p>As time passed on I found myself progressing in a
profitable business. I had paid for my house 
and lot, and purchased another adjoining, on which I 
had erected a valuable brick building. The Lord 
prospered all my undertakings and I felt grateful for 
my good fortune. I kept all kinds of groceries 
and grain, which met a ready sale; and now I began 
to look about me for a partner in life, to share my 
joys and sorrows, and to assist me on through the 
tempestuous scenes of a life-long voyage. Such a 
companion I found in the intelligent and amiable Miss 
B----, to whom I was married on the eleventh of 
May, 1825. She was the youngest daughter of a 
particular friend, who had traveled extensively and 
was noted for his honesty and intelligence.</p>
        <p>About this time, too, “Sam Patch” made his last
and fatal leap from a scaffold twenty five feet above
<pb id="steward150" n="150"/>
the falls of Genesee, which are ninety-six feet in
height. From thence he plunged into the foaming 
river to rise no more in life. The following spring 
the body of the foolish man was found and buried, 
after having lain several months in the turbulent 
waters of the Genesee.</p>
        <p>This year was also rendered memorable by the
efficient labors of Professor Finney, through whose
faithful preaching of the gospel, many were brought 
to a saving knowledge of the truth.</p>
        <p>The  “Emancipation Act” had now been passed, and
the happy time for it to take effect was drawing nigh.
Slavery could no longer exist in the Empire State nor
receive the protection of her laws. Would to God it
had so continued to be what it professed  -  the refuge
of the bondman and the home of the free. But alas!
Now the flying fugitive from Slavery finds no security
within her borders; he must flee onward, to the
dominion of Queen Victoria, ere he rests, lest the
exaction of the odious “Fugitive Slave Law” return
him to the house of bondage.</p>
        <p>But the Emancipation Bill had been passed, and the
colored people felt it to be a time fit for rejoicing.
They met in different places and determined to evince
their gratitude by a general celebration. In Rochester
they convened in large numbers, and resolved to
celebrate the glorious day of freedom at Johnson's
Square, on the <hi rend="italics">fifth</hi> day of July. This arrangement
<pb id="steward151" n="151"/>
was made so as not to interfere with the white population 
who were everywhere celebrating the day of
their independence  -  “ the Glorious Fourth,”  -  for amid 
the general and joyous shout of liberty, prejudice
had sneeringly raised the finger of scorn at the poor
African, whose iron bands were loosed, not only 
from English oppression, but the more cruel and 
oppressive power of Slavery.</p>
        <p>They met according to previous appointment, Mr.
A. H----, having been chosen president, Mr. H. 
E----, marshal, and Mr. E. D----, reader of the 
“Act of Emancipation,” and “The Declaration of
Independence.” A large audience of both white 
and colored people assembled, and the day which had
been ushered in by the booming cannon, passed by 
in the joyous realization that we were indeed free 
men. To the music of the band the large procession
marched from the square to the hotel, where ample
provision was made for dinner, after listening to 
the following oration, which I had been requested to
deliver.</p>
        <p>I must not omit to mention that on the morning of
that happy day, a committee of colored men waited
upon the Hon. Matthew Brown, and in behalf of the
citizens of Monroe County, presented their thanks for
his noble exertions in the Legislature, in favor of the
Act by which thousands were made free men.</p>
        <p>They were received by that worthy gentlemen
<pb id="steward152" n="152"/>
with grateful and pleasing assurances of his continued
labor in behalf of freedom.</p>
        <p>Now I will lay before the reader my address to the
audience on that eventful day.</p>

      <div1>
        <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
        <head>ORATION  -  TERMINATION OF SLAVERY.</head>
        <p>The age in which we live is characterized in no
ordinary degree, by a certain boldness and 
rapidity in the march of intellectual and political 
improvements. Inventions the most surprising; revolutions 
the most extraordinary, are springing forth, 
and passing in quick succession before us,  -  all tending 
most clearly to the advancement of mankind towards 
that state of earthly perfection and happiness, from 
which they are yet so far distant, but of which their 
nature and that of the world they inhabit, are most 
certainly capable. It is at all times pleasing and instructive 
to look backward by the light of history, and 
forward by the light of analogical reasoning, to behold 
the gradual advancement of man from barbarism to 
civilization, from civilization toward the higher perfections 
of his nature; and to hope  -  nay, confidently believe, 
that the time is not far distant when liberty and
<pb id="steward154" n="154"/>
equal rights being everywhere established, morality 
and the religion of the gospel everywhere diffused,  -  
man shall no longer lift his hand for the oppression of 
his fellow man; but all, mutually assisting and assisted, 
shall move onward throughout the journey of 
human life, like the peaceful caravan across the burning 
sands of Arabia. And never, on this glorious 
anniversary, so often and so deservedly celebrated by 
millions of free men, but which we are to-day for the 
first time called to celebrate  -  never before, has the 
eye been able to survey the past with so much satisfaction, 
or the future with hopes and expectations so 
brilliant and so flattering; it is to us a day of two-fold
joy. We are men, though the strong hand of prejudice 
and oppression is upon us; we can, and we will 
rejoice in the advancement of the rapidly increasing 
happiness of mankind, and especially of our own 
race. We can, and we will rejoice in the growing 
power and glory of the country we inhabit. Although 
Almighty God has not permitted us to remain in the 
land of our forefathers and our own, the glories of 
national independence, and the sweets of civil and religious 
liberty, to their full extent; but the strong hand 
of the spoiler has borne us into a strange land, yet has 
He of His great goodness given us to behold those
best and noblest of his gifts to man, in their fairest 
and loveliest forms; and not only have we beheld 
them, but we have already felt much of their benignant    
<pb id="steward155" n="155"/>
influence. Most of us have hitherto enjoyed
many, very many of the dearest rights of freemen.
Our lives and personal liberties have been held as
sacred and inviolable; the rights of property have
been extended to us, in this land of freedom; our
industry has been, and still is, liberally rewarded; 
and so long as we live under a free and happy government 
which denies us not the protection of its laws, 
why should we fret and vex ourselves because we 
have had no part in framing them, nor anything to do 
with their administration. When the fruits of the
earth are fully afforded us, we do not wantonly refuse
them, nor ungratefully repine because we have done 
nothing towards the cultivation of the tree which produces 
them. No, we accept them with lively gratitude; 
and their sweetness is not embittered by reflecting 
upon he manner in which they were obtained. It is 
the dictate of sound wisdom, then, to enjoy without 
repining, the freedom, privileges, and immunities 
which wise and equal laws have awarded us  -  nay, 
proudly to rejoice and glory in their production, and 
stand ready at all times to defend them at the hazard 
of our lives, and of all that is most dear to us.</p>
        <p>But are we alone shut out and excluded from any
share in the administration of government? Are not
the clergy, a class of men equally ineligible to 
office?  A class of men almost idolized by their
countrymen, ineligible to office! And are we alone
<pb id="steward156" n="156"/>
excluded from what the world chooses to denominate 
polite society? And are not a vast majority of the 
polar race excluded? I know not why, but mankind 
of every age, nation, and complexion have had lower 
classes; and, as a distinction, they have chosen to 
arrange themselves in the grand spectacle of human 
life, like seats in a theater  -  rank above rank, with 
intervals between them. But if any suppose that happiness 
or contentment is confined to any single class, 
or that the high or more splendid order possesses any 
substantial advantage in those respects over their more 
lowly brethren, they must be wholly ignorant of all 
rational enjoyment. For what though the more 
humble orders cannot mingle with the higher on terms 
of equality. This, if rightly considered, is not a 
curse but a blessing. Look around you, my friends: 
what rational enjoyment is not within your reach? 
Your homes are in the noblest country in the world, 
and all of that country which your real happiness 
requires, may at any time be yours. Your industry 
can purchase it; and its righteous laws will secure you 
in its possession. But, to what, my friends, do you owe 
all these blessings? Let not the truth be concealed. 
You owe them to that curse, that bitter scourge of 
Africa, whose partial abolishment you are this day 
convened to celebrate. Slavery has been your curse, 
but it shall become your rejoicing. Like the people 
of God in Egypt, you have been afflicted; but like
<pb id="steward157" n="157"/>
them too, you have been redeemed. You are henceforth 
free as the mountain winds. Why should we, 
on this day of congratulation and joy, turn our view 
upon the origin of African Slavery? Why should
we harrow up our minds by dwelling on the deceit, 
the forcible fraud and treachery that have been so 
long practiced on your hospitable and unsuspecting
countrymen? Why speak of fathers torn from the
bosom of their families, wives from the embraces of
their husbands, children from the protection of their
parents; in fine, of all the tender and endearing
relations of life dissolved and trampled under foot, by
the accursed traffic in human flesh? Why should 
we remember, in joy and exultation, the thousands 
of our countrymen who are to-day, in this land of 
gospel light, this boasted land of civil and religious 
liberty, writhing under the lash and groaning beneath 
the grinding weight of Slavery's chain? I ask, Almighty 
God, are they who do such things thy chosen 
and favorite people? But, away with such thoughts 
as these; we will rejoice, though sobs interrupt the 
songs of our rejoicing, and tears mingle in the cup we 
pledge to Freedom; our harps though they have long 
hung neglected upon the willows, shall this day be 
strung full high to the notes of gladness. On this day, 
in one member at least of this mighty Republic, 
the Slavery of our race has ceased forever! No more
shall the insolent voice of a master be the main-spring
<pb id="steward158" n="158"/>
of our actions, the sole guide of our conduct; no more 
shall <sic>thers</sic> hands labor in degrading and profitless 
servitude. Their toils will henceforth be voluntary, 
and be crowned with the never failing reward of 
industry. Honors and dignities may perhaps never be 
ours; but wealth, virtue, and happiness are all within 
the compass of our moderate exertions. And how 
shall we employ a few moments better than in reflecting 
upon the means by which these are to be obtained. 
For what can be more proper and more profitable to 
one who has just gained an invaluable treasure, than 
to consider how he may use it to the best possible 
advantage? And here I need not tell you that a 
strict observance to all the precepts of the gospel 
ought to be your first and highest aim; for small will 
be the value of all that the present world can bestow, 
if the interests of the world to come are neglected and 
despised. None of you can be ignorant of what the 
gospel teaches. Bibles may easily be obtained; nor
can there be a greater disgrace, or a more shameful 
neglect of duty than for a person of mature age, and 
much more, for any father of a family to be without 
that most precious of all books  -  the Bible. If, therefore, 
any of you are destitute of a Bible, hasten to 
procure one. Will any of you say that it can be of 
no use to you, or that you cannot read it? Look 
then to that noblest of all remedies for this evil, the

<pb id="steward159" n="159"/>
There you may learn without loss of time or money,
that of which none should be ignorant  -  to read.</p>
        <p>Let me exhort you with earnestness to give your
most sincere attention to this matter. It is of the 
utmost importance to every one of you. Let your 
next object be to obtain as soon as may be, a competency 
of the good things of this world; immense 
wealth is not necessary for you, and would but 
diminish your real happiness. Abject poverty is and 
ought to be regarded as the greatest, most terrible of 
all possible evils. It should be shunned as a most 
deadly and damning sin. What then are the means 
by which so dreadful a calamity may be avoided? 
I will tell you, my friends, in these simple words  -  hear 
and ponder on them; write them upon the tablets of 
your memory; they are worthy to be inscribed in 
letters of gold upon every door-post  -  “industry prudence, 
and economy.” Oh! they are words of power 
to guide you to respectability and happiness. Attend, 
then, to some of the laws which industry impose, while 
you have health and strength. Let not the rising sun 
behold you sleeping or indolently lying upon your beds. 
Rise ever with the morning light; and, till sun-set, give 
not an hour to idleness. Say not human nature cannot 
endure it. It can  -  it almost requires it. Sober, diligent, 
and moderate labor does not diminish it, but on 
the contrary, greatly adds to the health, vigor, and
duration of the human frame. Thousands of the
<pb id="steward160" n="160"/>
human race have died prematurely of disease engendered 
by indolence and inactivity. Few, very few 
indeed, have suffered by the too long continuance of 
bodily exertion. As you give the day to labor, so 
devote the night to rest; for who that has drunk and 
reveled all night at a tippling shop, or wandered about 
in search of impious and stolen pleasures, has not by so 
doing not only committed a most heinous and damning 
sin in the sight of Heaven, but rendered himself wholly 
unfit for the proper discharge of the duties of the 
coming day. Nor think that industry or true happiness 
do not go hand in hand; and to him who is
engaged in some useful avocation, time flies delightfully 
and rapidly away. He does not, like the idle 
and  indolent man, number the slow hours with sighs  -   
cursing both himself and them for the tardiness of 
their flight. Ah, my friends, it is utterly impossible 
for him who wastes time in idleness, ever to know 
anything of true happiness. Indolence, poverty, 
wretchedness, are inseparable companions,  -  fly them, 
shun idleness, as from eminent and inevitable destruction. 
In vain will you labor unless prudence and 
economy preside over and direct all your exertions. 
Remember at all times that money even in your own 
hands, is power; with it you may direct as you will 
the actions of your pale, proud brethren. Seek after 
and amass it then, by just and honorable means; and 
once in your hand never part with it but for a full and
<pb id="steward161" n="161"/>
fair equivalent; nor let that equivalent be something
which you do not want, and for which you cannot
obtain more than it cost you. Be watchful and diligent 
and let your mind be fruitful in devises for the
honest advancement of your worldly interest. So 
shall you continually rise in respectability, in rank 
and standing in this so late and so long the land of 
your captivity.</p>
        <p>Above all things refrain from the excessive use of
ardent spirits. There is no evil whose progress is so
imperceptible; and at the same time so sure and deadly, 
as that of intemperance; and by slow degrees it undermines 
health, wealth, and happiness, till all at length 
tumble into one dreadful mass of ruin. If God has 
given you children, he has in so doing imposed upon 
you a most fearful responsibility; believe me, friends, 
you will answer to God for every misfortune suffered, 
and every crime committed by them which right 
education and example could have taught them to 
avoid. Teach them reverence and obedience to the 
laws both of God and man. Teach them sobriety, 
temperance, justice, and truth. Let their minds be 
rightly instructed  -  imbued with kindness and brotherly 
love, charity, and benevolence. Let them possess 
at least so much learning as is to be acquired in the
common schools of the country. In short, let their
welfare be dearer to you than any earthly enjoyment;
so shall they be the richest of earthly blessings.</p>
        <pb id="steward162" n="162"/>
        <p>My countrymen, let us henceforth remember that 
we are men. Let us as one man, on this day resolve 
that henceforth, by continual endeavors to do good to 
all mankind, we will claim for ourselves the attention 
and respect which as men we should possess. So shall 
every good that can be the portion of man, be ours-
this life shall be happy, and the life to come, glorious.</p>

          <p>The opinion of the public regarding the celebration 
and performances of that day, together with the 
behavior of the colored people, will be seen by the 
following short extract from the <hi rend="italics">Rochester Daily Advertiser,</hi> 
published soon after the occurrence of those 
events:</p>
          <div3 type="article">
            <head>“ABOLITION OF SLAVERY.</head>
            <p>“The extinction of that curse by the laws of our 
State, was marked with appropriate rejoicings on the 
part of the African race in this neighborhood. A 
procession of considerable length and respectable 
appearance, preceded by a band of music, moved 
from Brown's Island through the principal streets to 
the public square, yesterday forenoon, where a stage 
and seats were erected, for the speakers and audience. 
The throne of Grace was addressed by the Rev. Mr. 
Allen, a colored clergyman. The act declaring all
<pb id="steward163" n="163"/>
slaves free in this State, on the fourth day of July, 
1827, was read, which was succeeded by the reading 
of the Declaration of Independence and delivery of 
an oration by Mr. Steward. We have heard but one 
opinion from several gentlemen who were present, 
and that was highly complimentary to the composition 
and delivery of the same.</p>
            <p>“The exercises were concluded by a short discourse
from the Rev. Mr. Allen, and the procession moved 
off to partake of an entertainment prepared for the 
occasion. The thing was got up in good order, and 
passed off remarkably well. The conduct of the 
emancipated race was exemplary throughout, and if 
their future enjoyment of freedom be tinctured with 
the prudence that characterized their celebration of its 
attainment, the country will have no reason to mourn 
the philanthropy that set them free.”</p>
          </div3>
          <div3>
            <p>Thus ended our first public celebration of our own 
and our country's freedom. All conducted themselves 
with the strictest propriety and decorum, retiring to 
their homes soberly and in proper season.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XVIII.</head>
        <head>CONDITION OF FREE COLORED PEOPLE.</head>
        <p>Pursuant to a call given in the summer of 
1830, by the colored residents of Philadelphia, 
for a National Convention of their race, I started  in 
company with a friend to attend it; having previously
engaged seats inside Mr. Coe's stage-coach as far as
Utica, N. Y., to which place we had paid our fare the
same as other passengers.</p>
        <p>We rode on to Auburn very pleasantly, but when 
at that place, we with others moved to resume our
seats; we were met by a stern rebuke for presuming 
to seat ourselves on the inside, and were ordered to 
ride on the outside of the coach. In vain we expostulated   
in vain we reminded the driver of the 
agreement, and of our having paid for an inside seat; 
we were told to take the outside of the coach or
remain behind. </p>
        <p>Desiring to attend the convention, we concluded to go
<pb id="steward165" n="165"/>
on, submitting to this rank injustice and dishonesty, 
until our return, when we determined to sue the proprietor 
of that line of stages. An opportunity was 
offered soon after, when I commenced a suit for 
damages against Mr. Sherwood, who was the great 
stage proprietor of those days. He, however, cleared 
himself by declaring that he was in no way responsible 
for the failures of Mr. Coe, to whom I must look
for remuneration. I never found it convenient to sue
Mr. Coe, and so the matter ended.</p>
        <p>We passed through New York City to the place of 
our destination, where we found many of our brethren 
already assembled.</p>
        <p>Philadelphia, which I now saw for the first time, I 
thought the most beautiful and regularly laid out city 
I ever beheld.  Here had lived the peaceable, just, and 
merciful William Penn; and here many of his adherents 
still reside. Here, too, was the place where 
the Rt. Rev. Bishop Allen, the first colored American 
bishop in the United States, had labored so successfully. 
When the Methodists sought to crush by cruel 
prejudice the poor African, he stepped boldly forward
in defence of their cause, which he sustained with 
a zeal and talent ever to be revered.</p>
        <p>Thousands were brought to a knowledge of the 
truth, and induced “to seek first the kingdom of 
heaven and its righteousness,” through his instrumentality. 
Through the benign influence of this good
<pb id="steward166" n="166"/>
man, friends and means were raised for his poor 
brethren, to build houses of worship, where they 
would no more be dragged from their knees when in 
prayer, and told to seat themselves by the door. Oh, 
how much good can one good and faithful man do, 
when devoted to the cause of humanity  -  following in 
the footsteps of the blessed Christ; doing unto others 
as they would be done by; and remembering those in 
bonds as bound with them. What though his skin be 
black as ebony, if the heart of a brother beats in his 
bosom? Oh, that man could judge of character as 
does our Heavenly Father; then would he judge
righteous judgment, and cease to look haughtily down
upon his addicted fellow, because “his skin is colored 
not like his own.”</p>
        <p>We convened at the specified time, and organized 
by appointing Rev. R. Allen, president, A. Steward, 
vice-president, and J. C. Morrell, secretary. The 
convention which continued in session three days, 
was largely attended by all classes of people, and 
many interesting subjects were ably discussed; but 
the most prominent object was the elevation of our 
race. Resolutions were passed calculated to encourage 
our brethren to take some action on the subjects of 
education and mechanism. Agricultural pursuits 
were also recommended;  -  and here allow me to give 
my opinion in favor of the latter, as a means of sustenance 
and real happiness.</p>
        <pb id="steward167" n="167"/>
        <p>I knew many colored farmers, all of whom are well
respected in the neighborhood of their residence. I 
wish I could count them by hundreds; but our people 
mostly flock to cities where they allow themselves to 
be made “hewers of wood and drawers of water;” 
barbers and waiters,  -  when, if they would but retire 
to the country and purchase a piece of land, cultivate 
and improve it, they would be far richer and happier
than they can be in the crowded city. It is a mistaken
idea that there is more prejudice against color in the
country. True, it exists everywhere, but I regard it 
less potent in the country, where a farmer can live less
dependent on his oppressors. The sun will shine, the 
rains descend, and the earth bring forth her increase, 
just as readily for the colored agriculturist as for his 
pale face neighbor. Yes, and our common mother 
Earth will, when life is ended, as readily open her 
bosom to receive your remains in a last embrace, as 
that of the haughty scorner of our rights.</p>
        <p>In the city, however, there is no escape from the
crushing weight of prejudice, to ramble over fields of 
your own cultivation; to forget your sorrows in the 
refreshing air that waves the loaded branches of an 
orchard of your own planting; nor to solace yourself 
with a gambol over the green meadow with your little 
ones. It is all toil, toil, with a burthened heart until 
shadows fall across the hearth stone, and dismal forebodings 
darken the fireside, from whence the weary
<pb id="steward168" n="168"/>
wife retires to refresh herself in broken slumber for 
the renewed toil of another day. Will not my friends 
think of these and many other advantages in favor of 
a country life, and practice accordingly?</p>
        <p>After the close of the convention, I returned to my
business in Rochester.</p>
        <p>Until the discussion, which commenced about this 
time on the subject of temperance, I had been engaged, 
as most other grocers were at that time, in the sale of 
spirituous liquors somewhat extensively. My attention 
had never before been called especially to the subject, 
though I had witnessed some of its direst evils; but 
now, when I saw the matter in its true light, I resolved 
to give it up. I was doing well and making handsome 
profits on the sale of alcoholic beverages. I had 
also experienced a good deal of trouble with it. My 
license allowed me to sell any quantity less than five 
gallons; but it was a fine of twenty-five dollars if 
drunk on the premises,  -  one half of the sum to go to 
the complainant. If a vicious man got out of funds 
it became both easy and common for him to give some 
person a sixpence, half of which was to be spent for 
whisky, which made him a witness for the other, who 
would make immediate complaint, and collect his 
share of the fine. Nor could I prevent men who came 
with bottles, and purchased whisky, from drinking it 
where they pleased; consequently I was often called 
to answer to such complaints.</p>
        <pb id="steward169" n="169"/>
        <p>One morning a man entered my store and called for 
liquor, which the clerk gave him. After drinking it,
he went directly to the office of A. House, Esq., and
entered a complaint against the clerk who had served
him; then stepped out for consultation with his counsel. 
At that moment I arrived at the office of the
magistrate to whom I immediately made complaint
against myself, relating to him also just how the 
event happened. In a few minutes the original complainant 
returned, to whom 'Squire House explained 
that he should have arraigned the proprietor of the 
store, and not the clerk as he had done. Determined 
on making a speculation, however, he demanded a 
precept for myself. The 'Squire, laughing most 
heartily, informed him that he was too late,  -  that Mr. 
Steward had the start of him, having just entered a 
complaint against himself, by which he saves one half 
of the fine. The man walked out, looking rather 
“cheap,” nor did he or others annoy me afterwards by 
making complaints of that kind.</p>
        <p>But now I saw, as never before, the sin of selling
that which would make beasts of men, and only
stopped to inquire what was duty in the matter. All
the arguments in favor of its sale were more forcible 
then than now. All classes of persons used and drank 
the article; and it required more moral courage, to 
relinquish the business than it does now. Nevertheless, 
it appeared plain to my mind, that duty to God 
<pb id="steward170" n="170"/>
and my fellow-men required it, and I cheerfully gave
it up forever.</p>
        <p>I could not conscientiously, nor do I see how any
man can, continue to traffic in this most fruitful source
of pauperism and crime. No benefit whatever arises
from its use as a beverage or from its sale. It is a
curse to the drinker, to the seller, and to the community. 
Those who are licensed venders take from 
the government fifty dollars for every one put into the 
treasury. The money paid for licenses is a very 
meager compensation for the beggary, crime, and 
bloodshed which rum produces. All who have any
knowledge of the statistics of the State, or of our
prison and police records know, that intemperance has 
done more to fill the prisons, work-houses, alms-houses, 
and asylums of the State than all other influences 
combined; and yet men uphold the traffic. Their 
favors are for those who love its use and sale, and 
their anathemas for him who is striving to save a
nation of drunkards from swift destruction; yea, their
own sires, sons, and brothers from the grave of the
inebriate.</p>
        <p>When in Rochester a short time since, soliciting
subscribers for this work, I stepped into a distillery
and asked a man to subscribe for it. He hesitated in
his decision until he took a tumbler and filling it with
brandy, invited me to drink. I thanked him, saying I
never drink brandy. “Never drink ” he growled,
<pb id="steward171" n="171"/>
“then I tell you, sir, that you stand a much better 
chance of being struck by lightning than of getting a 
subscriber here.” Oh, very well; most likely had 
he agreed to take a copy, he would have been sorely 
displeased with my views of the liquor traffic, and 
perhaps with the compliment I have here paid him.</p>
        <p>But in the foregoing remarks I have said but a tithe 
of what my heart feels, when I think of the sufferings
occasioned by drunkenness.</p>
        <p>Even the cup of the burthened slave, writhing in 
his chains and toiling under the lash, is not full of 
bitterness until the demon rum throws in its dregs and 
fills it to overflowing.</p>
        <p>How often does it occur that a passionate master,
heated with wine,  -  mad with himself and all about 
him, pours out his vengeful ire on the head and back 
of some helpless slave, and leaves him weltering in 
his blood! How often may be heard the agonized 
wail of the slave mother, deploring the departure of 
some innocent child that has been lost in gambling, 
while the master was intoxicated!</p>
        <p>How often do the shrieks of the poor but virtuous 
slave girl, ring through the midnight air, as she, pleading 
for death rather than life, rushes screaming away 
from a brutal master, infuriated and drunk! If it is 
a fact, and certainly it is, that the master is thus 
affected by his costly wine; what, think you, will be 
the temper and condition of the coarse and heartless
<pb id="steward172" n="172"/>
overseer who drinks his miserable whisky or bad 
brandy? It is horrible, beyond description. I have 
often myself seen a drunken overseer, after pouring 
down dram after dram, mount his horse anal ride 
furiously among the slaves, beating, bruising, mangling 
with his heavy cowhide every one he chanced to meet, 
until the ground presented the appearance of a battlefield.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XIX.</head>
        <head>PERSECUTION OF THE COLORED PEOPLE.</head>
        <p>While the colored population of New York 
were rejoicing in the measure of freedom 
allowed them by the more wholesome laws 
of that State, our brethren in Ohio were being oppressed and 
maltreated by the unjust and odious “black laws” of 
that professedly free State, enacted with special reference 
to the disposition of the colored race.</p>
        <p>In Cincinnati, O., within sight of the slave land of
Kentucky, a terrible persecution had commenced, and 
an effort was made to drive all colored persons from 
the place.</p>
        <p>Our people had settled there in large numbers, but 
now a mob had assembled in that city with the determination 
to drive them, not only from their homes and 
city, but from the State. A bloody conflict ensued, in 
which the white and black man's blood mingled 
freely. So great had been the loss of property; and
<pb id="steward174" n="174"/>
so horrid and fearful had been the scene, that our 
people chose to leave, rather than remain under such 
untoward circumstances. They lived in constant fear 
of the mob which had so abused and terrified them. 
Families seated at the fireside started at every breath 
of wind, and trembled at the sound of every approaching 
footstep. The father left his family in fear, lest on 
his return from his daily labor, he should find his wife 
and children butchered, and his house left desolate.</p>
        <p>Meetings were held to devise plans and means for
leaving the place where they had been so cruelly 
treated. But where should they go? And why 
should they be compelled to leave the State of Ohio? 
The fact is, that the African race there, as in all parts 
of this nominally free Republic, was looked down 
upon by the white population as being little above the 
brute creation; or, as belonging to some separate class 
of degraded beings, too deficient in intellect to provide 
for their own wants, and must therefore depend on the 
superior ability of their oppressors, to take care of 
them. Indeed, both the time and talents of eminent
men have been wasted in unsuccessful research for the
line of demarkation, between the African and the 
highest order of animals,  - such for instance as the 
monkey or the ourang-outang. Some even, have advanced 
the absurd idea, that wicked Cain transmitted 
to them the ''mark'' which the Almighty set upon 
him for the murder of his brother; and that he, (who
<pb id="steward175" n="175"/>
then must have survived the deluge), is the progenitor 
of that despised and inferior race  -  the negro slave of 
the United States of America!</p>
        <p>If it be true, that the natural inferiority of the black 
man, connects him so closely with the animal creation, 
it looks passing strange to me that he should be made 
responsible for the violation of laws which he has 
been declared too imbecile to aid in framing or of 
comprehending. Nor is it less strange to see him 
enslaved and compelled by his labor to maintain both 
his master and himself, after having declared him 
incapable of doing either. Why not let him go then? 
Why hold with an unyielding grasp, so miserable and 
useless a piece of property? Is it benevolence that
binds him with his master's chain? Judge ye. 
Stranger still is the fact of attaching such vast influence 
to his presence and so much concern regarding 
his movements, when in a state of freedom, if indeed, 
he is of so little worth and consequence, and so nearly 
related to the brutes that perish.</p>
        <p>Surely, the Legislature of Ohio, or of any other 
State, would never feel called upon to sit in grave 
counsel, for the purpose of framing laws which would 
impose fine and imprisonment on a monkey, should 
one chance to locate within its jurisdiction; nor would 
they think it advisable for the court to assemble, or a 
jury to be <sic>empanneled</sic>, to drive from their midst an 
ourang-outang. And yet this and more must be done 
to get rid of the hated negro, who has been born in
<pb id="steward176" n="176"/>
that State, or has fled to it for protection from the 
manstealer.</p>
        <p>When strangers pass hastily through this country, 
and after a careless glance at the colored population, 
report them to be “an indolent, improvident, and 
vicious class of persons,” they should consider some 
of the many obstacles thrown in the way of the most 
favored of that race. Knowing as they do, the rigor 
of the law, and feeling as they do, the oppressive 
power of prejudice, it becomes almost impossible for 
them to rise to that station they were designed to fill, 
and for which their natural abilities as certainly
qualify them, as though they had never been robbed 
of their God-given rights. But let us return to our
tried friends in Cincinnati.</p>
        <p>They finally resolved to collect what they could of 
their possessions and establish a colony in Canada.
In accordance with this resolution, they agreed to first 
send an agent to obtain liberty to settle there, and if 
successful to select and purchase a large tract of land, 
making such arrangements as he thought best for their 
speedy removal to their new home. Israel Lewis was 
their appointed agent, who departed immediately for 
Upper Canada to perform his mission; and there for 
the present we will leave him and return to Rochester.</p>
        <p>Our more favored brethren in New York felt a deep
sympathy for their outraged countrymen in Cincinnati; 
a sympathy equaled only by their indignation 
at the cause of such demand.</p>
        <pb id="steward177" n="177"/>
        <p>A meeting expressive of their news and feelings 
on that subject, was convened in the city of Rochester, 
during which, the following preamble and resolutions 
were read and unanimously adopted:</p>
        <div2>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Whereas,</hi> The city of Cincinnati has again become the scene of 
another dreadful mob and bloodshed, where nothing but terror and 
confusion reigned for a number of hours together.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">And Whereas,</hi> Our brethren and fellow citizens were left exposed 
to the fury of an ungovernable mob, made up of the base, the ignorant, 
and vile, the very dregs of society; arid probably led on by 
slaveholders, who of all melt are the most execrable; while boasting
of liberty, he tramples on the dearest rights of men and in the
greatest robber of it on earth.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That we deprecate an appeal to arms by any class of our 
fellow citizens, except in extreme oases, and we think that such a
case has been presented in the late outrage at Cincinnati.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italcis">Resolved,</hi> That when a class of men so far forget the duty they owe 
to God, their fellow men, and their country, as to trample under their 
feet the very laws they have made, and are in duty bound to obey 
and execute, we believe it to be the duty of our brethren and fellow 
citizens, to protect their lives against such lawless mobs; and if in the 
conflict, any of the mobocrats perish, every good citizen should say
Amen.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That we do truly sympathize with the friends of Gods 
poor; the friends of the oppressed, throughout this boasted land of 
liberty, in the losses they have sustained in consequence of the mob.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That we believe the time is not far distant, when the 
<hi rend="italics">Queen City of the West,</hi> shall be redeemed from the hateful influence 
of the slaveholder; redeemed from that cruel prejudice of caste which 
hangs like a mill-stone around the neck of our people; redeemed 
from all those unequal laws, which have a tendency to make the 
<pb id="steward178" n="178"/>
strong stronger and the weak weaker; redeemed from their false-hearted 
friends, whose sarcastic smile is more to be feared than the 
frowns of an open enemy.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Resolved, </hi>That the untiring exertions of our friends, and the indefatigable 
industry of our brethren, are sure guarantees that the State 
of Ohio will not long be what she now is,  -  a hissing and by-word 
on account of her iniquitous laws; but that she will rise above every 
narrow minded prejudice, and raise up her sable sons and daughters 
and place them on an equality with the rest of her citizens.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That ore deeply deplore the loss our friends have sustained 
in the destruction of their printing press in Cincinnati.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">Resolved,</hi> That we as an oppressed people, feel it our duty to give 
our undivided support to the press and the laborers in our cause.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2>
          <p>Mr. Israel Lewis made his way to Canada, and 
having obtained permission to establish a colony, he
bargained with the Canada Company for one township 
of land, for which he agreed to pay the money
demanded, in a few days, and then returned to Cincinnati, 
by way of Rochester. The poor, persecuted
colored people, had in the mean time made ready for 
their flight from their homes, their native land, and
from this boasted free Republic, to seek a residence in
the cold and dreary wilds of Canada; to claim that
protection from the English government which had 
been denied them in the land of their birth; and like
the overtasked Israelites, “they went out with 
their wives and their little ones,” but with smaller
possessions.</p>
          <p>During the stay of Mr. Lewis in Rochester, he
<pb id="steward179" n="179"/>
reported there and elsewhere, that eleven hundred 
persons were then in the dense woods of Canada in a 
state of actual starvation, and called upon the humane 
everywhere, to assist them in such extreme suffering.</p>
          <p>To me he also told the story of their destitution, 
which affected me deeply. I had at that time just 
made a public profession of my faith in the christian 
religion and my determination to be governed by its 
holy precepts. I felt for the distressed and suffering 
everywhere; but particularly for those who had fled, 
poor and destitute, from cruel task-masters, choosing 
rather the sufferings of cold and hunger, with liberty, 
than the meager necessities of life and Slavery. I 
concluded to go to Canada and try to do some good; 
to be of some little service in the great cause of
humanity.</p>
          <p>As soon as practicable therefore, I left Rochester for
Toronto, the capital of Upper Canada, which I found 
quite a thriving town, and containing some fine brick 
buildings, and some I saw were built of mud, dried in 
the sun, wearing rather a poor than pretty appearance. 
At Toronto we hired a team to take us on to Ancaster, 
fifty miles distant. We traveled now through a new 
country; the roads were very bad, and the inhabitants 
few. We, however, reached Ancaster, a small village, 
where we remained one night and next morning pursued 
our journey to the settlement of the poor fugitives 
from Cincinnati. After some hard traveling, we
<pb id="steward180" n="180"/>
finally arrived at the place where we found our
brethren, it is true, but in quite destitute circumstances. 
Our fare was poor indeed, but as good as 
they could get. The township was one unbroken 
wilderness when purchased for the colony, and of 
course their lands must be cleared of the heavy timber 
before crops could be got in, hence, there was a great 
deal of destitution and suffering before their harvest 
could ripen after the land was prepared for the seed.</p>
          <p>The day after I arrived at the settlement, which
consisted of a few rude log cabins, a meeting was
called to give the township a name. Several were
suggested, but I at length motioned to name it in
honor of the great philanthropist, Wilberforce. This
was carried, and the township from that time has been 
known by that name. It is situated on what is
known as the Huron Tract, Kent County, London
District, and is the next north of the township of
London. Our neighbors on the south, were a company 
of Irish people, who owned the township, and 
on the west side were a township of Welshmen, a 
hardy, industrious and enterprising people.</p>
          <p>In Wilberforce there were no white inhabitants; 
the land appeared level and handsome, with but one
stream of any magnitude running through it; this was
the Oxsable, which was dry during a part of the 
year. All was one vast forest of heavy timber, that 
would compare well with that of Western New York.
<pb id="steward181" n="181"/>
Beech, maple, ash, elm, oak, whitewood, bass, balm
of gilead, &amp;c. The soil was good for corn, wheat, 
rye, oats, and most kinds of the grain and vegetables 
raised in New York, and was a superior grazing
country, about fifteen miles from London. This was 
a village containing perhaps thirty dwellings, and two
hundred inhabitants; a court-house and jail all under
one roof, built of stone and plastered; small doors and
windows in the style of some of the old English
castles. London was built in the forks, or between 
the east and west branches of the river Thames; 
hence, you would hear people speak of “going to the 
forks,” instead of the village; it is about two hundred 
miles from Buffalo, and the nearest port between the 
two is Port Stanley, thirty miles from London.</p>
          <p>I returned from Canada, where I had seen an
oppressed people struggling with the hardships and
privations of a new settlement; I had seen wretchedness 
in some places, but by no means sufficient to
justify the report made by Mr. Lewis, and I determined 
I would remove there with my family, and do 
all in my power to assist the colored people
in Canada.</p>
          <p>I had witnessed a disposition on the part of some 
to prevent our brethren from settling in Wilberforce,
while the colonizationists made a grand argument of
it in favor of their wicked policy. All must see that 
it became a necessity with those who fled to Canada
<pb id="steward182" n="182"/>   
to save themselves from constant abuse or from 
Slavery, and in some instances their lives; and not 
because they admitted the justice of one portion of 
American citizens driving another from their native 
land; nor their right to colonize them anywhere on 
the habitable globe.</p>
          <p>All these things taken into consideration, determined 
me to join them in the enterprise of building 
up an asylum for the oppressed, where our colored 
friends could obtain a home, and where, by their 
industry they could obtain a competency for themselves, 
besides providing a safe retreat for the weary 
fugitive from Slavery; guiding by its beacon light of 
liberty, the destitute and oppressed everywhere, to 
home and plenty.</p>
          <p>I felt willing to make any sacrifice in my power to 
serve my Lord, by administering to the necessities of 
my down-trodden countrymen. How far my desire 
has been accomplished God only knows, but I do 
know that the purest motives influenced me, and an 
honest purpose directed my steps in removing to 
Wilberforce. Not so with all, however. Some there 
were,  Judas-like, who “cared not for the poor; but 
because he was a thief and had the bag, and bare 
what was put therein,” made great exertions for a
time in favor of the settlement. It too soon became
apparent that to make money was the prominent 
object with by far too great a number of the colonists; 
hence. our future difficulties.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
        <head>REMOVAL TO CANADA.</head>
        <p>In 1830, I closed my business in Rochester, preparatory
to leaving for Canada.  Some of my
friends thought I had better remain in the States and
direct emigrants to Wilberforce; while others were
certain I could benefit them more by going myself at
once,  -  the latter I had determined to do; but as the
time drew near for me to start, an unaccountable
gloominess and forebodings of evil took possession of
my mind. Doubts of the practicability of the undertaking 
began to arise, though nothing unfavorable had 
occurred. To the throne of grace, I often bore the 
subject and besought my Heavenly Father to enlighten 
my mind, and direct my steps in duty's path regarding 
it; but to confess the truth, I never received any great 
encouragement from that source, though it occupied 
my mind constantly. During the hours of slumber I 
was continually being startled by frightful dreams,  -  
<pb id="steward184" n="184"/>
sometimes I thought I saw a monstrous serpent as 
large as a log stretched across the road between 
Rochester and the Genesee River; at another I 
thought myself in the air so high that I could have a 
full view of the shores of Lake Ontario, and they 
were alive with snakes; and then I saw a large bird 
like an eagle, rise up out of the water and fly toward 
the south.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding these omens, I turned my steps
toward Wilberforce. In May, 1831, we bid adieu to 
our friends in Rochester, and taking passage to 
Buffalo on a canal boat, we arrived in due time, and 
from whence we sailed for Port Stanley, or as it is 
sometimes called, Kettle Creek. It took a week to 
make this trip, which, with favorable wind might have 
been made in two days. The mouth of the creek
makes a safe harbor at that place, where there is also 
a dock, one ware-house and several farm houses. The 
place was then very wild and picturesque in its appearance; 
we did not stop long, however, to admire its 
beauty, but engaged a farmer to take us on to London. 
Ten miles on our way, and we came to a newly laid 
out village, called St. Thomas, from whence we pursued 
our journey through a new country to London, 
where we arrived tired and hungry, and put up for 
the night with a Mr. Faden. There I purchased a 
span of horses for one hundred and fifty dollars, and 
putting them before a new lumber wagon brought on
<pb id="steward185" n="185"/>
from Rochester, we started for our wild and new home 
in good spirits, at which we arrived in good time.</p>
        <p>The colony was comprised of some fourteen or 
fifteen families, and numbered some over fifty persons 
in all. The first business done after my arrival, was 
to appoint a board of managers, to take the general 
oversight of all the public business of the colony. 
The board consisted of seven men, chosen by the 
settlers, and as I was now one of them, they gave me 
the office of President. It was also resolved by the 
board, to send out two agents for the purpose of soliciting 
aid for the erection of houses for worship, and
for the maintenance of schools in the colony.</p>
        <p>The Rev. N. Paul was chosen one of their agents, 
and he received from me a power of attorney, 
authorizing him to collect funds for the above purposes 
in England, Ireland, and Scotland; the other, I. Lewis 
was empowered to solicit and collect funds for the 
same objects in the United States.</p>
        <p>Preparations were immediately made to fit Mr. Paul 
out for his mission to England, from whence he was to 
remit any funds he might receive to Arthur Tappan, 
of New York City; first to pay for his outfit, and 
afterwards to the treasurer of the board of managers, 
for the support of schools in Wilberforce. Mr. Paul, 
however, still lacked money to proceed to England, 
and therefore went to Rochester, where he found 
my old and tried friend Everard Peck; who was ever
<pb id="steward186" n="186"/>
known as the poor man's friend, and the support of 
the weak everywhere. To this good man, whose 
memory is still dear to thousands, Mr. Paul showed 
his power of attorney, at the same time informing him 
of the condition and wants of the colony; and as was 
ever his wont, when help was needed, his purse, 
(though not one of the heaviest), was at his service. 
Through the kind influence of Mr. Peck, and some of 
the colored friends in that city, a note for seven 
hundred dollars was drawn up, signed by Mr. P. and 
cashed at the Bank, which enabled the agent to
make the voyage without further delay. He reached
England, and collected quite large sums of money, but
entirely failed in the remittance of any sums, either to 
Mr. Tappan or myself. When the note of seven 
hundred dollars became due, Mr. Peck was obliged 
to pay, and lose it. It was out of my power, nor had 
any of the friends the means to do any thing towards 
paying it, inasmuch as they had assisted Paul all they 
could and got nothing in return. There was one 
thing, however, that the reverend gentleman did do,  -  
he wrote me from time to time, to keep me advised of 
the success of his mission, and once informed me that 
he had then twelve hundred dollars on hand; but not 
a farthing could we get. We wrote him again and 
again, reminding him of the bank debt, and the
uneasiness of his friends on account of it, but all to no
purpose,  -  the Atlantic was between us, and he was
<pb id="steward187" n="187"/>
making money too easily, to like to be interrupted. 
He never paid one dollar.</p>
        <p>Let us now look after the other agent, who had 
likewise been fitted out, to prosecute his mission in 
the States. That he collected money professedly for
the assistance of the colony, is too well known to 
require proof, but how much, we could not determine; 
we had reason to believe, however, that he retained 
quite a large sum. He would neither pay it over to 
the board, nor give any account of his proceedings. 
Very little did he ever pay over to the aid of the 
colony as designed. He was frequently written to, 
and every means in our power used, to induce him to 
give some account of his mission, but in vain; he 
would do nothing of the kind. Things went on in 
this way for two years, when it became evident that 
he had no intention of satisfying the minds of the 
settlers; and farther, that he meant to collect what he 
could, and use it as he pleased. We learned too, that 
when abroad, he lived extravagantly, putting up at 
the most expensive hotels, giving parties, and doing 
many things, not only beyond his means, but that 
brought dishonor on the cause and colony. When he 
returned to the settlement, he would, if he had funds, 
make presents to his particular friends instead of 
paying it to the treasurer, as he was pledged to do, 
until the majority of the colony became thoroughly 
disgusted with his heartlessness and dishonesty. It
<pb id="steward188" n="188"/>
was also perceivable that Lewis and Paul both, were
getting weary of the solicitations of the board and
complaints of the settlers, and were anxious to be rid 
of them, and enjoy their ill gotten gains in their own
way.</p>
        <p>It was never intended by the managers, to send out
agents to beg money to be divided among the colonists; 
but to support schools, &amp;c. Most of the settlers 
were able to work and did so; and  were now getting 
along quite pleasantly.</p>
        <p>Finally, after we had tried every means in vain, to 
get a settlement with Lewis, and to obtain his papers, 
there was nothing more we could do, but to warn the 
public against him, by publishing the facts in the 
case; this we did in various newspapers of Canada 
and in the States. An article inserted in the “Rochester 
Observer,” to that effect, was like throwing a 
lighted match into a keg of powder. The excitement 
was intense on the part of Lewis and his friends, who 
were joined by the friends of N. Paul, to destroy, if
they could, the board of managers. I, however, being 
the only member of that devoted board, who happened 
to be extensively known in the States, their anathemas 
were all poured out on me, and all their energies 
brought forward to insure my destruction. They 
were few in number, it is true, but they had money, 
and I had little to spend in litigation; besides, Lewis 
was in debt, and his creditors did not like to see his
<pb id="steward189" n="189"/>
means of paying them swept away. The Canadians
seemed to think there was no harm done if Lewis did
get money out of the “Yankees,” as long as it came
into their hands at last, and so, on the whole, they
raised a tremendous storm, designed, however, to
sweep nobody away but myself; and I have continued 
to this day, notwithstanding all their artful 
malignity.  Nothing, I am persuaded, could have 
saved me from imprisonment at that time, had I not 
possessed a high reputation for truth and honesty 
during my previous sojourn in the colony.</p>
        <p>Lewis had dealt somewhat extensively with Mr.
Jones, who was the principal agent for the Canada
Company; but failing to fulfil his agreement, regarding 
the payment for a large tract of land, it so
exasperated Mr. Jones, that he declared he would
have nothing to do with any of the colored people;
and so when I wanted to buy a lot of lands he would
not sell it to me because he so despised Lewis.</p>
        <p>How much harm can one wicked man do! and yet
it cannot be right to judge the character of a whole
class or community by that of one person.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXI.</head>
        <head>ROUGHING IT THE WILDS OF CANADA.</head>
        <p>The “Canada Company,” of which I have so
frequently spoken, was an association of wealthy
gentlemen, residing in England; something like the
East India Company, especially regarding the title of
lands. They had sent on their agent and purchased a
large tract of land known as the “Huron Tract,”
extending from London to Lake Huron, where they
laid out a village, named Goderich, sixty miles distant
from Wilberforce. With this company, Mr. Lewis 
had contracted for a township of land, as agent for the
Cincinnati refugees; but failing to meet the demand,
the company kindly extended the time of payment;
but when that time also passed without receiving any 
thing from Lewis, the general agent, Mr. Jones 
became so indignant, that he utterly refused to sell a 
foot of land to any colored person whatever. This
<pb id="steward191" n="191"/>
proved to be one of the greatest detriments to the
prosperity of the colony it ever met.</p>
        <p>The Society of Friends at this time, however, with
commendable sympathy for the oppressed and abused
colored residents of Cincinnati, and with their proverbial 
liberality, raised a sum of money sufficient to 
purchase eight hundred acres of land of the Canada 
Company for the benefit of the colony. The funds 
were placed in the hands of one of their number, 
Frederick Stover, who went to Canada as their agent, 
purchased the land, and settled colored people upon it, 
which comprised nearly all of the Wilberforce settlement. 
This occurred before I settled in Canada, and 
the consequence was, when I desired to purchase land, 
none could be obtained. At the time, however, of 
which I am speaking, the Canada Company were 
constructing a road through their possessions, some
seventy miles in length, and the principal contractor, 
Mr. Ingersoll, had agreed to take land in part payment 
for his services on the road. In accordance with 
this agreement, he accepted one lot of land situated 
within the Wilberforce settlement, which he agreed to 
sell to Mr. Lewis for twenty-five dollars. Mr. Lewis, 
knowing that I was anxious to purchase, accepted the 
offer, and then came and showed the contract, offering 
it to me on condition that I paid him the twenty-five 
dollars which he had just paid Mr. Ingersoll. This I 
was glad to do; I paid the demand; took an assignment
<pb id="steward192" n="192"/>
on the back of the receipt, and passed into 
immediate possession of the land. He at the same 
time requested me to take up a note of twenty-five 
dollars for him; which I did, on his promising to 
refund the money in a short time.</p>
        <p>I commenced laboring on the wild land I had purchased; 
cleared some ten acres, which in consequence 
of its being so heavily timbered, cost me at least 
twenty-five dollars per acre; built a house and barn  -  
supposing myself its legal possessor,  -   until I chanced 
to meet Mr. Ingersoll, who informed me that Mr. 
Jones had refused to sell him the land to be disposed 
of to a colored person; that he had duly informed 
Lewis of the fact, and had returned to him the twenty-five 
dollars received. Not a word of this, had Lewis
communicated to me, though he knew I was making
expensive improvements, in the faith that I was its 
only owner. Instead of atoning for the wrong already 
done me, he made it the basis of a deeper injury.</p>
        <p>After one year's residence in Wilberforce, I found 
it necessary to return to Rochester to settle some 
unfinished business; and when on my way thither I 
stopped at London, where I found Lewis, who had 
not only preceded me but had taken out a <hi rend="italics">capias,</hi> for forty pounds currency. I was therefore obliged to get 
bail for my appearance at court, after which I pursued 
my journey.</p>
        <pb id="steward193" n="193"/>
        <p>On my arrival in Rochester, I found business at a 
stand; and the community in a state of excitement 
and alarm, on account of that fell destroyer, the 
cholera. This was its first visit to the United States, 
and the fearful havoc it was making, spread terror and 
consternation throughout the land. I returned to 
Canada; but found on my arrival at London, that 
“the pestilence that walketh at noon-day,” had preceded 
me, and taken from that village my friend, Mr. 
Ingersoll, with several others. So great had been the
alarm, that instead of my appearing at court as I 
expected to do, I found it adjourned, and the judge 
returned to his home.</p>
        <p>I hastened on to Wilberforce, which had fortunately
escaped the fearful scourge, with terrible apprehensions.</p>
        <p>Having a little spare time, I went out with my rifle,
in search of deer; but soon came upon a large wolf, 
which I wounded with the first shot; he, however, 
sprang aside and was gone. On looking about for 
him I espied another!-reloading my rifle, I fired, and 
he fell dead at my feet, while my dog at the same 
time I heard barking furiously. Having dispatched 
this second intruder, I saw that my dog had the first 
one, entangled in the branches of a fallen tree.  I 
searched for my balls, and was vexed to find that I 
had left them at home. In this predicament I cut 
with my knife, a knot from a beech limb, put it in my 
<pb id="steward194" n="194"/>
rifle, and took deadly aim at the enraged wolf. The 
wooden ball struck him between the eyes and killed 
him on the spot.</p>
        <p>The two dead animals, with their skins, I sold for 
nine dollars and a half,  -  making pretty good wages 
for a few hours labor.</p>
        <p>Hunting was very generally pursued by the settlers, 
with great earnestness and considerable skill. The 
forest abounded with deer, wolves, bears, and other 
wild animals. Bears were plenty, and very troublesome 
because so dangerously tame. One day, our 
children had built for themselves a play-house, a few 
rods from the door, and were enjoying their play 
when they were called in to dinner. A moment after, 
I observed one of the settlers gazing intently at the 
play-house; I called to know what so attracted his 
attention, and he informed me that an old bear, with 
three cubs, had just then taken possession of the play-house. 
And sure enough there they were!  knocking 
about among the dishes, and munching the crumbs of 
bread which the children had left. The man was supplied 
with a loaded rifle and urged to shoot them, but
he begged to be excused from a pitched battle with so
many; and the bears leisurely took their departure for 
the woods without molestation. The play-house, 
however, was soon deserted by the children after 
these unbidden guests had made so free with it; and 
we were ourselves somewhat alarmed for the safety
<pb id="steward195" n="195"/>
of our children, who were accustomed to roam in the 
edge of the forest, and make swings of the luxuriant 
grape vines.</p>
        <p>But such incidents are common in a new country,
surrounded as we were by a dense wilderness.</p>

      <div1>
        <head>CHAPTER XXII.</head>
        <head>NARROW ESCAPE OF A SMUGGLER.</head>
        <p>From the time I first settled in Wilberforce, my
house had ever been open to travelers and 
strangers; but a conversation I happened to overhear, 
led me to take a course different from what I had at 
first intended. I was at a public house about twenty 
miles from home, when I heard the landlord advising 
his guest to eat heartily, for, said he, “you will find
nothing more worthy of your attention, until you 
reach Wilberforce. When you arrive at that settlement, 
inquire for A. Steward, from the States, and he 
will give you a meal fit for a prince.” I began to 
reflect on the subject and concluded, inasmuch as 
people would send company to me, it would be better 
to make some preparation for entertaining them. I had 
plenty of furniture, and all I needed was a larger 
supply of food, to commence keeping a tavern. This
<pb id="steward197" n="197"/>
was easily obtained, and I opened a public house 
which was well patronized.</p>
        <p>One day while I was absent from home, a man 
drove to the door the finest span of horses, I think I 
ever saw,  -  black as jet, with proudly arched necks, 
and glossy tails that nearly swept the ground. The 
gentleman sprang from his carriage, bounded through 
the open door, and in the most excited manner, began 
to inquire “who owns this establishment? When 
will he return? Can I be accommodated? Can I see 
your barn?” &amp;c. The stable boy took him to the 
barn, from whence he soon returned; his face flushed, 
and breathing so heavily as to be heard all through 
the apartment; trembling so violently that he could
scarcely speak at all,  -  but made out to inquire, “if 
there was not some place besides the barn where he 
could put his horses?” He was told that there was a 
small shelter built for cows, in bad weather, and the 
next moment he was examining it. In a very short 
time he had his horses and carriage stowed away in 
the cow-shed. He acted like a crazy man; but when 
he had secured his horses, he re-entered the house and 
frankly apologized for his conduct. “I may as well 
tell you the truth,” said he; “I am suspected of 
smuggling goods; a reward is offered for my arrest, 
and the constables are on my track, in pursuit of me. 
My name is Cannouse, and I am from M-----, in 
Ontario County.”</p>
        <pb id="steward198" n="198"/>
        <p>But perhaps they can not prove you guilty of
smuggling, said I, in an after conversation.</p>
        <p>“Ah,” said he, “there is for me no such hope or
probability; I have been engaged for the last few 
months in the sale of dress-goods and broad-cloths, 
and my exposure and flight is the consequence of my 
own folly. While in the village of St. Catharines, I 
took a young girl out to ride, after she had engaged 
to accompany another young fellow, which of course 
offended him; and he being too well posted up on my 
affairs, went directly to the custom house officer and 
informed against me. I was sitting in the parlor,
perfectly at ease, when a young man, a relative of the
young lady in question, burst into the room, shouting, 
'Fly! fly! for your life! The officers are upon you!' 
And I did fly; with barely time to reach the woods, 
for as I sprang through the back door, the officers 
entered through the front door. My horses were my 
first consideration; they had been raised by my father, 
and should I lose them, I should never dare to meet 
him again. In my hasty flight, I engaged the young 
man to conceal them till night. and then to drive them 
to a certain place where I would meet him. This he 
did, and I kept on my flight until I came to the house 
of a friend, where I halted to, make inquiries. The
gentleman had just come from London, and had 
seen handbills at every conspicuous place, describing 
me and my horses. I asked him what I should do?
<pb id="steward199" n="199"/>
He said, ‘you are not safe a moment; there is no 
hope but in flight; avoid the main road, and get to 
the colony if you can; if you succeed, go to A. 
Steward;  he is an upright man and will never betray 
you for money.’ And here I am: if I am arrested, 
six months imprisonment, three hundred dollars fine, 
and the forfeiture of my father's valuable and favorite 
horses, will be my portion. I have had no regular 
meal for the last three days, and my head aches 
violently.”</p>
        <p>We gave him some refreshment, and conducted him 
to a room, assuring him that he should have it to
himself. All remained quiet until midnight, when a 
man knocked cautiously at our door. I opened it 
myself, and a gentleman, looking carefully about the 
place, inquired,</p>
        <p>“Are you full?”</p>
        <p>“No,” said I.</p>
        <p>“Have you any travelers here to night?”</p>
        <p>“Yes.”</p>
        <p>“How many?”</p>
        <p>“Two.”</p>
        <p>“Where are they?”</p>
        <p>“In this room; walk in, sir.”</p>
        <p>He took the light from my hand, and stepping
lightly up to a bed, where two travelers were quietly
sleeping, he closely examined their faces. He soon
returned the light, and without further inquiry retired
<pb id="steward200" n="200"/>
from the house. When his companions came up, I
distinctly heard him tell them that the smuggler was
not there.</p>
        <p>“You may be mistaken,” said the other, “and we
must search the barn for his horses.”</p>
        <p>This they did thoroughly, after procuring a lantern;
but without finding any thing to reward their diligent
search; and they finally drove off.</p>
        <p>When they had gone, Cannouse groaned most
bitterly, and trembled from head to foot at the 
thought of his narrow escape. The next day an 
officer rode up to where the children were playing, 
with a handbill which he read, and inquired if they 
had seen a person bearing that description, pass <hi rend="italics">that day?</hi> They answered negatively, and he rode on. 
The poor frightened Cannouse stayed with us a week; 
and nearly every day during the time, the house and 
barn were searched for him. The children kept 
watch, and when they saw any one coming they 
would let him know, in time to take himself and 
horses into a thicket near by. When he thought 
pursuit was over, he started to leave; but when, in a 
half hour after, a <hi rend="italics">posse</hi> of men drove up to my door, 
flourishing their handbills, I thought it all over with 
Cannouse. I told them that he was not there; but 
they chose to have another search, and when they 
found nothing, the officer sprang into his carriage, 
exclaiming, “come on, boys; we'll soon have him
<pb id="steward201" n="201"/>
now; we have tracked him here, and he can't be far 
off.”</p>
        <p>Cannouse had left us, feeling quite secure; but he 
had traveled but a short distance, when he observed a 
horse shoe loose, and to get it fastened he drove down 
to a blacksmith's shop, which happened to stand at 
the foot of a hill; and between it and the highway 
there had been left standing a clump of trees which 
nearly hid it from view. While there, getting his 
horse shod, the officers passed him unobserved, and 
he finally escaped.</p>
        <p>Some time after, a gentleman called on us who had 
seen Cannouse in Michigan, where he was doing well. 
He had succeeded in reaching Detroit, from whence 
he passed safely to his home; but probably learned a 
lesson not to be forgotten. He was a talented young 
man  -  one who would have felt deeply the disgrace 
of imprisonment,  -  and it was indeed a pleasure to me 
to do what I could, to effect his release from an 
unenviable position. I would never have betrayed 
him; but happily I was not asked directly for him,
until he was gone from my house and protection.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXIII.</head>
        <head>NARRATIVE OF TWO FUGITIVES FROM VIRGINIA.</head>
        <p>The settlers in Wilberforce, were in general, industrious 
and thrifty farmers: they cleared their 
land, sowed grain, planted orchards, raised cattle, and 
in short, showed to the world that they were in no 
way inferior to the white population, when given an 
equal chance with them. In proof of this let me say, 
that it was uniformly the practice of persons traveling 
from London to Goderich, to remain in our settlement 
over night, in preference to going on to find entertainment 
among their own class of people. And we
believe that the whites are bound to admit, that the
experiment of the Wilberforce colony proves that the
colored man can not only take care of himself, but is
capable of improvement; as industrious and intelligent 
as themselves, when the yoke is taken from off 
their necks, and a chance given them to exorcise their 
abilities. True, many of them had just escaped from
<pb id="steward203" n="203"/>
cruel task-masters; ignorant of almost every thing 
but the lash,  -  but the air of freedom so invigorated 
and put new life into their weary bodies, that they 
soon became intelligent and thrifty.</p>
        <p>Among the settlers might be gathered many a 
thrilling narrative, of suffering and hair-breadth 
escapes from the slave-land,  -  one of which I will 
tell as 'twas told to me.</p>
        <p>In a small rude cabin, belonging to one of the large
plantations in Virginia, sat at a late hour of the night, 
an afflicted slave-man and his devoted wife, sad and 
weeping. At length the husband repeated what he 
before had been saying:</p>
        <p>“I tell you, wife, we must flee from this place, without 
delay. Oh, I cannot endure the idea of seeing 
you sold for the Southern market, to say nothing of 
myself; and we shall most likely be separated, which 
I can't bear! Oh, Rosa, the thought distracts me,  -  
I can't bear it!”</p>
        <p>“Are you sure,” said Rosa,“ that master thinks of 
such a frightful doom for us?”</p>
        <p>“Oh yes, I know it; I heard master to-day making 
a bargain with the slave dealer that has been hanging 
about here so long; and when it was finished, I heard 
him reading over the list, and our names, wife, are 
the first on it.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, dear!” sobbed the wife, “we shall certainly
<pb id="steward204" n="204"/>
be retaken and whipped to death ; or else we shall 
starve in the wilderness! Oh, it is very hard to be 
compelled to leave all our friends and the old plantation 
where we were born!”</p>
        <p>“Yes; it is both hard and unjust,” said Joe, and an
indignant frown contracted his brow,  -  “here is our 
birth-place, and here, for forty years have I toiled 
early and late to enrich my master; and you, my poor 
wife, a few years less; and now we are to be sold, 
separated, and all without a choice of our own. We 
must go, Rosa. If we die, let us die together!”</p>
        <p>“It shall be as you say, Joe,” she replied, “but it
frightens me to think of the hardships of the way, 
and the danger of being recaptured.”</p>
        <p>“Courage, wife: no fate can be worse than the one
designed for us; and we have no time to lose. Tomorrow 
night, then, we must make the first effort to 
gain our liberty, and leave all that is dear to us except 
each other! ” And they retired to rest, but not to 
sleep.</p>
        <p>The following night was very dark; and as soon as 
all was quiet on the plantation, they stole out of their 
cabin and stealthily crept over the ground until they
reached the highway; and then, guided only by the 
north star, they made their way to the nearest woods. 
So fearful had they been of being suspected, that they 
took no provision of any kind with them. All night
<pb id="steward205" n="205"/>
they plunged forward through the tangled thicket and
under-brush, surrounded by thick darkness, glancing 
now and then upward to their only light,</p>
        <lg>
          <l>“Star of the North! though night winds drift the fleecy
drapery of the sky,</l>
          <l>Between thy lamp and thee, I lift, yea, lift with hope
my sleepless eye.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>When day dawned they threw their weary bodies 
on the ground, famished and thirsty, and waited for 
the darkness to again conceal them while they pursued 
their journey. The second day of their flight, the 
pain of hunger became almost beyond endurance. 
They found a few roots which relieved them a little; 
but frequently they lost their way, and becoming bewildered, 
knew not which way to go; they pushed on, 
however, determined to keep as far from their pursuers 
as possible. Their shoes were soon worn out; but
bare-footed, bare-headed, and famishing with hunger, 
they pressed forward, until the fourth day, when they 
found themselves too weak to proceed further. Hope, 
the anchor of the soul, had failed them! They 
were starving in a dense forest! No track or path 
could they find, and even had they seen a human 
being, they would have been more terrified than at 
the sight of a wild beast!</p>
        <p>Poor Rosa, could go no farther  -  her strength was 
all gone  -  and as her emaciated husband laid her on
<pb id="steward206" n="206"/>
the cold earth, he exclaimed, “Oh, dear God! <hi rend="italics">must</hi> we, after all our efforts, starve in this dark wilderness!  
Beside his fainting wife, he finally stretched 
himself, sheltered only by a few bushes, and tried to 
compose himself to die! but resting a few moments 
revived him, and he aroused himself, to make one 
more effort for life! “Stay you here, wife, and I will 
try once more to find the highway; it cannot be far 
from here; and if I am taken, I will submit to my fate 
without a struggle; we can but die.” So saying, he 
left her, and began to reconnoitre the country around 
them. Much sooner than he expected he emerged 
from the wood, and not far distant he saw a house in 
the direction from whence he came; being, however, 
as most of the slaves are, superstitious, he thought it 
would be a bad omen to turn backward, and so
continued to look about him. It seemed, he said, that 
some unseen power held him, for though starving as 
he was, he could not take a step in that direction; and 
at last as he turned around, to his great joy, he saw 
another dwelling a little way off, and toward that he 
hastened his now lightened footsteps. With a palpitating 
heart, he approached the door and knocked 
cautiously. The man of the house opened it, and as 
soon as he saw him, he said, “You are a fugitive slave, 
but be not alarmed, come in; no harm shall befall you 
here; I shall not inquire from whence you came; it is 
enough for me to know that you are a human being
<pb id="steward207" n="207"/>
in distress; consider me your friend, and let me know 
your wants.”</p>
        <p>“Bread! Oh, for a morsel of bread!” said the 
famished creature, while his hitherto wild and sunken 
eyes, began to distil grateful tears.  The “good 
Samaritan” stepped to another apartment and brought 
him a piece of bread, which he expected to see him 
devour at once, but instead, he looked at it wistfully, 
literally devouring it with his eyes; turned it over 
and over, and at last stammered out, “my good master, 
without a piece of bread for my poor starving wife, I 
can never swallow this, tempting as it is.”</p>
        <p>“Poor man,” said his benefactor, “can it be that 
you have a wife with you, wretched as yourself?” 
He brought out a loaf of bread, some cheese and meat, 
and while the fugitive was preparing to return, the 
kind gentleman said, “I am glad you came to me; 
had you called at the house you first saw, you would 
have been betrayed, and immediately arrested. You 
must remember,” he continued, “that you are young 
and valuable slaves, and that your master will make 
every effort in his power to find you, especially since 
he has made a sale of you. To-day and to-night, 
remain in the woods, and the next morning you 
may come to me, if all is quiet; should I see danger 
approaching you, I will warn you of it by the crack 
my rifle. Go now, to your poor wife, and listen for 
the signal of danger; if you hear none, come to me at
<pb id="steward208" n="208"/>
the appointed time.” He returned, and after feeding 
his helpless Rosa, she revived, and soon felt quite 
comfortable and grateful.</p>
        <p>When the morning came for them to leave their
retreat, they listened intently, but hearing nothing,
Joe started for the residence of his friend. He had
been gone but a short time, when his wife, who lay in
the bushes, thought she heard the tramp of horses,  -  
she crept nearer the highway, and peeping through
the bush  -  Oh, horror! what was her consternation
and sickening fear, to find herself gazing upon the
well-known features of her old master, and two of
his neighbors, all armed to the teeth! Her heart
seemed to stand still, and the blood to chill in her
veins. Had she been discovered she would have been
an easy prey, for she declared that she could not move
a step. In the meantime her husband had got about
half way to the residence of his preserver, when his
quick ear detected the sound made by the feet of
horses, and as he stopped to listen more intently, the
sharp crack of a rifle sent him bounding back to his
concealment in the forest.</p>
        <p>The party of horsemen rode on to the dwelling of 
the kind hearted gentleman, and inquired whether he 
had seen any fugitive slaves pass that way.</p>
        <p>“I saw,” said he, “a man and woman passing 
rapidly along the road, but do not know whether 
they were fugitives, as I did not see their faces.” The
<pb id="steward209" n="209"/>
human blood-hound, thanked the gentleman for the
information, and immediately set out in pursuit; but, 
just as the informant had intended, in a direction 
<hi rend="italics">opposite</hi> to that the slaves had taken. That night, Joe 
and Rosa visited the house of their benefactor, where 
they were supplied with clothing and as much food 
as they could carry; and next day they went an their 
way rejoicing. They settled in Cincinnati, where they 
lived happily, until the mob drove them with others, 
to the Wilberforce settlement, where they are in no 
danger of the auction block, or of a Southern market; 
and are as much devoted to each other as ever.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXIV.</head>
        <head>PLEASANT RE-UNION OF OLD AND TRIED FRIENDS.</head>
        <p>It is well known to those who have assisted in
clearing land in a new country, that bears, who 
are not Jews, are very troublesome, and levy a heavy 
tax on the settlers, to supply themselves with pork  -  
their favorite food. One old bear in particular, had 
for a long time annoyed the colonists, by robbing their 
hog-stys almost every night. We failed in all our 
plans to destroy his fife, until a woman saw him one 
day, walking at ease through the settlement. A half 
dozen of us gave chase immediately, and came up 
with him after traveling two miles. So anxious was I 
to kill him, that I fired at first sight and missed him, 
which gave us another two miles chase. When, however, 
we came up, he was seated on a branch of a tree,
leisurely surveying us and the dogs, with great complacency. 
The contents of my rifle brought him to the 
ground, and stirred his blood for battle. One blow
<pb id="steward211" n="211"/>
from his powerful paw, sent my fine greyhound some 
yards distant, sprawling upon the ground, and when 
he renewed the attack, Bruin met him with extended 
jaws, taking and munching his head in his mouth. 
My rifle was now reloaded, and the second shot killed 
him on the spot. We tied his legs together, and lifting 
him on a pole, marched in triumph into the settlement, 
where guns were discharged and cheers given, 
in approbation of our success.</p>
        <p>One winter's evening we had drawn closely around 
the blazing fire, for the air was piercing cold without, 
and the snow four feet deep on a level. Now and 
then, a traveler might be seen on snow-shoes; but 
though our cabin was situated on the king's highway, 
we seldom saw company on such a night as this. 
While the wind whistled, and the snow drifted about 
our dwelling, we piled the wood higher in our ample 
fire-place, and seated ourselves again, to resume the 
conversation, when I was startled by a loud and 
furious knocking at the door. I opened it to what I
supposed to be three Indians. Their costume was 
that of the red man; but the voice of him who 
addressed me was not that of an Indian. “Can you 
keep three poor devils here to night?” said he, and 
when I made further inquiry, he repeated the same 
question; “we can sleep,” he continued, “on the soft 
side of a board; only give us poor devils a shelter.”</p>
        <p>I told him we were not accustomed to turn away
<pb id="steward212" n="212"/>
any one on such a night; that they were welcome to
come in; and they were soon seated around our large
and cheerful fire.</p>
        <p>They had laid aside their snow-shoes and knap-sacks, 
and the heat of the fire soon made their
blankets uncomfortable; but as one of them made a
move to throw it off, another was heard to whisper,
“wait a little; we are among strangers, you know; so
do not make a display of yourself'' The fellow drew
his blanket about him; but we had heard and seen
enough to awaken curiosity, if not suspicion. In
passing out of the room soon after, I heard one of
these pretended Indians say to his companion, “I
know these folks are from the States, for I smell
coffee.” When they finally sat down to table, and saw
silver upon it, they cast surprised and knowing
glances at each other, all of which we closely observed, 
and were convinced, that they were not red men
of the forest, but belonged to that race who had so
long looked haughtily down upon the colored people;
that the least exhibition of comfort, or show of refinement 
astonished them beyond measure.</p>
        <p>In the meantime, my wife had whispered to me 
that she was sure that the principal speaker eras no 
other than the aristocratic Mr. G----, of Canandaigua. 
I could not believe it; I could not recognize 
in that savage costume, one who had been bred in 
affluence, and “the star” of genteel society. But my
<pb id="steward213" n="213"/>
wife soon developed the affair to our mutual satisfaction: 
G-----, on taking from her a cup of coffee, 
remarked, “this looks good; and I have had no good 
coffee since I left my mother's house.”</p>
        <p>“Does your mother still reside in C-----?” asked Mrs.
Steward.</p>
        <p>“My mother! my mother! what do you know of 
my mother!” said he, looking sharply at her; but 
observing that they were recognized, they began to 
laugh, and we had a hearty congratulation all round; 
while G----, starting up from table, exclaimed, 
“Come, boys, off with this disguise; we are among 
friends now.”</p>
        <p>Our Indian guests, now appeared in costume more 
like “Broadway dandies,” than savages. Dressed in 
the finest cloth, with gold chains and repeaters; and 
all that constituted the toilet of a gentleman. After 
tea they requested to dry some costly furs, which they 
took from their knapsacks and hung around the fire. 
The following day they took their leave, with many 
apologies and explanations, regarding their appearance 
and conduct. They were in the wilderness, they said, 
trading for very valuable furs; they had money, 
jewelry and rich goods, which they had taken that 
method to conceal.</p>
        <p>During all this time, there had been another visitor 
in the house, who was sitting in a corner, absorbed in
writing. Our mock Indians had noticed him, and not
<pb id="steward214" n="214"/>
knowing who he was, expressed a determination “to 
quiz that deaf old devil,” after supper. We all 
seated ourselves around the fire, and our Canandaigua 
friends, though no longer savages, had not forgotten 
the silent man in the corner; they began to question 
him, and he aroused himself for conversation; nor 
was it long before they forgot their design to quiz 
him, and found themselves charmed listeners to the 
brilliant conversation, of that world-renowned champion 
of humanity, Benjamin Lundy, for he it was.</p>
        <p>On this particular evening, he gave us a sketch of 
his journey to Hayti; to accompany there and settle 
some emancipated slaves; which I thought very interesting, 
and as I have never seen it in print I will here 
relate it, as near as I can, in his own words:</p>
        <p>In the State of Maryland, there lived a slaveholder, 
the proprietor of some sixty slaves, and being somewhat 
advanced in years, he determined to free them, 
in accordance with the laws of that State, which 
required that they be sent out of it.</p>
        <p>He had thought the matter over, but being undecided 
where to send them, he sent for Mr. Lundy to 
assist him in his proposed plan; who was only too 
glad to comply with a request calculated to carry out 
his own plans of philanthropy and equal rights.</p>
        <p>When he had listened to the suggestions and expressed 
desires of the planter, he offered his arguments 
in favor of the West India Islands; and it was
<pb id="steward215" n="215"/>
decided to send them to Hayti, as their future place of
residence.</p>
        <p>Six weeks were allowed for preparations; then Mr.
Lundy was to return and take charge of them on the
voyage, and see them settled in their new homes.</p>
        <p>When the appointed time arrived, Mr. Lundy was
there to accompany them on board a vessel bound for 
Hayti; on which was furnished as comfortable quarters, 
as the kindness of their conscientious master and 
his own benevolent heart could suggest. When all 
was ready, the Christian master came on board, to 
take leave of those faithful servants,  -  many of whom 
had served him from their childhood, and all of whom 
he had bound to his heart by kindness and Christian 
benevolence. It was a sad parting; not because the 
slaves did not love liberty, but because they appreciated 
their master's kind forbearance, and solicitude for 
their future welfare. He had ever been a humane and 
indulgent master; one who lightened the burthen of 
the poor slave, all in his power. A moment's reflection 
will show, that it is invariably this conscientious kind 
of slaveholders, who are induced to emancipate their
slaves; and not the avaricious, cruel tyrant, who neither
fears God nor regards his fellow man.</p>
        <p>The master of the slaves had kindly informed them 
of his intentions,  -  of the probable length of the 
voyage, and the unavoidable sickness they would 
experience, &amp;c. but now, they were gazing up into
<pb id="steward216" n="216"/>
his kind face for the last time, as he knelt in prayer,
commending that numerous flock  -  raised on his own
plantation  -  to the care and protection of Almighty 
God, beseeching Him to protect them in the storm 
and dangers of the ocean; to guide them through this 
life, and save them in the world to come; until the 
sobs and cries of the poor slaves drowned his utterance. 
He at length took his final leave of them, and 
of Mr. Lundy; and the ship sailed immediately. 
They, however, met storms and adverse winds, which 
detained them; and then the poor, ignorant slaves 
began to believe what they had before suspected: that 
this was only some wicked plan of Mr. Lundy's, laid 
to entice them away from a kind master, and to plunge 
them into some dreadful degradation and suffering. 
“Master” had not told them of the adverse winds, and 
they were certain that some mischief was intended; 
they grew sullen and disobedient; and notwithstanding 
the kindness of Mr. Lundy, they murmured and complained, 
until his kind heart sank within him; still he 
pursued the even tenor of his way, trusting in God 
for deliverance. He watched over them in sickness, 
and administered to all their wants; but his tender
solicitude for their health and comfort, only excited
suspicion, and increased their ungrateful ill humor.</p>
        <p>One pleasant evening, Mr. Lundy paced the deck 
in deep thought. He was sad, and well nigh hopeless. 
He had seen enough in the fierce look and sullen
<pb id="steward217" n="217"/>
scowl; and had heard enough of the bitterness, and
threatening anger of the negroes, to know that a storm
was gathering, which must soon burst in all its wild
fury over his devoted head. He was a small, feeble
man, compared with those who watched his every
movement, and gnashed their teeth upon him so
fiercely. None but the Almighty could save him 
now; and to Him who “rides upon the wings of the 
wind, and maketh the clouds His chariot,” he drew 
near in fervent prayer; after which he retired in peace 
and confidence to his berth. During the night, a fine 
breeze sprang up; and when he went on deck the 
next morning, they were in sight of the luxuriant 
shore of Hayti! The officers of the island boarded 
the ship; but their language was unintelligible to the 
negroes, who still looked daggers at every one who 
spoke. They landed; but the fearful, and ungrateful 
slaves continued sullen and forbidding. Mr. Lundy 
left them, however, and went into the country, where 
he selected their future residence; and made every 
preparation for their comfort and convenience in his 
power; saw them conveyed to their neat, pleasant 
homes, and all happily settled. This work was accomplished; 
and he merely called to bid adieu to his 
ungrateful charge, when he found that one of the 
slaves had been appointed to speak to him, in behalf 
of the whole number, and confess how deeply they 
had wronged him. While they were conversing, the
<pb id="steward218" n="218"/>
others gathered around, with tears and prayers for
forgiveness; and finally fell at his feet, imploring
pardon for themselves, and blessings on the kind,
patient and humane Benjamin Lundy. He hurried 
from the affecting scene, and soon after returned to
America.</p>
        <p>Thus that cold evening passed more pleasantly
away in our rude cabin; and our Canandaigua
gentlemen, after an agreeable acquaintance, and pleasant 
chat with Mr. Lundy, retired for the night  -  not 
like savages, but like gentlemen as they were; and I 
doubt not, with a more exalted opinion of “the deaf 
old devil in the corner.”</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXV.</head>
        <head>PRIVATE LOSSES AND PRIVATE DIFFICULTIES.</head>
        <p>Soon after settling in Wilberforce, I found that 
the rumor I had heard in the States, concerning 
the refusal to sell land to colored persons, was literally 
correct, and my farm being too small to yield a support 
for my family, and knowing it would be useless 
to apply for more land, I engaged to carry packages 
for different merchants in the adjoining villages, as 
well as to and from the settlement. Possessing a pair 
of excellent horses and a good wagon, I found it a 
profitable business, and the only one I could well do, 
to eke out the proceeds of my farm, and meet my 
expenses.</p>
        <p>One day as I was returning from the village, one of 
my horses was taken suddenly ill. I took him to 
a tavern near by, and as I could discover no cause for 
his illness, I concluded to leave him a few days, supposing
<pb id="steward220" n="220"/>
rest would soon restore him. I accordingly 
hired another horse, and returned to the colony. In 
a day or two after, I collected my packages as usual, 
and started on my route, designing to leave the hired 
horse and take my own; but when I arrived at the 
tavern, I found some Indians engaged in taking off 
the hide and shoes of my poor, dead horse. This was 
indeed, a great loss to me; but I consoled myself with 
the thought that I had one good horse left, yet he 
would hardly be sufficient to accomplish alone, the
labor I had engaged to perform; nor had I the means 
to spare, to purchase another. I therefore hired one, 
and commenced business again, with the determination 
to make up my loss by renewed diligence and perseverance, 
I started in good spirits; but had proceeded 
but a few miles, when my remaining horse, which I 
had supposed perfectly sound, reeled and fell in the 
harness! And before I could relieve him of it, my 
noble animal and faithful servant, had breathed his 
last! Without a struggle or a movement he lay lifeless 
on the cold earth. I was sad. I deplored the 
loss of my good, and valuable team; but more the 
mystery and suspicion that hung over the event. I 
returned home and sat down to devise some plan of 
procedure. What could I do? Half the means of 
our support had been suddenly and mysteriously 
snatched from us. What could I do next? While 
thus ruminating, I arose to answer a summons at the
<pb id="steward221" n="221"/>
door, and who should enter but Mr. B. Paul, a brother 
to our foreign agent, who had so long <sic>absented</sic>
 himself from our house, that I was indeed surprised 
to see him at this time. He, however, seated himself, 
with great apparent concern for my recent loss, which 
he soon made the subject of conversation and the 
object of his visit.</p>
        <p>“There has been,” said he, “a great deal of unpleasant 
feeling, and injudicious speaking on both 
sides, for which I am heartily sorry. The colony is 
too weak to sustain a division of feelings; and now, 
that your recent losses have left you in a far less 
favorable condition to sustain yourself and family, I 
have called to make a settlement of our former difficulties, 
and to offer you two hundred and fifty dollars 
out of the collections for the colony.”</p>
        <p>I saw through the plan at once, and considered it 
only a bribe, to prevent my exposing the iniquity of 
others. Should I consent to take a part of the ill-gotten 
spoils, with what confidence could I attempt to 
stay the hand of the spoiler. I wanted money very 
much, it is true; but after a moment's reflection, not 
enough to sanction the manner in which it had been 
obtained; and though I confess, the offer presented to 
me a strong temptation, I am thankful that I was 
enabled to resist it. I refused to accept the money; 
and after sending away the tempter and his offered
<pb id="steward222" n="222"/>
gain, I felt my heart lighter, and my conscience more 
peaceful than is often the lot of sinful, erring man in 
this world of trial and conflict; and yet I could but 
feel that the mystery in which the death of my horses 
was involved, was partially at least, explained.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXVI.</head>
        <head>INCIDENTS AND PECULIARITIES OF THE INDIANS.</head>
        <p>During our residence in Canada, we were often
visited by the Indians, which gave us an opportunity 
to learn their character, habits and disposition; 
and some incidents illustrative of the peculiarities of 
that abused people, I will here mention.</p>
        <p>I recollect one bitter cold night, about eleven
o'clock, I happened to awake, and looking out toward
the fire, I was surprised to see standing there, erect
and quiet, a tall, brawny Indian, wrapped in his
blanket; his long hunting knife and tomahawk dangling 
from his belt; and his rifle in his hand. Had he 
been in his own wigwam, he could not have looked 
about him with more satisfaction and independence. I 
instantly sprang to my feet, and demanded his errand.</p>
        <p>“Me lost in the woods, and me come to stay all
night,” was his grave reply. </p>
        <p>“Then,” said I, “give me your weapons, and I will
<pb id="steward224" n="224"/>
make no objection.” He disarmed himself, and gave
his weapons to me, with an air of haughty disdain for
my fears. I put them in a place of safety and then
prepared his bed, which was nothing more than the
floor, where they choose to sleep, with their head to
the fire. My offer of anything different from this he
proudly resented as an insult to his powers of endurance, 
and would say, “beds for pale faces and women;
hard board for Indians.” He threw himself down,
drew his blanket about him, and was soon sleeping
soundly. As soon as the day began to dawn, he was 
up, called for his arms, and after thanking me in the 
brief Indian style of politeness, departed for the 
forest. He had found our doors all fastened, save a low
back door, through which he entered, passing through
a back room so full of miscellaneous articles, that it
was difficult to go through it in the day time without
upsetting something; but the Indian understood all
this, he made no noise, nor would he have spoken at 
all, had I not awakened; and yet, he would have
scorned to injure any one beneath the roof that gave
him shelter, unless he had been intoxicated.</p>
        <p>One sabbath afternoon, one of my children was
sitting in the door, when a tall, emaciated Indian came
up and said, “Will my little lady please to give me
a drink of water?” While she went for it, I invited
him to a seat within. There was something dignified
and commanding in his appearance, and something in
<pb id="steward225" n="225"/>
his voice and countenance, that won my confidence 
and respect at once. He remained in the place some 
time, and I learned his history.</p>
        <p>In his younger days he had been a great warrior; 
and even now, when recounting, as he often did, the 
scenes of the battle field, his eye would burn with 
savage fire, lighting up his whole countenance with 
the fiercest kind of bravery, and often with a hideous 
yell that would startle our very souls, he would burst 
from the room and bound over the fields and forest, 
with the fleetness of a deer  -  making the woods ring 
with his frightful war-cry, until the blood seemed 
ready to curdle in our veins. He had also been 
one of the famous Tecumseh's braves; and had stood 
by him when he fell on the fifth of October, 1813.
This old brave, whenever he called the name of 
Tecumseh, bowed his head reverently; and would 
often try to tell us how very deeply they mourned 
when it could no longer be doubted that the brave 
heart of Tecumseh, brother of the celebrated Wabash 
prophet, had ceased to beat.</p>
        <p>“Had an arrow pierced the sun and brought it to 
my feet,” said the old warrior, “I could not have been 
more astounded than at the fall of Tecumseh. Then 
he told us that once, after a great and victorious battle, 
Tecumseh, in his war paint and feathers, stood in 
the midst of his braves, when a little pale faced girl made 
her way weeping to him and said, “My mother is
<pb id="steward226" n="226"/>
very ill, and your men are abusing her, and refuse to
go away.” “Never,” said the Indian, “did I see a
frown so terrible on the face of Tecumseh, as at that
moment; when he with one hand clutched his tomahawk, 
and with the other led the little girl to the
scene of riot. He approached the unruly savages 
with uplifted tomahawk, its edge glittering like silver, 
and with one shout of ‘begone!’ they scattered as 
though a thunderbolt had fallen in their midst.”</p>
        <p>But the old warrior at Wilberforce fought no more
battles, except in imagination those of the past. After
peace was declared he bought a valuable piece of land, 
with the intention of spending the remainder of his 
life more quietly; but unfortunately there lived not
far from him a man who had once been the possessor
of that farm, and had lost it in some way, and was
now in reduced circumstances.</p>
        <p>He was both envious and vicious; and because he
could not himself buy the land, he was determined
that the old Indian should not have it. After having
tried many ways to get it from him, he finally complained 
of him, for fighting for the British and against 
the country where he now resided. This was successful; 
he was arrested and thrown into prison, and  
without a trial, removed from one prison to another, 
until he, with several others, was sent South to be tried 
as traitors. While on the way, the keeper of this 
Indian wished to call on his mother, who lived in a
<pb id="steward227" n="227"/>
little cottage by the roadside, to bid her farewell. She 
was an aged woman, and when her son left her to join 
his companions, she followed him to the door weeping,
wringing her hands in great distress, and imploring 
the widow's God to protect her only son. She had had 
four; all of whom went forth, with an American 
mother's blessing, to fight in defence of their country; 
and this one alone, returned alive from the field of 
battle. Now as he took his final departure for the 
South, she clasped her hands, raised her tearful eyes to 
heaven, and while large drops rolled over her wrinkled 
cheeks, she cried, “Oh, God, protect my only one, and 
return him to me in safety, ere I die.” This scene, the 
imprisoned, and as some supposed, heartless Indian, 
watched with interest; no part of it escaped his attention; 
but they passed on, and safely reached Detroit.
The prisoners were conducted to a hotel and secured 
for the night; our Indian hero being consigned to an
attic, which they supposed a safe place for him. There
happened to be on that night, a company of showman
stopping at that hotel, and exhibiting wax-work; 
among the rest, was a figure of General Brock, who 
fell at Queenston Heights, and a costly cloak of fur, 
worn by the General previous to his death. Nothing 
of this escaped the eagle-eye and quick ear of the 
Indian. When all was quiet in the hotel, he commenced 
operations, for he had made up his mind to 
leave, which with the red man is paramount to an
<pb id="steward228" n="228"/>
accomplishment of his design. He found no great 
difficulty in removing the window of his lofty apartment, 
out of which he clambered, and with the agility 
of a squirrel and the caution of a cat, he sprang for 
the conductor and on it he slid to the ground. He was 
now free to go where he pleased; but he had heard 
something about the cloak of Gen. Brock; he knew 
too, that the friends of the General had offered fifty
guineas for it, and now he would just convey it to 
them.</p>
        <p>With the sagacity of his race, he surveyed the hotel, 
and determined the exact location of the show-room. 
Stealthily and noiselessly, he entered it; found the 
cloak-took it and departed, chuckling at his good 
fortune. As he was creeping out of the apartment 
with his booty, a thought struck him, which not only
arrested his footsteps, but nearly <sic>paralized</sic> his whole 
being. Would not his keeper be made to answer, and 
perhaps to suffer for his escape and theft? Of course 
he would. “Then in the darkness I saw again,” said 
the old brave, “that old pale-faced mother, weeping 
for the loss of her only son,” when he immediately 
returned the cloak to its place, and with far more 
difficulty than in his descent, he succeeded in reaching 
his attic prison, where he laid himself down, muttering 
to himself, “not yet,  -  poor old pale-face got but 
one.”</p>
        <p>They took him to Virginia, where, instead of a trial,
<pb id="steward229" n="229"/>
they gave him about the same liberty they do their 
slaves. He <sic>staid</sic> one winter; but when the spring 
opened, the fire of the red man took possession of him, 
and when sent to the forest to chop wood, he took a 
bee-line for his former residence. But what was he to 
do for food? With a rifle, he could live happily in 
the woods, but he had none; so after considering the 
matter, he said to himself, “Me <hi rend="italics">must</hi> get a rifle,” and 
instantly started for the highway. The first cabin he 
saw, he entered in great apparent excitement, and told
the woman of the house, that he had seen a “big 
deer in  the woods, and wanted a rifle to shoot it.
When you hear my gun,” he said, “then you come 
and get big deer.” She gave him her husband's 
excellent rifle and a few bullets; he looked at them, 
and said he must have more, for “it was a big deer ;” 
so she gave him the bullet-mould and a piece of lead, 
with which he departed, after repeating his former
injunction, to come when she heard the rifle; but, said 
he, “she no hear it yet.”</p>
        <p>He at length arrived at his own farm, from which 
he had been so cruelly driven, and concealed himself 
behind a log in sight of his own house, to watch the 
inmates. He soon learned that it was occupied by the 
man who had persecuted him in order to obtain it, his 
wife and one child. All day until midnight, he 
watched them from his hiding place, then assuming 
all the savage ferocity of his nature, and giving himself
<pb id="steward230" n="230"/>
the most frightful appearance possible, he entered
the house, and noiselessly passed to their sleeping
room, where he placed himself before them with a
long knife in his hand. Having assumed this frightful
attitude, he commanded them in a voice of thunder,
to get up and give him some supper. They were
awake now. Oh, horror! what a sight for a guilty
man, and a timid woman! “Me come to kill you!”
said the Indian, as he watched their blanched cheeks
and quivering lips. They tottered about on their
trembling limbs to get everything he asked for, imploring 
him for God's sake to take all, but spare their
lives. “Me will have scalps,” he answered fiercely;
but when he had eaten all he desired, he adjusted his
blanket, and putting on a savage look, he remarked as
if to himself, “Me go now get my men and kill him,
kill he wife, and kill he baby!” and left the house for
his post of observation.</p>
        <p>The frightened inmates lost no time, but hastily
collecting some provisions, fled to the frontier, and
were never heard of afterwards.</p>
        <p>The Indian immediately took possession of his own
and quite an addition left by the former tenants.</p>
        <p>While the kind-hearted old Indian repeated to me the
story of his wrongs, it reminded me of the injustice
practiced on myself, and the colored race generally.
Does a colored man by hard labor and patient industry, 
acquire a good location, a fine farm, and
<pb id="steward231" n="231"/>
comfortable dwelling, he is almost sure to be looked 
upon by the white man, as an usurper of <hi rend="italics">his</hi> rights and territory;  a robber of what he himself should 
possess, and too often does wrong the colored man 
out of,  -  yet, I am happy to acknowledge many honorable 
exceptions.</p>
        <p>I have often wondered, when looking at the remnant 
of that once powerful race, whether the black 
man would become extinct and his race die out, as 
have the red men of the forest; whether they would 
wither in the presence of the enterprising Anglo-Saxon 
as have the natives of this country. But now I have 
no such wondering inquiries to make; being persuaded
that the colored man has yet a prominent part to act
in this highly-favored Republic,  -  of what description 
the future must determine.</p>

          <p>It will now appear that I was not the only unfortunate 
individual who had difficulty with Mr. Lewis.</p>
          <note id="note40" n="40" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref40">* It necessarily follows that the public should withhold
their money from his subordinate agents.</note>
          <pb id="steward235" n="235"/>
          <p>Mr. Arthur Tappan made known through the press,
about this time, that Israel Lewis was not a man to be 
fully relied upon in his statements regarding the Wilberforce 
colony; and also, if money was placed in his 
hands for the benefit of the sick and destitute among 
the settlers, it would be doubtful whether it was faithfully 
applied according to the wishes of the donors.</p>
          <p>For this plain statement of facts, Mr. Lewis commenced 
a suit against Mr. Tappan, for defamation of 
character; laying the damages at the round sum of 
ten thousand dollars. It appeared that Lewis valued 
his reputation highly now that he had elevated 
himself sufficiently to commence a suit against one of 
the best and most respectable gentlemen in New York 
city; a whole souled abolitionist withal; one who had 
suffered his name to be cast out as evil, on account of
his devotion to the colored man's cause  -  both of the
enslaved and free; one who has, moreover, seen his 
own dwelling entered by an infuriated and pro-slavery 
mob; his expensive furniture thrown into the street as 
fuel for the torch of the black man's foe; and, amid 
the crackling flame which consumed it, to hear the vile 
vociferations of his base persecutors, whose only 
accusation was his defence of the colored man. This 
noble hearted, Christian philanthropist, who took 
“joyfully the spoiling of his goods” for the cause of 
the oppressed, was the chosen victim of Lewis' wrath 
and violent vituperation; and that too, where he was
<pb id="steward236" n="236"/>
well known as a most honorable, humane gentleman; 
and all for naming facts which were quite generally 
known already.</p>
          <p>Lewis returned to Wilberforce, flushed and swaggering 
with the idea of making his fortune in this 
speculation of a law-suit against Mr. Tappan; and to 
remove all obstacles, he sent a man to me, to say that 
if I would publish nothing, and would abandon the 
interests of the colonists, he would give me a handsome 
sum of money. I soon gave him to understand 
that he had applied to the wrong person for anything 
of that kind; and he then laid a plan to accomplish
by fraud and perjury, what he had failed to do by 
bribery.</p>
          <p>I have before mentioned the fact of my having 
taken up a note of twenty-five dollars for Mr. Lewis, 
on condition that he would soon refund the money. I 
did it as a favor, and kept the note in my possession, 
until about a year afterward, when I sued him to 
recover my just due on the note. We had then began 
to differ in our public business, which led to other 
differences in our transaction of both public and
private matters relating to the colony. He of course 
gave bail for his appearance at court, and it ran along 
for some time until he found he could not bribe me to 
enter into his interests, and then for the first time, he 
declared that I had stolen the note! And finally succeeded 
in getting me indicted before the grand jury!</p>
          <pb id="steward237" n="237"/>
          <p>In this I suppose Lewis and his confederates had
two objects: first, to get rid of me; secondly, that they 
might have a chance to account for my continued 
hostility, by saying that it arose in consequence of a 
private quarrel, and not for any true interest I had in 
their collecting money deceptively.</p>
          <p>Lewis appeared so bent on my destruction, that he 
forgot it was in my power to show how I came by the  
note. The Court of King's Bench met, but in consequence 
of the cholera, was adjourned, and of course, 
the case must lie over until another year. </p>
          <p>When the time for the trial drew near, I was, in the 
midst of my preparations to attend it, counselled and 
advised by different persons to flee from the country, 
which I had labored so hard and so conscientiously to 
benefit, and received in return nothing but detraction 
and slander. But conscious of my innocence, I declared 
I would not leave; I knew I had committed no 
crime; I had violated no law of the land,  -  and I 
would do nothing to imply guilt. He who hath 
formed the heart, knoweth its intent and purpose, and 
to Him I felt willing to commit my cause. True, the 
court might convict, imprison, and transport me away 
from my helpless family of five small children; if so, 
I was determined they should punish an innocent 
man. Nevertheless, it was a dark time; I was not 
only saddened and perplexed, but my spirit was
grieved, and I felt like one “wounded in the house of 
<pb id="steward238" n="238"/> 
his friends,”  -  ready to cry out, “had it been an enemy
I could have borne it,” but to be arraigned, for the
<hi>first</hi> time in my life, as a <hi rend="italics">criminal,</hi> by one of the very
people I had spent my substance to benefit, was
extremely trying. Guiltless as I knew myself to be,
still, I was aware that many incidents had transpired,
which my enemies could and would construe to my
disadvantage; moreover, Lewis had money, which he
would freely distribute to gain his point right or
wrong, and to get me out of his way.</p>
          <p>In due time the trial came on, and I was to be tried
for <hi rend="italics">theft!</hi> Lewis had reported all through the settlement 
that on a certain time I had called at his
house, and from a bundle of papers which his wife
showed me, I had purloined the note, which had
caused me so much trouble. To prove this it was
necessary to get his wife to corroborate the statement.
This was not an easy matter. Mrs. Lewis, indignant
and distressed by her husband's unkindness, had left
him and taken up her abode in the family of a hospitable 
Englishman. After Lewis had been sent out as
an agent for the colony, finding himself possessed of
sufficient funds to cut a swell, he associated and was
made a great deal of, by both ladies and gentlemen in
high stations of life; the consequence of which was,
he looked now with disdain upon his faithful, but
illiterate wife, who like himself had been born a slave,
and bred on a Southern plantation; and who had with
<pb id="steward239" n="239"/>
him escaped from the cruel task-master, enduring with 
him the hardships and dangers of the flying fugitive.</p>
          <p>Now her assistance was necessary to carry forward 
his plans, and he endeavored in various ways to 
induce her to return, but in vain. When he sent 
messengers to inform her how sorry he felt for his past 
abuse, she said she feared it was only some wicked 
plot to entice her away from the peaceable home she 
had found. Lewis saw that he must devise some 
other method to obtain her evidence. He therefore 
called on the brother of the Englishman in whose
family Mrs. Lewis was, and in a threatening manner 
told him that he understood his brother was harboring 
his wife, and that he intended to make him pay dear
for it. The brother, to save trouble, said he would 
assist him to get his wife, and that night conducted 
Lewis to her residence. No better proof can be given 
that Mrs. Lewis possessed the true heart of a woman, 
than that the moment her husband made humble concessions, 
and promised to love and protect her henceforth, 
she forgave him all his past infidelity and 
neglect, and looked with hope to a brighter future. In 
return Lewis presented her with a note, telling her to 
take it to a certain person and present it, and he 
would give her twenty dollars on it. This would, he
doubtless thought, leave her in his power.</p>
          <p>As Mrs. Lewis could not read, the unsuspecting wife
presented the paper all in good faith. The gentleman
<pb id="steward240" n="240"/>
looked at her sharply, suspiciously,  -  and then asked 
her, if she was not aware that she was presenting him 
a paper completely worthless! The poor woman was 
mortified and astonished; and instead of returning to 
her husband, fled to Wilberforce, and called at our 
house. Knowing how disastrous to me would be her 
false statement, and ignorant of her state of mind, I 
asked her if she had come to assist Mr. Lewis by 
swearing against me. I saw at once, that she had not 
yet been informed of her husband's design.</p>
          <p>“Swear against you, Mr. Steward!” said she. “I 
know nothing to swear that would injure you; I have 
always known you as an honest, upright man, and you 
need not fear my turning against an innocent person, 
for the benefit of one I know to be guilty. Nor 
would I have left my place, had I known what I now 
do.” So all help and fear was ended in that quarter.</p>
          <p>When at length the appointed morning arrived, I 
arose early, but with a saddened heart. I looked upon 
my wife and helpless family, reflecting that possibly 
this might be the last time we should all assemble 
around the breakfast table in our hitherto quiet home, 
and I could scarcely refrain from weeping. I, however, 
took my leave, and a lad with me, to bring back 
a message of the result, if the court found sufficient 
cause to detain me for trial. But when I found that I 
must be tried, I felt too unhappy to make others so, 
and kept out of the lad's way. He returned without
<pb id="steward241" n="241"/>
a message; and I took my seat in the prisoner's box. 
I had just taken a letter out of the post office, from 
Rochester, containing recommendations and attestations 
from the first men in the city, of my good 
character, which relieved my feelings somewhat; 
nevertheless, my heart was heavy, and especially 
when, soon after I took my seat, a trap-door was 
opened and a murderer was brought up and seated by
my side!</p>
          <p>Chief Justice Robinson, made his appearance in 
great pomp  -  dressed in the English court style  -  then 
the crier, in a shrill voice, announced the opening of 
the court, and finished by exclaiming, “God save the 
King!” His lordship then called the attention of the 
jury to the law of the land; particularly to that 
portion relating to their present duty; and the grand 
jury presented me to the court, for feloniously taking 
a certain promissory note from the house of Israel 
Lewis. The King's Attorney had but one witness, 
and that was Lewis. He was called to the stand,
permitted to relate his story, and retire without any 
cross-examination on the part of my Attorney; but 
that gentleman called up three respectable white men, 
all of whom swore that they would not believe Israel 
Lewis under oath! Then submitted the case to the 
jury without remark or comment, and the jury, without 
leaving their seats, brought in a verdict of “NOT 
GUILTY.” Thus ended my first and last trial for theft!
<pb id="steward242" n="242"/>
Oh, how my very soul revolted at the thought of 
being thus accused; but now that I stood justified 
before God and my fellow-men, I felt relieved and 
grateful; nor could I feel anything but pity for Lewis, 
who, like Haman, had been so industriously engaged 
in erecting “a gallows fifty cubits high” for me, but 
found himself dangling upon it. He raved like a 
madman, clutched the arm of the Judge and demanded 
a new trial, but he shook him off with contempt and 
indignation, as though he had been a viper. In his 
wild fury and reckless determination to destroy my 
character, he had cast a foul stain upon his own, never 
to be effaced. I had felt bound to preserve my reputation 
when unjustly assailed, but it had been to me a 
painful necessity to throw a fellow-being into the 
unenviable and disgraceful attitude in which Lewis 
now stood; and yet, he would not, and did not yield 
the point, notwithstanding his ignominious defeat.</p>
          <p>He very soon began to gather his forces for another
attack upon me, and followed the same direction for 
his accusation,  -  the land purchase.</p>
          <p>The reader will recollect without further repetition, 
that as I could purchase no land of the Canada Company, 
because of their indignation against Lewis, I 
was glad to accept of the contract he had made with 
Mr. Ingersoll, for lot number four in the colony; that 
I paid the sum demanded, and took his assignment on 
the back of the contract, and as we then were on good
<pb id="steward243" n="243"/>
terms, it never occulted to me that a witness was
necessary to attest to the transaction. But after his
failure to prove me a thief; his next effort was to
convict me of forgery! It will be remembered that
Lewis after selling out to me, returned the contract to
Mr. Ingersoll, and that I had lost by the means, the
land, and at least five hundred dollars' worth of improvements. 
Then I brought a suit against Lewis, to 
recover the money I had paid him for the contract;
and then it was that he asserted and attempted to
prove, that I had forged the assignment, and therefore, 
had no just claim on him for the amount paid. But 
in this, as in the other cause, he met a defeat and made 
an entire failure. I recovered all that I claimed, which 
was only my just due. One would suppose that after 
so many unsuccessful attempts to ruin me, he would 
have left me alone,  -  but not so with Lewis: he had 
the ambition of a Bonaparte; and doubtless had he 
possessed the advantages of an education, instead of 
having been born and bred a slave, he might, like an 
Alexander or Napoleon, have astonished the world 
with his deeds of daring. I am, however, no admirer 
of what the world call “great men,”  -  one 
humble, self-sacrificing Christian, like Benjamin Lundy, 
has for greater claim on my respect and reverence.</p>
          <p>Lewis, failing in his second attack, backed up as he  
had been in all his wicked course, by a friend wearing 
the sacred garb of a minister of the gospel, cooled off,
<pb id="steward244" n="244"/>
and it became evident to all, that he was meditating 
some different mode of warfare. To this concealed 
confederate, I must attach great blame, on account of 
the influence his station and superior learning gave 
him, not only over Mr. Lewis, but the colonists generally, 
and which should have been exerted for the good 
of all, in truth and honesty.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXVIII.</head>
        <head>DESPERATION OF A FUGITIVE SLAVE.</head>
        <p>We had as yet received no funds from our 
foreign agent, N. Paul, and the board of 
managers had resolved to send a man after him. An 
Englishman and a white man named Nell, would 
gladly undertake the mission, leaving his wife and five 
children among the settlers. Again was I under the 
necessity of returning to New York, to obtain the 
funds required to send out Mr. Nell after our agent in 
England.</p>
        <p>The night before I left home, I had a singular
dream which I will briefly relate. I dreamed of journeying 
on a boat to Albany, and of stopping at a
house to take tea. Several persons, I thought, were 
at the table, and as a cup of tea was handed me, I 
saw a woman slyly drop something into it. I, however, 
drank the tea, and dreamed that it made me 
very sick.</p>
        <pb id="steward246" n="246"/>
        <p>I found it difficult to drive form my mind the
unpleasant impression this dream made upon it,
but finally succeeded in doing so, attributing it to the
many and malicious threatenings which had been
made by Lewis and his associates. They had boldly
asserted that “if I went to the States, I would never
return alive,” and several other threats equally malignant.  
I, however, started with Mr. Nell for Rochester,
where we made an effort to raise money to aid in 
defraying the expenses of the voyage, and succeeded
in collecting about a hundred dollars.  From thence 
we passed on to Albany, where we fell in company
with a number of Mr. Paul's friends, who appeared
to be terribly indignant, and accused me of coming
there to expose their friends  -  Paul and Lewis. We
had some warm words and unpleasant conversation,
after which they left me very unceremoniously, and 
appeared to be very angry. A short time after, one of
them returned, and in the most friendly manner invited 
me to his house to tea. I was glad of an opportunity 
to show that I harbored no unpleasant feelings
toward them, and immediately accompanied him
home. The moment that we were all seated at the
table, an unpleasant suspicion flashed through my
mind. The table, the company  -  all seemed familiar
to me, and connected with some unpleasant occurrence
which I could not then recall.  But when the lady of
the house poured out a cup of tea, and another was
<pb id="steward247" n="247"/>
about to pass it, I heard her whisper, “I intended that
for Mr. Steward,” my dream for the first time, flashed
through my mind, with all the vivid distinctness of a
real incident. I endeavored to drive it from my
thoughts, and did so. Pshaw! I said to myself; I
will not be suspicious no whimsical, and I swallowed
the tea; then took my leave for the steamboat, on our
way to New York city.</p>
        <p>When we had passed a few miles out of Albany,
the boat hove to, and there came on board four men  -  
one of the number a colored man. The white men
repaired to their state-rooms, leaving the colored man
on deck, after the boat had returned to the channel.
He attracted my attention, by his dejected appearance
and apparent hopeless despair. He was, I judged,
about forty years of age; his clothing coarse and very
ragged; and the most friendless, sorrowful looking
being I ever saw. He spake to no one, but silently
paced the deck; his breast heaving with inaudible
sighs; his brow contracted with a most terrible frown;
his eyes dreamily fastened on the floor, and he appeared 
to be considering some hopeless undertaking.
I watched him attentively, as I walked to and fro on
the same deck, and could clearly discover that some
fearful conflict was taking place in his mind; but as I
afterwards repassed him he looked up with a happy,
patient smile, that lighted up his whole countenance,
which seemed to say plainly, I see a way of escape,    
<pb id="steward248" n="248"/>
and have decided on my course of action. His whole
appearance was changed; his heart that before had 
beat so wildly was quiet now as the broad bosom of 
the Hudson, and he gazed after me with a look of 
calm deliberation, indicative of a settled, but desperate 
purpose. I walked hastily forward and turned 
around, when, Oh, my God! what a sight was there! 
Holding still the dripping knife, with which he 
had cut his throat! and while his life-blood oozed 
from the gaping wound and flowed over his tattered
garments to the deck, the same exultant smile beamed 
on his ghastly features! </p>
        <p>The history of the poor, dejected creature was now 
revealed: he had escaped from his cruel task-master 
in Maryland; but in the midst of his security and
delightful enjoyment, he had been overtaken by the 
human blood-hound, and returned to his avaricious 
and tyrannical master, now conducting him back to a 
life of Slavery, to which he rightly thought death 
was far preferable.</p>
        <p>The horrors of slave life, which he had so long
endured, arose in all their hideous deformity in his
mind, hence the convict of feeling which I had
observed,  -  and hence the change in his whole appearance, 
when he had resolved to endure a momentary
pain, and escape a life-long scene of unrequited toil
and degradation.</p>
        <p>There happened to be on the boat at the time, several
<pb id="steward248a" n="248a"/>
<figure id="ill4" entity="stew248"><p>“I walked hastily forward and turned around, when, Oh, my God! what a sight was there! He still held the dripping knife, with which he had cut his throat.”<lb/>page 248</p></figure>
<pb id="steward249" n="249"/>
companies of citizen soldiers, who, shocked by the awful
spectacle, expressed their decided abhorrence of the institution 
of Slavery, declaring that it was not for such
peculiar villainy, that their fathers fought and bled on 
the battle field. So determined were they in their 
indignation; so loudly demanded they a cessation of 
such occurrences on board our boats, and the soil of 
a free State, that the slaveholders became greatly 
alarmed, and with all possible dispatch they hurriedly 
dragged the poor bleeding slave into a closet, and 
securely locked the door; nor have I ever been able 
to learn his final doom. Whether the kindly messenger 
of death released him from the clutches of the
man-stealer, or whether he recovered to serve his 
brutal master, I have never been informed.</p>
        <p>After this exciting scene had passed, I began to 
realize that I was feeling quite ill; an unusual load 
seemed to oppress my stomach, and by the time we 
had reached New York city, I was exceedingly distressed. 
I hastened to a boarding house, kept by a 
colored woman, who did everything in her power to 
relieve me; but I grew worse until I thought in 
reality, I must die. The lady supposed I was dying 
of cholera, sent to Brooklyn after Mr. Nell; but
having previously administered an emetic, I began to 
feel better; and when I had finally emptied my 
stomach of its contents, <hi rend="italics">tea and all,</hi> by vomiting, I fell 
into a profound sleep, from which I awoke greatly 
<pb id="steward250" n="250"/>
relieved. The kindness of that lady I shall not soon 
forget. She had a house full of boarders, who would 
have fled instantly, had they known that, as she supposed, 
I was suffering from cholera; and instead of 
sending me to the hospital, as she might have done, 
she kept all quiet until it was over, doing all she could 
for my relief and comfort; yet, it was a scene of 
distress which I hope may never be repeated.</p>
        <p>On the following morning, I saw in the city papers, 
“A Card,” inserted by the owner of the poor slave 
on board the steamboat, informing the public that he 
was returning South with a fugitive slave, who, when 
arrested, evinced great willingness to return; who had 
confessed also, that he had done very wrong in leaving 
his master, for which he was sorry,  -  but he supposed 
that the abolitionists had been tampering with him. 
That was all! Not a word about his attempt to take 
his life! Oh no, he merely wished to allay the excitement, 
that the horrid deed had produced on the minds 
of those present.</p>
        <p>I was indignant at the publication of such a deliberate 
falsehood, and immediately wrote and published 
that I too was on board the same boat with the 
fugitive; that I had witnessed an exhibition of his 
willingness to return to Slavery, by seeing him cut his 
throat, and lay on the deck wallowing in his blood; 
that the scene had so excited the sympathies of the 
soldiers present, that his owner had been obliged to 
hurry him out of their sight, &amp;c.</p>
        <pb id="steward251" n="251"/>
        <p>When this statement appeared in the newspapers, it 
so exasperated the friends of the slaveholder, that I 
was advised to flee from the city, lest I might be 
visited with personal violence; but I assured my 
advisers that it was only the wicked who “flee when 
no man pursueth, but the righteous are bold as a lion.” 
I therefore commenced the business that brought me 
to that city. Messrs. Bloss, Nell, and myself, made an 
effort, and raised between three and four hundred 
dollars for the purpose of sending Mr. Nell after Rev.  
N. Paul.</p>
        <p>Most of the funds collected, we gave to Mr. Nell, 
who sailed from New York, and arrived safely in 
England, just as N. Paul was boarding a vessel to 
return to New York.</p>
        <p>Had Mr. Nell acted honorably, or in accordance 
with his instructions, he would have returned with 
the agent; but he remained in England, and for aught 
I know is there yet. He was sent expressly after Mr. 
Paul, and when he left that kingdom, Nell's mission 
was ended. He proved himself less worthy of confidence 
than the agent, for he <hi rend="italics">did</hi> return when sent for, 
and he did account for the money he had collected, 
though he retained it all; but Mr. Nell accounted for 
nothing of the kind; and if he has ever returned, I 
have not seen him. Mr. N. Paul arrived in New 
York in the fall of 1834, and remained there through 
the winter, to the great disappointment and vexation
<pb id="steward252" n="252"/>
of the colonists. I wrote him concerning our condition
and wants, hoping it would induce him to visit us
immediately; but he had married while in England, 
an English lady, who had accompanied him to New
York, where they were now living; nor did he 
appear to be in any haste about giving an account of
himself to the board of managers who had employed 
him.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXIX.</head>
        <head>A NARROW ESCAPE FROM MY ENEMIES.</head>
        <p>During my absence in New York city, Lewis 
and his confederates were prophesying that I 
would never trouble them more, and shaking their
heads quite ominously at the happy riddance. One
day, our hired man entered the house and inquired
of my wife, when I was expected home. She told
him she did not know, having received no intelligence
from me. He assured her that a letter had been
received by some one in the colony; that he had
seen it, and had heard Mr. Lewis speak of conveying
it to her,  -  but as it did not come, she gave it up, supposing 
some mistake had been made. I had, however, 
written, naming the time when she might expect me; 
but no letter of mine reached her, during my long absence, 
for which she could not account. A short time 
before that specified for my return, a woman, whose 
husband was an associate of Mr. Lewis, came to my
<pb id="steward254" n="254"/>
house, and urged my wife “to leave word at the 
village of London, to have Mr. Steward detained
there, should he arrive toward evening, and by no
means allow him to start for the colony after dark.” 
My family had so often been alarmed by such warnings, 
and had so frequently been annoyed by the 
violent threatenings of Lewis, that they ceased to 
regard them, and paid little attention to this one.</p>
        <p>I arrived at London on the day I had appointed for 
my return, but was detained there until a late hour; 
feeling anxious, however, to get home that night, 
supposing that I was expected,  -  I therefore hired a 
horse to ride the remaining fifteen miles to the settlement.</p>
        <p>The road from London to Wilberforce led through 
a swamp, known as “McConnell's Dismal Swamp,”
and it was indeed, one of the most dreary places in all 
that section of country. I am certain that a hundred 
men might conceal themselves within a rod of the 
highway, without being discovered.</p>
        <p>The horse I had engaged, was a high spirited 
animal, and to that fact, I doubtless owe my life. The 
moon shone brightly, and nothing broke the stillness 
of the night, as I rode onward, but the clatter of my 
horse's hoofs, and an occasional “bow-wow” of some 
faithful watch-dog.</p>
        <p>When I reached the swamp and entered its darkened
recesses, the gloom and stillness was indeed fearful;
<pb id="steward255" n="255"/>
my horse started at every rustling leaf or crackling 
brush, until I attempted to pass a dense thicket, when 
I was started by the sharp crack of a rifle, and a 
bullet whizzed past me, close to my ear! The frightened 
horse reared and plunged, and then springing as 
if for life, he shot off like an arrow, amid the explosion 
of fire arms discharged at me as I rode away. I
lost my balance at first, and came near falling, but 
recovering it I grasped the rein tightly, while my 
fiery steed flew over the ground with lightning speed;
nor did I succeed in controlling him until he had run 
two miles, which brought me to my own door.</p>
        <p>I found my family well, and very grateful that I
had arrived safely after so fearful an encounter.</p>
        <p>When morning came I sent a person out to inquire
whether any of the settlers were out the night previous, 
and the report was, “Israel Lewis and two 
other men were out all night; that they had been seen 
near the Dismal Swamp;” moreover, Lewis was seen 
to come in that morning with his boots covered with 
swamp mud,  -  these the Rev. Mr. Paul's boys cleaned 
for him, all of which was evidence that he it was, 
who had way-laid me with criminal intent.</p>
        <p>I afterwards learned, that those three men left the
settlement at dusk, for the swamp; that they stationed
themselves one rod apart, all on one side of the road, 
each man with a loaded rifle,  -  the poorest marksman 
was to fire first, and if he did not bring me down,
<pb id="steward256" n="256"/>
probably the second would; but Lewis being the
best shot of the three, was to reserve his fire until
the last, which they supposed I could not escape. It
was quite dark in the thicket, and my spirited horse
plunged in every direction so furiously, that they
could take no aim at me, until he had started to run,
when we were soon beyond their reach.</p>
        <p>We had already had so much difficulty in our little
colony that we were getting heartily sick of it. I was
well aware that Lewis was thirsting for revenge; that
he wished to do me a great wrong; and yet I was
thankful on his account, as well as on my own, that
he had been prevented from imbruing his hands in
the blood of a fellow being.</p>
        <p>Had he succeeded in taking my life, as he undoubtedly 
intended to do, he would have been arrested
immediately, and most likely punished as a murderer.
He had boldly threatened my life, and the colonists
were expecting something of the kind to take place.
Had I not arrived at the colony, it was known at
London that I had started for the settlement that
night, and an immediate search would have been instituted; 
nor could the wicked deed have brought the
least peace to the mind of Lewis or his companions</p>
        <lg>
          <l>“No peace of mind does that  man know,</l>
          <l>Who bears a guilty  breast;</l>
          <l>His conscience drives him to and fro,</l>
          <l>And never lets him  rest.”</l>

        <head>CHAPTER XXX.</head>
        <head>DEATH OF B. PAUL AND RETURN OF HIS BROTHER.</head>
        <p>The bold and wicked attempt to take my life,
recorded in the preceding chapter, aroused a 
feeling of indignation in the community against 
Lewis, and completely destroyed the little influence he 
had left; moreover, he had now been so extensively
published as an impostor, that he could collect no
more money on the false pretense of raising it for the
benefit of the colony. As soon as his money was 
gone and his influence destroyed,  -  many who had been 
his firmest friends, turned against him, and among this 
class was the Rev. Benjamin Paul. He had ever professed 
the greatest friendship for, and interest in the 
success of Mr. Lewis. Heretofore, whenever he went 
to the States he was commissioned by that gentleman's
family, to purchase a long list of expensive articles, 
which the poor colonists were seldom able to buy; 
and he generally returned to them richly laden with
<pb id="steward258" n="258"/>
goods, purchased with money given to the poor, sick, 
and destitute in the colony.</p>
        <p>Mr. B. Paul had ever been a very proud man, but 
not a very healthy one. He was inclined to pulmonary 
diseases; but had kept up pretty well, until Lewis 
was effectually put down, and his own character 
involved in many of his notorious proceedings, together 
with the disappointment occasioned by his 
brother remaining so long in England, when his 
health failed, and he sank rapidly under accumulating 
disasters, to the grave.</p>
        <p>The Welshmen had partially engaged him to preach 
for them the ensuing year, but something they had 
heard of him changed their minds, and they were about 
appointing a meeting to investigate his conduct, when 
they were informed of his illness, and concluded to 
let it pass. His son, with whom he lived, became 
deranged, and his oldest daughter on whom he was 
greatly dependent, had been dismissed from school, 
where she had been for some time engaged in teaching. 
All these unpleasant circumstances in his sickly 
state weighed heavily upon his proud heart; and he 
not only declined in health, but sank into a state of
melancholy and remorse for his past course of living. 
As he lay pining and murmuring on his death bed, I 
could but reflect how different the scene from that of 
an apostle of the Lord Jesus Christ, who could exclaim, 
when about to be offered, “I have fought a good fight,
<pb id="steward259" n="259"/>
I have finished my course, I have kept the faith;
henceforth there is laid up for me a crown of righteousness.”</p>
        <p>I called to see him as he lay writhing in agony, his
sunken eyes gleaming wildly, rolling and tossing from
side to side, while great drops of perspiration stood
upon his forehead, continually lamenting his misspent
time, and the life he had led! He took my hand in his
cold, bony fingers, thanking me that I did not so despise 
him, that I could not come to see him in his sorrow 
and affliction. Generally, however, when he raved 
and talked of his wicked life, his family excluded all 
persons from his room except his attendants.</p>
        <p>Pride, which had ever been his besetting sin, displayed 
itself in his conduct to the last, for he had a
lengthy will made, dispensing some sixteen hundred
dollars to different individuals, when he must have
known that his whole possessions would not amount
to half that sum. As I looked upon him I could 
but reflect on the mysterious ways of Providence. 
Before me lay a man, who had for years arrayed himself 
against me, using all his influence as a man and a
minister to injure me, by setting Lewis forward in his
wickedness; his family living in extravagance and a
style far beyond their means, while mine had labored
hard and were sometimes destitute, often <sic>harrassed</sic>
and perplexed on every side by himself and party. 
And for what? Because I would not join hands
<pb id="steward260" n="260"/>
with iniquity, and deeds of darkness. Notwithstanding 
the contrast, when I heard his bitter lamentations and
self-reproaches, I could lift my heart to God, in 
gratitude for His protecting goodness, which had 
preserved me an <hi rend="italics">honest man.</hi> I had often erred no 
doubt, but it had never been designedly; and never 
did I value a good conscience more than when standing 
by the death-bed of Benjamin Paul, who now had 
passed the Jordan of death; and it is enough to know
that his future, whether of joy or woe, will be meted 
out to him, by a merciful and just God,  -  nevertheless, 
his last moments on earth were such as ought to 
arouse every professed christian, to redoubled diligence
in watchfulness and prayer, lest they fall into temptation,
  -  lest they determine to become rich, and thereby 
fall into diverse and hurtful lusts, and pierce themselves 
through with many sorrows.</p>
        <p>Soon after the event above narrated, a law was 
passed in the Province, allowing each township to 
elect three commissioners, whose duty it should be, to 
transact the public business pertaining to the township. 
Each township should also elect one township clerk, 
whose business it should be, to hold and keep all 
moneys, books, and papers belonging to said town; 
with power to administer oaths, and in fact, he, with 
the commissioners, were to constitute a board, possessing 
all the power of a court, in relation to township 
business.</p>
        <pb id="steward261" n="261"/>
        <p>In our colony, located in the township of Bidulph, 
the colored people were a large majority of the inhabitants, 
which gave us the power to elect <sic>commisioners </sic>
from our own settlement, and therefore, three black 
men where duly chosen, who entered on the duties of 
their office, while your humble servant, A. Steward, 
was elected township clerk, with all the responsibility 
of the office resting upon him and the same 
power given him as though he had been born in 
Her Brittanic Majesty's dominion, with a face as
white as the driven snow. I felt the responsibility 
of my office, but not more deeply than I did this 
assurance of entire confidence, and respect shown me 
by my townsmen, after all the cruel persecutions I had 
met; after all the accusations of theft, forgery, &amp;c., 
that vicious person could bring against me.</p>
        <p>The Rev. Nathaniel Paul, with his lady, arrived at
Wilberforce in the spring of 1835, to the great joy of 
the colonists, to find that his brother had gone the 
way of all the earth, and his remains quietly resting 
on his own premises, where his afflicted family still 
resided.</p>
        <p>In the colony there was a great deal of excitement
regarding the course our agent would pursue, and all
waited with anxious expectancy to see him enrich the
treasury with his long-promised collections.</p>
        <p>We had agreed, on sending him forth as an agent 
for the colony, to give him fifty dollars per month for 
his services, besides bearing his expenses.</p>
        <pb id="steward262" n="262"/>
        <p>The reverend gentleman, charged, on his return to 
the colony, the sum specified, for four years, three 
months and twenty days. We spent several days in 
auditing his account, with increased fearful forebodings. 
We found his receipts to be, in the United 
Kingdoms of Great Britain, one thousand six hundred 
and eighty-three pounds, nineteen shillings; or, eight 
thousand and fifteen dollars, eighty cents His expenditures 
amounted to one thousand four hundred and 
three pounds, nineteen shillings; or, seven thousand and 
nineteen dollars, eighty cents. Then his wages for over 
four years, at fifty dollars per month, left a balance 
against the board of several hundred dollars, which 
we had no funds to cancel, inasmuch as the reverend
gentleman had paid us nothing of all he had collected 
in Europe, nor even paid a farthing toward liquidating 
the debts incurred for his outfit and expenses.</p>
        <p>There was also in Mr. Paul's charge against the
board of managers, an item of two hundred dollars,
which he had paid to Wm. Loyd Garrison, while that
gentleman was also in England; but by whose authority 
he had paid or given it, it was hard to determine.
We gave him no orders to make donations of any
kind. To take the liberty to do so, and then to charge
it to our poor and suffering colony, seemed hard to
bear; still we allowed the charge. Had we, in our
straitened and almost destitute circumstances, made a
donation of that, to us, large sum of money to Mr.
<pb id="steward263" n="263"/>
Garrison or any body else, certainly we should, at 
least, have had the credit of it; and as Mr. Garrison 
had made no acknowledgment of the receipt, I wrote 
him on the subject, and his answer will be found, 
heading our correspondence, in this volume.</p>
        <p>Not a dollar did the treasurer ever receive of the 
Rev. N. Paul, unless we call the donations he had 
made without our permission, a payment. He did, it 
is true, award to the board, the sum of two hundred 
dollars, paid by him to Mr. Garrison, and fifty dollars 
more given by himself to Mr. Nell, on his departure 
from England. Not a farthing could we get of him; 
and in short, as far as the monied interest of
the colony was concerned, his mission proved an entire
failure. How much good the reverend gentleman 
may have done in spreading anti-slavery truth, during 
his stay in Europe, is not for me to say. The English, 
at that time held slaves; and report speaks well of his 
labors and endeavors to open the eyes of that nation 
to the sin of slavery and the injustice of the colonization 
scheme. It is said that he continually addressed 
crowded and deeply interested audiences, and that 
many after hearing him, firmly resolved to exert 
themselves, until every chain was broken and every 
bondman freed beneath the waving banner of the 
British Lion. Perhaps his arduous labors assisted in
freeing the West India islands of the hateful curse of
<pb id="steward264" n="264"/>   
Slavery; if so, we shall not so much regret the losses 
and severe trials, it was ours to bear at that time.</p>
        <p>The indignant and disappointed colonists, however,
took no such view of his mission; and knowing as 
they did, that he had paid not a cent of cash into the 
treasury, nor liquidated one debt incurred on his 
account, they became excited well nigh to fury,  -  so 
much so, that at one time we found it nearly impossible 
to restrain them from having recourse to Lynch 
law. They thought that the reverend gentleman 
must have large sums of money at his command
somewhere  -  judging from his appearance and mode 
of living, and that a little wholesome punishment 
administered to his reverence, by grave Judge Lynch, 
enthroned upon a “cotton bale,” might possibly bring 
him to terms, and induce him to disgorge some of his 
ill-gotten wealth, which he so freely lavished upon 
himself, and was withholding from those to whose 
wants it had been kindly contributed.</p>
        <p>Just, as was their dissatisfaction, I was satisfied by 
the examination of his accounts, that he had spent 
nearly all of the money collected for us; his expenses 
had been considerable; beside, he had fallen in love, 
during his stay in England, with a white woman, and 
I suppose it must have required both time and money 
to woo and win so fine and fair an English lady, said 
also to possess quite a little sum of money, that is,
<pb id="steward265" n="265"/>
several thousand dollars, all of which our poor, little
suffering colony must pay for,  -  the reverend gentleman's 
statement to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>
        <p>We succeeded at last, after a tedious effort, in satisfying 
the minds of the settlers to the extent, that a 
violent outbreak was no longer to be feared or 
dreaded. When all was quiet in the colony, I ventured 
to make my first call on the wife of N. Paul, 
who was then stopping with the widow of the late 
Rev. B. Paul, residing some three miles from us.</p>
        <p>The houses of the colonists were generally built of 
logs, hewn on both sides, the spaces chinked with mortar, 
and the roof constructed of boards. The lower 
part was generally left in one large room, and when 
another apartment was desired, it was made by drawing 
a curtain across it. When we arrived at the 
residence of Mrs. Paul, we were immediately ushered 
into the presence of Mrs. Nathaniel Paul, whom we 
found in an inner apartment, made by drawn curtains, 
carpeted in an expensive style, where she was seated 
like a queen in state,  -  with a veil floating from her 
head to the floor; a gold chain encircling her neck, 
and attached to a gold watch in her girdle; her fingers 
and person sparkling with costly jewelry. Her
manners were stiff and formal, nor was she handsome, 
but a tolerably fair looking woman, of about thirty 
years of age: and this was the wife of our agent for 
the poor Wilberforce colony!</p>
        <pb id="steward266" n="266"/>
        <p>N. Paul had now settled his business with the 
colonists, and being about to leave for the States, we 
appealed to his honor as a man and a Christian, to call 
at Rochester and pay the seven hundred dollar bank 
debt, for which he was justly and legally holden, and 
relieve honorably, those kind gentlemen who had 
raised the money for him. He well knew the condition 
of our friend E. Peck, and that the names of 
some of  our colored friends were also attached to the 
note; all of whom were relying implicitly on his or 
our honor to pay the obligation. That we had no funds 
in the treasury he was well aware; also, that all were 
deeply concerned about that debt. All this he knew; 
and in answer to our earnest and repeated injunction, 
he promised most faithfully and solemnly that he 
would call at Rochester, and take up the note. On 
those conditions he was allowed to leave the colony, 
and when parting with me, no more to meet in this 
life, his last assurance was, that he would cancel that 
obligation. What then could we think of his word, 
when we learned soon after that he passed Rochester, 
without calling, direct to Albany; nor did he ever 
return, or make any explanation of his conduct; nor
give any reason why his promise was not redeemed 
and the money paid.</p>
        <p>He preached in Albany until his health failed, then 
he was obliged to live the best way he could, and at 
last to depend on charity.</p>
        <pb id="steward267" n="267"/>
        <p>His disease was dropsy, from which he suffered 
deeply, being unable to lie down for some time previous 
to his death. I have been told that his domestic 
life was far from a peaceable or happy one, and that 
in poverty, sorrow and affliction, he lingered on a long 
time, till death at last closed the scene.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXXI.</head>
        <head>MY FAMILY RETURN TO ROCHESTER.</head>
        <p>I was now seriously meditating a return to 
Rochester. My purpose in going to Canada, has 
already been made known to the reader, as well as 
some of the disappointments I met, and some of the 
trials and difficulties I had to encounter.</p>
        <p>Now, after laboring, and suffering persecution for 
about five years, my way was comparatively clear; still 
I wished to leave the Province and return to the States, 
in which prospect my family greatly rejoiced. Doubtless 
most persons in the position I then occupied, 
would have chosen to remain; but for several reasons, 
I did not.</p>
        <p>Notwithstanding I had been during my youth, a
poor, friendless, and illiterate slave, I had, through the
mercy of God and the kindness of friends, not only obtained 
my freedom, but I had by the industry and perseverance 
of a few years, acquired a tolerable English
<pb id="steward269" n="269"/>
education, established a profitable business, built for
myself a good and extensive business reputation, and 
had laid the foundation for increasing wealth and
entire independence.</p>
        <p>Indeed, so far as a competency is concerned, I possessed 
that when I left Rochester. My house and
land was paid for; my store also, and the goods it
contained were free from debt; beside, I had several
hundred dollars in the bank for future use,  -  nor do I
boast, when I say that the comfort and happiness of
myself and family, required no further exertion on 
my part to better our worldly condition. We were 
living in one of the best countries on the earth, surrounded 
by friends,  -  good and intelligent society, and 
some of the noblest specimens of Christian philanthropy 
in the world. My wife and children, had not 
only been accustomed to the comforts, if not the 
luxuries of life, but also to associate with persons of 
refinement and cultivation; and although they had 
willingly accompanied me to Canada, where they had
experienced little less than care, labor and sorrow, it
cannot be thought very strange that they should
desire to return. We were colored people to be sure,
and were too often made to feel the weight of that
cruel prejudice, which small minds with a perverted
education, know so well how to heap upon the best
endeavors of our oppressed race. Yet truth and
justice to my friends, compel me to say, that after a
<pb id="steward270" n="270"/>
short acquaintance, I have usually been treated with 
all that kindness and confidence, which should exist 
between man and man.</p>
        <p>At my house of entertainment in Canada, it was 
not uncommon for gentlemen of my former acquaintances, 
to stop for a friendly chat; merchants, journeying 
through our settlement, after goods, would 
frequently call, with their money, watches, and other 
valuables, carefully concealed about their persons; but 
when they learned our name, and had become acquainted 
a little, they would not only freely expose 
their wealth, but often place all their money and
valuables in my hands, for safe keeping; nor was 
their confidence ever misplaced to my knowledge.</p>
        <p>Another thing: when I went to Wilberforce, I supposed 
that the colonists would purchase the whole 
township of Bidulph, and pay for it, which might 
have been done, had they been fortunate enough to 
put forward better men. Then when we had a sufficient 
number of inhabitants, we could have sent a 
member to Parliament, one of our own race, to represent 
the interests of our colony. In all this we were 
disappointed. The Canada Company, in their unjust
judgment of a whole people, by one dishonest man, 
had stopped the sale of lands to colored persons, which 
of course, put an end to the emigration of respectable 
and intelligent colored men to that place; nor was 
there any prospect of a favorable change. Moreover,
<pb id="steward271" n="271"/>
the persecutions which gave rise to the colony, had in 
a great measure ceased; anti-slavery truth was taking 
effect on the minds of the people, and God was raising 
up many a friend for the poor slave, to plead with 
eloquent speech and tears, the cause of the dumb and 
down-trodden.</p>
        <p>These, with other considerations, influenced me in 
my decision to leave Canada. As soon, however, as 
my intentions were made known, I was importuned 
on all sides, by persons both in and out of the settlement, 
to remain awhile longer, at least. This will be 
seen by a reference to the appendix.</p>
        <p>After due deliberation, I concluded to send my 
family to the States, and remain myself, until my year 
should terminate, for which I had been elected township 
clerk. In accordance with this determination, I 
made preparation to take my family to Port Stanley, 
forty miles distant. But what a contrast was there between 
our leaving Rochester, five years before, and our 
removing from the colony! Then, we had five
two-horse wagon loads of goods and furniture, and seven 
in family; now, our possessions were only a few
articles, in a <hi rend="italics">one-horse wagon,</hi> with an addition of two
members to our household! The settlers collected 
about us, to take an affectionate leave of my wife and 
children; but tears and sobs, prevented an utterance 
of more than a “God bless you,” and a few like expressions. 
The scene was indeed an affecting one: all the
<pb id="steward272" n="272"/>
weary days of our labor; all the trials and difficulties 
we had passed; all the sweet communion we had 
enjoyed in our religious and social meetings; all the 
acts of neighborly kindness, seemed now to be indelibly 
impressed on every memory, and we felt that a 
mutual regard and friendship had bound us closer 
to each other, in the endearing bonds of Christian 
brotherhood  -  bonds not to be broken by the adverse 
scenes incident to frail human life.</p>
        <p>Arrived at Port Stanley, we were kindly entertained 
by a Mr. White, a fugitive slave from Virginia, who 
owned a snug little farm on the bank of Kettle Creek, 
and who appeared to be in a good and prosperous 
condition. Being detained there, waiting for a boat, 
on which I was anxious to see my family comfortably 
situated before I left them, I was aroused at an 
early hour on the second morning of our stay, by a 
loud rapping at the door; and hearing myself inquired 
for, I dressed myself immediately, and followed Mr. 
White into the sitting room, where I saw two strange
men, armed with bludgeons! I soon learned, however, 
that one of them was the under-sheriff, who had 
come to arrest me for a debt of about forty dollars, 
and the other armed man had come to assist him. I 
assured them I was ready to accompany them back to 
London, which I was obliged to do, a prisoner, leaving 
my family among comparative strangers. The debt 
had become due to a man who had worked for us in
<pb id="steward273" n="273"/>
the building of a saw-mill. I arranged the matter 
without going to jail, but before I could return to 
Port Stanley, my family, kindly assisted by Mr. 
White, had departed for Buffalo. The weather was 
cold and the lake very rough, but they safely arrived 
in Rochester, after a journey of three days. During 
their passage up the lake my oldest daughter took a 
severe cold, from which she never recovered.</p>
        <p>I returned to the colony to attend to the duties of 
my office, and to close my business with the colony,
preparatory to joining my family, who were now 
settled in Rochester, but in very different circumstances 
from those in which they had left it. I had 
deposited quite a sum of money in the Rochester 
Bank; but our continual expenditures at Wilberforce, 
in my journeyings for the benefit of the colony and 
in the transacting of business pertaining to its interests, 
had left not one dollar for the support of my
family, or to give me another start in business.
Nevertheless, I felt willing to submit the case to Him 
who had known the purity of my intentions, and 
who had hitherto “led me through scenes dark and 
drear,” believing he would not forsake me now, in 
this time of need.</p>
        <p>Consoling myself with these reflections, I renewed 
my endeavors to do my best, leaving the event with 
my God.</p>

      <div1>
        <head>CHAPTER XXXII.</head>
        <head> THE LAND AGENT AND THE SQUATTER.</head>
        <p>I have named, I believe, that all the colored 
people, who purchased lands of Lewis, could get 
no deed nor remuneration for their improvements.     
This they thought hard and unfair. Some had built 
a house and barn, cleared land, &amp;c.; but when they 
wished to pay for their farms, they could get no deed, 
and were obliged to lose all their labor.</p>
        <p>This raised such a general complaint against the 
land agents, that they finally agreed to pay the squatters 
for their improvements, if they would leave their 
farms An opportunity was soon offered to test their 
sincerity in this agreement. A shrewd fellow, who 
had been many years a sailor, named William Smith, 
had made valuable improvements on land, for which 
he could get no deed, and then he wished to leave it. 
His wife, also, died about this time, leaving him with 
eight children, which determined him to leave the
<pb id="steward275" n="275"/>
colony, and after providing homes for his children, to
return to his former occupation on the high seas; but 
he also determined not to leave without receiving the 
pay which the agents had agreed to give for his improvements.</p>
        <p>“Oh yes,” said they, in answer to his repeated solicitations,
“you shall be paid, certainly, certainly ; you
shall be paid every farthing.” But when the appointed 
day came for the pompous land agents to ride through 
the settlement, you might see Smith station himself at 
first one and then another conspicuous place on the 
road, hoping they would have the magnanimity to 
stop and pay him, especially, as he had informed them 
of his destitute and almost desperate condition, with 
eight young children to maintain, and no means to do 
so, after giving up to them the farm. Before them as 
usual rode their body servant, of whom Smith would 
inquire at what hour the agents might be expected. 
And most blandly would he be informed of some 
particular hour, when perhaps, within the next ten
minutes, the lordly agent would fly past him, on their
foaming steeds, with the speed of a “lightning train.” 
This course they repeated again and again. One day, 
when all of the land agents rode through the settlement 
in this manner, Smith followed them on foot 
over fifty miles. He at last intercepted them, and they 
promised with the coolest indifference, that on a certain 
day, not far distant, they would certainly pay him
<pb id="steward276" n="276"/>
all he claimed, if he would meet them at a certain 
hotel in London. To this he agreed; and the poor 
fellow returned to the colony almost exhausted.</p>
        <p>His funds were nearly all spent, and he wished to 
take his children to New York; yet his only hope was 
in the integrity and honor of the land agents.</p>
        <p>On the day appointed, he was at London long before 
the hour to meet, had arrived. He entered the village 
with a determined air, and saw the agents just riding 
up to a hotel,  -  but not the one they had told him to 
call at. He, however, waited for no invitation, but 
entered the hotel and inquired of the servant for his 
master. He said his master was not there!</p>
        <p>“I know he is,” said Smith, “and I want to see 
him.”</p>
        <p>The servant withdrew, but soon returned to say 
that his master was engaged and could not see him 
that day. Smith followed the servant into the hall, 
calling out to him in the most boisterous manner, 
demanding to be told the reason <hi rend="italics">why</hi> he could not see 
his master, The noise which Smith purposely made, 
soon brought into the hall one of the agents, a Mr. 
Longworth, a short, fat man,  -  weighing in the neighborhood 
of three hundred pounds! When he saw
Smith, he strutted about, assuring him that this disgraceful 
uproar was quite uncalled for, and finally 
putting on a severe look, told him that he could not 
have anything for his improvements; of course not,  -  
<pb id="steward277" n="277"/>
he really could not expect; certainly not, &amp;c. Smith
plainly assured the agent that his “blarney” would avail
him nothing; he had come by their own appointment
to get his pay, and that he certainly should <hi rend="italics">have</hi>  -  if not in the way they themselves agreed upon, he would
choose his own method of getting it! Thus saying,
he stepped back, threw down his woolly head, and goat
fashion, let drive into the fat Englishman's “bread
basket!” He sprawled about and soon recovered
his standing, but continued to scream and halloo with
rage and mortification, more than with pain, until he
had brought to the spot landlord, boarders, and servants, 
to witness the affray; but Smith, nothing daunted, 
administered two or three more effectual butts with
his hard head into the lordly agent, when the subdued 
and now silent English gentleman, drew from
his pocket book, and carefully counted out, every
dollar Smith had at first demanded. Smith accepted
it pleasantly, thanked him and withdrew, amid the
shouts and jeers of the spectators, which the agent
was more willing to avoid than he. That was the way
the land agent paid the squatter.</p>
        <p>It seemed, however, a little too bad, to make a fine
English gentleman, feel as “flat” as Longworth appeared 
to feel; yet it was undoubtedly the only method
by which Smith could recover a farthing. The agents,
it was supposed, did not design to pay for any improvements; 
indeed, some very hard and unjust
<pb id="steward278" n="278"/>
incidents occurred in connection with that matter,
and probably Smith was about the only one, who
ever received the full value of his claim.</p>
        <p>There was committed about this time, a most shocking 
murder, in the London district. A farmer who
had a respectable family, consisting of a wife and
several children, became so addicted to the use of
spirituous liquors, that he neglected both his family
and farm so much, that his friends felt called upon to
request the distiller, who was his near neighbor, to
furnish him with no more intoxicating drink. This,
so exasperated the poor, ruined and besotted wretch
that he raved like a madman  -  such as he undoubtedly
was  -  crazed and infuriated, by the contents of the
poisoned cup of liquid damnation, held to his lips by
a neighboring distiller; a fellow-being, who for the
consideration of a few shillings, could see his neighbor
made a brute and his family deft in destitution and
sorrow. Perhaps, however, he did not anticipate a
termination so fearful; yet that is but a poor excuse
for one who lives by the sale of rum. When a rum-seller 
gives that to a man, which he knows will “steal
away his brains,” and make him a maniac, how can he
anticipate his future conduct? And who is responsible? 
Ah, who?</p>
        <p>When Severin found he could get no more intoxicating 
beverage, he in his demoniacal rage, conceived
the idea of despatching his whole family, and set
<pb id="steward279" n="279"/>
about his purpose by first snatching the young babe
and casting it into the fire! When the poor wife and
mother came shrieking to the rescue of her darling
infant, he with one furious blow, laid her a bleeding
corpse at his feet! Two other young children he
next murdered, and left them mingling their blood
with that of their mother's, while he ran furiously
after the two older ones, who were endeavoring to
escape to a neighbor's for assistance; and overtaking,
killed them both! When the miserable wretch had
completed his hellish designs he started for his nearest
neighbor, named Smith, and told him that there was a
black and a white man at his house, murdering his
family, requesting him to go to their assistance. Mrs.
Smith, believing that Severin designed to murder her
husband, insisted on his calling his young men to
assist him, which he did; and on arriving at the scene
of slaughter, a most horrid spectacle was before them:
five dead bodies weltering in blood, aside from that of
the innocent babe, whose little form lay roasted and
charred, on the fatal and bloody hearthstone of the
drunkard! Victims all, of an intoxicated husband
and father! When the guilty man saw the mangled
remains of his household, he only increased his depravity 
by trying to make others responsible for the
wicked deed,  -  exclaiming in feigned anguish, “my
dear wife! my poor children! I was afraid they
would murder you! Oh, my lost family!” &amp;c.
<pb id="steward280" n="280"/>
Community was soon alarmed; Severin, arrested,
tried, convicted, and sentenced to suffer the extreme
penalty of the law.</p>
        <p>It is sufficient for us to say, that the evidence was
clear and conclusive, that he was the only murderer
of his family; nor was it doubted that Mrs. Smith's
suspicion was correct; yet, with all the array of positive 
testimony brought against him, he denied the
commission of the crime to the last moment of his
life! When brought out for execution, he was placed
under the gallows, and the rope with its fatal noose
adjusted around his neck, when one of the attorneys
arose, and with great solemnity, addressed him, in the
most impressive manner: “We have done,” said he,
“all in our power to save your life; but you are justly
condemned, and in a few minutes more, will enter the
presence of the All-seeing eye of Jehovah; now let
me beseech you, in the name of God, to tell the truth,
before you die.” Severin declared himself innocent
of the crime, for which he was about to suffer; but
was consoled, he said, with the belief that he should,
in a few short moments, meet in blissful re-union his
dear, murdered wife and children in heaven, to part
no more! Prayers were read; and during the reading
of the Lord's prayer, at the words “Thy will be done,”
the hardened wretch was launched into eternity.</p>
        <p>No room was left to doubt the fact, that Severin
with his own hand destroyed the life of his unhappy
<pb id="steward281" n="281"/>
and abused wife, and also that of his helpless family.
Yet in one sense, may we say with the murderer, it
was not he who committed the awful and inhuman
deed, but boldly and truthfully charge it to man's
bitterest foe  -  Rum! What but the maddening effects
of spirituous liquors, could so demoralize, so demonize
a man, as to convert the once loving husband and
proud father, into a reckless fiend, a heartless savage?
Oh, Rum! earth contains not another so fell a foe!</p>
        <p>Should any who may read these humble pages, find
an effectual warning in the unhappy end of Severin,
one which shall induce them to pause in their course,
or at once and forever abandon the use of alcoholic
drinks, I shall gratefully feel that I have not written
this incident in vain.</p>
        <p>Before I left Wilberforce, the Rev. S. E. Cornish,
made a visit, and preached the Word of Life to the
colony, greatly to the satisfaction and comfort of the
settlers. After distributing liberally of his abundance,
to his poor brethren, he departed for the States,
attended by the prayers and blessings of the Wilberforce 
colonists.</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXXIII.</head>
        <head>CHARACTER AND DEATH OF I. LEWIS.</head>
        <p>I have spoken in the preceding chapter, of a
visit from the Rev. S. E. Cornish, to the colony.
He had previously written me, concerning the object
of his proposed visit, which was to obtain the depositions 
of the board of managers, relative to all the
money received through their agents for the colony.
He was sent to Canada then, and once afterwards, for
and at the expense of A. Tappan, on business pertaining 
to the law-suit instituted by I. Lewis against that
gentleman, for defamation of character. The depositions 
taken in the colony, with the expense of
twice sending an agent to Canada, must have made a
round sum for that kind gentleman to pay, merely for
telling a truth already known!</p>
        <p>Mr. Cornish had also been informed of my intention
to leave the colony, and that my family were already
gone. He, knowing something concerning the state of
<pb id="steward283" n="283"/>
things, urged me to remain at least, until his arrival,
as will be seen by a reference to his letter in the
appendix.</p>
        <p>As I look back on those scenes of labor and trial, I
find cause for deep humiliation and gratitude to God,
for His goodness and gracious protection, over my
frail life, through unseen dangers of various kinds,
and for his continued favors and unmerited blessings.
Many of my fellow men have fallen in death's cold
embrace since that time, while my health and life has
been mercifully preserved.</p>
        <p>Three of the leading characters of the Wilberforce
colony are now dead. Rev. Benjamin Paul, lies in
the silent grave-yard in Wilberforce, C. W. His
brother, Rev. Nathaniel Paul, also sleeps the dreamless
sleep of death, and his dust rests in the beautiful
cemetery in Albany, N. Y.</p>
        <p>Israel Lewis has also finished his earthly career
after robbing the poor of their just dues, and persecuting 
those who endeavored to defend them; after
living in extravagance  -  “faring sumptuously every
day,”  -  he became reduced in circumstances; despised
and dishonored, his proud spirit was at last broken.
His health gave way; when at length, unattended and
alone, he found his way to a hospital in Montreal,
where he soon after died, leaving not enough of all
his gains to afford him a decent burial!</p>
        <p>Oh, what a reward “for all his labor under the
<pb id="steward284" n="284"/>
sun!” His fame, his wealth, and his law-suits, all
have perished with his memory. Poor man!</p>
        <p>Israel Lewis was born a slave, raised on a Southern
plantation, and subjected to all the cruelties and deprivations 
of a bondman. His natural abilities were
above mediocrity, but having never had the advantages 
of an education, or the privileges of a society
calculated to cultivate and refine his natural aspiring
intellect, and to direct his indomitable will in the
acquirement of the more imperishable graces of the
human heart, he had come to manhood with a determined, 
selfish disposition, to accomplish whatever
gratified his vanity or administered to the wants of
his animal nature.</p>
        <p>And may we not, with propriety here inquire,
whether our common Father, who has declared himself 
to be “no respecter of persons,” has endowed
men with enlarged capacities for the attainment of
that knowledge and wisdom, so requisite to the elevation 
of character,  -  for the express purpose of seeing
them made beasts of burden, and their superior faculties 
prostituted by the sensuality imposed by Slavery,
and to be sold as chattels, with impunity? I tell you,
nay. The day when Almighty God will avenge the
work of his own hands, hasteth greatly! Were it not
so, we might rejoice in the ignorance of the poor
slaves, and pray that none of them may ever be
endowed with a superior intellect to that of the brutes
<pb id="steward285" n="285"/>
they are made to resemble. Then would the proud
spirit no longer chafe, and manhood writhe in the
unbroken chain; but, like the ox to the yoke or the
horse to the harness, they might submit, without a
conscious violation of their dearest and God given
rights. But we were speaking of Israel Lewis.</p>
        <p>A natural energy and strength of character, he had
inherited; a malicious, selfish, and consequently a deceptive 
disposition, his life as a slave had undoubtedly
bestowed upon him. Intellect must have scope, and
when nothing is left within its grasp but vice, can we
wonder that the slave possessing the most talent,
should generally prove the greatest villain.</p>
        <p>Uneducated as was Lewis, his quick perception, his
ungoverned passions, and his native independence, not
only made him a dangerous slave, but an unfaithful
and overbearing companion. He, however, took a
wife  -  a slave like himself,  -  whose devotedness and
good sense, cannot be made manifest, more than in
her willingness to leave all that was dear to her on
earth, and flee from their birthplace, she knew not
whither; but confiding in the professed love and protection 
of her husband, she cheerfully followed him to
the dense forest, in search of that freedom, denied
them in their native country,  -  submitting herself
gladly to all the hardships and fearful anxieties of a
fugitive slave. What to her were horsemen, armed
with dirk and rifle! What though the trained and
<pb id="steward286" n="286"/>
inhuman blood-hound bayed upon their track! Was
not he who had sworn a life-long allegiance to her by
her side! Should he be killed or retaken, what could
she desire, but to be his companion still! Slavery
even, bitter as was the cup, might contain for her <hi rend="italics">one sweet drop,</hi> while connubial love lighted up their rude
cabin, and sweetened their daily toil; but the additional 
anticipation of LIBERTY, to their domestic
happiness  -  oh blessed hope! How it quickened their
weary footsteps, and, with fixed eyes upon the star of
the North, they pressed forward through every difficulty, 
until they finally reached Cincinnati, O. There
they lived quietly, and with others, suffered the
terrors of the mob, where also he was chosen agent,
to seek a more safe and quiet home for his afflicted
and outcast countrymen. The office was accepted,
and Lewis became the founder of the Wilberforce
colony.</p>
        <p>The personal appearance of Israel Lewis was prepossessing; 
his manner and address easy and commanding. 
To those unacquainted with his private
life, his ungoverned passions, and his unprincipled,
revengeful disposition, he could appear the gentleman,
the philanthropist, and the Christian.</p>
        <p>His education was limited; yet he had managed to
gather a sufficient knowledge of the sciences to enable
him to read and write, together with quite a fund of
general information; and then his shrewdness end tact
<pb id="steward287" n="287"/>
accomplished all the rest. To strangers he could
appear a ripe scholar, if left unquestioned. He was a
good speaker, and once spake with eloquence and
marked effect before the Legislature, assembled in the
Senate Chamber, at Albany, N. Y.</p>
        <p>Had the childhood of Mr. Lewis been passed under
more favorable auspices; had his intellectual faculties
been so cultivated as to predominate over his animal
propensities, and his towering aspirations directed
toward the accomplishment of acts, lofty in their
benevolence, noble in their sacrifice, high in their
honorable purpose, and great in their purity; I can
but believe that his powerful intellect would have
achieved the fame of a Lundy, or would have bequeathed 
to his brethren a memory like that of a
Clarkson. Instead, we have found him devoting his
energies to the gratification of his avarice, pride, and
ambition  -  characteristics directly opposed to the deportment 
of the humble Christian, and such as our
Heavenly Father has never promised to prosper.
How truly has “the wise man” said, “He that is
greedy of gain troubleth his own house; but he that
hateth gifts shall live.” How strikingly has this
passage been verified in the course of Lewis! For a
few paltry sums of gain, could he consent, not alone to
rob the poor, for whom it was kindly given as unto
the Lord, but to turn scornfully away from that poor,
illiterate, and humble slave wife, whom he had, in
<pb id="steward288" n="288"/>
their mutual adversity, vowed to cherish in <hi rend="italics">prosperity</hi>
as well as in all other circumstances through life. That
wife, who had borne with him the sorrows of
Slavery  -  the humble choice of a bondman! She,
who fled with him, anticipating additional happiness
in a life of freedom! Poor woman! Disappointment
is of an earthly growth, yet God is merciful; notwithstanding 
we have the same authority as above, for
saying that “Every one that is proud in heart is an
abomination to the Lord: though hand join in hand,
he shall not be unpunished.”</p>
        <p>In the hands of a righteous Judge we leave him,
who, for the wealth that perisheth,-who, for worldly
honor and selfish gratification, could barter his honesty
and integrity, as “Esau, who sold his birth-right for a
mess of pottage.”</p>
        <p>To me the lesson is an impressive one, and I am
thinking it would be well for us all to examine the
foundation on which we stand. If based upon the
solid and broad foundation of Christianity, doing to
others in all things as we would they should do to us,
sacrificing on all occasions our own ease, and worldly
honor, for the benefit of our fellow-men, and the good
of our country, then indeed, we need fear no evil; if
the winds of adversity howl about our dwelling, we
shall find it will stand, being founded on a ROCK.
But if we build upon “the sands” of fame or 
self-aggrandizement, and, like the towering oak. lift our
<pb id="steward289" n="289"/>
insignificant heads in proud defiance of the coming
storm, we may expect that our superstruction will
fall! “And great will be the fall of it!”</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXXIV.</head>
        <head>MY RETURN TO ROCHESTER.</head>
        <p>Having closed my business in Wilberforce, I
prepared to leave on the expiration of my
term of office as township clerk, which was now near
at hand. Notwithstanding, I ever felt a sensation of
relief and pleasure, when I thought of returning to
my old home and friends in the States, yet as often
as I look abroad over the settlement and remember all
my glowing hopes,  -  all my delightful anticipations of
a prosperous future for those poor, struggling colonists;
when I recollected with what zeal and honest purpose,
with what sincerity and sacrifice I had prosecuted my
labor among them,  -  a dark shadow of disappointment
would flit across my mind, however welcome it might
be. That I had firm and tried friends in the colony,
I had never the least reason to doubt, not to suppose
their number less after a five years residence with
them; but our expectations had not been realized.
<pb id="steward291" n="291"/>
Our hope of settling a township, to be represented in
Parliament by one of our own people, was now forever 
blasted. I remembered too, that many of the
colonists had been unjustly incited against my course;
but in the retrospect my heart did not condemn
me. Errors many, no doubt I had committed; but I
was grateful, when reviewing the whole ground, for a
conscience void of offence toward God and man; and
I finally took my leave of all, craving the choicest
blessings of Heaven to rest upon that infant colony
and its interests.</p>
        <p>On the nineteenth day of January, 1837, I left
Wilberforce, passing through Brantford, Hamilton,
Queenston, Lewiston, and from thence to Rochester.
During my journey, I could not avoid feeling sad and
despondent, as my mind incessantly returned to the
review of my mission, upon which I could look with
no other decision than that of an entire failure. I had
spent my time, wasted my substance for nought, and
was now returning to my dependent family,  -  that,
with myself, had been stripped of nearly every
means of comfort and support.</p>
        <p>What would my Rochester friends think of my
conduct? Notwithstanding all my despondency and
evil foreboding at that time, I am now well satisfied
that my labor was not all in vain, but that some good
did result from it.</p>
        <p>As I drew near the city, a gloom like thick darkness
<pb id="steward292" n="292"/>
overshadowed me: I thought of the unfavorable
transactions which had occurred between the directors
of the colony and my friends in Rochester, and fell to
wondering how they would receive me.</p>
        <p>On the twenty-third of January, 1837, I finally reentered 
the city penniless; but as I soon found, not so
friendless as my fears would have it. Among. the
first to welcome me back to my old home, was that
friend of “blessed memory,” Everard Peck, who had
been apprised of some of the losses I had met and the
trials I had passed through. This gentleman was also
one of the first to propose to be one of five men, who
should loan me one hundred dollars each, for five
years. Through the disinterested kindness of this
worthy gentleman, I was in a few days after my
arrival, well established in a store of provisions and
groceries. The five kind gentlemen, to whom I was
so deeply indebted for the loan, were: Everard Peck,
George A. Avery, Samuel D. Porter, Levi W. Sibley,
and Griffith, Brother &amp; Co.</p>
        <p>This noble act of generosity and kindness, on the
part of my friends, to furnish me with the means to
commence business, especially when their prospect was
anything but flattering, regarding my ever being able
to refund their well-timed and gracious liberality,  -  
affected me more deeply than all the censure and
persecution I had elsewhere received. Their frown
and displeasure, I was better prepared to meet than
<pb id="steward293" n="293"/>
this considerate act of Christian sympathy, which I am
not ashamed to say melted me to tears, and I resolved
to show my appreciation of their kindness by an
industry and diligence in business hitherto unsurpassed.</p>
        <p>E. Bardwell, then a merchant on Exchange Street,
next laid me under a lasting obligation by offering to
sell me goods on credit; others proffered assistance
by promising their continual patronage, which was to
me the same as cash,  -  and soon the store I had
opened on Main Street, was doing an extensive business. 
My profits were small to be sure, and I had a
heavy rent to pay for my store and dwelling, yet I
was making a comfortable living for my family, and
laying by something to reimburse the kind friends
who had helped me in the time of need, when I found
that the health of my family required more of my
time and assistance than ever before. My oldest
daughter, who, I have before mentioned, having taken
a violent cold on Lake Erie, was now confined to her
bed. All that could be done to save the life of a
darling child  -  our first born  -  was done; and if we
sometimes went beyond our means, it was a satisfaction 
to us to see her enjoy some of the comforts of
life of which my mission to Canada had deprived her.
One physician after another was employed to stay the
approach of the destroyer: some said they could cure
her, if paid in advance; to all of which I cheerfully
<pb id="steward294" n="294"/>
acceded, but only to see our beloved sink lower, and
patiently pine away.</p>
        <p>No one but a parent who has watched the rapid
decline of a darling child, and marked with a bursting
heart the approaching footsteps of the spoiler, can
imagine how powerless we felt at that time. The
wealth of the Indias, had we possessed it, would have
been freely given, although it would have been unavailing, 
to shield that loved and gentle form from
pain, and we were obliged to look hopelessly on, while
our little patient, suffering daughter sank lower and
lower every day. In vain were our parental arms
outstretched for her protection; from death we could
not save her. She had long since ceased to glide
about the house, and soothe with her silvery tones all
the childish fears of the little ones. Helpless she now
lay, burning with fever, and wasting from our sight,
“till soft as the dew on the twilight descending,”
the cold damps of death gathered on her youthful
brow. One pleasant morning after passing a restless
night, I observed her to gaze earnestly upward, and a
moment after I called her name but received no
answer.</p>
        <lg>
          <l>“Her languishing head was at rest;</l>
          <l>Its thinkings and achings were o'er;</l>
          <l>Her quiet, immoveable breast,</l>
          <l>Was heaved by affliction no more.”</l>
        </lg>
        <p>On the fifteenth day of April, 1837, she sweetly fell
<pb id="steward295" n="295"/>
asleep, aged eleven years. Sorrowfully we followed
her remains to Mount Hope, where we laid her down
to rest until the resurrection morning. Death had
now made its first inroad in our family circle, and
since then we have laid two other loved ones by her
side. We sorrowed, but not without hope.</p>
        <p>My business continued to prosper, and I concluded
to buy a small variety store, containing some three or
four hundred dollars worth of goods on the corner of
Main and North Streets, formerly owned by Mr.
Snow, but, having two stores on my hands, I did not
make much by the trade.</p>
        <p>The first summer after I returned to Rochester, the
friends of temperance made a fine celebration, and
gave me the privilege of providing the dinner.</p>
        <p>I considered it not only a privilege, but an honor,
and felt very grateful to the committee who conferred
the favor upon me.</p>
        <p>The celebration came off on the Fourth of July, and
was indeed a splendid affair. The multitude were
addressed on the public square, by some of the best
speakers in the country. I laid in a large quantity of
provisions of every available kind, built a bower,
hired waiters, and prepared seats for five hundred to
dine; but when the oration was over, and the multitude 
came to the table, I found that as many more
seats were wanted. We, however, accommodated as
many as we could, at one dollar each, and all passed
off well, to the great satisfaction of all concerned.</p>
        <pb id="steward296" n="296"/>
        <p>When all was over, and the friends learned that I
had on hand a large amount of cooked provision, they
continued their kindness by purchasing it, thus preventing 
any loss on my part.</p>
        <p>My store on the corner of Main and North Streets,
was at the head of the market, and I was enabled to
supply both of my stores with country produce on
the best possible terms. I kept two clerks at each
store, and all seemed prosperous for a time, when from
some cause, which I could never understand, my
business began to fail. My family had ever lived
prudently, and I knew that was not the cause. I
thought to better my circumstances by taking a store
in the Rochester House, but that proved to be a bad
stand for my business, and after one year, I removed
to Buffalo Street, opposite the Court House. I ought
to say, that as soon as I found that my income was
getting less than my expenses, I went to the gentlemen 
who had loaned me the five hundred dollars, and
showed them the true state of my affairs, and they
kindly agreed to take fifty per cent., which I paid
them.</p>
        <p>After locating on Buffalo Street, I took in a partner,
named John Lee, a young man, active and industrious,
who paid into the firm three hundred dollars, with
which we bought goods. With what I had on hand,
this raised the joint stock to about a thousand dollars,
which we were making frequent additions, and on
<pb id="steward297" n="297"/>
which we had an insurance of six hundred dollars.
Our business was now more prosperous than at any
previous time, and we began to look up with hope
and confidence in our final success. One night I
returned to my home as usual, leaving Lee in the
store. About twelve o'clock, Mr. Morris awoke me
with a few loud raps, and the announcement that
my store was on fire and a part of my goods in the
street! I hastened to the place, where I found, as he
had said, what was saved from the fire piled up in the
street and the fire extinguished. The building was
greatly damaged and the goods they rescued were
nearly ruined. Now we were thrown out of business, 
and the firm was dissolved. With the assistance
of W. S. Bishop, a lawyer, we made out the amount
of damage, which was readily paid by the agent for
the insurance company.</p>
        <p>When the Fourth of July came round again, the
temperance men resolved on having another demonstration, 
and as before, I was requested to supply the
dinner, which I did, after the same manner as the year
previous.</p>
        <p>Having been thrown out of business by the fire, I
began to examine my pecuniary matters, and found
that I was some three or four hundred dollars in debt,
which I had no means of paying. True, I had met
with a great misfortune, but I felt that to be an honest
man I must meet all obligations, whether legally
<pb id="steward298" n="298"/>
bound to do so or not; yet it was beyond my power at
that time, and I finally concluded to leave the city,
and try to better my condition by some other business
or at least to clear myself from debt.</p>
      </div1>
      <pb id="steward299" n="299"/>
      <div1>
        <head>CHAPTER XXXV.</head>
        <head>BISHOP BROWN - DEATH OF MY DAUGHTER.</head>
        <p>I removed with my family to the village of
Canandaigua, where I commenced teaching a
school for colored children, assisted by my daughter.
The school was sustained partly by the liberality of
the citizens of the village, and partly by donations
from abroad. It was continued two years, and the
children made rapid progress while they were under
our tuition.</p>
        <p>Soon after I left Rochester, I visited New York city,
and while there, I joined “The African Methodist Episcopal 
Conference.” Bishop Brown, of Philadelphia,
presided over the deliberations of that body, and
appeared to be a man of deep piety, as well as apt in
business, and was a native of one of the Carolinas.
I found a pleasing acquaintance also, with Bishop
Walters of Baltimore, Md. He was small in stature;
but a powerful speaker, and discharged every duty
<pb id="steward300" n="300"/>
with “an eye single to the glory of God.” He has
now gone to give an account of his stewardship, and
I pray that “his mantle may fall” upon one as
capable of leading our people as he. The conference
consisted of some sixty or seventy ministers of the
gospel, with these two Bishops at their head. The
conference continued its session ten days. When it
was closed, Bishop Brown, with several others, started
on a visit to the West. They called at Rochester, and
then passed over to Canada, where a conference was
to be holden. We arrived, after a pleasant journey,
at Hamilton, where the English government have a
regiment of black soldiers stationed. It was common,
in passing through the streets of Hamilton, to meet
every few rods, a colored man in uniform, with a
sword at his side, marching about in all the military
pomp allowed only to white men in this <hi rend="italics">free republic.</hi></p>
        <p>All being in readiness, Bishop Brown opened the
conference under the authority of Her Brittanic
Majesty, with great solemnity, which seemed to be
felt by the whole assembly. This meeting appeared
to me far more interesting than the one we had
attended in New York city. The colored people
were much more numerous in Hamilton, and in far
better circumstances than in New York. It is a hard
case to be poor in any large city, but to be both poor
and black, as was the condition of the majority of our
friends in New York, was indeed a terrible calamity
<pb id="steward301" n="301"/>
Every class, no matter how worthless they might be,
would be allowed to rent a house in preference to a
colored man. The consequence was, our people were
crowded back into the most unhealthy alleys, in old
dilapidated tenements unfit for human beings to dwell
in, and such as could not be disposed of to any other
class of people. I am happy to say, however, that a
favorable change has taken place in New York, since
the time of which I am speaking. Capitalists have
noted the good reputation of the colored people as
tenants, and have of late erected good dwellings for
their accommodation. In Hamilton there was none
of that wretchedness and squalid poverty, nor any of
that drunken rowdyism so common in Eastern cities,
perceivable among the colored people.</p>
        <p>Our conference was largely attended by all classes,
both black and white,  -  many of the latter invited the
Bishop with his associates to their dwellings to dine,
indeed we seldom took a meal at our lodgings, so constantly 
were we solicited by friends to accompany
them home.</p>
        <p>We also found many fugitive slaves in that city,
many of whom were intelligent mechanics. Some of
them took us about the place, showing us the different
buildings they were engaged in erecting; quite a
number were employed in building a church which
appeared to be done in a workman-like manner.</p>
        <p>In the meantime our meeting was progressing in a
<pb id="steward302" n="302"/>
very interesting manner, and when the closing services
were commenced, the house was filled to overflowing;
still many could not be accommodated. The preaching 
was solemn and impressive, and it really seemed
to me that the glory of God filled the house in which
we worshipped; saints rejoiced and shouted “glory to
God, in the highest,” while sinners trembled and cried
out, “what must we do to be saved from the wrath to
come.” There were several hopeful conversions
during the session of conference; and after its close
we spent one day in making social calls, and viewing
the city and its surroundings.</p>
        <p>Burlington Bay makes an excellent harbor for shipping, 
while Burlington Heights loom up on the north
in all their wild and terrific grandeur. Near the bay
resides Mr. McNab, so notorious in the history of the
Canadian revolution. We went in a large company
to look at his beautiful grounds and residence, over
which we were politely conducted by his amiable
lady. It was indeed a lordly mansion, with its surroundings 
laid out in the English style of princely
magnificence.</p>
        <p>On our return to the city at evening, we were
invited to attend a grand soiree, got up in honor of
the Bishop's first visit to that place. Several families
of colored people combined to provide the splendid
entertainment, while one lady presided at the board.
She was very beautiful and very dark; but a complete
<pb id="steward303" n="303"/>
model of grace and elegance, conversing with perfect
ease and intelligence with all, both black and white
ministers, who surrounded the festive board, as well
as our Irish friends, not a few of whom were present.
One honest son of the Emerald Isle entered, and not
understanding the matter, inquired of his brother
“Pat,” in rather a loud whisper, “What's all them
<sic>nagurs</sic> setting to that table for?” He, however, soon
satisfied himself, and all passed off quietly and in
excellent order. At a late hour the company after a
benediction, withdrew and dispersed.</p>
        <p>We left Hamilton the following morning, feeling
grateful and pleased with our meeting and visit.
It was a beautiful morning; the lake was still, no
sound was heard but the rushing waves, as our boat
moved on through its placid waters, toward our
destination, then called Fort George, now Niagara,
where we took stage for the Falls.</p>
        <p>At that place of resort, we stopped to view the
stupendous work of Almighty God, and listen to the
ceaseless thundering of the cataract. How tame appear 
the works of art, and how insignificant the
bearing of proud, puny man, compared with the awful
grandeur of that natural curiosity. Yet there, the
rich from all parts of the world, do congregate!
There you will find the idle, swaggering slaveholder,
blustering about in lordly style; boasting of his
wealth; betting and gambling; ready to fight, if his
<pb id="steward304" n="304"/>
slightest wish is not granted, and lavishing his cash
on all who have the least claim upon him. Ah, well
can he afford to be liberal,  -  well can he afford to
spend thousands yearly at our Northern watering
places; he has plenty of human chattels at home,
toiling year after year for his benefit. The little hoecake 
he gives them, takes but a mill of the wealth
with which they fill his purse; and should his
extravagance lighten it somewhat, he has only to
order his brutal overseer to sell  -  soul and body  -  
some poor creature; perchance a husband, or a wife,
or a child, and forward to him the proceeds of the
sale. While the wretched slave marches South with
a gang, under the lash, he lavishes his funds in
extravagant living,  -  funds gathered from the tears
and blood of a helpless human being. Have you,
dear reader, ever watched the slaveholder at such
places as I have, gliding through the shady groves,
or riding in his splendid carriage, dressed in the
richest attire, and with no wish ungratified that gold
can purchase; and have you ever been guilty of
envying him, or of wishing yourself in his condition?
If so, think of the curse which rests on him who
grinds the face of the poor. Think of his doom in
the day of final retribution, when he shall receive at
the bar of a righteous Judge, “according to the deeds
done in the body,” and not according to his wealth
and power. Think you, that the prayers, cries, and
<pb id="steward305" n="305"/>
pleadings of the down-trodden slave that for years
have been ascending to the throne of a just God, will
never be avenged? Yea, verily, the day of reckoning 
hastens on apace, and though, “He bear long
with them; He will surely avenge them of their adversaries; 
and that speedily!”</p>
        <p>As we pursued our journey to Buffalo, we passed
Grand Island, from whence Mordecai Emanuel Noah,
some years ago issued a proclamation, calling on the
Jews to come and build on that island the “City of
Refuge,” but which I believe was not responded to,
as I saw it remained in its native wildness. He had
also a monument erected there at the time, which
might be seen from the highway and canal, consisting
of a white marble slab, six feet in height, with a suitable 
inscription upon it, to direct the poor Jew to the
City of Refuge.</p>
        <p>It was quite conspicuous, but not so magnificent as
Gen. Brock's at Queenston Heights.</p>
        <p>Arrived at Buffalo, we held several meetings which
were very interesting. The colored people were then
numerous in that city, and owned one of the largest
churches in Western New York. We found a large
and prosperous society under the superintendence of
Elder Weir, who was a good and talented man, setting
a godly example for his flock to imitate. At Buffalo I
parted with my pleasant and instructive traveling
companion, Bishop Brown, never to meet again on the
<pb id="steward306" n="306"/>
shores of time. Soon after that pleasant journey he
died, and passed from his labor to reward.</p>
        <p>Buffalo was then, as now a great place for business.
Vessels from all parts of the country crowded the
docks, and I then thought that it must in time become
one of the largest cities in the Union. After a pleasant 
visit with our people there, I returned to my
home in Canandaigua, where I now began to feel
quite settled.</p>
        <p>I had been requested to act as agent for the “Anti-Slavery 
Standard,” with which I complied, and
leaving my daughter to teach the school, I spent the
most of my time in traveling through the country to
advance the interests of that paper. </p>
        <p>When I returned from Buffalo, she was complaining 
of poor health, nor was it long before we saw
that she was rapidly declining.</p>
        <p>This beloved daughter, I had spared no pains nor
money to educate and qualify for teaching. I had
encountered all the trials and difficulties that every
colored man meets, in his exertions to educate his
family. I had experienced enough to make me fear
that I should not always be able to get my children
into good schools, and therefore determined at whatever 
cost, to educate this child thoroughly, that she
might be able, not only to provide for her own wants,
but to teach her younger brothers and sisters, should
they be deprived of the advantages of a good school.
<pb id="steward307" n="307"/>
Well had she rewarded my labor; well had she
realized all my fondest hopes and expectations,  -  but
alas! for human foresight and worldly wisdom! The
accomplishments and qualifications of a teacher were
attained; and proudly we looked for the achievement 
of our long-contemplated design. How hard to
believe that the fell destroyer was upon her track!
Her education had qualified her for teaching the
sciences; but now I saw, that her faith in the religion
of the blessed Christ, was assisting her to teach her
own heart a lesson of patience, and quiet submission
to the will of Him who holds the issues of life,  -  and
Oh, how difficult for us to learn the <sic>solomn</sic> lesson,
that her wasting form, her gradual sinking away, was
hourly setting before us.</p>
        <p>Slowly her strength failed; she, however, saw our
sorrowful anxiety, and would try to relieve it with a
cheerful appearance. One day perhaps she would be
able to walk about, which would revive our wavering
hope; the next she was prostrate and suffering; then
hope died and we were sad! All the spring time she
languished; the summer came, the roses bloomed, and
the grain began to ripen, but she was wasting away.
The orchard yielded its golden harvest; the birds
sang merrily on the trees, but a dark shadow had
fallen on our hearthstone, and a gloom, like the pall of
death, rested on our household. Her place at table
was already vacant; no longer she called the little
<pb id="steward308" n="308"/>
ones about her to hear them repeat their tasks,  -  all
of which admonished us, that soon the bed where we
could now see her, would be vacated; and we should
no longer witness her patient smile, and know that
she was still with us. The pastor of the Baptist
church often called to pray with, and for, the quiet
sufferer, which she appreciated very highly, for she
was a Christian in every sense of the word.</p>
        <p>On the thirtieth day of August, at about eleven
o'clock, A. M., without a struggle or a groan, her
spirit returned to God who gave it. “Sweetly as
babes sleep,” she sank into the embrace of death.
Happily, triumphantly, had she seen the grim messenger 
approach; but she knew whom she had believed, 
and that He was able to keep that which
she had committed to Him, unto the resurrection of
the just.</p>
        <p>She had previously made a confession of her faith
in Christ, and had been buried with Him in baptism.
A few days after her demise, a long, sad train wound
its way to the village church yard, where we deposited 
the remains of our beloved,   -  Patience Jane
Steward, in the eighteenth year of her age; and then
returned to our desolate house, to realize that she had
left a world of pain and sorrow, where the fairest rose
conceals a thorn, the sweetest cup a bitter drop, for a
home where the flowers would never fade, and where
pain, sorrow and death will never come. We all felt
<pb id="steward309" n="309"/>
the solemn and impressive warning, “Be ye also
ready, for in such an hour as ye think not, the Son of
Man cometh.”</p>
        <p>As often as I recalled her triumphant, peaceful
death, her firm reliance on God, and sweet submission
to His will, I could not forbear contrasting her departure 
with that of Mrs. Helm, whose death I have
elsewhere described; and could fervently pray, that I
might live the life of the righteous, that my last end
might be like hers.</p>
        <lg>
          <l>“Behold the Western evening light,</l>
          <l>It melts in deep'ning gloom;</l>
          <l>So calmly Christians sink away,</l>
          <l>Descending to the tomb.</l>
          <l>The winds breathe low, the withering leaf</l>
          <l>Scarce whispers from the tree,  -  </l>

        <head>CHAPTER XXXVI.</head>
        <head>CELEBRATION OF THE FIRST OF AUGUST.</head>
        <p>The anti-slavery friends in Canandaigua, had resolved 
to celebrate the anniversary of the West
India emancipation, in suitable manner in that village,
for which funds had been unsparingly collected, to
defray the expenses of the coming demonstration.
The first of August, 1847, fell on Sunday, and our
people concluded to devote that day to religious meetings, 
and the second to their proposed celebration.</p>
        <p>Frederick Douglass and Mr. Van Loon, from Poughkeepsie, 
addressed the people on the Sabbath; and
also, on the same evening, a large concourse at the
Court House. The day following, there were not less
than ten thousand people assembled on the beautiful
grounds, belonging to the village Academy  -  attentive
listeners all to the eloquent speeches delivered, and
interested spectators of the imposing exercises.
<pb id="steward312" n="312"/>
When the vast multitude had convened, the exercises 
were commenced by the Rev. S. R. Ward, who
addressed the throne of grace, after which, Mr. Frederick 
Douglass delivered an oration, in a style of
eloquence which only Mr. Douglass himself can equal,
followed by a song from the Geneva choir, and music
by Barring's band. Rev. H. E. Garnet, editor of
“The National Watchman,” next spake, and with
marked effect, followed by Messrs. Ward and Doug
lass; after which, the assemblage formed a procession,
and marching to the Canandaigua Hotel, partook of a
sumptuous dinner, provided by the proprietor of that
house. At six P. M., they again assembled on the
square, and were most eloquently addressed by both
Ward and Garnet; at the close, they repaired to the
ladies' fair, where they found everything in a condition 
which spoke well for the enterprise and industry 
of our colored sisters. Their articles for sale,
were of a choice and considerate selection, and such
as sold rapidly and at fair prices. When all was
pleasantly over, the ladies contributed twenty dollars
toward paying the speakers present.</p>
        <p>A most beautiful ode was composed by a warm and
generous friend of the cause, which was sung in the
grove, in a spirit which produced a thrilling interest
Gladly would I give the reader the whole composition, 
but its length makes it objectionable for this
<pb id="steward313" n="313"/>
place, but should they happen to hear a soul-stirring
and sublime ode, commencing with,</p>
        <lg>
          <l>“Hail! to this day returning;</l>
          <l>Let all to Heaven aspire,” &amp;c.,</l>
        </lg>
        <p>they may know it is the one to which I refer.</p>
        <p>It was indeed, a glorious day for the colored population 
generally; and many were the indications of a
diminution of that prejudice so prevalent everywhere.
Some, who had supposed the colored man so inferior
to themselves as to be incapable of making an interesting 
speech, were convinced of their error, after
hearing Messrs. Douglass, Ward and Garnet. Mr. Van
Loon was a white clergyman, but a brother indeed;
his soul illumined by the pure light of the gospel of
peace; his heart full of sympathy for the oppressed;
his tongue pleading eloquently for equal rights; and
his hands busily engaged in breaking every yoke,
resting on the necks of poor humanity. So vigorously, 
so zealously did he unfold the horrors of the
slave system; so truthfully and faithfully did he
expose the treachery of northern politicians, and so
pathetically did he appeal to the humanity of every
professed Christian to speak out boldly for the dumb;
to shield, by the holy principles of their religion, the
poor, bound, illiterate slave, from Southern cruelty
and bondage,  -  that some of our aristocratic citizens,
some of our white savans, repaid his truthful eloquence,
<pb id="steward314" n="314"/>
by visiting upon him the bitterest maledictions. 
From the negro, said they, we will
accept these statements as true,  -  from him, they are
pertinent and forcible; but when such unpalatable
truths are uttered by a white clergyman, we cannot
abide, nor will we listen to them!</p>
        <p>Let consistency blush, and justice hang down its
head! Is not truth the same, whether proclaimed by
black or white,  -  bond or free? Is a falsehood to be
pardoned because uttered by a negro? If indeed, as
was admitted, the sentiments expressed by our eloquent 
colored speakers, were <hi rend="italics">true,</hi> could they be false,
when enforced by our intellectual friend, Van Loon?
Certainly not; nor would the case have been so
decided by these Solons, in any other case: or where
the prejudice against color had not warped and
blinded their otherwise good judgments. Our speaker, 
however, performed his duty faithfully, and with
great satisfaction to the colored people and their true
friends present.</p>
        <p>The remains of this fearless champion of liberty;
this humble disciple of the despised Nazarene, now
sleeps in death, beside the placid waters of the
Hudson, while his cherished memory lives in the
affections of thousands, who “are ready to perish,”
and is honored by the pure in heart, wherever his
name has been known throughout the land. In the
day of final reckoning, think you, he will regret
<pb id="steward315" n="315"/>
having plead the cause of the bondman? Ah, no;
nor can we doubt that to hint will be rendered the
welcome plaudits: “Well done, good and faithful
servant; enter thou into the joy of thy Lord. Thou
hast been faithful over a few things; I will make thee
a ruler over many things.” What then are the few
light afflictions endured in this life, when compared
with “an eternal weight of glory,” awarded to the
faithful in that which is to come?</p>
        <p>Pleasant, happy, and beneficial, as had been the
re union of old and tried friends, to celebrate a glorious 
event, yet, like all earthly enjoyments, it was
brought to a termination, reluctant as were the friends
to separate. Since that clay, many have been the
demonstrations of grateful joy and gladness on the
glorious anniversary of the emancipation of slaves on
the West India Islands; and yet, in this boasted “land
of the free, and home of the brave;” this famous and
declared <hi rend="italics">free</hi> Republic,  -  the American slave still
clanks his heavy chain, and wears the galling yoke
of the bondman!</p>

        <head>CHAPTER XXXVII.</head>
        <head>CONCLUSION.</head>
        <p>For several years past, anti-slavery truth has
been spreading, and in proportion as light has
shone upon the “peculiar institution,” exposing to the
world its crimes and blood,  -  enstamping upon its
frontlet, “THE SUM OF ALL VILLAINIES,”  -  has the
wrath of the impious slaveholder been kindled, and
his arm outstretched to strengthen the chain, and
press closer the yoke upon the helpless slave, proving
conclusively that he loves darkness because his deeds
are evil. Nor is this all; he and his apologists will insolently 
tell you, that <hi rend="italics">you</hi> are the guilty ones who have
tightened the bonds of the slave, increased his hardships, 
and blighted his prospect of freedom, by your
mistaken kindness, in showing the slaveholder the
enormity of his sin! Can this be so? Have we any
direct influence over his human chattels? None.
Then who is it that rivets the chain and increases the
<pb id="steward317" n="317"/>
already heavy burden of the crushed slave, but he
who has the power to do with him as he wills? He
it is, who has been thrust, unwillingly perhaps, into
sufficient light to show him his moral corruption, and
the character of the sin he is daily committing; he it
is, whose avarice and idleness induces to hold fast
that which is to him a source of wealth,  -  and by no
means to allow the same light to fall in upon the
darkened intellect of his slave property, lest his
riches “take to themselves wings;” or, as may be
more properly said, <hi rend="italics">take to themselves legs and run
away.</hi></p>
        <p>What stronger proof can we ask in favor of our
position, than the intolerant spirit of the South? If
the system and practice of Slavery is a righteous one,
instituted by an All-wise God, certainly no human
power  -  especially one so impotent and futile as the
abolition power is said to be  -  can ever overthrow it.
Why then are the mails so closely examined, and
fines imposed on prohibited anti-slavery documents?
Is it beyond their power to confute the arguments
adduced, or are they fearful that a ray of Northern
light may fall on the mind of some listening slave,
and direct him to the depot of an under-ground railroad? 
Judge ye!</p>
        <p>What but this same fearful and intolerant spirit,  -  
this over-bearing, boasting spirit, was it, that cowardly
attacked a Christian Senator, while seated unsuspectingly
<pb id="steward318" n="318"/>
at his desk, and felled him to the floor, bleeding
and senseless? Was not the villainous blow which
fell upon the honored head of CHARLES SUMNER, dealt
by the infamous Brooks of South Carolina, aimed at
the free speech of the entire North? Was it, think
you, a personal enmity that the cowardly scoundrel
had toward our worthy Northern Senator, which
induced the attack? No, no. Brooks spake for the
South, and boldly has it responded  -  Amen!</p>
        <p>It has said through its representatives, that you
Northerners are becoming too bold in speaking of our
sin, and we will use brute force to repel it  -  an argument 
with which we are familiar. You have told us
that we ought not to hold slaves, nor extend slave
territory, which will in a measure destroy our slave
market, and prove injurious to our slave-breeding
population. You have told us we have no right to
usurp Kansas,  -  no right to murder “Free State men,”
and no right to sustain there, a set of “ruffians” to
make Kansas a slave State. You have told us, that
we have no right to live on the unrequited toil of our
slaves; nor to sell them to the highest bidder; nor
spend the proceeds of the sale in idle extravagance.
Now know, all ye Northerners, by this cowardly blow
on the devoted head of your honored and respected
Senator, that we shall no longer permit you to tell us
such unpalatable truths, nor allow you the privilege
of free speech! We have too long held the balance
<pb id="steward319" n="319"/>
of power in the government to yield it now; and we
give you to know, that whatever we ask of this
government, we expect to obtain; nor will we hear
any of your objections. When we desire you to turn
blood-hound, and hunt for us our fugitive slaves, we
expect you to do it, and to see them returned to their
masters, without a murmur on your part. Should
you object or dare refuse, we shall certainly <hi rend="italics">cane somebody, </hi>
or else do what we have threatened for the last
quarter of a century,  -  “DISSOLVE THE UINON!”
Bah!</p>
        <p>My house has ever been open to the fugitive slaves;
but more particularly when I resided in Rochester,
did I have occasion to see and feel the distresses
of that class of persons; and it appears to me, that
the heart must be of adamant, that can turn coldly
away from the pleadings of the poor, frightened, flying 
fugitive from Southern bondage.</p>
        <p>For many years past, I have been a close and interested 
observer of my race, both free and enslaved. I
have observed with great pleasure, the gradual improvement 
in intelligence and condition of the free
colored people of the North. In proportion as prejudice 
has diminished, they have gradually advanced;
nor can I believe that there is any other great impediment 
in the way to a higher state of improvement.
That prejudice against color is not destroyed, we very
well know. Its effects may be seen in our down-cast,
<pb id="steward320" n="320"/> 
discouraged, and groveling countrymen, if <sic>no where</sic>
else. Notwithstanding the late diminution, it exists
in many of our hotels: some of them would as soon
admit the dog from his kennel, at table, as the colored
man; nevertheless, he is sought as a waiter; allowed
to prepare their choicest dishes, and permitted to
serve the white man, who would sneer and scorn to
eat beside him. Prejudice is found also, in many of
our schools,  -  even in those to which colored children
are admitted; there is so much distinction made by
prejudice, that the poor, timid colored children might
about as well stay at home, as go to a school where
they feel that they are looked upon as inferior, however 
much they may try to excel.</p>
        <p>Nor is that hateful prejudice  -  so injurious to the
soul, and all the best interests of the negro  -  excluded 
from the professed church of Christ. Oh, no; we
often find it in the house of worship, in all its cruel
rigor. Where people assemble to worship a pure and
holy God, who can look upon no sin with allowance  -  
the creator of all, both white and black,  -  and where
people professing to walk in the footsteps of the meek
and quiet Jesus, who has taught us to esteem others
better than ourselves; we often see the lip of some
professed saint, curled in scorn at a dusky face, or a
scowl of disapprobation if a colored person sits elsewhere 
than by the door or on the stairs. How long,
O Lord, must these things be!</p>
        <pb id="steward321" n="321"/>
        <p>Of my enslaved brethren, nothing so gratifies me,
as to hear of their escape from bondage; and since the
passage of that iniquitous “Fugitive Slave Bill,” I
have watched with renewed interest the movements
of the fugitives, not only from Slavery direct, but
those who have been compelled to flee from the nominally 
free States, and ask the protection of a monarchial 
government, to save them from their owners in
a land of boasted liberty!</p>
        <p>The knowledge I have of the colored men in
Canada, their strength and condition, would cause me
to tremble for these United States, should a war ever
ensue between the English and American governments, 
which I pray may never occur. These fugitives
may be thought to be a class of poor, thriftless,
illiterate creatures, like the Southern slaves, but it is
not so. They are no longer slaves; many of whom
have been many years free men, and a large number
were never slaves. They are a hardy, robust class of
men; very many of them, men of superior intellect;
and men who feel deeply the wrongs they have endured. 
Driven as they have been from their native
land; unprotected by the government under which
they were born, and would gladly have died,  -  they
would in all probability, in case of a rupture, take up
arms in defense of the government which has protected 
them and the country of their adoption.
England could this day, very readily collect a regiment
<pb id="steward322" n="322"/>
of stalwart colored men, who, having felt the
oppression of our laws, would fight with a will not
inferior to that which actuated our revolutionary
forefathers.</p>
        <p>And what inducement, I ask, have colored men to
defend with their lives the United States in any case;
and what is there to incite them to deeds of bravery?</p>
        <p>Wherever men are called upon to take up arms in
defense of a country, there is always a consciousness
of approaching wrong and oppression, which arouses
their patriotism and incites to deeds of daring. They
look abroad over fields of their own cultivation; they
behold too, churches, schools, and various institutions,
provided by their labor, for generations yet to come;
they see their homes, their cherished hearthstone,
about to be desecrated, and their wives and little ones,
with their aged sires, exposed to the oppression of a
ruthless foe. Then, with what cheerful and thrilling
enthusiasm, steps forward the husband, the father, the
brother, and bares his bosom to the sword,  -  his head
to the storm of the battle-field, in defence of his
country's freedom, and the God-given rights of himself 
and family! But what sees the oppressed negro?
He sees a proud and haughty nation, whose Congressmen 
yearly meet to plot his ruin and perpetuate his
bondage! He beholds, it is true, a few Christ-like
champions, who rise up with bleeding hearts to defend
his cause; but while his eye kindles with grateful
<pb id="steward323" n="323"/>
emotion, he sees the bludgeon of the South  -  already
reeking in the blood of freemen  -  raised and ready to
fall with murderous intent upon the head of any one,
who, like the illustrious Sumner, dare open his mouth
in defence of Freedom, or speak of the wrongs of the
poor negro, and the sins of the Southern autocrat!</p>
        <p>What inducement then, has the slave to shoulder
his musket, when the American drum beats the call,
“To Arms! To Arms!”  Does he not remember that
the wife of his bosom; the children,  -  “bone of his
bone, and flesh of his flesh,”  -  and the rude hearthstone 
they for a time are allowed to surround, belong
not to himself, but to the tyrannical master, who
claims dominion over all he possesses. As his property 
then, let the slave owner go forth in defence of
his own, and lay down his life if he please; but the
poor slave has no home, no family to protect; no
country to defend; nor does he care to assist in sustaining 
a government that instead of offering him
protection, drives him from the soil which has been
cultivated by his own labor,  -  to beg at the hand of
England's Queen, “life, liberty, and the pursuit of
happiness.”</p>
        <p>Humiliating as it is for an American citizen to
name these things, they are nevertheless true; and I
would to God that America would arise in her native
majesty, and divest herself of the foul stain, which
Slavery has cast upon her otherwise pure drapery!
<pb id="steward324" n="324"/>
Then would she be no longer a hissing and by-word
among the nations; but indeed what she professes to
be, “the land of the free, and the home of the brave;”
an asylum for the oppressed of every clime.</p>
        <p>But should the monarchial government of England
call for the services of the colored man, freely would
his heart's blood be poured out in her defence,  -  not
because he has a particular preference for that form
of government; not because he has ceased to love his
native country,  -  but because she has acknowledged his
manhood, and given him a home to defend. Beneath
the floating banner of the British Lion, he finds
inducements to lay down his life, if need be, in
defence of his own broad acres, his family end fireside,
  -  all of which were denied him under the Stars
and Stripes of his fatherland. But a short time ago,
the colored men of Cincinnati, O., were promptly
denied the privilege they had solicited, to join with
other citizens, in celebrating the anniversary of
WASHINGTON'S Birth Day! Oh, no; there must be
no colored man in the company, met to honor him
who still lives in the heart of every American citizen,  -  
“the father of his country,”  -  and yet, who
scorned not to sleep beside his faithful negro! Nor
did the nephew of the illustrious General, despise the
command of the black regiment, which Gen. Jackson
so proudly commended for their bravery, and bestowed 
upon it his personal thanks, for their services
on the field of battle.</p>
        <pb id="steward325" n="325"/>
        <p>Do the Northern or Free States of the Union think
to clear their skirts of the abomination of Slavery, by
saying that they own no slaves? Very true. But is
the poor, flying fugitive from the house of bondage,
safe one moment within your borders? Will he be
welcomed to your homes, your tables, your firesides?
Will your clergymen bid you clothe and feed him, or
give him a cup of cold water, in the name of a disciple
of that holy Christ, who has said,  -  “inasmuch as ye
have done it unto one of the least of these little ones,
ye have done it unto me?”  -  Or will your own
miserable Fugitive Slave Law, close the mouth of your
clergy; crush down the rising benevolence of your
heart; and convert you into a human blood-hound, to
hunt down the panting fugitive, and return him to the
hell of Slavery? Oh, my God!  -  the fact is too horrible 
to acknowledge, and yet it is a stubborn one.
Not on one foot of land under the broad folds of
Columbia's banner, can the slave say, “I am free!”
Hungry, naked, and forlorn, he must flee onward;
nor stop short of the outstretched arms of an English
Queen. Yet, thanks be to our Heavenly Father, that
all have not bowed the knee to the Southern autocrat
or slave power. A few noble souls, thank God,
remain, who, in defiance of iniquitous laws, throw
open wide their doors to the trembling, fleeing bondman, 
whose purses arc freely emptied to supply his
wants, and help him on in his flight to the British
<pb id="steward326" n="326"/>
dominion. But can these out-gushings of a benevolent 
heart  -  the purest impulses of a noble nature  -  be
permitted to flow out spontaneously, in open daylight? 
Alas, no! You must be quiet; make no
noise, lest an United States' Marshal wrest from you
the object of your Christian sympathy, and impose
on you a heavy fine, for your daring to do to another
as you would he should do to you.</p>
        <p>Is not the necessity of an <hi rend="italics">“under ground railroad,”</hi>
a disgrace to the laws of any country? Certainly it
is; yet I thank God, that it does afford a means of
escape to many, and I pray that the blessings of
Heaven may ever rest upon those who willingly
superintend its interests. Oh, my country! When
will thy laws, just and equal, supersede this humiliating 
necessity!</p>
        <p>Is my reader about to throw the blame of our
nation's wrong on England, and accuse her of first
tolerating Slavery? We admit it; but did she not
repent of the evil she had done, and speedily break
every yoke, and let the oppressed go free? Certainly;
no slave now breathes in England's atmosphere. But,
say you, her white poor are slaves to the aristocracy,
from which sentiment I beg leave to differ. Oppressed
they may be, and doubtless are, as the poor are apt to
be in any and every country; but they are not sold
in the market, to the highest bidder, like beasts of
burden, as are the American slaves. No Englishman,
<pb id="steward327" n="327"/>
however poor, destitute, or degraded he may be, but
owns himself, his wife and children; nor does he fear
that they be sold and torn from his embrace, while he
is laboring for their support. Poverty, my friend,
does not comprise the bitterness of Slavery, no more
than “one swallow makes a summer,”  -  nor does it
consist solely in ignorance and degradation. Its
bitterness arises from a consciousness of wrong; a
sense of the violation of every right God has given to
man, and the uncertainty of his future, over which he
has no control.</p>
        <p>If the American people flatter themselves with the
idea of getting rid of the hated negro race, by colonizing 
them on the sickly soil of Liberia, or any other
country, they will surely find themselves mistaken.
They are Americans; allied to this country by birth
and by misfortune; and here will they remain,  -  not
always as now, oppressed and degraded,  -  for all who
have any interest in the matter, well know that the
free colored people, are rapidly advancing in intelligence, 
and improving their condition in every respect.
Men of learning and genius, are now found among
those with fleecy locks, and good mechanics with
dusky complexion.</p>
        <p>This marked improvement in the condition and
rapid advancement in intelligence among our people,
seems to have alarmed the colonizationists, and made
them fearful that those very down-trodden slaves, who
<pb id="steward328" n="328"/>
have for years labored for nought; whose blood and
tears have fertilized the Southern soil, may, perchance,
become their equals in intelligence, and take vengeance 
on their oppressors for the wrongs done them;
and lest they should do so, they would gladly remove
them to some far-off country.</p>
        <p>Yet here, in North America, will the colored race
remain, and ere long in my opinion, become a great
people, equal with the proud Anglo-Saxon in all things.
The African has once been a powerful nation, before
Christian Englishmen invaded her coasts with rum,
and incited her chiefs to war, by purchasing with
gaudy, but worthless trinkets, her conquered captives;
and we have every reason to believe, that though her
glory as a nation has departed, that her sons will yet
be acknowledged free men by the white population of
this country.</p>
        <p>There have been black generals in the world before
Napoleon was born, and there may be again; and
to-day, notwithstanding all the prejudice against
color, that everywhere exists in this guilty nation,
there are men of talent among us, inferior to none on
the earth; nor are their numbers few, though rapidly
increasing.</p>
        <p>Well may the South arouse herself, form societies,
replenish its treasury with a tax imposed on the free
colored people, to defray the expense of sending manumitted 
slaves to Liberia!</p>
        <pb id="steward329" n="329"/>
        <p>Listen a moment to the cant of the colonizationists.
Hear him talk of the duty he owes to Africa, and how
happy, how intelligent, how prosperous everything is
in Liberia. But when that delightful country asks to
be taken into fellowship with the United States, and
to have her independence recognized  -  ah, then he
lifts his hands in horror and begs to be excused from
so close a relation.</p>
        <p>This is all cant, in my humble opinion; and when
I see men so anxious to send the negro out of their
sight, I feel quite certain that they are conscious of
having deeply wronged him, and think to remove
him, to atone for their guilty consciences. Would
they refuse to acknowledge the independence of
Liberia, if their interest in the colored people was
genuine, especially when several other nations had
done so? Oh, no. But that is not <hi rend="italics">“the rub.”</hi> How
could one of our lordly nabobs of the South, sit in
Congress with perhaps one of his own manumitted
slaves as a representative from Liberia or Hayti! He
would die of mortification. Very well then; but let
him talk no more of sending colored men to that
country to make them free men.</p>
        <p>The colored people generally, I am happy to say,
have a right conception of the colonization plan, and
will never be induced to go to Africa, unless they go
as missionaries to the heathen tribes, who certainly
should have the gospel preached to them. Some,
<pb id="steward330" n="330"/>
from a sense of duty, may go as teachers,  -  which is
all well enough,  -  but certain it is, that no amount of
prejudice or abuse, will ever induce the colored race
to leave this country. Long have they been oppressed; 
but they are rising  -  coming up to an elevated
standard, and are fast gathering strength and courage,
for the great and coming conflict with their haughty
oppressors.</p>
        <p>That there must be ere long, a sharp contest between 
the friends of Freedom and the Southern
oligarchy, I can no longer doubt.</p>
        <p>When our worthy ministers of the gospel, are sent
back to us from the South, clothed with a coat of tar
and feathers; when our best and most sacrificing
philanthropists are thrown into Southern dungeons;
when our laboring men are shot down by haughty
and idle Southern aristocrats, in the hotels of their
employers, and under the very eye of Congress;
when the press is muzzled, and every editor, who has
the manliness to speak in defence of Freedom,
and the wickedness of the slaveholder, is caned or
otherwise insulted by some insignificant Southern
bully; and when at last, our Mr. SUMNER: is attacked
from behind, by a Southern, cowardly scoundrel, and
felled senseless on the floor of the Senate chamber, for
his defence of Liberty,  -  then, indeed, may Northern
men look about them! Well may they be aroused
by the insolence and tyranny of the South!</p>
        <pb id="steward331" n="331"/>
        <p>And for what <hi rend="italics">is</hi> all this? Do not our Southern
men know, that if light and truth are permitted to
reach the minds of the people, that Kansas will be
lost to them as slave territory, wherein the Southern
slave-breeder can dispose of his own flesh to the
highest bidder! Hear them talk as they do, in their
pious moments, with upturned faces, in solemn mockery, 
of returning the negro to his <hi rend="italics">native</hi> Africa! How
many pure Africans, think you, can be found in the
whole slave population of the South, to say nothing
of their nativity? Native Africa, indeed! Who
does not know, that in three-fourths of the colored
race, there runs the blood of the white master,  -  the
breeder of his own chattels! Think you, that a
righteous God will fail to judge a nation for such
flagrant sins? Nay, verily. If the All-wise God,
who has created of one blood all nations of the
earth, has designed their blood to <sic>commingle</sic> until
that of the African is absorbed in that of the European,
  -  then is it right, and amalgamation of all the
different races should be universally practiced and
approved. If it be right for the Southern slaveholder,
to cruelly enforce the mixture of the races, to gratify
his lust, and swell the enormity of his gains, certainly
it cannot be wrong to amalgamate from choice and
affection. Let us ask then, why did our Omnipotent
Creator make the marked distinction? Certainly not
for the purpose that one race might enslave and
<pb id="steward332" n="332"/>
triumph over another; but evidently, that each in his
own proper sphere might glorify God, to whom their
respective bodies and spirits belong. Why, indeed,
was the black man created, if not to fulfil his destiny
<hi rend="italics">as a negro,</hi> to the glory of God?</p>
        <p>Suffer me then to exhort you, my countrymen, to
cease looking to the white man for example and
imitation. Stand boldly up in your own national
characteristics, and show by your perseverance and
industry, your honor and purity, that you are men,
colored men, but of no inferior quality. The greatest
lack I see among you, is unity of action, pardonable, 
to be sure, in the eyes of those who have seen
your oppression and limited advantages; but now that
many of you have resolved to gain your rights or die
in the struggle, let me entreat you to band yourselves
together in one indissoluble bond of brotherhood,
to stand shoulder to shoulder in the coming conflict,
and let every blow of yours tell for Freedom and the
elevation of your race throughout the land. Speak
boldly out, for the dumb and enslaved of your unfortunate 
countrymen, regardless of the frowns and
sneers of the haughty tyrants, who may dare lift
their puny arm, to frustrate the design of the Almighty, 
in preserving you an unmixed and powerful
race on the earth.</p>
        <p>While I would not that you depend on any human
agency, save your own unyielding exertion, in the
<pb id="steward333" n="333"/>
elevation of our race; still, I would not have you
unmindful of, nor ungrateful for, the noble exertions
of those kind white friends, who have plead the
cause of the bondman, and have done all in their
power to aid you, for which, may the God of the
oppressed abundantly bless them.</p>
        <p>Let your attention be given to the careful training
and education of the rising generation, that they may
be useful, and justly command the respect of their
fellow-men. Labor for a competency, but give not
your whole attention to amassing the wealth that
perishes; but seek to lay up for yourselves “treasures
where moth doth not corrupt, nor thieves break
through and steal.”</p>
        <p>Suppose not, my brethren, that your task is a light
one, or one that can be performed without years of
patient toil and unyielding perseverance. Our oppressors 
are not very ready to credit our exertion,  -  
too often forgetting the effects of our long degradation,
and vainly expecting to see us arise at once, to the
highest standard of elevation, able to cope successfully
with those who have known no such discouragements 
or disadvantages, as has been our lot to bear.</p>
        <p>These and many other obstacles must be bravely
met, and assiduously removed,  -  remembering that
Slavery has robbed some of us, and prejudice many
others, of that perseverance so necessary to the accomplishment 
of any enterprise; but in the elevation of
<pb id="steward334" n="334"/>
ourselves and race, let us never falter and grow
weary, until we have reached the elevated station
God designed us to occupy, and have fitted the rising
generation to fill and improve it after our earthly
course is finished and we leave to them the stage of
action.</p>
        <p>Allow me, however, to entreat, that no success
which may attend your determined efforts; no position
which you may attain,  -  may ever so occupy your
mind, as to cause you to forget for one moment, the
afflictions of your countrymen, or to cease to remember 
the groaning millions in bonds, until every slave
shall triumphantly chant the song of deliverance
from Slavery's dark prison house.</p>
        <p>Bear with me, my dear brethren, while I claim a
friend's license, to say, that I would not that you
place implicit confidence in any of the political organizations 
of the present time; but remember that the
majority of those parties are diligently laboring for
their own interest. Look you then to yours; are
you less capable of securing your rights than
they? Never was there a time when indolence and
supineness among us, would be so unpardonable as
now, nor when so much depended on our active and
judicious exertions.</p>
        <p>Let us not forget, that in the past, we could and
did truthfully complain, that we had no helper,  -  
bound and crushed beneath an overwhelming weight
<pb id="steward335" n="335"/>
of prejudice and ignorance, we lay helpless at the
feet of our political spoilers. A favorable change has
since been effected in the public sentiment; and now
that we see thousands who are willing to aid us, and
as many more who will not hinder our labor,-shall
we fold our hands in idleness?  -  or shall we renew
our energies, in the cause of freedom and of our own
advancement? Although we may not implicitly rely
upon the political exertion of others, let us not fear to
co-operate with the friends of liberty everywhere, as
far as a good conscience will permit, and our limited
privileges will allow, by our determined zeal for the
right, make our influence felt in the nation. See what
wrong and oppression our white brethren have met in
Kansas, from the slave power; and let their noble
deeds of patriotism; their liberal sacrifices for freedom,
be not only our example, but an incentive to do our
duty. Have they more at stake in that mighty
struggle than we, that they should leave their homes
of refinement and comfort, take their lives in their
hands and bravely contend for their rights, surrounded
by scenes of blood and carnage? Certainly not. No
people on the earth can have greater incentives to
arouse them to action, than the colored people of this
country now have; I trust therefore, that our future
independence and prosperity, will suffer nothing from
the inactivity of our race.</p>
        <p>Some may entertain the belief that the African
<pb id="steward336" n="336"/>
slave trade is entirely abandoned. I think not. Often
are seen strange, suspicious looking vessels, lying
along the African coast, for no other purpose than that
of kidnapping the poor, ignorant natives. Stealthily
the slave-trader lands his wicked crew, in the vicinity
of some negro village or cluster of huts, and when a
favorable opportunity occurs, he and his men rush
upon the frightened African, burn their huts, and amid
the shrieks of the captives, and the groans of the helpless 
and aged, who have been trampled down in their
rude haste to secure the young and able-bodied
natives, bear them to the vessel, where they are
stowed away in the hold of the ship, which bears
them to Christian (?) America, where they are sold as
slaves.</p>
        <p>Some years ago, a woman engaged in washing
clothes, near the sea coast, had a lad with her to take
care of her two younger children  -  one a young babe  -  
while she was at work. They wandered away a short
distance, and while amusing themselves under some
bushes, four men, to them strange looking creatures,
with white faces, surrounded them; and when the lad
attempted to run away, they threw the infant he held
in his arms, on the ground, and seizing the other two
children, bore them screaming with fear, to the ship.
Frantic and inconsolable, they were borne to the
American slave market, where they were sold to a
Virginia planter, for whom they labored sorrowfully
<pb id="steward337" n="337"/>
and in tears, until old age deprived them of farther
exertion, when they were turned out, like an old horse,
to die; and did die destitute and uncared for, in their
aged infirmity, after a long life of unrequited toil.
That lad, stolen from Africa's coast, was my grandfather.</p>
        <p>It is not, however, necessary for us to look beyond
our own country, to find all the horrors of the slave
traffic! A tour through the Southern States will
prove sufficient to satisfy any one of that fact;
nor will they travel over one of them, before  -  if
they have a heart of flesh  -  they will feel oppressed
by the cruel outrage, daily inflicted on their 
fellow-beings. The tourist need not turn aside to seek
evidences: he will very readily observe the red flag
of the auctioneer floating over the slave pen, on which
he may read in large letters, waving in the pure air of
heaven, “SLAVES, HORSES, AND OTHER CATTLE, <hi rend="italics">in lots
to suit purchasers!”</hi> He may halt a moment, and look
at the multitude, collecting under the folds of that
infamous banner, where will be found a few gentlemanly 
appearing slave holding planters, superbly
mounted, and perhaps with their servants in waiting;
but the larger number he will find to be drunken,
coarse, brutal looking men, swaggering about in the
capacity of slave-traders.</p>
        <p>Let him enter the low, dingy, filthy building, occupied 
by human merchandise, and he will there behold
<pb id="steward338" n="338"/>
husbands and wives, parents and children, about to be
sold, and perhaps separated forever! See the trader,
as he examines with inhuman indifference the bones
and sinews, the teeth and joints of the <hi rend="italics">articles</hi> on
hand, even of females, and hear him make inquiries
concerning her capabilities, that would make a savage
blush! And see the miserable woman lift her red
and swollen eyes to the face of the heartless trader,
and the next moment cast a <sic>dispairing</sic> glance over the
motley crowd, in search of a compassionate look  -  a
pitying eye. Should she see one countenance wearing
a kind, humane expression, it will most likely bring
her frantically to his feet, where, kneeling, with uplifted 
hands, she pleads: “Oh, Massa, do buy me! Do
buy me and little Sam! He be all of the chil'ens I
got left! O, Lord! O. Lord! Do, Massa, buy me,
and this one baby! Oh, do Massa!” But the
weight of the cow-hide drives her to the auction
block, where in mock solemnity she is represented as
“an article of excellent breed, a good cook, a good
seamstress, and withal a good Christian, a ra'al gene-wine 
lamb of the flock!”  -  and then she is struck off
to the highest bidder, who declares that he “won't
have the young'un any how, 'cause he's gwine to
drive her down to Lousianny.”</p>
        <p>He may see, too, the wild, dispairing look of some
frightened young slave girl, passing under the lustful
gaze of some lordly libertine, who declares himself
“ in search of a fancy article for his own use!”</p>
        <pb id="steward339" n="339"/>
        <p>One after another is taken from the block, until all
are disposed of, amid the agonized wail of heartbroken 
wives and mothers, husbands and fathers, and
the piercing screams of helpless children, torn from a
parent's embrace, to be consigned to the care of
strangers.</p>
        <p>Nor need I inform our traveler of the inhuman
method generally approved, in hunting with trained
blood-hounds, kept and advertised for the purpose of
recapturing any poor slave who may attempt to
escape from this cruel bondage. He may perchance,
come across the mangled and lifeless body of some
fugitive, which has just been run down and torn in
pieces by the dogs of the hunter! Should he stop a
few moments, he will soon see a hole dug in the
ground, and the remains of the slave pitched into it,
covered sufficiently to hide the unsightly mass from
view, and there will be an end of the whole matter!
“Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord;
and shall not my soul be avenged on such a nation as
this?”</p>
        <p>In giving to the public this unvarnished, but truthful 
narrative, of some of the occurrences of my
humble and uneventful life, I have not been influenced 
by a vain desire for notoriety, but by a willingness 
to gratify a just and honorable request,
repeatedly made by numerous and respected friends,
to learn the truth concerning my connection with the
<pb id="steward340" n="340"/>
Wilberforce colony;  -  the events which there transpired
during my stay, and the cause of my losing a hardearned 
property. Regarding the affairs of the colony,
I have, therefore, endeavored to be particular,  -  believing 
that duty to myself and brethren, required me
to give them the within information; but nothing
have I set down in malice. Much more might have
been said relative to some of the leading characters in
that settlement, had I not been fearful of its assuming
the character of a personal enmity or retaliation. He
who knows and will judge the actions of men, will
bear me witness, that I have cherished no such
feelings toward any of those who then lived, but now
sleep in death.</p>
        <p>In justification, however, of my statements regarding 
the character of Mr. Lewis, I will call the attention
of the reader to some of the many letters received
from good and eminent men, to show that I was not
alone in the low estimate of his virtues. Gladly I
leave that unpleasant subject, hoping that nothing in
our past history will serve to becloud the bright
future beginning to dawn on the prospects of our
disfranchised and oppressed countrymen.</p>

          </opener>
          <p>Dear Sir: In a recent examination of the business
transactions between the Board of Managers of the Wilberforce
Colony, and their agent Rev. N. Paul, I find a charge made by him,
and allowed by the board, of the sum of two hundred dollars, which
he paid to yourself.  Finding no receipt or acknowledgment from
you, I write to ask you to favor me with one, or an explanation of the
facts in the case, either of which will greatly oblige me, as I design
to make it public.    </p>

          <head>MR. GARRISON'S REPLY TO A. STEWARD.</head>
          <opener>
            <salute>DEAR SIR:</salute>
          </opener>
          <p>You state that Rev. N. Paul, as agent for the Wilberforce
Settlement, U. C., in rendering his accounts on his return from England, 
charged the Board of Managers with the sum of two hundred
dollars, paid by him to me while in England; that said sum was
<pb id="steward342" n="342"/>
Allowed by the board; adding that you do not recollect of my acknowledging 
or giving credit to the Settlement for it.</p>
          <p>In reply, I can only assure you that there must be a mistake in
regard to this item. I borrowed no money, nor had I any occasion
to ask a loan of my friend Paul, my expenses being defrayed by
funds contributed by friends in this country; nor could I with 
propriety receive, nor he give me any part of the money contributed for
the benefit of the Wilberforce Settlement; hence, a loan or gift from
him, could have been nothing more than a personal matter between
ourselves. Moreover, had he at that time or any other, given me in
good faith the sum named as belonging to the Settlement, (believing
that as we were laboring together; for the interest of one common
cause, the board would not hesitate to allow it,) he would certainly
have demanded a receipt, which it would have pleased me to give,
of course, that he might satisfy the board that their liberality had
been disbursed according to their wishes, or his judgment. But
receiving no money from your agent, will be a sufficient reason for
not acknowledging it, or giving due credit to the Settlement.</p>
          <p>I can account for this charge on his part, in no way, except that as
he was with me a part of the time I was in London, and we traveled
together a part of the time, during which, he ably and effectively
assisted me in exposing that most iniquitous combination, “The
American Colonization Society,”  -  he charged to me, (that is, to my
mission) sundry items of expense which he undoubtedly believed
justly incurred by his helping me to open the eyes of British philanthropists 
to the real design of that society; and I shall ever
remember with gratitude, his heartiness and zeal in the cause and in
my behalf. I owe much to the success that so signally crowned my
mission, to his presence, testimony, and eloquent denunciation of the
colonization scheme. I, however, received no money from him, and
can but think that the above explanation was the occasion of his
making the charge, and which I trust will leave on his memory, no
intentional wrong.</p>

          </opener>
          <p>Dear Sir:  -  Israel Lewis, the former agent of your
Settlement, last spring represented to me the suffering condition
of your poor, and requested that I should forward some goods, for
which I should be paid; I did so, and sent goods to the amount of
one hundred thirty-six dollars and ninety-eight cents. The goods
were sold at cost.</p>
          <p>I am also endorsed on a note for two hundred thirteen dollars
and ten cents, which falls due 24th of this month, and which I shall
have to pay. This note was given by Lewis for the purpose of raising

promised that the money should he here to meet it.</p>
          <p>I have heard nothing from Lewis or this business since, and as I

to meet the note, and pay for the goods. Good faith requires that all

            <salute>DEAR FRIEND:</salute>
          </opener>
          <p>In August last, Israel Lewis, accompanied by Rev.
Nathaniel Paul called upon me and exhibited a power of attorney,
signed by you as president of the trustees of the colony, authorizing
Lewis to take loans, &amp;c., for the benefit of the colony.</p>
          <p>Feeling a deep interest in the progress of the colony, I agreed to
become security with E. Peck, at the Bank of Rochester, for the
payment of seven hundred dollars, which soon was raised by Lewis
on the note, for the benefit of the colony. I was in hopes to have
<pb id="steward344" n="344"/>
seen you. E. Peck and myself, both are willing to aid you in your
noble enterprise,  -  and may others feel the same disposition. But as
we have families and friends, who look to us for support and protection, 
it is proper that we should have your personal pledge to save us
from embarrassment.</p>
          <p>We know your character<hi rend="italics"> well,</hi> and we have also great confidence in
Israel Lewis, and the others engaged with you,  -  but none of them
are so thoroughly known to us as yourself.</p>
          <p>Our asking for your personal pledge, does not arise from any fears
that the note will not be paid; but as it was signed to aid you, we
think it proper that you should respond by guaranteeing that we
shall not be injured.</p>
          <p>I accordingly copy the note in question, and write a guarantee
which I wish you to sign and hand to my brother.</p>
          <p>I feel much anxiety in regard to your progress; in your forming
schools; religious and temperance societies; and in your taking every
measure to elevate the unfortunate colored man who may go to your
colony for protection and improvement.</p>

            <salute/>
          </opener>
          <p>Esteemed Friend:  -  I am charged by the conventional 
board, to inform you that at the last session of the general
convention, you was duly elected their <hi rend="italics">General Corresponding Agent,</hi>
for the Wilberforce Settlement and parts adjacent. Respectfully and
in an official capacity, would I ask you to accept the appointment</p>
          <p>And in pursuance of the said appointment, the board would be
happy to have at least a monthly correspondence from you, on all
such matters as may, in your opinion, be thought conducive to the
<pb id="steward345" n="345"/>
prosperity of the settlement, the elevation and future happiness of
the free people of color.</p>
          <p>In particular, we would wish you to give a accurate an account as
possible, of the number of settlers; the number of acres a purchased; 
at what price; what number are improved and under
culture; what number of houses or tenements are in the Settlement,
&amp;c., &amp;c. </p>
          <p>What are your present prospects in regard to crops; your political
advantages or disadvantages.</p>
          <p>We would also respectfully ask you to inform us, what number of
settlers might emigrate there each year, without injuring the Settlement. 
Also, what kind of machines you most need; also, what are
the terms for which laborers are contracted for and how paid.</p>
          <p>The board have been thus particular, because they rely with full
confidence on your <hi rend="italics">patriotism</hi> and capability, which have been
unanimously assigned to you.</p>
          <p>You will perceive our object is, to contribute, a far as lays in our
power, <hi rend="italics">pecuniary</hi> aid, and assist in securing you such <hi rend="italics">agricultural</hi>
and mechanical emigrants as, in your opinion, the Settlement may
need; and in all our recommendations to you, we shall endeavor to
have an eye to character, knowing full well that by that alone you
must <hi rend="italics">stand</hi> or <hi rend="italics">fall.</hi></p>
          <p>We have been informed here by a letter (purporting to be written
by a Mr. Stover), that the Canada Company actually refuses to sell
land to colored persons; and that they are anxious to buy out the
colored settlers at Wilberforce.</p>
          <p>Be pleased to inform me if that be a fact, with its particulars; and
if there be any disadvantages in purchasing land by colored emigrants.</p>
          <p>The board would be happy to know if you have had any news
from your agent in England. If any, what are his prospects?</p>
          <p>You will please be particular and candid in stating your wants
(as well as disadvantages) to us, as we will do our utmost to satisfy
<pb id="steward346" n="346"/>
them, as well as promote the happiness of the settlers, nod the prosperity 
of the Settlement.</p>
          <p>Be pleased to answer as soon as possible, for we as brothers in
common, feel deeply interested.</p>

          <head>RESOLUTIONS PASSED BY THE BOARD OF MANAGERS OF THE 
WILBERFORCE COLONY.</head>
          <p>At a meeting of the Board of Managers, held September 30th,
1831, to call the Agents to an account:</p>
          <p>Resolved, That the Report of N. Paul be accepted, and unanimously 
agreed to.</p>
          <p>At a meeting of the Board of Directors, all the members present,
March 18th, 1832:</p>
          <p>Resolved, That we disapprove of the conduct of Israel Lewis, in his
being absent so long, and also his not communicating with the Board
of Directors, and not informing them from time to time, how he is
prosecuting his agency.</p>
          <p>Resolved, That the chairman of this board be instructed to write
to said Lewis, to return home, and lay before this board his doings.</p>
          <p>At a meeting of the Board, held April 1st, 1832, all the members
and Israel Lewis present with them, he made the following Report
and resigned his office as agent, which was accepted:</p>
          <p>Lewis said that seven hundred dollars was all that he had collected. 
That he paid one hundred and fifty dollars for board in New
York, thirty-five dollars for clothes, and two hundred dollars to N
Paul, as an out-fit for England.</p>

          <head>CIRCULAR.</head>
          <opener>THE BOARD OF MANAGERS FOR THE COLONY,<lb/>
<salute><hi rend="italics">To the Christians and Philanthropists in the United States:</hi></salute></opener>
          <p>We, the undersigned inhabitants and Board of Managers for the
Colony of Wilberforce, beg leave to state that the frost cut off the
crops in this part of the country last year, and some of the colonists
are in great need of assistance. And we flatter ourselves that when
the peculiar circumstances of this infant Settlement are duly considered, 
this appeal, to a generous and discriminating public, will not
be made in vain.</p>
          <p>The board are sensible from the cause above stated, that the inhabitants 
of Wilberforce will be <hi rend="italics">compelled</hi> to ask <hi rend="italics">aid</hi> from the friends of
humanity in the States, or they must <hi rend="italics">suffer.</hi></p>
          <p>Under these circumstances they commissioned the Rev. James
Sharp, as their agent, and sent him to the States; but owing to the
opposition of Israel Lewis,  -  who had been formerly employed as
agent, but was removed from the agency  -  his labors were almost
wholly lost to the board.</p>
          <p>We would simply say, that Lewis was acting for a <hi rend="italics">certain</hi> company
here; but we have made inquiries, and find but <hi rend="italics">one man</hi> in Wilberforce 
that belongs to said company, and he is an old man, in his
dotage. That man is <hi rend="italics">Simon Wyatt.</hi> We might say <hi rend="italics">more</hi>, but we
think there has been enough written to satisfy the public.</p>
          <p>In consequence of the unfaithfulness of Israel Lewis, and the
numerous agents that may be looking around the country after him,
the board have come to the conclusion to dispense with a traveling
agent for the present.</p>
          <p>And we would humbly request Lyman A. Spalding, Esq., of Lockport; 
E. Peck, Esq., of Rochester; Rev. Dr. Budd, of Auburn; Charles
Davis, Esq., of Ludlowville, Tompkins County, N. Y.; Arthur Tappan, 
Esq., city of New York; to act as receivers for the Colony. The
above named gentlemen, will see that the funds which they may
receive, be faithfully applied according to the wishes of the donors.</p>
          <pb id="steward348" n="348"/>
          <p>All money placed in each of the banks at Rochester a duplicate 
sent on to the Colony, may be cashed here without any
discount.</p>
          <p>To Christians we appeal: by the brotherhood of Christ, and by
their own hopes of being united in him, to extend to us the means
of obtaining bread; give us, in the name of Jesus, of your abundance; 
give us, as God has blessed you, for the poor among us want
bread and clothing.</p>
          <p>It is to be hoped that every clergyman in the States, will lay this
circular before their respective congregations, and give every person
an opportunity to throw hi their mite into the treasury of the
Lord!</p>

            <salute>MESSRS. PAUL AND STEWARD:</salute>
          </opener>
          <p>I have ever taken a great degree of
interest in the welfare of your colony, and have in various ways,
brought it before the public.</p>
          <p>It has pained me deeply to learn that there are divisions among
you. The whole deportment and manner of Lewis, who has been
here, has evidently impressed the public in his favor. Although I do
not wish to take ground as his advocate, to the extinction of others, I
am not inclined to think him dishonest from the testimony now
before me.</p>
          <pb id="steward349" n="349"/>
          <p>But, apart from him, my present impression is that the most
effectual way for you to promote the cause of the Colony, is not, at
this stage of the business, to appear before the public in a hostile
attitude to Lewis.</p>
          <p>I know some excellent and prominent gentlemen in this quarter,
who think he is unkindly treated; at any rate, while the investigation, 
lately commenced at Albany, is going on, it appears to me not
wise in you to put forth any further publication reflecting upon
Lewis. He may have acted imprudently; but he has excited himself 
very much, and should the idea prevail that you and he are in a
state of collision, it would be very bad for you.</p>
          <p>I consider your Colony as a very important matter, and will do all
in my power to promote your welfare, but it is very material not to
prejudice the public against you.</p>
          <p>Before I move in the matter, I wish to know the real state of the
matter between Lewis and the Colony. As soon as I can know that
he has defrauded you and deceived the public, I will not hesitate to
give my views on the subject, and put forth any efforts in my power
for your advancement.</p>
          <p>There should no sectarian or party feeling be allowed to creep into
your institution.</p>
          <p>I thank you for naming me as a receiver for your Colony, and
should anything come to me, I shall hand it over to James S. Seymour, 
Esq. Cashier of the Bank of Auburn, who should have been
named instead of me. I hope you will put his name in my place, or
at any rate, name him with me, for he has been from the first, much
interested in your behalf.</p>
          <p>If you will allow me, I will briefly say, that my opinion is, your
best way to relieve your immediate wants, would be to issue a brief
circular, stating the failure of your crops, your newness of settlement, 
&amp;c., &amp;c.; and call upon the public for help, without naming
Lewis or alluding to your difficulty with him; let your papers be
properly authorized, and say that the agent you employ is not
<pb id="steward350" n="350"/>
engaged in getting funds to pay for land, found schools, &amp;c., but to
get <hi rend="italics">immediate</hi> provisions for the Colony.</p>
          <p>If you will send an agent here and prepare your circular in this
way - let it be short - and I will print it and give copies of it to him
for circulation, free of charge.</p>
          <closer><salute>With many prayers for the prosperity of your Colony,<lb/>

          <opener>
            <salute>TO THE REV. J. BUDD,</salute>
          </opener>
          <p>Sir:  -  We feel under renewed obligation to you,
for you friendly advice; but we have already sent out several copies
of our circular to different places, and probably some of them have
been printed before this time.</p>
          <p>We have no object in view, but truth, justice,  -  the greatest good of
the Settlement, and of our brethren in general. Israel Lewis has,
however, collected large sums of money, for our relief, of which we
have not had the benefit. Nearly two years ago, he was appointed
agent for the Colony, to collect funds to build a meeting-house, to
endow schools, &amp;c. In less than one year he received more than two
thousand dollars, which he squandered; and we have neither 
<hi rend="italics">meeting-house</hi> nor <hi rend="italics">schools,</hi> nor never <hi rend="italics">will have,</hi> so long as the money goes
into the hands of Lewis. All that we would have forgiven him
gladly, if he would consent to be <hi rend="italics">still</hi> and not <hi rend="italics">usurp</hi> the agency
<hi rend="italics">against</hi> the wishes of the people.</p>
          <p>Sir, is it not expected that he would appear well; as you say, that
“the whole deportment and manner of Lewis, who has been in this
place, evidently have impressed the people in his favor,”  -  while collecting 
money with the eye of the public upon him. But follow him
home into another kingdom, and there see the man in his true
<pb id="steward351" n="351"/>
character; stripped of his borrowed plumage,  -  and we will guarantee 
that you would agree with us, in believing that he <hi rend="italics">is</hi> an <hi rend="italics">arch
hypocrite.</hi></p>
          <p>We should be sorry to prejudice the public against our Settlement,
more especially when we are actuated by the purest motives,  -  that
of preventing the Christian public from being imposed upon, by
drawing large sums from them for us, as they suppose, when in <hi rend="italics">truth</hi>
such sums <hi rend="italics">never</hi> reach us at all.</p>
          <p>Sir, we know that you are actuated by the purest motives, but you
are deceived in the character of the man, (Lewis). When I was
living in the States and only saw him there, collecting money for the
poor, I thought him honest as you now do; but two or three years'
residence in Wilberforce Colony, has abundantly satisfied me that
his object is to get money, that he may live in a princely style, and
not for the benefit of the poor as he pretends.</p>
          <p>Such are the true facts in the case. We should be glad to have
the name of James S. Seymour, Esq., added to the list, and any
other prominent citizen you may think would help the cause.</p>
          <p>In regard to the investigation at Albany, we do not see how the
public are to arrive at the facts in the case from any statement Lewis
may make; for all his statements that I have seen in print, are positively 
void of truth, in the most essential part, so that they are of
little or no importance at all unless substantiated by other testimony.</p>
          <p>The circular contains no testimony that has not been heretofore
laid before the public. Mr. Benjamin Paul recently wrote a letter to
the editors of “The Baptist Register,” in which he stated that Lewis
had fed and clothed the colonists like a father, which is not true; and
so sensible was Paul of the fact, that when the letter reached here,
together with the <sic>surprize</sic> it created wherever Lewis was known,
that Paul cheerfully contradicted it, confessed that he was mistaken,
and thus made it known to the public.</p>
          <p>We certainly have no sectional feelings in the matter, though
Lewis has labored hard to impress the public with a contrary belief;
and he has even brought false charges of the basest kind against our
<pb id="steward352" n="352"/>
most respectable all to draw the attention of the public from
the true facts in the ease.</p>
          <p>It is a general time of health here in the Colony. The season is
very favorable; our crops look well, and with the blessings of God
we shall raise enough to supply our wants this year.</p>

          <p>I have received a communication through your corresponding 
secretary, Mr. James C. Brown, and I hasten to answer it.
The last communication I have received from Mr. N. Paul, was
in December, 1833, at which time he was vigorously prosecuting his
mission, as will more fully appear by the annexed copy of said letter,
which I cheerfully send you. His return is expected daily.</p>

            <salute>MY DEAR BROTHER STEWARD:</salute>
          </opener>
          <p>When I last addressed you, I informed you that I
expected to leave this country before a return letter from you could
be expected. I therefore stated, if I remember correctly, that you
need not write.</p>
          <p>I now find that I shall be detained much longer than I then calculated; 
and this detention is owing to the Slavery question. The
friends of the cause, advised me to forego my object, until that
question was settled; and then they would turn their attention to my
cause, and render me what assistance they could.</p>
          <p>All their united strength was needed now, while that question was
<pb id="steward353" n="353"/>
pending. But thanks be to God, that is now settled. On the first
day of August next, will be the proudest day that ever Britain knew;
for from that time henceforth, there will not remain a single slave
throughout His Majesty's dominions.</p>
          <p>The friends of the cause are now turning their attention to Slavery
in the United States, and are about to form a society for the abolition
of Slavery throughout the world. They all think highly of our
Settlement, and will give it their cordial support.</p>
          <p>The leading abolitionists have given me letters of recommendation
throughout the Kingdom, and have appointed one of their most effective 
men to travel with me,  -  his name is John Scoble, a very ready,
intelligent, earnest, and an eloquent speaker. I think I can do more
now in one month, than I could in three before the question was
settled in regard to their own slaves.</p>
          <p>You will at once see that although the people concluded my object
to be an important one, yet, they generally thought that they ought
to lend all their aid in removing the stain from their own land first.
This stain is now effectually effaced, and my meetings are exceedingly 
crowded. I addressed an audience at Norwich of from three
to four thousand persons, week before last, when about five hundred
dollars was collected. So you see I am getting on. I start, the Lord
willing, next week for Scotland, and shall spend the winter
there and in the North of England. In the spring I shall return and
take passage for Canada. I doubt not, that you are anxiously looking
for my return; yet, you cannot want to see me more than I want to
return; but I tell you now as I have told you before, that I shall not
return until I have done all that can be done by my labor.</p>

          </opener>
          <p>We are glad to acknowledge your favor of October last,
and to hear of your safe arrival in England, your health and fair
prospects.</p>
          <p>Since my removal to Wilberforce, I have opened a school, which
Mrs. Steward has engaged to teach for one year; while I shall probably 
devote my time to traveling through the States, for the benefit
of the Colony, which is indeed poor, and in want of come assistance;
and yet, not a dollar have we in the treasury to help them with.</p>
          <p>Mr. Paul has not returned, though we are daily expecting him.
Our friends in New York, still have confidence in his pledge to do
right; and we are anxiously expecting its <sic>fulfilment.</sic></p>
          <p>Your wife, Mrs. Nell, and the children are well, and we are still
doing all in our power for their comfort; but my means, in consequence 
of having been so much abroad the past season, are limited;
by which you will see, my dear Sir, the necessity of remitting funds
to me, that I may make your family more comfortable in all things,
without distressing my own.</p>
          <p>The settlers are well, and are looking with hopeful expectancy for
you to do something handsome for them, in which I do hope they
may not be disappointed. Lewis is still in New York. We have
appointed another agent, named Scott, but who is doing nothing for
the Colony now.</p>
          <p>May the blessings of God rest upon you, and your endeavors; your
good deportment put to silence your enemies; may they who foresee

            <salute>DEAR FRIENDS:</salute>
          </opener>
          <p>I have received a letter from Israel Lewis, New York,
requesting me to forward fifty dollars to the treasurer of the Wilberforce 
Colony, which I will do at the first convenience. I sent fifty
dollars some time since, which I presume was received.</p>
          <p>I have also received a letter from B. Lundy, who speaks very
flatteringly of the Settlement; but gives me some information relating
to Lewis, which will injure you, unless you act wisely.</p>
          <p>Now I suggest for your consideration, whether it would not be best
to keep perfectly quiet relative to him, until after he returns and
settles with the directors.  If he cannot then satisfy you, he will
no doubt surrender up his documents and agency like a man, and
leave you to appoint another.</p>
          <p>By all means you must agree among yourselves, not suffering any
difference of opinion to become public. Your enemies will seize
upon this, and injure your prospects; besides, you gain nothing by it.
Your friends too, could then say that you acted imprudently. I hope
to have a good account of the settlement of your difficulties if any
should exist.</p>

          <p>I have this day received your letter, and God willing,
I will he with you in the course of ten or twelve days. Please to
keep your people together, until I come. I will see that they be
not oppressed by that notorious Israel Lewis. I believe him to be
one of the worst men living, whose deeds will yet come to light. Do
stay in the Colony and keep all things as they are until I come.</p>

          <trailer>P. S.  -  I am glad that Mrs. Steward is in Rochester; your Colony
is by no means suited to her talents and refined mind. She never
could be happy there. My love to all the Colonists; I will do every
thing for them in my power.	S.E.C.</trailer>

          </opener>
          <p>Again I take this method of communicating
some private information to my personal friends, relative to my proceedings 
in Mexico. My last visit to that country, (like the one
preceding), having been prolonged far beyond the time which I had
anticipated, I feel it incumbent on me to explain the causes thereof
especially to such as take an interest in the enterprize in which I
have engaged, and those who have kindly assisted me with means to
defray the expenses of my journey, &amp;c.</p>
          <p>Soon after the date of my last printed letter, which was issued
from this place, I went to New Orleans, with the intention of taking
a passage by sea, to some port in Mexico; but after waiting in that
city about two weeks, and finding no opportunity to obtain one, I
proceeded up the Red River, and journeyed through Texas again by
<pb id="steward357" n="357"/>
land. My health continued very good for some length of time; but
when I reached the middle part of the Texas country, it was my
misfortune to come again in contact with the direful “cholera,” and
again I was the subject of its virulent attacks. My detention was
great, and affliction severe; though I finally expelled the disorder as
I had done before. My sufferings were somewhat aggravated in
several instances, by the fearful prejudices of the people among
whom I traveled. I was very anxious to get through my journey,
and often assayed to travel before I was in fact well enough. The
consequence was, that I frequently took relapses, and sometimes had
to lie out under trees, even in time of rain, within sight of houses,
the people being unwilling to give me shelter therein, fearing that my
disorder was contagious.</p>
          <p>At length I reached the Mexican town of San Antonio de Bexar,
and there I tarried, until I had got pretty well rid of the cholera. I
then pursued my journey to Monclova, the seat of government for the
State of Coahuila and Texas, in company with several Mexican
gentlemen and foreigners. Previous to this time, I had traveled
several hundred miles entirely alone, and generally encamped in the
woods or plains at night. On my arrival at Monclova, I was doomed
to encounter “misfortune” of a very different character. Here I
found that the Englishman, (mentioned in my other letter), with
whom I had contracted to petition for two grants of land, <hi rend="italics">had totally
failed in he application.</hi> The petition had been laid before the
Governor, and he was about issuing the grants, when he received a
<hi rend="italics">decree</hi> from the Legislature  -  which was then in session  -  forbidding
him to grant any more land, under any pretext. This measure was
taken to prevent the great land speculators from carrying on their
swindling operations in Texas. An act was soon after passed by that
body, repealing all their Colonization laws; and thus every hope that
I had so fondly entertained, and each fair prospect, seemingly so
near its realization, <hi rend="italics">was instantly blasted and utterly destroyed!</hi> If ever
the fortitude of man was tried, mine was then. If ever stoic philosophy 
might be successfully caned to the aid of human courage, I
<pb id="steward358" n="358"/>
felt the necessity of invoking it upon that occasion. Nearly two
years of toil, privation and peril, hare hem wasted. My sufferings
had been great, though my spirit soared on the bouyancy of hope.
Now the fair superstructure of an important enterprise, whose ideal
magnitude had employed my mind, to the exclusion of manly hardships 
endured, suddenly vanished from my sight, and left before me
a hideous and gloomy void with no other encouragement than total
disappointment, conscious poverty and remediless despair! What
<hi rend="italics">should</hi> I then have done? My health was restored, but my detention
and consequent expenses had been so great that my funds were
nearly exhausted. I came to the country for an important purpose;
and I reasoned with myself thus; although my way is closed in this
State, cannot something be done <hi rend="italics">elsewhere?</hi> I will not boast of the
stoutest heart among men, but mine <hi rend="italics">must not quail.</hi> Something further 
must be done if possible, and I will try.</p>
          <p>In the course of my travels, I had seen a part of the adjoining State
of Tamaulipas, and had been informed that the colonization laws
thereof were liberal. I was even aware that some parts of it are
more suitable for the culture of the sugar cane, than any tract I
could have obtained in Coahuila and Texas. And upon a little
reflection, I determined to make further investigations in Tamaulipas, 
and had been informed of the State. As soon as my horse was
a little rested, I set out, <hi rend="italics">alone,</hi> on a journey of between four and five
hundred miles, part of the way through an awfully mountainous
region, and much of it an uninhabited wilderness. I encamped out
almost every night, during the whole journey; very seldom near any
human habitation. I had no fire-arms nor anything to defend myself
against the ferocious beasts of the forest, which I had evidence to
convince me were frequently numerous, and not far distant. In two
weeks I reached the city of Matamoras, in the State of Tamaulipas,
quite destitute of funds, after parting with almost every disposable
article belonging to my wardrobe, &amp;c. The people of this place
being all perfect strangers to me, I did not for a while unfold to them
the real object of my visit; but instead thereof, I opened a shop, and
<pb id="steward359" n="359"/>
commenced working at my old trade  -  the saddling business. I soon
got as much work as I could do  -  supported myself, replenished my
pocket, made some acquaintance with a number of people, and
obtained more information respecting the Colonization laws of the
State. A few weeks elapsed, while I was employed in this way. I
then mounted my horse again, and proceeded to the capital of the
State; and after negotiating for some time with the Governor and
Council of the State, I succeeded in obtaining a grant of land, upon
advantageous terms. I then performed another journey of almost
two hundred and fifty miles, “alone,” to Matamoras again; and soon
thereafter embarked for the United States.</p>
          <p>My friends will thus perceive that I have not been idle; though
much time has been occupied in my last expedition. I shall not
attempt to excite their sympathy by exhibiting the twentieth part of
what I have suffered. I do not even like to look back upon some of
the scenes through which I have passed. But thanks to a kind and
all-sustaining Providence, complete success has at last crowned my
exertions. I strove hard to command it; and I leave it to others to
say whether I have <hi rend="italics">deserved</hi> it or not.</p>
          <p>The terms upon which I have obtained my grant of land
will be noticed in a public address, which I shall forward with this
letter.</p>
          <p>Since my arrival in this place, I have been confined by sickness;
but am now convalescent, and shall visit my friends to the eastward,
as soon as circumstances will permit. I cannot close this communication, 
without an expression of my sincere thanks to those kind
friends who rendered me assistance in defraying the expenses of my
last Mexican tour. Their favors will be most gratefully remembered, 
and I shall feel myself under additional obligations to labor
for the melioration of the condition of the poor and suffering
<hi rend="italics">slave.</hi></p>
          <p>In the next number of the “Genius of Universal Emancipation,”
I shall insert the names of those who contributed to aid me in the
<pb id="steward360" n="360"/>
prosecution of my enterprise; and correct information relative to
all proceedings therein, will be given in the pages of that work, as
the business connected with it progresses.</p>
