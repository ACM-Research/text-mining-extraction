        <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
        <p>No military conflict has ever been the theme of so
many memoirs by its participators as the American
Civil War. The narratives of Sherman and Johnston,
McClellan and Longstreet, Grant and Hood, Schofield
and Mosby, and of other leading generals are but the
vanguard of an almost endless amount of similar
testimony. Indeed it seems that the cherished desire of
well-nigh every patriot engaged, if he had the gift of
self-expression, has been to give to posterity an account
of his part in our great national tragedy, and as
the ties of mortal life weaken, this desire becomes
stronger. Hence as the number of survivors diminishes,
the number of memoirists increases, so that during the
past decade the publication of personal accounts of the
Civil War seems to rival that of the earlier years just
after the conflict when the memory of all readers was
full of military recollections.</p>
        <p>It is therefore eminently fitting that the
Reminiscences of General William R. Boggs should be
given to the public. Their value well merits the
attention of all interested in Confederate military
history. By taste and training General Boggs was a
soldier, having graduated with high honors from West
Point. His military activity under the Confederacy was
entirely in fields which popular interest too often
neglects, the erection of fortifications on the coast and
the Confederate operations in Kentucky and the
southwest. Even
<pb id="boggsviii" n="VIII"/>
more important is the fact that he wrote for the
information of his children, not for the public, his
manuscript being prepared in 1891. His criticisms
are therefore those of a professional soldier, stated
most frankly and without reservation, concerning
Confederate operations too often overshadowed in the
memory of Southerners by the glories of the Virginia
battlefields.</p>
        <p>The ancestors of William Robertson Boggs were
distinguished in both civil and military affairs. His
maternal great-grandfather was “Scotch Billy”
Robertson of Chesterfield County, Virginia, who
served in the colonial wars. The next in line, John
Robertson, likewise served the colony and his son,
William Robertson (1786-1859) removed from
Virginia to Abbeville, South Carolina, served in the
South Carolina militia during the Second War with
Great Britain, and afterwards became surveyor, then
Superintendent, of the South Carolina Railroad, and
also manager of a line of steamboats on the Savannah
River. His wife was Pamela Moseley, daughter of
Joseph Moseley, who had migrated from Virginia to
South Carolina contemporaneously with the
Robertsons. Their daughter, Mary Ann, married
Archibald Boggs, a merchant of Augusta, Georgia. To
them were born nine children. Of these seven survived
infancy. Three sons, William Robertson, Robert, and
Archibald, served in the Confederate army. Of the
four daughters two remained single and two married
brothers of the Butt family; one, Pamela Robertson,
became the wife of Joshua Willing Butt, one of their
sons being Major Archie
<pb id="boggsix" n="IX"/>
Butt, who lost his life in the Titantic disaster of April,
1912; the other, Catherine Joyner, married J. D.
Butt, who served in W. H. T. Walker's Brigade of
Georgia troops.</p>
        <p>William Robertson, the oldest of the above named
children, was born at Augusta, March 18,1829.
Comparatively little is known of his early youth, but his
training and associations awakened talents quite in
keeping with those of his ancestors. His preparatory
education was secured at the old Augusta Academy.
To the memory of its rector, William Ernenputsch, he
paid the following tribute; “What a kind old teacher he
was, a German of a small stature, and small frame, but
a large head, and big heart. He used to punish sharply
and severely, but not cruelly. There was not a boy in
that school who would not have fought for him.”</p>
        <p>Very early his interest in science was awakened.
Once he heard a lecture on the impossibility of applying
steam navigation to the ocean; at another time he saw
the principle of “galvanism” illustrated with a small
battery, but the impracticability of its use for industrial
purposes on account of the high cost of mercury was
pointed out. Once he and his playmates gave his great-grandfather, Joseph Moseley, an account of a
steamboat they had seen on the Savannah River.
According to tradition the old gentleman listened
politely, then gave each narrator a sound thrashing for
trying to impose on his credulity. Later when Mr.
Moseley himself saw a steam boat at Augusta he gave
each of the boys five dollars in gold as recompense for
the chastisement.</p>
        <pb id="boggsx" n="X"/>
        <p>Young Boggs' summers were spent at the Sand
Hills, now Summerville, South Carolina, then as now a
resort. There an interest in military life was aroused by
visits to the army post located near by. Born with
traditions of fighting and engineering, with a latent
interest in science and military affairs awakened, it
was natural for him to find his way to the leading
scientific as well as the best military school of the time,
the United States Military Academy at West Point. He
entered as a cadet from Georgia in July, 1849 at the
age of twenty and graduated four years later among
the first five of his class.</p>
        <p>Among the students at the Academy at that time
were many who later gained distinction in both the
Union and Confederate armies. Among Boggs'
classmates were John B. McPherson, Philip H.
Sheridan and John M. Schofield, later Union generals,
and John B. Hood of the Confederate service. Cadet
Boggs ranked high in his class and in the entire student
body. At the end of his first year he was tenth in
scholarship in a class of seventy-four, second in
conduct among the entire 221 cadets enrolled. At the
close of the second year he was second among his
classmates in point of scholarship, being surpassed only
by McPherson, and in conduct tenth in the entire
academy. The third year found his scholarly standing
unchanged, but his rank in conduct ninth. At graduation
in 1853 his rank in scholarship had dropped to fourth,
that in conduct had risen to third.</p>
        <p>Traditions of his student life at West Point centre
around artistic rather than military tastes. In 1851
<pb id="boggsxi" n="XI"/>
while Boggs was on adjutant duty a new cadet
entered. His name was James McNeill Whistler.
Boggs was at once interested in the new matriculate
because the lad's father had attained distinction as an
engineer. Whistler soon formed the habit of visiting the
adjutant's office; frequently he spent the time in
sketching scenes described in books or suggested by
life at the academy. Boggs preserved three drawings
illustrative of West Point, two suggested by characters
in Dickens, and one representing Russian soldiers. In
1852 through Boggs' influence a drawing of Whistler's 
  -  the wood cut also being carved by Whistler  -  was
used to decorate the dance cards for the academy ball.
These are probably the earliest existing products of
Whistler's art.<ref id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1" targOrder="U">1</ref>
</p>
        <p>Boggs' talents were evidently for the scientific
problems of military service. On graduation he was
made Brevet-Second Lieutenant, was assigned to the
Topographical Bureau, and spent some time in the
office of the Pacific Railroad Surveys. In 1854 he was
transferred to the Ordnance Corps and was made
assistant at the Watervliet Arsenal, Troy, New York.
In December of the same year he became Second
Lieutenant and in 1856 he was promoted to the rank of
First Lieutenant. While at Watervliet Arsenal he
married Mary Sophia, daughter of Col. John
Symington, the commandant, the date of their marriage
being December 19, 1855. In 1857 he was transferred
to the Louisiana Arsenal at Baton Rouge, Louisiana; in
1859 he became inspector of Ordnance at Point Isobel,
Texas,
<note id="note1" n="1" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1">1.  See “Whistler's First Drawings,” <hi rend="italics">Century Magazine</hi> Sep., 1910.</note>
<pb id="boggsxii" n="XII"/>
and on December 14 took part in an engagement with
Cortino's Mexican Marauders near Fort Brown, for
which he was given honorable mention by General
Scott. Soon after, he was transferred to the Alleghany
Arsenal at Pittsburg, to which Col. Symington had also
been assigned. Evidently the service that opened
before Lieutenant Boggs in the Army of the United
States was that of scientific expert rather than the
command of troops.</p>
        <p>In 1861 the choice of fighting with or against his
native state was forced upon him. He did not believe in
the wisdom of secession, but like many of his
countrymen he cast his destiny with the South,
resigning from the United States Army the very day
that the Georgia Convention adopted an ordinance of
secession. Altogether twenty-two relatives by blood or
marriage entered the Confederate armies. His father-in-law, 
 however, having been born in Delaware, having
 been appointed to the Academy from Maryland, and
having spent thirty-five years in the Army, remained in
the United States service. Yet friendship and interest
in his son-in-law were not interrupted. On Jan. 31,
1861, he wrote,  -  “So my dear Boggs, the deed is done
so far as your resignation is concerned, and we must
look into the future with hope that this change may
eventuate to your full satisfaction and prosperity. You
are of the right stuff and I have every confidence that,
from your energy, perseverance and upright honesty
you will succeed in any object you may give your
attention to.”</p>
        <p>The nature of Boggs' service in the Confederacy
<pb id="boggsxiii" n="XIII"/>
was similar to that in the Army of the United States,
that of an engineer and ordnance officer. He was
always on staff duty and was never given the
command of troops. His criticisms of military
operations therefore suggest the observer rather than
the leader of men. This characteristic, together with his
scientific training and utter frankness, give a distinct
value to his account of the three operations in which he
was active, perfecting fortifications and supplies in
1861, Kirby Smith's invasion of Kentucky in 1862, and
Kirby Smith's administration west of the Mississippi
from 1863 to 1865.</p>
        <p>When Lieutenant Boggs resigned from the Army of
the United States, he tendered his services to the State
of Georgia and was immediately appointed to the staff
of Governor Brown. He was soon entrusted with the
duty of purchasing supplies for his native State.</p>
        <p>At his suggestion it was determined to send an agent
to Europe to procure an outfit for the manufacture of
small arms, while Boggs himself was to place orders
for heavy ordnance in Richmond. T. Butler King was
ordered to Europe but he postponed his departure in
order to carry orders for the Confederate government
just being organized. The delay was fatal and Georgia
never secured from Europe its much needed
machinery. Boggs, however, went to Richmond,
carrying with him the latest designs for guns that had
been worked out in Union arsenals, and placed large
orders for the State of Georgia. He also superintended
the conversion of the State Penitentiary into a foundry.</p>
        <pb id="boggsxiv" n="XIV"/>
        <p>Soon he was transferred to the Confederate service,
going first to Charleston where he assisted Beauregard
in preparing its defenses for war. In April he was sent
to Pensacola to assist General Bragg in erecting
defenses. He found the first urgent need to be supplies
for the troops. To meet it he spent $40,000 which had
been entrusted to his use. A second problem was the
rearrangement of the defenses. To this end Boggs
removed the barbette guns from the forts and placed
them along the bluffs overlooking the harbor and along
the beach, and erected a concealed battery south of
Fort McRee. With these arrangements completed, it
was the intention to attact Fort Pickens, which was
held by the Federals. The plan was frustrated by the
credulity of Bragg, who allowed Lieutenant Worden, of
the United States Army, to cross from Pensacola to
the Federal fleet. Immediately Fort Pickens was
strongly reinforced. The effectiveness of the
Confederate defenses was also impaired by the
arbitrary action of Bragg. While Boggs was
temporarily absent he placed a battery of casement
guns in the open, south of Fort McRee. These, having
about one-half the range of the barbette guns, were
ineffective during the Federal bombardment and Fort
McRee was silenced. But the Federal men-of-war, the
<hi rend="italics">Niagara</hi> and the <hi rend="italics">Richmond</hi>, as they reached the shore
were forced to retire by Boggs' concealed battery. “It
was sometime in the afternoon,” says Boggs, “when I
observed them swing around head on, and saw them
move slowly up to a new position. Having no other
means after they had taken up their new
<pb id="boggsxv" n="XV"/>
position and commenced firing, I got their distance by
sight and sound. My first shot, afterwards so reported,
passed between the masts of the Richmond and the
second one hulled the ship so effectively as to disable
her. When some of her timbers floated ashore next
day my Georgians claimed them, and Bragg endorsed
their claim.”<ref id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2" targOrder="U">2</ref>
</p>
        <p>Inefficiency and lack of judgment were not the only
weak points in the military policy of the Confederacy.
While at Pensacola Boggs saw places of high rank in
the Army given to civilians while young officers like
himself failed to get promotion. Bragg, on behalf of the
officers under him, complained of the discrimination but
the most he could secure for Boggs was a nominal
appointment in 1862 as Superintendent of the Louisiana
State Seminary, a military school. However, the
relations between Boggs and Bragg became cool; an
estrangement gradually developed, with the result that
Boggs resigned from the service of the Confederate
States and re-entered that of the State of Georgia.</p>
        <p>Again, Boggs' assignment was to engineering work,
being made Chief Engineer with the rank of Colonel by
Gov. Brown. He was sent to Savannah in March,
1862, to aid in erecting fortifications. Again the
impression he received was one of inefficiency and
lack of foresight on the part of those in authority. He
urged the necessity of fortifying the islands on
the South Carolina side of the Savannah River. The
Confederate commander did not think it possible to
stand on these,
<note id="note2" n="2" resp="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref2">2. See page 99.</note>
<pb id="boggsxvi" n="XVI"/>
much less to occupy them, and that a gun would sink
out of sight, and seemed to rely upon some torpedoes
that Captain Ives had placed there to keep the
gunboats from coming into Wall's Cut and getting
between us and Fort Pulaski. “There were some of us
who had very little confidence in Ives' loyalty and the
fact that Ives had been seen at work down the river
caused us still more anxiety... One morning we found
the Federal gunboats in Wall's Cut on the Carolina side,
in which Ives' torpedoes were supposed to be. They,
with the boats already in the St. Augustine's Creek, on
our side, cut off all communication by water with Fort
Pulaski . . . General W. H. T. Walker was very
indignant; he proposed a plan for the capture of the
gunboats, offered to take all the responsibility, and
make the necessary preparations, and attack with his
own Brigade. Had his plan been promptly accepted, it
would, in my opinion, have been successful. But it was
taken into consideration. Before the consideration was
concluded those islands on which a man could not
stand were covered with tents and troops; and those
estuaries which had been filled with torpedoes, were
full of gunboats.”

        <p>In recognition of Boggs' work at Savannah one of
the forts was named for him. Today its site is occupied
by a fertilizer factory. From Savannah he was sent to
the interior of Georgia to erect fortifications along the
upper Appalachicola to protect cotton plantations from
raids by federal gun boats. His mission was not
effective because the civil authorities failed
<note id="note3" n="3" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref3">3. See page 26.</note>
<pb id="boggsxvii" n="XVII"/>
to co-operate. In August 1862, he was again in the
service of the Confederate States because Kirby
Smith had asked aid of Governor Brown in his
impending invasion of Kentucky, and Brown's reply
was to send Boggs and some artillery harness to
Knoxville.</p>
        <p>The campaign that followed forms a new chapter in
the experience of Colonel Boggs. Hitherto he had been
engaged in fortification; now as a member of Kirby
Smith's staff he was in close touch with an aggressive
military movement. Indeed the invasion of Kentucky
was one of the most brilliant, as well as one of the
most disastrous, of the early Confederate campaigns.
Kirby Smith crossed the Cumberland mountains from
Knoxville, while Bragg advanced from Chattanooga
northward across Tennessee, crossing into Kentucky
by way of Gainesville. With their armies united they
hoped to win Kentucky for the Confederacy and to
force Buell beyond the Ohio. Kirby Smith was first on
the scene of operations. By August 30 he reached
Richmond, Kentucky, and drove back the enemy. How
narrow was the margin between victory and defeat is
well described by Boggs. During the afternoon General
William Nelson, commander-in-chief of the Union
forces in Kentucky, personally took the leadership and
formed a new line of battle south of Richmond. “This
was so unexpected,” said Boggs, “that General Kirby
Smith and myself, riding leisurely up the road in
advance of the army, came within short range before
we were aware of it. Seeing an officer gallop down the
road and hearing him command to ‘bring on the
cavalry,’ I rode close up to and alongside
<pb id="boggsxviii" n="XVIII"/>
the fence, expecting them to come up with a rush, and
saw our victory turned into rout. Had they come
Sheridan's charge at Winchester would have been a
duplicate. They did not come and we had time to get
out of the road and form line; then a single charge of
the infantry, before the artillery could be brought into
action, drove them through Richmond.”<ref id="ref4" n="4" rend="sc" target="note4" targOrder="U">4</ref>
</p>
        <p>From Richmond the victorious Confederates pressed
on toward Lexington. Boggs, with a band of infantry
and cavalrymen, marched before the regular army.
When the outskirts of Lexington were reached, he rode
back to camp and found everything in confusion. “A
sudden halt had been ordered, the advance drawn back
to where I found it, all the wagons were being unloaded
and sent back to bring Heth's division. A herald was
being gotten ready to summon the Federal commander
at the sound of a midnight bugle to evacuate Lexington
or come outside of it and fight. It looked very much like
a panic. There was no answer to the bugle and the
herald rode into town without being questioned. The
Federal commander, Gilbert, had also been seized with
an uncertainty, and while we were preparing the herald
he was making hot haste in another direction. We now
found out that, if we had followed the Federals up
closely we could have gone into Lexington the night
before and have captured valuable supplies.”<ref id="ref5" n="5" rend="sc" target="note5" targOrder="U">5</ref>
</p>
        <p>The tide of success now changed. Instead of
advancing on Cincinnati Kirby Smith awaited orders
from General Bragg, his superior. Bragg's advance
<note id="note4" n="4" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref4">4. See page 38.</note>
<note id="note5" n="5" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref5">5. See page 40.</note>
<pb id="boggsxix" n="XIX"/>
had been delayed for various reasons so that Buell
outreached him in the race for Louisville. He now
ordered Kirby Smith to fall back to Frankfort and
participate in the inauguration of Richard Hawes as
Confederate Governor. Bragg, leaving his army at
Bardstown, arrived at Frankfort in due time. The
ceremony took place on October 4, 1862, but in the
afternoon news came that Buell was advancing from
Louisville. Believing that the movement was directed
against Frankfort, Kirby Smith retired to Versailles and
Bragg rejoined his army which advanced to
Harrodsburg. Boggs' narrative of the events of the day
well illustrate the confusion and the uncertainty of the
Confederate commanders.
<ref id="ref6" n="6" rend="sc" target="note6" targOrder="U">6</ref>
</p>
        <p>During the Kentucky campaign Col. Boggs won the
confidence of his superiors and on General Kirby
Smith's recommendation he was promoted to the rank
of Brigadier General and became Chief of Staff under
him in the Trans-Mississippi Department in the spring
of 1863. The task in the Southwest was complicated
and difficult. Grant was besieging Vicksburg, and
Banks threatened an invasion from New Orleans.
There was need of co-operative organization of army
posts in Louisiana, Texas, and Arkansas, while the
heavy production of cotton raised the question of its
disposal beyond the lines of the army. Unfortunately
there was a distinct lack of unity in the councils of the
Confederate leaders. Broadly speaking the cleavage
was between Kirby Smith and his subordinates,
especially Richard Taylor; later Governor Allen and Kirby
<note id="note6" n="6" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref6">6. See page 43.</note>
<pb id="boggsxx" n="XX"/>
Smith were at cross purposes.
<ref id="ref7" n="7" rend="sc" target="note7" targOrder="U">7</ref> Charges of
inefficiency, favoritism and secret influences were
prevalent. The whole story of the situation has never
been revealed.</p>
        <p>General Boggs soon found himself out of sympathy
with the two active military plans of Kirby Smith. First
of these was the demonstration against the Federal
lines around Vicksburg, which was then besieged by
Grant. This was entrusted to General Holmes of the
District of Arkansas but his attack on Helena, made
early in July, was too late to change the fate of the city.
The other military purpose, to prevent the conquest of
western Louisiana and Texas, was accomplished, not,
however, without a conflict of wills among Confederate
generals. The Federals took the aggressive and
inaugurated two movements in the spring of 1864, an
invasion by Banks from New Orleans and one from
Little Rock by Steele. Believing that Banks was the
weaker of the two generals Kirby Smith decided to
engage him first and gave that part of the defense to
General Richard Taylor, whose headquarters were in
southern Louisiana. General Price, who succeeded
Holmes in Arkansas, was ordered to forward to Taylor
all his infantry and artillery, keeping only his cavalry to
harass the advance of Steele. However, these
reinforcements were halted at Kirby Smith's
headquarters at Shreveport and it was planned for
Taylor to harass, not engage, Banks. The cause of this
change of plans, according to Boggs, was the influence
of Dr. Sol Smith, Surgeon to Kirby Smith. “The animus
of change was that Doctor Smith 
<note id="note7" n="7" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref7">7. Dorsey, Recollections of Henry W. Allen, <hi rend="italics">passim</hi>.</note>
<pb id="boggsxxi" n="XXI"/>
disliked General Taylor as much as he liked General
Smith; Taylor was to harass Banks up to the last
moment, and then General Smith was to move down
with additional troops, take command, and carry off
the glory of the pitched battle.”
<ref id="ref8" n="8" rend="sc" target="note8" targOrder="U">8</ref> Kirby Smith's orders
reached Taylor too late to prevent him from turning
and defeating Banks first at Mansfield, then at
Pleasant Hill. These victories presented another
problem; should Banks be pursued and New Orleans
possibly be attacked, or should attention be given to
Steele? Taylor of course advised the former course,
but Kirby Smith chose the latter. However, Steele,
when he heard of the defeat of Banks, gave up his
invasion and fell back to Little Rock.</p>
        <p>An estrangement developed between the
commanding general and his chief-of-staff soon after
the Banks-Taylor campaign. Dr. Sol Smith supplanted
Boggs in the councils of Kirby Smith. Boggs resigned
and was for a short time commander of the District of
Louisiana. He was soon superseded by General Harry
Hays. He then returned to Shreveport. Early in 1865
he enlisted in an expedition to enter military service in
Mexico. Finding that the purpose of its leaders was to
fight for Maximilian, rather than Juarez, he withdrew
his name. With the collapse of the Confederate armies
in the East, Kirby Smith moved his headquarters to
Houston, Texas. The surrender of his army was made
by his subordinates, in which General Boggs
participated, the parole of Boggs being dated June 9,
1865.</p>
        <note id="note8" n="8" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref8">8. See page 76.</note>
        <pb id="boggsxxii" n="XXII"/>
        <p>Such was the course of General Boggs' service in
the war and such were the impressions made upon him
by the military policy of the Confederacy. His
unreserved frankness, together with his military
training, give his words great weight. No one can read
them without being impressed with the inefficiency of
the Confederate preparations for the war, the
inexcusable failure of the Kentucky campaign of 1862,
and the friction among the Confederate generals. If it
had not been for the genius of Lee's defense of
Virginia, how much earlier might the conflict have
ended!</p>
        <p>After the close of hostilities General Boggs engaged
in the profession of engineering, participating to a great
extent in railroad construction in the west. In 1875 he
was appointed Professor of Mechanics in the Virginia
Polytechnic Institute at Blacksburg, a position he held
until a reorganization of the Faculty in 1881. Writes one
of his colleagues: “He was highly valued by his
associates as a man of force and culture; was
esteemed by the student body as an attractive and
honest teacher; by the people of the community as an
upright, genial, agreeable gentleman. Politics was alone
responsible for his removal.” The later years of his life
were spent in Winston-Salem, N. C., where he died
September 11, 1911, at the age of eighty-two.</p>
        <p>As previously stated, General Boggs married in
1854 Mary Sophia, daughter of Col. John Symington
and Elizabeth McCaw Johnston Symington. To them
were born five children: William R., Jr., a mining
engineer, who was murdered in Mexico in 1907;
Elizabeth McCaw, John Symington, Edith Allston (deceased), 
<pb id="boggsxxiii" n="XXIII"/>
and Henry Patterson. To the second of these,
Mrs. Elizabeth Boggs Taylor, of Winston-Salem, the
Historical Society of Trinity College is indebted for the
permission to publish these Reminiscences. This
introduction may well close with the lines to General
Boggs, written by his grandson, Henry Porterfield
Taylor:</p>

            <p>PURCHASE of ARMS: DEFENSES AT CHARLESTON  -  THE
CONFEDERATE ORDNANCE BUREAU  -  OPERATIONS AT
PENSACOLA  -  CRITICISM OF CONFEDERATE MILITARY 
APPOINTMENTS.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>In 1860 I was an officer of the United States Army,
detailed on special duty at the Fort Pitt Foundry at
Pittsburg, Pennsylvania, to superintend the manufacture of
the new pattern eight and ten-inch Rodman Guns, under the
new Rodman process. I was delightfully situated, proud of
my profession and not a secessionist.</p>
          <p>The Presidential election of that year was most bitterly
partisan; and with election of Mr. Lincoln, I could not see
how an intestine war was to be avoided. I was afterwards
very much surprised to find that Mr. Davis and his Cabinet
had thought that the Southern States would be permitted to
withdraw from the union peaceably. I believed then as I do
now, that men who held such opinions were unfit to direct
our affairs. I believed then as I do now, that an active,
determined, and unhesitating policy would have brought
about an early and honorable settlement.</p>
          <p>But, let me make a fresh start. The Georgia Legislature
had, at its session just previous to the election,
<pb id="boggs2" n="2"/>
created the office of Adjutant General and elected
Major Harry Wayne to fill the office. It had also
appropriated money to purchase heavy Ordnance and
other war material, and had selected Colonel W. J.
Hardee, of the U. S. Army, and a native Georgian, to
make the purchases. By a strange fatality he made his
contract for the heavy guns with the Fort Pitt Foundry.
The proprietor took the contract, remarking that if
Georgia should not want the guns or there should be
any difficulty about delivery, the United States would
take them. The United States took them. Had the
contract been given to almost any other foundry,
especially Anderson's at Richmond, Georgia would
have got her guns. It is a singular fact that nearly all
the heavy ordnance intended for the Southern seacoast
were on skids in Northern Arsenals.</p>
          <p>In casting the first fifteen-inch Rodman gun, the Fort
Pitt Foundry had, for the want of room, taken the risk
of altering one of their furnaces in a manner contrary
to all accepted rules. The alteration proved a
marvelous success. So soon as Mr. Lincoln's election
was assured, I made a very careful drawing of this
furnace; I also made drawings of the latest bullet press
and other machines and models that I thought would
soon be needed down South. When I went I took them
with me; but as the New Government proposed to live
in peace and harmony with all mankind, especially the
Yanks, my labors were cast aside.</p>
          <p>On the morning after the election a young man,
Nicholas Wade by name, boasted that he had voted
for Mr. Lincoln for the sole purpose of seeing what
the South was going to do about it. I remarked that “if
<pb id="boggs3" n="3"/>
he stood by his vote, he and I would soon be shooting
at each other.” There were two other young men,
Metcalfs by name, very whole-soured and liberal in
their views, who remarked that “if we were forced into
a war by politicians, they would take no part in it.” I
told them they would have to; for that in the beginning
their bar-room bullies, roughs, toughs, and gutter-snipes
would rush into their army to have a good time, that we
had no such characters or but few in the South, and
furnishing soldiers with higher motives and principles,
we would whip them so badly that for the honor of
their section they would have to go. I heard of the
Metcalfs and others, who did not vote for Mr. Lincoln,
in order to see what the South was going to do about it,
being in the Federal Army; but never of Mr. Wade or
men of his like, North or South.</p>
          <p>When a Convention of the people of Georgia was
called to consider their relations with the Federal
Government, I obtained a leave of absence for thirty
days and went home to Georgia. On the day that the
State, in Convention assembled, voted the State no
longer a member of the Union, I resigned my
commission in the United States Army.</p>
          <p>At the request of the Governor I went to
Milledgeville for consultation. One of my first
suggestions was that he send some trusty person to
Europe for the express and sole purpose of purchasing
an outfit for the manufacture of small arms; that if this
was done at once, it could be brought in before a
blockade was established. Mr. King, T. Butler King I
think, was written to and accepted. It was arranged
that I, with a master armorer, should meet him in
Philadelphia,
<pb id="boggs4" n="4"/>
I lost some time waiting but he never came. On my
return to Milledgeville I suggested to the Governor that
Mr. King was probably waiting the formation of the
Confederate Government so that he might act for both.
Such proved to be the case and we got no armory. My
meeting Mr. King in Philadelphia was in connection
with other duties, I having received authority from the
Governor to purchase war material wherever I could
find it.<ref id="ref9" n="9" rend="sc" target="note9" targOrder="U">1</ref> I will say, just here, that I, on behalf of the
State of Georgia, purchased and ordered manufactured
more war material than all the other seceding States
put together, or than was provided for by the
Confederate Congress. I now busied myself
converting the State Penitentiary into an arsenal of
construction. It was while so engaged that the
Confederate Government was formed and Beauregard 
made a Brigadier-General and sent to Charleston.</p>
          <p>It had been expected that on Beauregard's arrival
the bombardment of Fort Sumter would begin. But his
inspections and a few shots to the seaward satisfied
him that something was wrong. W. H. C. Whiting,
recently of the engineer corps, and I, of the Ordnance,
being the nearest available officers, he asked
Governor Brown to send us to him for a short time. At
the General's request we made a thorough examination.</p>
          <p>At Fort Moultrie, the small but important omission of
putting the swinging props under the trails of the gun
carriages had caused the guns to dismount themselves
when fired with shot. Anderson no doubt removed
<note id="note9" n="9" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref9">1. See Appendix, Commentary II, p 92.</note>
<pb id="boggs5" n="5"/>
these props before he abandoned the Fort.
Their only fuses were old style wooden mortar fuses
and for economy they had been sawed into two or
more pieces; the shock of the discharge would drive
the small ends into the shell and explode the shell
either in the gun or just after leaving it. Their mortar
beds were made of wood, from patterns intended for
iron and brass. Morris Island beach was exposed to an
enfilading fire from Fort Sumter and required heavy
epaulments to protect its batteries from that fire. We
remained with General Beauregard until Governor
Brown summoned us to Savannah.<ref id="ref10" n="10" rend="sc" target="note10" targOrder="U">2</ref>
</p>
          <p>I had ordered from Anderson's Foundry at
Richmond an unlimited number of heavy guns, with the
irons for their carriages and four hundred rounds each
of shot and shell for each gun. They were to be
shipped, as fast as made, in box cars, by the way of
the East Tennessee R. R. In daily expectation that
these guns would begin to arrive, we determined not
only to arm Fort Pulaski, but also to occupy Tybee
Island and to place some of the guns in lunettes on the
Island. The guns ordered by me were diverted by the
Honorable Secretary of War, and sent to Mobile.
Therefore Fort Pulaski was never armed or Tybee
Island occupied.<ref id="ref11" n="11" rend="sc" target="note11" targOrder="U">3</ref>
</p>
          <p>While in Savannah, Senator F. S. Bartow, chairman
of the committee on military affairs in the Confederate
Congress, came there. He asked me what I thought of
his bill for the organization of the army.
<note id="note10" n="10" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref10">2.  Boggs was recalled to Savannah early in March, 1861. See

Commentary II. page 92. Fort Pulaski and Tybee Island are near
Savannah.  -  (ED.()</note>
<pb id="boggs6" n="6"/>
My reply was that I would hardly call it his bill since
Mr. Davis' hand was to be seen in every line of it.
Bartow blushed. I mention this, as I shall mention
some other matters, in order to show Mr. Davis'
determination to direct the smallest affairs in
connection with the army.</p>
          <p>It was not long before I was summoned to
Montgomery, and with the consent of Governor
Brown, I went.<ref id="ref12" n="12" rend="sc" target="note12" targOrder="U">4</ref> Arrived at Montgomery, I was
requested to take temporary charge of the Ordnance
Bureau, (the head of that department, as of most
others, being held in reserve for others who were
supposed, intended, or might be induced thereby to
come South). Among the first things needful was a
competent clerk. I called upon the only resident of
Montgomery that I knew and requested his assistance
to procure one. The very next morning the Honorable
Secretary of War, Pope Walker, informed me that I
would need a clerk and that he had sent for one for
me. There was no hurry about anything connected
with the New Government except in providing places.
In a short time my Pope Walker clerk came; so far as
his usefulness was concerned he might as well have
remained at home and drawn his salary there. Mr.
Walker was not the only Cabinet member interested in
providing clerks; L. W. O'Bannon resigned his
commission in the United States Army and came to
Montgomery; he received an appointment and was
sent to Pensacola as quartermaster; the night before
he went he received an intimation purporting to come
from Mr. Mallory, as to whom he
<note id="note12" n="12" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref12">4.  I have not been able to find when Boggs was called to
Montgomery. (ED.)</note>
<pb id="boggs7" n="7"/>
should appoint as clerk. He requested the messenger
to say to Mr. Mallory, “that if the egg was rotten
before it was laid, to let him know, and he would return
to Washington and ask to be taken back into the
Union.”</p>
          <p>My first care was to examine the appropriations for
the ordnance department. I found them most picayune;
the appropriation for gunpowder was not sufficient to
have fired the guns mounted at Pensacola for two
days, and the appropriation was for one year. All other
material was in the same ratio. I made haste to inform
the Secretary of War. He told me that the
appropriations were for a peace establishment, that
treaty commissioners had been sent to Washington and
we must do nothing that implied war. I satisfied him
that even for a peace establishment the appropriations
were too small. I finally succeeded in getting an
additional appropriation. I was then sent to examine a
foundry at Mobile to see if it could be converted into a
gun foundry; and also to inspect the defences of New
Orleans. At Mobile I was surprised to find that the
foundry already had orders from Mr. Walker to
manufacture an unlimited number of canister shot for
twenty-four and thirty-two pounder guns. What he
proposed to do with them was past finding out. At
New Orleans I suggested that some of the heavy guns
be taken out of the Forts and placed in one or, at most,
two gun batteries along the banks of the river above
the Forts.</p>
          <p>On my return to Montgomery, I found several
proposals from English houses to furnish many much
needed supplies. The proposals were very liberal in
<pb id="boggs8" n="8"/>
every respect; they even offered for 10 per cent. of
the original cost to run the blockade and deliver guns to
the C. S. A., and no harm could have arisen from
accepting them. They remained unacted upon, either
upon the supposition that the United States would
permit us to depart in peace, or because the proper
person to have charge of such affairs, had not yet
come South. I never knew, and it was soon too late.</p>
          <p>An agreement had been entered into that we should
make no effort to capture Fort Pickens, nor the
Federals to reinforce it, without a previous notice of
twenty-four hours. A severe storm accompanied by a
gale seemed to suggest an opportunity to capture the
Fort. I proposed to General Cooper, Adjutant General
of the Army, that he should call Mr. Walker's attention
to the opportunity. He insisted that the idea having
originated with me that I should see Mr. Walker. I lost
no time in doing so; the Secretary left me immediately,
I presumed to see Mr. Davis. I heard nothing more of
it until sometime afterwards, when, in conversation
with General Bragg I happened to speak of it. He told
me that he also had seen the opportunity and had
telegraphed the Secretary for permission to take
advantage of it, but had received no reply until too late,
and then it was to ask him, if he had established
“reserved batteries,” and that he had never yet
understood what the Honorable Secretary meant.</p>
          <p>Late one afternoon I was standing at the counter in
a book store, when I felt a gentle touch on the
shoulder. It was the Secretary of War who took me to
one side, and informed me that our commissioners had
<pb id="boggs9" n="9"/>
been rejected; and that we were going to have war.
He further informed me, that he wished me to go to
Pensacola as soon as possible. It was arranged that I
should take the next train; and that I should meet him
at his office immediately after supper for instructions. I
was on hand at the appointed time: but also was Jerry
Clemens, erstwhile a member of the United States
Congress, now Major General and Commander in
Chief of the Military Forces of Alabama. General
Clemens was an out and out Union man, bitterly
opposed to the secession movement, as were the
people he represented, as were in fact a majority of
the voters of Alabama. Clemens was still a power in
Alabama, and Mr. Walker seemed to remember it: for
he submitted to be bull-dozed by him until after two
o'clock in the morning.</p>
          <p>All this time I sat patiently waiting the pleasure of
the Secretary, or rather that of Jerry Clemens. When
Clemens got through with him, he was in no condition
for further labor; he could only tell me to take the first
train for Pensacola and be governed by circumstances.
<ref id="ref13" n="13" rend="sc" target="note13" targOrder="U">5</ref>
</p>
          <p>Arrived at Pensacola I reported to General Bragg.
The General informed me that they were sending him
regiment after regiment; but no supplies of any kind,
nor the means of moving or distributing them if he had
them. Fortunately, at that time, everybody was
enthused and were sending or bringing ample supplies
of food. I informed the General of all the
circumstances of my orders, and thought he need not
hesitate

Commentary I, page 90.  -  (ED.)</note>
<pb id="boggs10" n="10"/>
to take almost any responsibility.
<ref id="ref14" n="14" rend="sc" target="note14" targOrder="U">6</ref>
O'Bannon, his chief
quartermaster, was called into consultation and, with
the aid of the telegraph, it was not many days before
he had a well equipped army.</p>
          <p>General Bragg expressed the wish that I would
remain with him. Being most heartily tired of the
inaction at the seat of government, as well as of
preparing a place for someone else, I was glad of the
opportunity. That was the way in which I became
attached to General Bragg's staff.
<ref id="ref15" n="15" rend="sc" target="note15" targOrder="U">7</ref>
</p>
          <p>For a while the work was continuous and heavy.
Captains Stevens and S. H. Locket of the Engineer
Corps were engaged in putting heavy guns in lunettes
along the beach; and in the end, all the heavy barbette
guns were taken out of the Forts and placed along the
beach. When the rush was over, I went to Georgia and
brought my wife and children.</p>
          <p>In anticipation of an opportunity, I had prepared two
portable platforms for eight inch guns; which with the
guns and carriages were so placed as to be easily
shipped for transportation to Santa Rosa Island. Special
details were made, who were taught to handle these
guns. Should we attempt to carry Fort Pickens by
assault, it was intended that these guns were to be
mounted in the sand hills near the outer beach to
engage the fleet. All the details had been arranged;
Col. John H. Forney was to command and was to
assault from the glacis, Stevens to attack the sallyport,
and I through the embrasures. During this

time, some transports made their appearance off the
Island and it was evident that the Federals intended to
reinforce Fort Pickens upon the first favorable
opportunity. One night General Bragg sent Stevens
and myself to Santa Rosa Island for the purpose of
ascertaining, as near as possible, the exact condition of
affairs. We went up to the glacis, captured, and
conversed with a sentinel. While Stevens and I were
upon the Island, an officer of the United States Navy
arrived at General Bragg's headquarters, with orders
from Mr. Davis to permit him to communicate, at
once, with the fleet.
<ref id="ref16" n="16" rend="sc" target="note16" targOrder="U">8</ref>
What the Confederate
Government proposed to gain by such courtesy I have
never been able to ascertain: but I do know, that a
battallion of regular artillery was that night thrown into
the Fort and the sixth New York volunteers landed
upon the beach. Fort Pickens was now, by the grace
of the Confederate Government, fully garrisoned.</p>
          <p>Soon after Mr. Lincoln's inauguration, Fort Sumter
was bombarded and captured. Mr. Lincoln then called
upon the different States for their quota of troops to
put down the rebellion. This caused the remaining
slaveholding States to withdraw from the Union and
join their fortunes with the seceding States. The seat
of government was now removed to Richmond.</p>
          <p>About this time I received a letter from Thomas R.
Cobb, of Georgia, informing me that he had received
authority to organize a legion, to be composed of
Infantry, Cavalry and Artillery, and to be known as
“Cobb's Legion,” that I had been recommended to
<note id="note16" n="16" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref16">8.  This was Lieutenant Worden who came direct from Washington.
See Appendix,
Commentary I, pp. 90-91.</note>
<pb id="boggs12" n="12"/>
him to organize it, and that he would have me appointed
his Lieutenant Colonel, if I would accept. I declined. I
had the confidence of General Bragg, was engaged
upon duties for which but few persons in our service
were qualified, and had no doubt but that I would be
promoted to a rank commensurate with the duties I
was performing. Again, here was a lawyer appointed
by the President to the command of three branches of
service, all at once, under the high sounding name of
“Legion” and who seemed perfectly confident, that at
his say-so the President would appoint me <hi rend="italics">his</hi>
Lieutenant Colonel. From what will appear hereafter, it
would have been a most peculiar act on the part of the
President. When the Government moved to Richmond,
Robert Toombs, Secretary of State, suggested that as
the cabinet had been formed from the first five
seceding states, it would be a proper thing for the
cabinet to resign and permit Mr. Davis to form his
cabinet from all the States. He resigned; but the rest
were too well satisfied with themselves and their
places. By and by, when pressure began to bear and
changes were inevitable, the Secretary of War began
to organize a brigade for himself to command when he
ceased to be Secretary.</p>
          <p>In the progress of this organization, Joseph Wheeler,
(“Point Wheeler” of West Point), Lieutenant in the C. 
S. Army, detailed as Adjutant General to an Alabama
Brigade, told me of the proposed organization and that
the officers of his Brigade would help him to get
promotion in it, if he would apply. He said he felt a
delicacy in doing so, because there were so many of
his comrades, right there, who had seen so much more
<pb id="boggs13" n="13"/>
service than he had. I advised him not to hesitate on
that account, for none of us would be jealous of his
promotion. Pope Walker was from north Alabama, so
was Wheeler and the officers of the Brigade to which
he was attached. When he finally decided to apply for
a Majority, I asked him if he did not consider himself
more competent to command a regiment than any of
the Colonels under whom he was serving. The talk
ended in <hi rend="italics">my</hi>
writing, for him, the following application,
to wit:</p>
          <div3 type="letter" org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">

            <p>I have the honor to apply for promotion in the Provisional
Army of the Confederate States.</p>

          </div3>
          <div3 org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
            <p>By my advice he made a copy of this letter, which,
having shown to the officers of his Brigade, he then
forwarded through regular channels. I told General
Bragg all of the circumstances. He endorsed the
application with his approval and at the same time
called attention to his repeated recommendations of
O'Bannon, Slaughter, Villepigue and myself, all of
whom ranked Wheeler and were equally worthy of
promotion. The return mail brought Wheeler his
Colonel's commission and orders to proceed to north
Alabama.</p>
            <p>I have gone into these details for two reasons: one,
to show that the Cabinet was as much governed by
their personal interest at Richmond as at Montgomery;
the other, because this application, written by me, has
<pb id="boggs14" n="14"/>
been quoted as a specimen of military brevity,
surpassed only by Caesar and as the foreshadowing of
the distinguished officer that Wheeler afterwards
became. He is now a member of the United States
Congress, and for him I have always had a high
regard.</p>
            <p>After the battle of Bull Run July 21st, 1861, there
was a rush to Richmond. Some of General Bragg's
officers, on short leaves, took advantage of their leaves
to go to Richmond and were promoted. Two went
without leave and were promoted. These things,
Beauregard's two battles, but more specially, the
appointment of Mansfield Lovell, a late comer, to the
command at New Orleans, with the rank of Major
General, (a command that General Bragg wanted and
to which he felt himself entitled) rankled General Bragg
very much and made him feel it was necessary to do
something to bring himself into notice.
<ref id="ref17" n="17" rend="sc" target="note17" targOrder="U">9</ref> Having
determined to burn “Billy” Wilson's Camp and the
supply buildings that had been built outside of Fort
Pickens, he sent Lieut. J. E. Slaughter and myself to
Santa Rosa Island on the night before the proposed
attack, for the purpose of ascertaining if it was possible
to surprise them. Our mission was successfully
accomplished. The following night General Richard H.
Anderson with a command of details from all the
different regiments, made a descent upon the Island
and succeeded in burning the camp. Captain L. A.

</p>
            <p>General Bragg's command was now extended to
include the State of Alabama. He sent me to inspect
the defences at Mobile. When I had completed my
inspection I determined to return on horseback by the
way of Perdido Bay. I took with me an escort of two
cavalrymen. The steamboat landed us low down on
Mobile Bay, at a turpentine distillery. After passing the
turpentine plantations, the roads disappeared. We
came upon a young man leaning upon a gate of a
pretty residence: although living in the house in which
he had been born, he professed to know nothing about
the roads or to have ever heard of Perdido Bay. We
could only keep as near east as the Savannah would
permit and trust to luck. In the midst of the forest we
found a single room cabin, in which there lived a wood
chopper and his family. Upon enquiring our way he
kindly volunteered to take us across what he called the
laurel swamp and the old mill dam: which he said
would be impossible without a guide. He got us across
and pointed out our direction. The man was a native of
Georgia, his occupation to chop wood, which he floated
down the stream, on which the old mill had stood, to
the gulf, where it was loaded on floats for the Mobile
market. He declined taking any pay for his services;
but happening to have some gold

the perfect knowledge of the enemy's pickets and positions, obtained
by close reconnaisences, on which the expedition was based, and for
the secret and complete organization which insured its success.” See

dollars in my pocket I gave him three of them for
keepsakes. When it was nearly sundown we found a
path running north and south crossing our route: we
decided to go north and after swimming one stream
arrived at the ferryman's house. We were not sorry to
find that he had not come home; for having fasted
since breakfast we were glad to wait and have supper.
Our ferryman proved to be a Spaniard of many
occupations, a dark, wiry, leather-skinned old chap. It
was now dark, but he said he could take us over all the
same. When I saw the boat in which he proposed to
accomplish it I was not so confident. It was a scow,
with a pointed bow not over twenty-five feet long and
about four feet wide, at its widest part. In this boat he
proposed to, and did, take three men and their horses,
two negro oarsmen and himself across a bay three
miles wide, and not only that, but so soon as we were
clear of the shore, he hoisted sail. I prepared and
handed to General Bragg a written report; it determined
him to go at once to Mobile. On his return he sent for
me and read me <hi rend="italics">his</hi> report to the Secretary of War. It
was singularly like the one I had made to him, but to
which it made no reference: he did, however at the
close of it, ask the President to make me a Brigadier,
and he would place me in command of the defences of
Mobile. Some little time afterwards, he informed me
that Captain Page, recently of the U. S. Navy, had
been appointed to the command.

            <p>About this time Billy Wilson's Zouaves had been
reembarked and disappeared. One day, November
22nd, I was crossing to the camp at Live Oak Point,
when Major Brown opened, unexpectedly, with all his
guns. He had selected the moment when our transports
had arrived from Pensacola and tied up at the Navy
Yard Wharf. The pilot of the tug <hi rend="italics">Nelms</hi> stuck to his
boat, backed her out, and started up the bay. He got
her safely off, notwithstanding every gun that could be,
was brought to bear upon her. From my position I had
an unobstructed view of the race between the tug and
the shot and shell: one of my darky oarsmen exclaimed,
“ain't that barbarous?” The other crew abandoned
their boat and sought safety in the woods. While
returning across the bay, it occurred to me that so
furious a cannonade must be for the purpose of
covering a landing at Perdido.
<ref id="ref20" n="20" rend="sc" target="note20" targOrder="U">12</ref> I joined General
Bragg and was sent to superintend the firing at the
fleet from a battery on our extreme right. Finding that
the fleet was out of effective range, I caused the
battery to cease firing. When the fleet moved up closer
we opened again; after the second shot the fleet again
retired, with the <hi rend="italics">Hartford</hi> disabled. The cannonading
lasted for two days, the only result being a great waste
of ammunition and that thereafter our supplies could
not be landed at the dock.</p>
            <p>Upon the arrival of the transports, the teams and
<note id="note20" n="20" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref20">12.  When I reached my little cabin I found my son William
watching “the bombs burst in air,” my wife making a camp kettle of
coffee and the cook, Jane, picking a turkey. My wife had wisely
concluded that in the midst of so much excitement, the preparation
of necessary food would, probably, be overlooked. When she directed
Jane to kindle a fire, put on water and kill the turkey; poor Jane
exclaimed, “de-laws Miss Mary, you ain't thinking bout eatin' now, is
you?” I sent them by the first train to Montgomery.</note>
<pb id="boggs18" n="18"/>
teamsters and the working details, and a good many
idlers also, were generally on the dock. Major Brown
dropped his first shells into the midst of this crowd,
causing panic and confusion. The appearance of
General Richard Anderson walking cooly about and
that of an old soldier, who looking up and saying, “there
seemed to be a considerable of a shower,” raised his
umbrella, stopped the panic and confusion. An
Alabama soldier, to whom I had done a kindness,
narrated the above in connection with his own
experiences  It seems he was an idler, and, following
his first impulse, he took refuge in the stone dock. He
and some others found it a jolly place until the rising
tide drove them out. Making way through the heavy
sand he heard himself called and looking round saw
Pell, the master ship-carpenter, sitting behind one of
the big cisterns; as there was plenty of room, he went
there also. It was all very well for awhile; but a heavy
shell coming over the cistern and exploding sufficiently
near to cover them with sand they concluded to seek
other quarters.</p>
            <p>With the first gun all the negro employees
disappeared and were not seen again until the firing
had ceased. We then learned that for some time they
had been digging bomb-proof shelters, called gopher
holes, and provisioning them for just such occasions.
Gaps had been cut in the wall surrounding the Navy
Yard; through these women, children and others not on
duty found their way out of range. An orderly brought
Mrs. Anderson a horse without saddle and only an old
rope for a bridle; so mounted, with one
<pb id="boggs19" n="19"/>
of her children behind her, she was making her way
out of range when she passed Justice Moulton: all at
once her womanly instincts returned, and stopping her
horse she asked Mr. Moulton to please assist her to
adjust her seat and skirts. Just then a large shell came
tearing through the woods; the old man informed her
that she was doing very well indeed and rushed on.
Justice Moulton was the owner of our principal
transport, “The Steamboat Times;” that morning found
him confined to his berth on the boat, with a severe
attack of inflammatory rheumatism. He was heard
afterwards to remark that he had found a rapid cure
for rheumatism. Young Francis Parker, Jr., aide-de-camp 
to General Bragg, and one of the most gallant
officers of the whole war, hearing General Bragg ask
if anyone knew whether the enemy were firing hot
shot, replied: “Yes, for one of them falling near him, he
had gotten off his horse and spat upon it, and it fizzed.”</p>
            <p>A soldier was placed in the covered way of
Batchelers battery, First Louisiana, to watch the fight
of the shot and caution the men at the guns, when to
take cover: he would call out “that is to the right,” or,
“left,” or, “look out boys;” when a shot from a rifle gun
cut the sand bag on which he was leaning, he never
moved, but in his usual tone remarked “Pretty d--d
close.” Notwithstanding all restriction and care these
same Louisiannians were frequently the worse for
liquor and it was some time before the cause was
ascertained. Mrs. Bragg had sent to this regiment,
from her plantation, a hogshead each of sugar and
<pb id="boggs20" n="20"/>
molasses; these, the soldiers were distilling into rum.<ref id="ref21" n="21" rend="sc" target="note21" targOrder="U">13</ref>
</p>
            <p>Up to the time of General Bragg's visit to Mobile I
had enjoyed his full confidence: since then there
appeared to be a change. For some time I had very
little active employment, in fact all of our duties
were simple routine; a number of troops had been
ordered from us to Virginia: others upon condition of
reorganizing for the war, had been permitted to go
home on furlough. I could not understand my
treatment in Richmond or General Bragg's cool
official manner. I determined to have a talk with the
General and let the result of that interview decide
my course of action. After the interview I sent in my
resignation; it was promptly forwarded and promptly
accepted.<ref id="ref22" n="22" rend="sc" target="note22" targOrder="U">14</ref>
</p>
            <p>After forwarding my resignation General Bragg
had gone to Mobile and had not returned. When I was
ready to leave Pensacola I called on General Anderson
(Bragg was still absent) to make my adieus and also
wish him and his family the compliments of the
season,  -  it was new year's day, 1862. While chatting
with them, there was a roar of artillery, followed by the
shrieks of shot and shell. All the officers present
mounted and rode to the Navy Yard. After remaining
with the General a little while I rode back to my
quarters. Finding an extra horse, I took my wife to a
point between Fort McRee and the lighthouse: from
there we witnessed the firing until darkness

recommendation of Bragg. The Superintendent at the opening of the
war was W. T. Sherman. Boggs was granted a leave of absence and
never assumed charge of the school.</note>

put a stop to it. On our way back I noticed some
soldiers kindling a fire to cook their suppers, directly in
the rear of their battery. I rode to them and suggested
that they had better make their fire to one side, as it
certainly would be fired at. I had scarcely ceased
speaking when a shell came roaring by, followed by
the sound of the gun from which it was fired. The fire
disappeared in a hurry, and so did my wife and I.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>I was now, against my will, free to do as I pleased.
While in the United States Army I had been frequently
detailed to different foundries either to inspect or
superintendent the manufacture of heavy ordnance. At
New Orleans there was a large foundry; I also
considered New Orleans as one of the most important
places in the Confederacy; therefore I went to New
Orleans. Shortly after my arrival the commanding
officer, General Mansfield Lovell, sent for me. He
expressed a desire to have me on his staff. I informed
him fully of my position and my belief that Mr. Davis
would not consent. He insisted on trying, saying Mr.
Davis had refused him nothing as yet and if I would
consent to serve on his staff with the rank of Colonel
he would take the risk of refusal. He was refused. In
the interval I had received a dispatch from Governor
Brown, saying that the State needed my services and
requesting me to come to Milledgeville. On my return
to Georgia, my mother gently, but decidedly, made me
understand that she did not approve of my leaving the
Confederate service, and I have now to admit that she
was right.</p>
          <p>While journeying home, I travelled with some of the
twelve month volunteers returning home. I was
surprised to learn from them that General Bragg had
<pb id="boggs23" n="23"/>
placed General Anderson under arrest, and preferred
charges against him, on account of the cannonade of
January the first. This cannonade was begun by Fort
Pickens, and because a young officer of the First
Louisiana, detailed on special duty by General Bragg,
had ordered one of the steam transports to tie up at the
Navy Yard dock. When he was called upon for an
explanation, he stated that he had authority from
General Bragg to do so. So soon as I reached a
stopping place I wrote to General Bragg expressing
my surprise, and stating the facts as I knew them; I
also wrote to General Anderson telling him I had done
so, and if he should need me as a witness for his
defense, at any time or place, to let me know and I
would come.<ref id="ref23" n="23" rend="sc" target="note23" targOrder="U">1</ref>
</p>
          <p>I reported to Governor Brown at Milledgeville, and
was appointed by him Colonel and Chief Engineer of
the State Forces. There were already on his staff
Harry Wayne, Adjutant General, and Lachlan
McIntosh, Chief of Ordnance. The State had in the
field a division under the command of Major General
Henry R. Jackson, consisting of three brigades,
commanded by Brigadier Generals W. H. T. Walker,
G. P. Harrison, and J. W. Capers.</p>
          <p>Late in the month of March, 1862, the Governor
received a dispatch from Savannah, stating that the
Federal gun boats had appeared in one of the estuaries
(Vernon River) and were in sight of Causton's Bluff,
four miles from Savannah. Taking the night train, I
reached Savannah a little after daylight and hastened
to the headquarters of the State troops: finding no

one there I went to the headquarters of the
Confederate troops, to find no one there. It began to
look as if no one was very much alarmed after all.
About ten o'clock the staff began to appear, and later
the commanding officers. I was furnished with a horse
and we galloped out to Causton's Bluff. Having
examined into the situation I made up my mind what to
do if permitted. I called on General A. R. Lawton,
commanding the Confederate forces, and in discussing
the situation suggested the propriety of occupying the
Islands (especially Venus' Point) on the South Carolina
side, or at least of establishing a few batteries. He did
not think it possible to stand on them, much less occupy
them, and that a gun would sink out of sight. I
suggested that those were difficulties to be overcome.
He seemed to rely upon some torpedoes that Capt. J.
C. Ives had placed there to keep the gun boats from
coming into Wall's Cut and getting between us and Fort
Pulaski. There were some of us who had very little
confidence in Ives' loyalty; and the fact that Ives had
been at work down the river, caused us still more
anxiety.</p>

          <p>At State headquarters it was determined to employ
the State troops in building a line of defence around the
city. I expressed a wish to examine the city archives
for the oldest county map. Captain Gladding, a
volunteer aide-de-camp, said he knew where it was
and would get it. I could not have had one better suited
to my purpose. Governor Brown, General Wayne, and
Major McIntosh came down from Milledgeville. It was
desired to establish the line of defence as quickly as
possible: with the map for a guide, and a pocket full of
fencing nails and a hatchet in my belt, I verified the
map. Having found what I thought was a first rate line,
and General Lee having examined and approved, it
was begun at once. About this time we heard that the
Federals were in the habit of landing on Tybee Island
every night and leaving again before day. Tybee Island
being in the State, it was decided, at State
headquarters, that I should go down and if possible
ascertain what they were doing on the Island. Gladding
volunteered to furnish the boat and crew and
accompany me. The following night was fixed upon for
the attempt: but for some reason, unknown to us,
General Henry R. Jackson reported our intentions to
Confederate headquarters and we were forbidden to
go. One morning we found the Federal gun boats in
Wall's Cut on the Carolina side, in which Ives'
torpedoes were supposed to be. They, with the boats
already in St. Augustine Creek, on our side cut off all
communication by water with Fort Pulaski.
Commodore Josiah Tatnall took down one load of
supplies, receiving their fire going and coming. General
W. H. T. Walker was very indignant: he proposed 
<pb id="boggs26" n="26"/>
a plan for the capture of the gun boats, offered
to take all the responsibility, and make the necessary
preparations and attack with his own Brigade. Had his
plan been promptly accepted, it would, in my opinion,
have been successful. But it was taken into
consideration. Before the consideration was concluded,
those Islands, on which a man could not stand, were
covered with tents and troops; and those estuaries,
which had been filled with Ives' torpedoes, were full of
gun boats. On the tenth day of April, we could hear
distinctly the bombardment of Fort Pulaski. At the end
of twenty-four hours the stillness assured us that it was
in the hands of the Federals.</p>
          <p>Governor Brown now insisted upon pushing the line
of defence and obstructing the river. While so engaged
we received the news of the battle of Seven Pines, of
Johnston's being wounded, and also of passage of the
infamous conscript law. Gen. Lee being ordered to the
command of the army of Virginia, called to make his
adieus to General Jackson. During this call he
suggested that I should reorganize one of the State
regiments, which under the conscript law would soon
be claimed by the Confederacy, stating that in so doing
I would not be in the way of anyone wishing to be
Colonel, as he had no doubt I would soon be given a
Brigade. I told the General that “it was not my desire to
remain out of the Confederate service: but, for some
cause unknown to me, Mr. Davis would not give me a
command.”</p>
          <p>In that respect I was in good company: General W.
H. T. Walker had been one of the most distinguished
officers of the United States Army, one of a very few
<pb id="boggs27" n="27"/>
receiving more than two brevets in the Mexican war.
On the day that his State seceded, he sent in his
resignation, and upon its acceptance, offered his
services to his State. Upon the formation of the
Confederate Government, he tendered his services. He
was after a while appointed a Brigadier General; but
being kept inactive, in subordinate positions, he
resigned and accepted the command of Brigade of
State troops.<ref id="ref26" n="26" rend="sc" target="note26" targOrder="U">4</ref> He was now, by the conscript law,
deprived of that command.<ref id="ref27" n="27" rend="sc" target="note27" targOrder="U">5</ref> With ample means he
might have lived comfortably, in his forced retirement;
but being every inch a soldier, he once more entered
the Confederate service and was killed at Atlanta,
while serving under men whom he could, and should
have, commanded. So much for Mr. Davis' pique!</p>
          <p>I will mention but one of many cases in contrast, and
that not by way of disparagement of the person:   -  for
I believe that Pemberton did his very best. Pemberton
came south after the war had begun. He was, at once,
appointed a Brigadier and sent to take command at
Charleston. When Lee was ordered to Virginia, he
was, without having fought a battle, made a Major
General and given command of the States of Georgia
and South Carolina. In less than one year, before his
qualifications had been tested, he was made a
Lieutenant General and sent to command Vicksburg,
the most important command in the southwest: and
which he surrendered on July the fourth, 1863. Steven
D. Lee had been tested at Vicksburg, where he had repelled

Sherman's attack. So much for Mr. Davis'
judgment!</p>
          <p>With the fall of Fort Pulaski, there was a general
move of women and children from Savannah. Major
Lachlan McIntosh's mother and half sisters and Mrs.
Gladding, wife of my most valuable assistant, Captain
Gladding, went to my house in Milledgeville until they
could be provided for.</p>
          <p>The Army of the State of Georgia having been
reduced by the conscript law, to the Governor, its
commander-in-chief, Henry C. Wayne, its adjutant
general, Lachlan McIntosh, its chief of ordnance, and
myself, its chief engineer, we retired to Milledgeville,
the seat of government, to await events. Within a few
days after our return Governor Brown received a letter
from General Pemberton requesting that I be sent to
him for a special duty. It appeared that sundry persons,
having hid away a large amount of cotton, over 80,000
bales, on the Appalachicola river, were becoming
uneasy as to its safety. The town of Appalachicola, the
Bay, and the mouth of the river were already in the
hands of the Federals. The Honorable Judge Iverson
had been sent to Richmond, on the fall of Pulaski, to
ask help to protect the cotton; the people of Columbus,
Georgia, and Eufala, Alabama, promising to furnish the
labor, tools and supplies necessary to construct such
defences as might be decided upon. The petition and
proposals were sent to General Pemberton; he now
directed me to make a careful examination and after
having decided what to do to report to and call upon
Judge Iverson for the necessary
<pb id="boggs29" n="29"/>
assistance. I invited Captain Gladding to accompany
me.</p>
          <p>At Columbus we were furnished with a comfortable
boat and good crew. Our first landing after leaving
Eufala was at the landing of the Chattahoochee
Arsenal. We were now in a distinct civil and military
department and I proceeded to pay my respects to the
nearest commanding officer, Col. (Judge) Finley. He
was encamped with his regiment at the Arsenal, nearly
two miles off. When I suggested, in our interview, that
it would be advisable to station a sentinel at the landing
to protect his supplies, he remarked “why, it is two
miles off!” At Rickoos Bluff I found an effort being
made to plant a battery; the guns were on top of a bluff
at least three hundred feet above the river, with a
range of only half a mile. The most of the cotton was
some twenty miles further down the river: near it was
a small battery of field artillery, behind an epaulment,
supported by a battalion of infantry. Owing to a deep
creek coming up to a very short range in their rear the
position was untenable. Below this point the Federals
were in full possession. Having requested and obtained
a company of infantry for an escort I proceeded down
the river, where I examined all the creeks, lakes and
old river beds. These streams were very crooked but
very deep. Having completed my examinations and
decided what to do, I was about to return up the river
when the captain, who was the principal owner of the
boat and, when at home, a resident of Appalachicola,
suggested that we run down, and if we found it
practicable, to land at Appalachicola, and load up with
machinery, casting, and such other
<pb id="boggs30" n="30"/>
things as we sadly needed. Concealing the soldiers on
the lower deck, we continued down the river. As soon
as we saw that the Federal ship was at anchor some
distance down the Bay, we put on steam, made the
wharf, and took on a good load, the soldiers working
with a will. On my way up the Captain called my
attention to Owl Creek, the mouth of which was very
much lower down than our explorations had extended,
and I determined to explore it. It was very deep but
very difficult to navigate on account of its crookedness.
We surprised and were surprised by an old planter,
who had, as he thought, hid himself and his negroes
there. When the coast had been abandoned, he had
moved all his negroes and supplies to that pine forest,
built comfortable cabins and fixed himself for the war.
When he saw the smoke of the boat he thought it was
the Federals, and like Pell and the bomb shell wondered
where they would come next. Leaving the boat at
 his landing I got him to ride out to ..........river.<ref id="ref28" n="28" rend="sc" target="note28" targOrder="U">6</ref>
On the bank of this river I found a fisherman and his
family, who, having abandoned his home on the gulf
was living in a tent made of a sail. The country near
this river is exceedingly beautiful.</p>
          <p>Having finished my explorations I left the boat at
Bainbridge, Georgia, and went to Tallahassee, Florida,
to report my presence and duties in that district.
Returning to the boat, we went on it up the river as far
as Fort Gaines, Georgia. There I wrote letters to the
mayors of Eufalla and Columbus, stating what labor
and materials I should need and requesting that they be
ready for me on my return to Columbus, on a fixed
<note id="note28" n="28" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref28">6. The name of this river is omitted in the Mss.  -  (ED.)</note>
<pb id="boggs31" n="31"/>
date. When we reached Milledgeville, Gladding found
a letter informing him that there was a vessel loaded
with cotton ready for him to take out, and requesting
him to come to Savannah at once. Gladding had been
an officer of the United States revenue marine. He
had already run the blockade successfully. He
succeeded in getting out with his cotton, but was
captured on his return trip. After I had been made a
Brigadier General I asked his appointment as captain
and adjutant general on my staff and that he be
exchanged. When exchanged, he insisted on returning
by the way of Hilton Head: there, for some reason, he
was placed in irons and died in close confinement.</p>
          <p>On my return to Columbus, I found neither
workmen or materials, and no steps had been taken to
provide them. The scare was off and the labor was
needed in the crops, so it was proposed to put off the
work until later in the season. Having read my report
to General Pemberton and to Judge Iverson, I then
forwarded it by mail and returned to Milledgeville.</p>
          <p>I had been there but a short time when the battle of
Secessionville, South Carolina, took place.<ref id="ref29" n="29" rend="sc" target="note29" targOrder="U">7</ref> This and
other fighting on James Island implied that the
Federals intended to follow the path of the British and
endeavor to take Charleston in the rear.</p>
          <p>I obtained Governor Brown's permission to go to
Charleston. This effort of the Federals had created
uneasiness at Richmond and General Cooper was sent
there. I was very glad of the opportunity of meeting
him as it enabled me to enquire into my status at
Richmond. He told me that my resignation had been
<note id="note29" n="29" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref29">7.  June 16, 1862.Ä(ED.)</note>
<pb id="boggs32" n="32"/>
received at an unfortunate time; that many others had,
like myself, sent in similar papers about that time; that
Mr. Davis had been very much annoyed thereat and
bunched the whole, determined to take no further
notice of them. Then I asked him why it was that
previous to that, no notice had ever been taken of the
various applications for my promotion and especially
the one with reference to the command at Mobile.
Concerning that one he knew that in the same
envelope there was a private letter to Mr. Davis,
explaining that while he considered the promotion due
me, that he (General Bragg) could not well dispense
with my services on his staff, and that the promotion be
withheld for the time being. This was news.</p>
          <p>I also took advantage of the opportunity to inquire
concerning the charges made by General Bragg
against General Richard Anderson and to state facts in
that case as I knew them. General Cooper asked me if
I would object to giving him what I had stated in
writing. So far from it, if it would be of any service to
General Anderson, I would do so gladly. I did give him
a written statement, and shortly afterwards had the
satisfaction of seeing the promotion of that chivalrous
officer.</p>
          <p>The Federal assault on Secessionville, June 16th,
1862, had been made in force; being repulsed with
heavy loss they withdrew from James Island.</p>
          <p>On my return to Milledgeville I urged the Governor
to permit me to construct defensive lines about
Atlanta. This was objected to, through fear that it
might have a demoralizing influence. It was
determined that I should visit the mines, nitre caves
and foundries in
<pb id="boggs33" n="33"/>
upper Georgia, for the purpose of ascertaining if State
control or aid would facilitate the working of them.
Very soon after my inspection and before any decided
action had been taken, the Nitre and Mining Bureau of
the Confederate Government was created. I had found
that the abandoned copper mines near Canton yielded
lead and thought, in a time of such emergency, they
ought to be worked for it. The iron at Etowah and
Rome was well adapted to ordnance purposes; but we
were in need of persons familiar with the manufacture
of modern guns. The Nobles at Rome were casting
some small guns, but they were of old patterns. They
were very proud of their guns, and were casting their
names and place upon the bunions. I suggested that the
first one captured by the Federals would lead to a raid
to destroy their foundry. And it so happened.</p>
          <p>On my return to Milledgeville I found a telegram
from Mr. Davis inviting me to accept a position on his
personal staff. I have always thought that this was due
to either General Lee or Cooper or both, and that
courtesy to them, as well as to Mr. Davis, demanded
my acceptance, but I could not possibly make up my
mind to do so, and declined.</p>

          <p>In August Governor Brown received a letter from
General E. Kirby Smith at Chattanooga asking for
assistance. The Governor could offer only some
artillery harness and my services. He accepted both
and I was sent to Chattanooga.</p>
          <p>When I reached Chattanooga, General Kirby Smith
had gone to Knoxville, leaving General Henry Heth in
command: before the harness arrived, General Jno. P.
McCown took command and his brother, who was his
chief of artillery, took possession of the harness on his
arrival. Finding I could do nothing, either within my
own State or out of it, without a Confederate
commission, I so informed the Honorable Secretary of
War, in a most respectful letter: and in reply received a
commission as Colonel of Artillery in the provisional
army, with orders to report to General E. Kirby
Smith.</p>
          <p>I found the General completing his preparations for
an advance into Kentucky. Leaving General Carter
Stevenson's division of infantry, and Colonel Ben
Allston's Brigade of Cavalry to hold the Federals in
Cumberland Gap, he ordered General (then Colonel)
John H. Morgan with his division of cavalry to keep
well out towards the center of Tennessee and
Kentucky, and to meet him in Lexington on the second
day of September.</p>
          <pb id="boggs35" n="35"/>
          <p>General Kirby Smith's staff consisted of aide-de-camps,

          <p>Taking the route through Clinton and Jacksborough
we crossed the Cumberland mountains at Big Creek
Gap. At the “Clear Fork” of the Cumberland River we
were overtaken by General McCown, who, having
expressed a doubt as to the propriety of pushing on to
Barboursville, leaving a large force of Federals at the
gap in our rear, the afternoon was spent in debating the
question. McCown was the only other Major-General
in the command and had come up unexpectedly. We
persuaded General Kirby Smith that if McCown
remained and continued in the same spirit there was no
hope of success, and finally to order him back to the
command of Tennessee.</p>
          <p>We pushed on rapidly to Barboursville, so rapidly as
to surprise all the country, capture a few officers, and
some supplies. The country through which we had
come was intensely Union. Its young men, having to
choose between being conscripts or Union soldiers,
had enlisted in the Union army. Its elderly men, so
soon as they found out who we were, bushwhacked us
at every turn of the road. While waiting to hear from
or of General Bragg the troops were moved up the
Cumberland valley towards the gap.</p>
          <p>Not hearing from General Bragg, General Kirby
Smith decided to move on Lexington. When the troops
marched back down the valley they thought it was a
retreat, and marched in silence, with banners furled;
but when they turned north through Barboursville, flags
unfurled, drums beat and the rebel yell was distinctly
audible. One determined young woman stood upon a
balcony and waved the stars and stripes over us as we
passed. The soldiers cheered her. General
<pb id="boggs37" n="37"/>
Kirby Smith directed me to ride in advance with
Scott's cavalry, not only to keep him advised as to
what was going on in front, but also, should the
necessity arise, of settling a question of rank between
Generals Cleburn and Churchill.</p>
          <p>The afternoon before the battle of Richmond we
came suddenly upon the Federals in line of battle. It
was nearly sunset and we considered it advisable to
withdraw. When I reached Cleburn's brigade, which
was in advance, he was bivouacing it in line of battle. I
informed him of the disposition of the Federals and how
near they were to his front. P. P. Cleburn was one of
the very best officers in the southern army: he should
have commanded a corps: he was killed at Nashville.<ref id="ref33" n="33" rend="sc" target="note33" targOrder="U">5</ref>
Shortly after I left him the Federal Cavalry came
dashing down the road; the disposition of his troops
enabled him to give them a warm reception. From
there to headquarters I found that the soldiers had lain
down where they were halted and gone to sleep
without food. Reaching General Kirby Smith, he
informed me that he had given orders for the troops to
be put in motion before daybreak. I begged him not to,
told him the condition of his own troops, also that of the
Federals; that they were fresh and prepared to receive
him. I advised that the command be permitted to sleep
as long as they wished to, that they be permitted to
cook and enjoy their breakfast, for there was a hard
day's work before them. When he consented to do so,
instead of wakening some of the young men about
headquarters, he sent me to the various commands
with his change of orders. Thanks to
<note id="note33" n="33" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref33">5.  This officer was killed at the Battle of Franklin, in 1864.  -  (ED.)</note>
<pb id="boggs38" n="38"/>
the change, our soldiers went into the fight in splendid
condition and we whipped.</p>
          <p>General Cleburn, who opened the fight, sent word
that the Federals were moving heavy masses to his
right. General Kirby Smith directed me to investigate.
With Freret and a young engineer I rode too far to the
right and came out in the rear of the Federals. They
were in full retreat and seeing, as they thought, cavalry
in their rear, surrendered.</p>
          <p>Between the first and second fights a cloud of dust
indicated a large body of troops on our left. General
Kirby Smith sent me to see who they were. I found
Scott's cavalry who, having lost the road, had moved
towards the firing. I explained the situation and
directed him to move on rapidly and get between the
Federals and Lexington. This he accomplished so
successfully that he captured General M. D. Manson
and his staff and nearly all the Federal Army.</p>
          <p>During the afternoon General William Nelson,
known as “Bull Nelson,” formerly of the Navy and
afterwards killed by Jefferson C. Davis at Louisville,
took command, and forming a third line of battle just
south of Richmond, offered us battle. This was so
unexpected that General Smith and myself, riding
leisurely up the road in advance of the army, came
within short range before we were aware of it. Seeing
an officer gallop down the road, and hearing him
command to “bring on the cavalry,” I rode close up to
and along side of the fence, expecting them to come by
with a rush, and saw already our victory turned into a
rout. Had they come Sheridan's charge at Winchester
would have been a duplicate. They did
<pb id="boggs39" n="39"/>
not come, and we had time to get out of the road and
form line: then a single charge of the infantry, before
the artillery could be brought into action, drove them
through Richmond and on to Scott.<ref id="ref34" n="34" rend="sc" target="note34" targOrder="U">6</ref> The following day
we remained in Richmond equipping our men with
captured arms and ammunition (those that had armed
with smooth-bore muskets). The following day with a
small force of infantry, 107 all told, and 20 cavalrymen
for couriers, and Freret for company, I was sent in
advance. My orders were to push forward and to keep
General Kirby Smith advised. The Federals were on
the north bank of the Kentucky River. They retired
and permitted us to cross unmolested. I gave Freret
permission to worry them with the mounted men,
which he did, capturing a few prisoners. At
Todhunter's I was informed that a full and fresh
regiment of cavalry had just come out to cover the
retreat of the Federals and that my force was too
small and we would be captured.</p>
          <p>We went on until we came in sight of them in line of
battle. A thousand fresh cavalry, in new uniforms and
freshly mounted, in line of battle is a beautiful sight.
Not knowing how far I was ahead of the army I did
not see any more safety in going back than in
remaining. I sent a message to General Kirby Smith
and requested that he would send me a couple of
pieces of smooth-bore cannon. Whenever the
retreating troops would have retired sufficiently, the
cavalry would wheel about by companies and gallop
back to a new position. After a long time General
Kirby Smith
<note id="note34" n="34" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref34">6.  The date of the conflict at Richmond was August 30, 1862.  --  (ED.)</note>
<pb id="boggs40" n="40"/>
sent me a rifled cannon; we fired one shot at the
cavalry, but the next one stuck in the gun. Captain
Cunningham, one of General Smith's aides, came up
about this time. I showed him the Federal line, our
small force, and disabled gun; also I told him that there
was plenty of water just ahead for camping purposes,
but that I needed a few more troops and above all
some artillery. I heard nothing more from General
Smith, and after waiting until sunset I withdrew my
command. We went back nearly six miles before we
found our pickets and nearly two more before we
reached headquarters.</p>
          <p>As I approached headquarters I heard one soldier
ask another, “where those wagons were going?” He
replied, “that the train wagons were being emptied and
sent back to bring up Heth's division;” the first then
remarked, “that means retreat, for the Yanks could
reinforce faster than we could.”</p>
          <p>At headquarters I found a rather peculiar state of
affairs. A sudden halt had been ordered, the advance
drawn back to where I found it, all the wagons were
being unloaded and sent back to bring Heth's division.
A herald was being gotten ready to summon the
Federal commander, at the sound of a midnight bugle,
to evacuate Lexington or come outside of it, to fight. It
looked very much like a panic. There was no answer
to the bugle, and the herald rode into town without
being questioned. The Federal commander, C. C.
Gilbert, had also been seized with an uncertainty, and
while we were preparing the herald he was making hot
haste in another direction. I afterwards heard that
Gilbert received a brevet for skill in withdrawing
<pb id="boggs41" n="41"/>
his command; but when the circumstances became
better known, the brevet was revoked. We now found
that, if we had followed the Federals up closely, we
could have gone into Lexington the night before, and
have captured valuable supplies.</p>
          <p>Early in the morning of September the first, I rode
into Lexington with the advance guard, just one day
earlier than was fixed for General Morgan to report
there. Morgan came in on the next day. The town
seemed deserted; but at the front door of one house
there were a lot of ladies who appeared excited, and
were concealing something. Presuming it to be a
Confederate flag, I called them to let it wave; and they
did.</p>
          <p>The Federals being very much demoralized I had
presumed that we would push rapidly towards
Cincinnati. I was very much surprised when
headquarters were established at Lexington. I do not
know, but afterwards inferred, that it was done by the
advice of Dr. Sol Smith. I shall always regard this as
another of those grand opportunities lost.<ref id="ref35" n="35" rend="sc" target="note35" targOrder="U">7</ref>
</p>
          <p>The Federals at Cumberland Gap under General G.
W. Morgan finally abandoned it. When General Smith
heard of this, he went over to General Humphrey
Marshall's brigade, at Mount Sterling, for the purpose
of intercepting them: but we were too late. Marshall
had been sent from West Virginia across the
mountains to report to General Smith.</p>

positive orders not to go within the neck of land made
by the Ohio river, opposite to it. Heth found the whole
country in a panic and believed he could cross the river
and enter Ohio. He sent more than one messenger to
General Smith asking his permission to be allowed to
enter Covington. What a grand diversion in favor of
Generals Lee and Bragg it would have been!</p>
          <p>We soon learned that General Bragg had turned
Nashville and was upon General Buell's line of
communication, compelling Buell to follow him. Now
occurred one of General Bragg's peculiar movements.
He deliberately stepped to one side and let Buell pass
him with his, Buell's, whole flank open to his attack and
never molested him.</p>
          <p>General Kirby Smith received orders from General
Bragg to concentrate at Frankfort, as it was his,
General Bragg's, intention to inaugurate the
Confederate Governor there. The day before the
expected arrival of General Bragg and the future
Governor, General Kirby Smith formed his line of battle
on the west bank of the Kentucky river. After
inspecting his line he sent me to inspect the pickets. I
found our cavalry about a mile in front of our line but
no pickets, not even a sentinel. Colonel Scott promised
to send out pickets at once. Every one had had supper
when I got back. General Bragg and staff, the future
Governor, a number of prominent men, and many
ladies were at the hotel. The Governor was to be
inaugurated the next day at noon. General Bragg, with
great confidence, informed the ladies that they might
witness a
<pb id="boggs43" n="43"/>
battle the next day or, at the latest, the day after. His
army had not yet come up, but was in easy supporting
distance.</p>
          <p>Our right rested on a ravine; General Kirby Smith
was uneasy about this flank and had directed me to go
up this ravine early next morning, to move slowly, keep
a good look out, and if necessary send him messengers.
I started very early and was still moving away from our
line, when I heard the inauguration salute fired. From
the remarks of the escort it appeared that they were
recruits; upon enquiry, I found, to my anxiety, that
there was not an old soldier among them. As the
afternoon advanced, hearing nothing more and having
seen nothing, I returned to Frankfort. It was dark when
I crossed the bridge. As I crossed the Railroad, I saw a
train of passenger and box cars filled with people.
Seeing some ladies that I knew in one of the box cars, I
rode up and asked if it was the fear of the coming
battle that drove them away from the inauguration ball
that General Bragg had promised them. One of them
with much indignation asked me if this was any time for
trifling. I then noticed that some of them were in tears.
One pointing up the hill asked me what that meant; it
was the rear guard of a retreating army. Looking in the
other direction I saw the bridge that I had just crossed
was burning. I apologized, stating what I had been
doing all day. My negro man, Shadrick, coming up with
my extra horse, I told the ladies that so soon as I had
fed my horses and myself I would return and keep
them company until the train started. When Mrs.
Humphreys asked me where I proposed to get supper, I
could not say,
<pb id="boggs44" n="44"/>
but that with the prospect of an all-night ride I would
do my best. She insisted on getting out of the car and
taking me to the house of a friend. Having been
sumptuously fed we returned to the car. When the
train left, I left, to follow one of the most unnecessary
and disgraceful retreats recorded in history.<ref id="ref36" n="36" rend="sc" target="note36" targOrder="U">8</ref>
</p>
          <p>After waiting at Versailles a day General Kirby
Smith, taking me with him, rode down to General
Bragg's headquarters at Harrodsburg. The two armies
were now touching each other, forming together the
largest and best western army we had ever had, or
were likely again to have.</p>
          <p>We reached General Bragg's headquarters about
noon. He was surrounded by a large retinue of hangers
on, and it was hard to get a quiet interview. His
conversation and actions were unaccountable, they
were like those of a wild man. He gave General Kirby
Smith to understand that he did not need his army, that
with his own troops he could whip anything the
Federals could bring against him. General Smith
returned to Versailles completely at a loss what to do.
During the next morning he gave General Marshall
permission to return to Lexington and await events.
We tried to persuade him to do so also: but during the
afternoon the sound of battle in Bragg's direction
decided him to go at once to his assistance.</p>
          <p>While waiting on the train at Frankfort, I telegraphed
to Shropshire that, if he proposed to leave Kentucky
with our army he had better start, that I would share
my bed and board with him. He joined me the
afternoon that General Bragg was fighting
<note id="note36" n="36" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref36">8. The evacuation of Frankfort was on October 4, 1862.  -  (ED.)</note>
<pb id="boggs45" n="45"/>
the battle of Perryville, October 8th. My bed consisted
of a few blankets on the ground under a tree where we
were repeatedly roused, during the night, by couriers.
While sharing my breakfast next morning, served direct
from the cooking utensils, Shropshire asked, “Well,
Colonel, is this your bed?” “Yes!” “Is this your board?”
“Yes!” “Well! if you will not. feel hurt, I will go at once
to Knoxville.” I made no objections and when I saw
him again, it was at Knoxville.</p>
          <p>Without orders and unsolicited, General Kirby Smith
moved his army to the assistance of General Bragg.
When we reached Harrodsburg, General J. M.
Withers' command was all that we found of General
Bragg's army; the remainder were in retreat to camp
Dick Robinson. General Smith bivouaced his army in
line of battle, and then asked me to find a place for
headquarters. I found a comfortable house, a short
distance in front of his line, which had been abandoned
in hot haste. Overcoming his objection to being in front
of his line we were not only most comfortable for the
night but were a protection to the property. Our escort
and couriers now consisting of a company of
Georgians commanded by Captain Nelson, posted a
few sentinels between us and the Federals. About dusk
I was sent with orders to General Withers: while tying
my horse on the lawn in front of his quarters, I was
ordered, most peremptorily and brusquely, to untie my
horse and take him off the lawn. Instead of so doing I
walked up to General J. M. Withers, whom I had
recognized, and remarking, “there are orders from
General Smith which I could not deliver without
<pb id="boggs46" n="46"/>
tieing my horse!” I bade him good evening and
without further ceremony mounted and left him.</p>
          <p>When General Smith rode to Harrodsburg the day
before the battle of Perryville, we met Major General
Frank Gardner's division in the road. The two armies
were then touching each other. The day following,
during the afternoon of which the battle was fought,
the two armies were getting further apart and
Humphry Marshall with his brigade had started for
Lexington. The next day General Smith was hurrying
to General Bragg's assistance, and General Bragg was
running away to Camp Dick Robinson.</p>
          <p>The following day I was given half a dozen mounted
men and orders to burn certain bridges after all the
troops had passed, and then to ride with the rear guard.
General Duncan, who commanded the rear brigade,
was an old acquaintance, and we rode along together
very sociably. We first noticed some cavalry to the
south, moving parallel with us. As we made out some
blue overcoats among them, it was determined to
ascertain who they were. It turned out to be Allston's
brigade, having among them some captured overcoats.
Presently one of General Smith's aides spoke to
General Duncan. Duncan referred him to me as
representing General Smith. It was concerning this
same cavalry that he was enquiring. I told Captain
Cunningham to inform General Smith who commanded
the rear guard, and that nothing could be more
satisfactory. Again and again would General Smith
send back, and finally came back himself, Duncan
remarking to me, “The commanding General having
taken command of the rear guard he, Duncan,
<pb id="boggs47" n="47"/>
would ride at the head of his brigade.” Putting spurs to
his horse he proceeded to do so.</p>
          <p>That afternoon the two armies were, for the first
time, together at camp Dick Robinson.<ref id="ref37" n="37" rend="sc" target="note37" targOrder="U">9</ref>
</p>
          <p>Late in the afternoon General Smith ordered me to
go back to the river (Dicks River) and if possible to
gather some men and tools, and obstruct the crossing.
Both banks were high bluffs and the road on both sides
was a long ramp cut from the banks. When I reached
the river I found Robinson's battery unlimbered, with
the men at their posts ready for action. Robinson was a
West Pointer, being a native of Texas and having
straight dark hair he was nicknamed “Comanche,” and
had served with me at Pensacola. He called to know
where I was going. He then told me that the Federal
skirmishers were already on the other bank of the
river, firing from behind trees at anyone they could get
a shot at, and that he was only waiting for them to
appear in force to open with his battery. While I
agreed with Robinson, that it was too late to obstruct
the road, I did not like to go back without making a
personal investigation. Leaving my horse with him I
walked to the bank, and avoiding the road, on down to
the river. There were some ten or more of our men at
the river filling canteens. Returning just behind a soldier
loaded with canteens, he fell at the same instant that I
heard a musket shot. I thought that he was shot, and
for a moment so did he; finding himself unhurt, he
picked himself up and looking around remarked “It was
that durned old root and I
<note id="note37" n="37" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref37">9.  The battle of Perryville was fought Oct. 8, 1862; Kirby Smith
joined Bragg at Camp Dick Robinson Oct. 11.  -  (ED.)</note>
<pb id="boggs48" n="48"/>
thought it was a bullet.” Fortunately it was getting dark.
Having gotten my horse I returned to camp. Robinson
became a Brigadier before the close of the war.</p>
          <p>On the following day there was a grand council of war; it
lasted several hours and resulted in a most disgraceful
retreat. General Bragg started immediately, by the way of
Crab Orchard, and never stopped until he reached
Richmond.</p>
          <p>General Smith returned by the way of Big Hill. When we
reached the foot of the hill, we found that all of the captured
and many other wagons had been turned upon our road.
Forty-five miles of wagons on our road in order that the
retreat of Bragg's army should not be impeded! When
General Smith became aware of it, General Bragg was out of
reach, and his army rapidly becoming so, leaving our entire
flank exposed to attack. He at once sent a messenger to
General Polk explaining the situation. General Wheeler was
ordered to keep upon our flank.</p>
          <p>Polignac and myself were ordered to the foot of the hill
with instructions to pack all wagons that were not loaded
with supplies. Here we found a most disgraceful state of
affairs, many wagons being loaded with dry goods, shoes,
trimmings and trumpery of all kinds. The headquarter
wagons of one Major General, accompanied by his
quartermaster, were already going up the hill. Two days
afterwards this Major General came into our bivouac while
we were eating a hearty breakfast; in his hand and pockets
he carried parched corn. He remarked how well we fared, but
that he had had nothing but parched corn for two days. 
I did not ask him where his headquarter wagons were.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>Arrived at Knoxville, General Smith received instructions
to come to Richmond. Before leaving he directed me to go to
Cumberland Gap for the purpose of ascertaining if it could
be fortified. East Tennessee was intensely Union and it was
very unsafe to go a few miles without an escort. With Freret
for a companion, and an escort of ten men detailed from an
East Tennessee cavalry regiment, and a full company to
meet me at Clinton, we set out by the way of Clinton and
Powell's river. During the first morning we met General
Churchill and staff. He advised me take some other route as
there was nothing left on that road.</p>
          <p>All of my escort being natives of that region, knew where
to find food and forage. Nearly every night found us near
the homes of some of my escort; they would get permission
to spend a night at home and being supplied with money for
the purpose would always bring in supplies when they
returned. One morning a liberal supply of eggs, milk and
apple brandy were brought in; the weather was cold, and
that night, borrowing a large bowl from a neighboring
house, I got Freret to concoct what is called in Louisiana hot
egg-nog. Taking out our share I sent the sergeant
<pb id="boggs50" n="50"/>
with the remainder to the men. I heard one of the men
as he sipped it say, “If that is the sort of truck the
Colonel makes out'n eggs, milk and apple-jack, he was
bound to have it every night on this trip.”</p>
          <p>We arrived at the Gap in a snow storm: leaving the
men to pitch camp in as sheltered a place as we could
find, I went to pay my respects to General W. G. M.
Davis of Florida, the commanding officer.</p>
          <p>While with him his servant announced dinner: with
an apology for his meager fare, the General invited us
down. I told the General that we had ordered a dinner
of mutton chops and mushrooms and unless he could
improve on that he had better dine with us.</p>
          <p>“Mutton chops and mushrooms! Are you joking?”</p>
          <p>“No, put on your overcoat and come along.”</p>
          <p>We dined out of doors in a snow storm; but the
dinner was served “hot and hot.”</p>
          <p>To fortify Cumberland Gap would be a difficult,
expensive and useless labor. It is isolated, can be easily
flanked, as we had already proven, and easily carried
by assault. To prevent the last, I recommended Cohorn
mortars or hand grenades.</p>
          <p>On my return to Knoxville, General Smith informed
me that the object of his call to Richmond was Mr.
Davis' desire for a personal interview; that he had
consented, upon Mr. Davis' urgent solicitation, to
continue to serve under General Bragg for the present.</p>
          <p>In the recent campaign General Bragg had proved
himself unfit for a high command. When General
Smith found himself deserted by him, he told me that
on no conditions would he consider to serve under him
again. But General Bragg was retained in command
<pb id="boggs51" n="51"/>
and Murfreesboro and Missionary Ridge are lasting
monuments to Mr. Davis' will power.</p>
          <p>General Smith brought me my commission as
Brigadier General.<ref id="ref38" n="38" rend="sc" target="note38" targOrder="U">1</ref> He told me Mr. Davis objected on
the grounds that my services were needed on the staff
and that the administration of the army was being
destroyed by personal ambition. General Smith called
his attention to the fact that my being a general officer
need not prevent my being on staff duty; but on the
contrary that, if I was to remain with him, he preferred
that I should be his chief-of-staff with the additional
rank, and would promise for me that I should not ask for
a command. This fixed my rank and place for the war.</p>
          <p>There being no immediate urgent demand for my
services I went, on leave of absence, to pass the
Christmas holidays with my family. While being feasted
and made much of, I received orders to meet General
Smith at Chattanooga on his way to take part in
General Bragg's new campaign. When I reached there
I found orders to return to Knoxville and make
preparations to move headquarters across the
Mississippi River. I do not know by what lucky chance
the transportation of our headquarters was placed in
charge of Major Ezell, quartermaster. I had known the
Major at Pensacola, he was then a private in the first
Georgia, and on account of his many splendid qualities
was of inestimable value to me.</p>
          <p>Everything having been provided for the move, I
<note id="note38" n="38" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref38">1. The date of appointment was Nov. 4, 1862.  -  (ED.)</note>
<pb id="boggs52" n="52"/>
went to Milledgeville for my family.<ref id="ref39" n="39" rend="sc" target="note39" targOrder="U">2</ref> At Atlanta we
met General Smith and the following named members
of his staff, to-wit: Captains Cunningham and E.
Walworth, aides-de-camp; Col. J. F. Belton and
Captain H. P. Pratt, adjutants general; Captain Meem,
signal officer; Col. John M. Brown, chief of ordnance
and artillery; Major Thomas, commissary, and Freret
now captain of engineers. Major Ezell, quartermaster,
was in charge of the transportation train and Dr. Sol
Smith, surgeon, whose residence was at Alexandria
La., had gone on before.</p>
          <p>At Montgomery the party separated, General Smith
with a few officers and his family going to Mobile by
rail, some of the young officers with Walworth by the
way of his home on the Mississippi River, the
remainder with me by boat to Mobile. My brother
Robert, my aide-de-camp, joined me at Mobile. Our
route was then by the way of Meridien to Jackson.
The quartermaster at Jackson was profuse in his
attentions, and having assured me that the necessary
transportation had been provided, I went on to Osyka.
When I reached there it looked as if the
aforementioned quartermaster had been anxious to get
us away. There
<note id="note39" n="39" place="ref39" anchored="yes">2.  My daughter Bessie, then in her fifth year, was with my
parents in Augusta, where she had been spending the holidays. My
mother brought her to Milledgeville and went with us as far as
Atlanta.  Our parting with her there was for the last time on
Earth, for after the sacking of Columbia by Sherman's army, she
overtasked her strength in gathering food and supplies for those
distressed people, sickened and died.
<lb/>
Sherman denies the destruction of Columbia by his army and it
may be so: but in the winter of '66 and '67 I had occasion to
visit that lower part of South Carolina bordering the Savannah
river and the line of railway between Charleston and Savannah.
The imagination can not take in the extent of the wanton
and malicious destruction of property of all kinds; which it can
not be denied was done by his army; and which could not have
been done, had he any desire to prevent it.</note>
<pb id="boggs53" n="53"/>
had been no transportation provided, not even a
message that we were coming and would require it.
After much labor we succeeded in transporting
ourselves and supplies to Clinton, Louisiana. There I
learned that two Federal gun boats had passed
Vicksburg and were patrolling the river directly on our
route. I went to Port Hudson to make inquiries. Major
General Frank Gardner, the commanding officer,
advised me not to attempt to proceed, but to wait until a
boat they were protecting with cotton bales should
preceed us. Leaving my family at Clinton, I moved the
headquarter outfit to Port Hudson and put it aboard a
boat to await our opportunity. When the time
approached for the completion of the cotton-bale
gunboat I moved my family down, We followed the
gunboat, but our Captain stopped at so many places to
take on sugar and molasses that it was soon out of
sight and hearing. Coasting along the west bank and
occasionally making enquiries, it was not until we
entered the mouth of Red River that we felt
comparatively safe. A few miles inside the mouth of
the river there is an island, made by the present river
and an old bed of the river. We were steaming up the
north side of this island feeling very comfortable when
we noticed a dense smoke from a steamer moving up
the other side of the island. Starting up so suddenly and
moving so rapidly we inferred that it was a Federal gun
boat waiting for just such an opportunity. It was now a
question of speed and we made all we could. We
reached the head of the island first but not sufficiently
far to have been out of reach of shot and were very
glad to find we had been running a race with one
<pb id="boggs54" n="54"/>
of our own transports from the Atchafalaya Bayou.
On our way up the river we met the Steamer <hi rend="italics">Webb</hi> on
her way to attack the <hi rend="italics">Indianola</hi>. The <hi rend="italics">Webb</hi> was an
ocean steamer, she was unarmored but very fast. We
also passed the Federal gun boat <hi rend="italics">Queen of the West</hi>;
which having ventured up Red River, had been
abandoned by her crew, after being disabled by a
battery of small guns. She accompanied the <hi rend="italics">Webb</hi>.<ref id="ref40" n="40" rend="sc" target="note40" targOrder="U">3</ref>
</p>
          <p>Arrived at Alexandria I reported to General Dick
Taylor. General Taylor sent his own headquarter boat
to Port Hudson for General Smith. The river being
now open, General Smith was soon at Alexandria.</p>
          <p>When General Smith went to interview General
Taylor he took me with him. He told General Taylor of
Mr. Davis' anxiety about Vicksburg and his desires
that something should be done on our side of the river.
General Taylor asked General Smith to give him, at
once, another brigade for that duty, and to order me to
report to him to command it  -  stating that General A.
G. Blanchard, who was in that district, made his
headquarters at Monroe, and was too old for active
service near the river. General Smith stated that he
could not possibly spare me, but that he was going at
once to Little Rock, and under positive instructions
from Mr. Davis, would send General George Walker's
division of Texas troops to Milliken Bend.</p>
          <p>About that time there arrived at headquarters two
men who claimed to be sympathizers, and who had
brought through the lines two bladders of quinine, as a
pledge of good faith. Coming at that particular crisis, I
was suspicious and expressed my doubts to General
<note id="note40" n="40" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref40">3.  The date of the conflict referred to was Feb. 24, 1863.  -  (ED.)</note>
<pb id="boggs55" n="55"/>
Smith. I was very much surprised when I found them
on the same boat that was to take us to Camden, <hi rend="italics">en
route</hi> for Little Rock, and still more so when General
Smith gave them permission to get off at Monroe and
visit our lines opposite Vicksburg. One of them
afterwards came to Little Rock, took down many
orders from various persons for gew-gaws and
jimcracks, and with a pass from General Smith,
returned north through our lines. With his
memorandum book open he came to know what he
could bring me on his next trip. I not only declined to
take advantage of his kindness, but did all I could to
have him arrested. The other never returned from
opposite Vicksburg, and I have no doubt made his way
to the nearest Federal outpost with information worth
many bladders of quinine.</p>
          <p>On the road from Camden to Little Rock we passed
many nominal deserters; these, I thought, ought to be
detained for several months at least; their desertion
was entirely too systematic; but they were permitted to
go on through the lines.</p>
          <p>While riding with General Smith between Camden
and Little Rock, he informed me that Mr. Davis was
very much annoyed with the manner in which General
T. H. Holmes had been conducting the department;
that he had centered his thoughts and ideas on
Arkansas alone, keeping the largest and best body of
his troops centered about Little Rock, and leaving the
rest of the department to take care of itself; that he,
General Smith, would send Walker's division to
northern Louisiana, with orders to report to General
Taylor, and might send others troops there also. I was
not
<pb id="boggs56" n="56"/>
present at the interviews between Generals Smith and
Holmes, and can not say what occurred; but Walker's
division was not sent at once to Louisiana. General
Smith seemed to have fallen under the same influences
as General Holmes had done.</p>
          <p>After inspecting the troops at Pine Bluff, (two
divisions that at that instant were needed, and Mr.
Davis had expected to be opposite Vicksburg), and
spending some time at Little Rock we started on our
return to Alexandria. During the first afternoon we
were overtaken by a terrific storm and no shelter in
sight. When night came on, we could not see the road
and no doubt passed some unseen houses: fortunately
some one opened a door to look out at the weather. We
rode up and asked for shelter. It was a small house with
limited accommodations and no men at home. An old
lady, the grandmother, said she could not turn any one
away such a night as that and would do the best she
could. The head of the family was absent on business,
the son and son-in-law in the army. The family
consisted of the old lady, her daughter and daughter-in-law, 
three grand children, and an adopted child. The
house was a one room, storey and a half log cabin, a
one storey shed for the loom and a similar shed for
kitchen and eating room. Everything was deliciously
clean and such a contrast to the house we stopped at, in
that neighborhood, on our way to Little Rock. That one
was an unfinished two frame, belonging to a doctor,
who had his Philadelphia diploma. We had found him
sitting on his porch, heels on rails and smoking his pipe,
while his daughters and grand-daughters
<pb id="boggs57" n="57"/>
were ploughing in the field, and one of them had to be
called to get dinner for us.<ref id="ref41" n="41" rend="sc" target="note41" targOrder="U">4</ref>
</p>
          <p>There was no system of communication between the
different district headquarters; so that it was not until
we reached Monroe that we learned that Grant was
passing down on our side, and investing Vicksburg on
the lower side; and that Banks was threatening
Alexandria to cover his investment of Port Hudson.
We were advised not to take our boat down to and up
Red River, but as the waters were high, to take an old
river bed, called False River, which would land us eight
miles north of Alexandria. A messenger was now sent
back to order Walker's division to Milliken Bend.
When he did get there the Federals were so well
fortified that he could not dislodge them.</p>
          <p>At our first interview with General Taylor he had
suggested that Shreveport, being the geographical
center of the department, would be the most suitable
place for department headquarters, but General Smith
did not seem to consider the proposal favorably,
maybe through Dr. Smith's influence.<ref id="ref42" n="42" rend="sc" target="note42" targOrder="U">5</ref> I was now sent
up there to look into the matter. Within forty-eight
hours after my return we were afflicted with a genuine
stampede. Banks commenced to threaten Alexandria
in force, and everything movable was put on
steamboats and hurried off to Shreveport. General
Smith had now no choice but to make his headquarters
at Shreveport.<ref id="ref43" n="43" rend="sc" target="note43" targOrder="U">6</ref> We had the greatest difficulty in
obtaining accommodations 
<note id="note41" n="41" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref41">4.  On my return to Alexandria I found that General Mason Graham
had taken my wife and the children out to his plantation on Bayou

of any sort, so much so as to give the
appearance of a desire to prevent headquarters being
established there. The town was full of men, some
wearing uniforms and some not. For the purpose of
ascertaining the cause and also of providing more room,
I published an order requiring all officers and men in
Shreveport and the surrounding country to report at
headquarters, register their names, rank, and by what
authority they were there. My recollection is that in
addition to the post officers but two reported. I then
sent for the post commandant and directed him to send
a patrol, consisting of one commissioned, two non-commissioned 
officers, and ten privates through the
streets with orders to arrest every man they met,
whatever his apparent rank might be, and require him
to show his orders. After that day there were but few
officers or soldiers to be seen upon the streets and we
soon had ample accommodations.</p>
          <p>I had found a cousin of my mother's, George
Calhoun, living there; on our arrival he crowded us into
his own small house. A few days after I moved my
family across the river to a Mrs. Cane's. Mrs. Cane
had a large plantation, large house and a large number
of slaves. I had taken the precaution to call on her and
ascertain if she was willing to take us as boarders. She
seemed willing and fixed her own terms. She treated
my wife most rudely from the moment we arrived; had
it not been dark I should have moved back at once, and
did next day. I never imagined that a woman could be
so contemptible.</p>
          <p>A desperate character by the name of Hope,
confined in jail, sent for me and offered me his house
and
<pb id="boggs59" n="59"/>
servants, upon the sole condition that I would take care
of them: we remained there until he was released from
jail. I then rented a house three miles in the country;
but before the end of the year Mr. Duke Tally very
kindly offered me the use of his house and furniture in
town. When Mr. Tally sold his house Mr. Hunnisucker
was equally kind.</p>
          <p>When we had become acquainted with the citizens
proper, we found them hospitable, social and kind. Our
life there was, in all respects, most agreeable.</p>
          <p>At Little Rock there was a department staff, among
whom were Colonel Sam Anderson, Adjutant General;
Colonel Blair, Chief Commissary; Major Thomas G.
Rhett, Chief of Ordnance; and Dr. Hayden, Medical
Director. These officers had been ordered to those
duties by special order of the War Department and
objected to being placed in subordinate positions except
by the same authority. The position assumed by them,
interfering with General Smith's intentions with
reference to Dr. Sol Smith, his surgeon, and Major
Thomas, his commissary, he created the Bureaus of
Commissariat and Medicine, with Blair and Hayden as
their respective heads. Anderson and Rhett were
ordered to Shreveport, one as Adjutant General, and
the other as Chief of Ordnance. Colonel Ben. Allston
whom we had been compelled to leave in Kentucky on
account of wounds he had received at the head of his
brigade, upon being exchanged, finding his brigade had
been given to another, asked for and received orders to
join us, bringing with him Major Wright Schaumburg,
formerly of General Little's staff. Captain P. H.
Thompson of the First Louisiana Regulars, 
<pb id="boggs60" n="60"/>
having been thrown out by the consolidation of his
command, asked for and was ordered to us as an
assistant adjutant general. And it was not very long
before Generals Huger and Magruder, Colonel
Clemson of the nitre and mining bureau, Colonel
O'Bannon, quartermaster, Major Ducayet,
quartermaster, Major Douglas, engineer corps, and Dr.
Yandel, surgeon, were ordered to our headquarters
from Richmond.</p>
          <p>The working staff of the department was
constituted as follows:</p>
          <p>Captains Cunningham and Walworth, aides-de-camp. 
Capt. Meem, signal officer, also the most
trusted aide. Three most accomplished and
unexceptional gentlemen in every respect.</p>
          <p>Colonel Belton, assistant adjutant general,
thoroughly competent. His desk was in General
Smith's private office and his duties for the most part
confidential.</p>
          <p>Dr. Sol Smith, surgeon and confidential adviser. He
was a man of immense frame and immense intellect:
but indolent and selfish. He was undoubtedly very fond
of General Smith and endeavored to serve him to his,
General Smith's, advancement and glory. But the
Doctor having gotten back among his own people (he
belonged to Alexandria) was influenced by his local
relations to such an extent that his advice was not
always beneficial.</p>
          <p>Dr. Yandel, another fine specimen of physical and
mental ability, was also a part of General Smith's
household. He had no special duties but accompanied
him in the field. It was concerning him that Mr. Davis
wrote to General Smith that he had not sent him to
the department for promotion, but because he,
<pb id="boggs61" n="61"/>
the Doctor, was personally obnoxious to him, Mr.
Davis.</p>
          <p>The following were at the head of the bureaus:</p>
          <p>Of Ordnance, General Huger. General Huger had
been a distinguished officer in the Mexican war, where
he had served on the staff of General Scott. He was
the inspector of Ordnance at foundries when the
difficulties began and it was as his assistant that I was
serving at Pittsburg. Both he and General Magruder
made some great blunders during the seven days fight
around Richmond and were relieved from their
commands. General Huger never again had a
command, and I think General Smith made a great
mistake when he gave Magruder one.</p>
          <p>At the head of Quartermasters, Colonel O'Bannon.
O'Bannon went to the Mexican war as a sergeant in
the Edgefield Company, Palmetto Regiment. He was
promoted into the regular army of the United States for
distinguished personal courage in assaulting the breach
at Molino del Rey. A man of ability and energy, he had
no superior for the special duty to which he was
assigned. The same O'Bannon whom Mr. Mallory
wished to supply with a clerk. He was scarcely warm
in his seat when an exempt on account of a civil office
called upon him and invited him to dinner. After a short
time the same person informed him that he had just
received a barrel of whiskey and would be pleased to
fill the Colonel's jug if he would send it round.
O'Bannon sent his jug, at the same time informing his
clerk that “that man wants something.” On the morning
of the grand review he drove to O'Bannon's office
behind a fine double team
<pb id="boggs62" n="62"/>
and informing O'Bannon that his wife being ill he would
be pleased to give O'Bannon a seat to the review. As
he turned to follow him, he whispered to his clerk “that
he hadn't a doubt but that man wanted something.” It
was not long before the same person called again. He
informed O'Bannon that the elections were about to
take place and the indications were against his re-election. 
O'Bannon expressed his regrets that so polite
an official should be turned out of an office he filled so
hospitably. He then informed O'Bannon that he was not
fit for service in the field; O'Bannon did not know about
that, but thought a musket would fit his shoulder
beautifully. The end of it all was that he asked
O'Bannon to take him in his office. O'Bannon
acknowledged having accepted his other invitations but
declined this one with thanks. The next morning while
his exemption papers were still good this person
started for the Rio Grande behind his fine team and
was not seen in those parts any more until the close of
the war.</p>
          <p>Just before Banks' raid up Red River the captain of
one of the steamboats called at O'Bannon's office and
informed him that he had been ordered down the river
after a load of corn but that his steamboat was disabled
and he could not make good time, etc. O'Bannon
thanked him for the information, saying, “Captain, you
gentlemen seem to think that whenever we select your
boat that it is a personal spite or favor to some other
person. Your statement that your boat is disabled
relieves me from a very disagreeable duty, for I have
just received an order from General Smith to select the
least serviceable boat and
<pb id="boggs63" n="63"/>
sink it in the mouth of Tone's Bayou. Since you tell me
that your boat is unserviceable I will of course take it.
You had better remove the furniture and whatever you
can, for I shall take your boat down in the morning and
sink her.” The captain left in a hurry and started for
the wharf. In a few minutes the blackest kind of
smoke was pouring out of the chimneys and within half
an hour she had backed out into the stream and started
down the river. When she returned she was loaded to
the guards with corn.</p>
          <p>During the fall of '64 and winter of '64 and '65 our
department became very much demoralized by an
order issued at Richmond, authorizing a limited
contraband trade in cotton, with the Federals. This
infamous authority was not intended for our
department; but much to the discredit of some high in
rank, advantage was taken of it. It was upon one of the
papers connected with this traffic, that I saw an
endorsement in President Lincoln's own hand, over his
own signature. So manly and so decided was this
endorsement, that it rendered the paper itself and the
action of our authorities contemptible. A merchant of
Shreveport, I think his name was Jacobs, called on
Colonel O'Bannon and expressed a wish to take out a
load of cotton and bring back goods. He showed
O'Bannon what enormous profits there would be, and
which he would divide with O'Bannon if he would get
him a permit. After permitting Mr. Jacobs to commit
himself as to the amount of money to be made on the
cotton, O'Bannon suggested that Mr. Jacobs might not
return. Jacobs offered to give security and finally
proposed to deposit with O'Bannon quite a large sum
<pb id="boggs64" n="64"/>
of ready money as security: or in plain language to pay
O'Bannon so much, cash down, for the permit
O'Bannon locked the door leading from his office, then
opened the one to his clerks and requested them to
come in. He then requested Mr. Jacobs to repeat his
offer. Mr. Jacobs declined, insisting that his interview
had been confidential. O'Bannon repeated it; then
opening his outside door kicked Mr. Jacobs out of the
room and to the head of the steps.<ref id="ref44" n="44" rend="sc" target="note44" targOrder="U">7</ref> Since the war,
during the yellow fever epidemic at Memphis,
O'Bannon stuck to his post and worked unceasingly to
improve the sanitary condition of the town. Such was
the man at the head of our Quartermasters
Department.</p>
          <p>Colonel Blair, at the head of the Commissary
Bureau, was a gentlemen of the old school; had
acquired name and fame in the United States Army;
and was considered to be the very best fitted, of all
others, to be Commissary General of the Confederate
States Army.</p>
          <p>Dr. Hayden, <hi rend="italics">sans peur et sans reproche</hi>, at the
head of the Medical Bureau, was a man of magnificent
physique and incomparable intellect. In connection with
this bureau was a pharmaceutical laboratory in charge
of Dr. Smith of New Orleans. This Dr. Smith was a
son of General Percifer F. Smith of Mexican war fame
and was a most accomplished gentleman.</p>
          <p>At department headquarters there was myself, as
chief of staff. In the Adjutant General's Department,
Colonel Sam Anderson, recently of the United States
Artillery. He served through the Mexican war
<note id="note44" n="44" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref44">7. On cotton speculation, see Appendix, Commentary VII, page 109.  -  
(ED.)</note>
<pb id="boggs65" n="65"/>
and was breveted for distinguished conduct. A most
accomplished and competent officer. Major Williamson
of Louisiana had already earned distinction in the army
east of the river. Having been a lawyer of standing, all
affairs relating to courts martial and civil rights in the
districts of Louisiana and Arkansas, were referred to
him. Captain West occupied a similar position with
reference to the district of Texas. Captain Pratt had
charge of the clerk's office. Inspector Generals
Colonel Ben. Allston and Major Wright Schaumburg;
both unexceptional.</p>
          <p>Major Minter had been especially ordered from
Texas, by General Smith, to be his chief quartermaster,
and proved to be one of the most competent officers.
When General Smith sent him to Europe, Major Gary
was ordered to take his place. He was an excellent
officer but was unable to take in the extent of his
duties.</p>
          <p>Major Thomas was still his chief commissary, and
was considered by General Smith a most excellent
one. I never doubted the sincerity of his opinion for he
could not have had any other reason for placing him in
so responsible a position. As an individual there could
be no objection; but as chief commissary he was
entirely out of place; he had neither the education or
ability to take in the work of the department. For
example, I received a letter from General Taylor
complaining, that in a department capable of supplying
Europe with beef, his district had received scarcely
enough to supply his hospitals. I referred this letter to
Major Thomas. He returned it covered with an
endorsement, giving the number and weight of the cattle 
<pb id="boggs66" n="66"/>
he had sent to the district in a given time, and, as he
said, to show me that the General had been
misinformed. I placed the paper on my private file until
the Major, as I was sure he would, should ask for it.
When he enquired to know about it I sent him for his
rosters. From them it was easy to figure how much
meat was required for the hospitals. And it was not until
he had divided the amount of beef sent by the days for
which it was sent that he realized the justness of
General Taylor's complaint. On another occasion a
regiment had been ordered to build a road through a
swamp on the north side of the river and within a few
miles of headquarters. The Colonel commanding applied
in person for rations of whisky as a prophylactic. Coffee
had long since ceased to be a ration; but we had a good
supply in store at our commissary headquarters for just
such emergencies. When I offered it in place of
whiskey the Colonel was delighted with the prospect. I
gave him a written order on Major Thomas for ten
thousand rations of coffee, stating in the order the
purpose for which it was issued. After ten days the
Colonel reported the road completed and that he was
ready to return to his brigade. When I asked him how
his men enjoyed the coffee he informed me that they
had not received it yet. I invited him to take a seat and
sent for Major Thomas. When asked for an explanation,
he informed me that the requisitions had not been
returned. When I wanted to know what requisitions and
from whom they were to be returned, it appeared that
he had had his clerk make out duplicate requisitions;
these he had sent to the headquarters of the district, to
be sent to
<pb id="boggs67" n="67"/>
his divisions, thence to his brigade, thence to his
regiment and finally to come all the way back through
the same channels again. I asked the Major if he did
not recognize General Smith's right to give him, his
chief commissary, a special order. He could not be
made to understand that he had not done exactly right.</p>
          <p>When we first came to the department Captain
Freret was our only engineer officer; afterwards
Colonel Douglas, a splendid specimen of youthful
manhood, was ordered to us.</p>
          <p>Colonel Brown, chief of artillery, came with us from
Tennessee. He had seen service in the United States
Army.</p>
          <p>Major Rhett, also of the United States Army, was
chief of ordnance. He was a man of grand physique,
spirit and capacity. He could see no wrong in one he
liked and no good in one he disliked. He afterwards
served in the army of the Khedive and died shortly
after his return to America. For an assistant he had
Captain Green, of St. Louis, a most elegant and
accomplished gentleman.</p>
          <p>Major Carr, chief paymaster, was a native of
Louisiana; but had not been there since the beginning
of the Mexican war, until ordered there from
Richmond. He was a whole-soured, cultivated
gentleman. When in New Orleans, shortly after the
surrender, a nephew of his was finding fault with the
conduct of the war: the Major asked him if he had
been in the Federal army; he replied with some
surprise that he had not; he then asked him if he had
been in the Confederate army and upon his saying that
he had not, advised him never to talk about the war.
On another occasion, after listening 
<pb id="boggs68" n="68"/>
patiently to another after-the-war warrior, he told
him that he fully agreed with him and could inform him
that the only obstacle was the want of ten thousand
more men; and that from what he had seen since he
arrived he was satisfied that there were at least that
many able bodied men lying idle in New Orleans at
that time.</p>
          <p>Major Ezell, quartermaster, had charge of
everything relating to that department connected with
headquarters. He was unexceptionable. Doctor Catlett
of St. Joseph, <sic>Misouri</sic>, was our medical purveyor. He
came with us from Tennessee and was most
competent.</p>
          <p>Colonel Clemsen, who represented the Nitre and
Mining Bureau, was an elderly man, full of scientific
attainments; but most impracticable. His duties were
light.</p>
          <p>Captain P. H. Thompson, of the First Louisiana
Regulars, acting assistant adjutant general, and my
brother Robert, I considered as belonging to my own
personal staff.</p>
          <p>These were the gentlemen with whom I was in
intimate official and social relations for a little more
than two years and I often wonder how it happened
that there should have gotten together so many men of
such distinguished physical, mental, moral and social
characteristics. Some of them had become obnoxious
to Mr. Davis on account of their independence of
character, others were in the way, on account of their
well known abilities and reputations, and the Trans-Mississippi 
was a little out of the way.</p>
          <p>Finding the communication with the district headquarters 
<pb id="boggs69" n="69"/>
very irregular and uncertain I determined to
establish lines of couriers to them. In order to avoid
taking able bodied men from the army I suggested to
General Smith that we enlist six companies of boys,
between thirteen and fifteen years of age. These boys
were to be enlisted, with the consent of their parents,
with the same pay and allowances as cavalrymen and
to be officered by some of those already in service but
those regiments having been consolidated were
unattached. The plan having been approved by General
Smith, I sent for Major Bird, of Baton Rouge,
Louisiana, and having explained it to him offered him
the command. With his assistance the other officers
were appointed, and the enlistments begun. We met
with no opposition and soon had our lines established.
It was arranged that while three of the companies
were on duty the other three should be in camp for rest
and instruction. The command was well officered and
worked most satisfactorily until the end of the war.</p>
          <p>In the meantime General Holmes was arranging for
an attack on Helena, as a diversion in favor of
Vicksburg. I presume that it was on this account that
General Smith had delayed ordering the Texas troops
to Louisiana. It was not until July the fourth that
General Holmes was ready and made this attack and
on that day General Pemberton surrendered
Vicksburg. This diversion diverted the principal
purpose for which General Smith had been sent to the
department. After this attack General Holmes crossed
the river and Major General Price succeeded to the
commend. 
<pb id="boggs70" n="70"/>
That was the last of active operations in this
district until the following spring.</p>
          <p>General Dick Taylor was eternally vigilant; he never
missed an opportunity of annoying Banks, attacking
and capturing outposts and threatening his
communications.</p>
          <p>Early in June my friend and kinsman, George
Calhoun, came to inform me that he had sold all his
property in Shreveport and bought a plantation on Red
River and was about to take his family to South
Carolina, from whence he proposed to bring back
negroes to work his plantation. Finding that he was in
earnest I took him into a private office, where I told
him that if he intended to take his family across the
river he had no time to lose, for it was my private
judgment, never before expressed to anyone and not to
be repeated by him, that Vicksburg would soon be in
the hands of the Federals. He turned ashy. I went
further and asked him if he supposed he would ever
work a slave after the close of the war. He replied that
if he could not in this country he would go to one in
which he could. I advised, that if such were his
feelings, not to go to Carolina at all; but to dispose of
what he had and set out at once to seek his new
country. I learned afterwards that he went home and
told his wife that I was a Yankee. He took my advice,
however, and set out as soon as he could and had so
little time to spare that as he went out of Jackson on
the east, General Grant's army was coming in on the
west. He returned to his plantation that fall but left his
negroes in Carolina.</p>
          <p>In September, a fleet of transports, escorted by gun
<pb id="boggs71" n="71"/>
boats, appeared off Sabine Pass. A few fortunate
shots from our little battery disabled two gun boats and
they were abandoned. The fleet then returned to New
Orleans without making an effort to land. We learned
afterwards that it contained General Franklin's army
corps. Had he landed and established himself in the
Sabine Valley, we would have been so completely
flanked as to have prevented us from meeting and
defeating General Banks the following spring. Upon
hearing of the capture of the boats General Magruder
made haste to go from Houston to the pass and date
his despatches from on board one of the captured
boats. Our force at the pass was, I think, twenty-one
men, all told.</p>
          <p>Shortly after this event General Smith sent me down
below Alexandria to see if it were possible to fortify or
obstruct Red River. I invited Major Carr to accompany
me. He was a native of Natchitoches and had not
visited it for many years. Judge Boyce, of Bayou
Rapides, was on a business trip to Shreveport at the
time. I invited him to take a seat with us, letting his
own wagons go on without him. The Judge was one of
those who think that you cannot make a good day's
journey without waking men and animals long enough
before day to have everything ready to start just as
soon as there is light enough to see. I being of a
contrary opinion, his wagon would start on his time and
mine two hours later. Every day we would pass his
team and get to our stopping place an hour before it.
The Judge insisted that it was the team and not the
principle that caused it. At Alexandria I took a
steamboat for the lower river and to
<pb id="boggs72" n="72"/>
avoid attention and comment started before day.
Doctor Egan, an elegant Irish gentleman, hearing me
moving about the room, inquired the cause of my early
rising. To keep off miasma, he prescribed a dram of
juniper gin of his own distilling. I examined the river as
far as the Black to find that General Taylor had
already made the very best possible disposition of the
means at our disposal. While returning I happened to
hum the following:</p>
          <lg org="uniform" sample="complete" part="N">
            <l part="N">“As I was going to the fair, the choice of all true hearted 
swains,</l>
            <l part="N">Miss Kitty she promised, she would be there, so I staid the 
last of all the peoples.</l>
            <l part="N">Perhaps some pretty thing catch her eye, some ginger bread
or apple pie.</l>
            <l part="N">I runned as fast as I could t'get it, for what in the devil did
I care for a tuppence.</l>
            <l part="N">With scorn she now hears me complain, nor will she look at
me at all.</l>
            <l part="N">She loves John Peter Michael better as I, because he has got
a couple of dollars more as me.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The captain of the boat informed me that he had not
heard that ditty for many years and then it was sung by
a friend of his in California. Upon comparing notes his
friend turned out to be my uncle, William Alexander
Robertson. Uncle Aleck went to California in 1849,
sailing round Cape Horn. He came back in the winter of
'56 for his family: but met with so much opposition, that
he finally settled in Augusta, Gal, where he died the
same year with yellow fever. The Captain told me when
he left, he was judge of
<pb id="boggs73" n="73"/>
the county court of Shasta County and if he had
returned they had intended making him Governor and
afterwards Senator. He also informed me that his
portrait hung in one of the public halls at Yreka.</p>

            <p>LAST DAYS OF THE CONFEDERACY  -  INTERVIEW WITH
GENERAL SMITH  -  THE BANKS  -  TAYLOR
CAMPAIGN  -  RESIGNATION AS CHIEF OF
STAFF  -  THE SURRENDER</p>
          </argument>
          <p>During the winter of '63 and '64 it seemed almost a
certainty that the Federals intended to make a determined
effort to drive us out of Arkansas and Louisiana. I was so
satisfied of this that I had the roads leading from Arkansas
and Texas towards Shreveport, Mansfield, and Natchitoches
put in order. I also directed Major Thomas to establish
supply deposits at certain points on these roads and keep
them well supplied. With the exception of some of those
ordered my Texas my orders were carried out.</p>
          <p>General Smith went to Texas for the purpose of a personal
interview with Magruder with reference to the approaching
campaign. In that interview Magruder induced him to
suspend my orders in his district. When I heard of it I did my
best to repair the mischief.</p>
          <p>One morning finding General Smith and several members
of the staff in high glee I inquired the cause. I was informed
that it was occasioned by the fact General Joseph E.
Johnston had been ordered to the command of the army in
upper Georgia. I told them that I hoped that their
expectations might be realized; but if I were to judge by his
campaign on the peninsula or in Mississippi, we would soon
hear of him at Atlanta and if not relieved, in the everglades of
Florida.
<pb id="boggs75" n="75"/>
General Johnston's strategy seemed to be in permitting the
enemy to keep him amused at one of his stragetic points
while they quietly turned both flanks and compelled him to
fall back to the next one.<ref id="ref45" n="45" rend="sc" target="note45" targOrder="U">1</ref>
</p>
          <p>My preparations were none too soon, for early in the
spring General Banks advanced from New Orleans with an
army estimated between forty and fifty thousand men,
flanked by a fleet of gun boats under the command of
Admiral Porter, while General Steele came down from the
north with an army of over twelve thousand. After some
correspondence, General Taylor came to Shreveport and, in
a personal interview, the plan of campaign was decided
upon. It was agreed that in consideration of General Banks'
want of reputation as a commander, to concentrate and fight
him first, although his army was supposed to be nearly four
times as large as General William Steele's.</p>
          <p>With this understanding General Taylor hurried back to
his command and devoted his attention to compelling Banks
to advance slowly.</p>
          <p>General Price, commanding the district of Arkansas, was
ordered to send all his infantry and artillery to Shreveport;
but retaining his cavalry to harass Steele and keep him in
check. All available troops from Texas were ordered to move
by the shortest routes towards Natchitoches and Mansfield.</p>
          <p>As the troops began to arrive from Arkansas Doctor Sol
Smith also arrived from Alexandria, and now began a change
of movement, which I have always held him responsible for.
The Arkansas troops were halted at Shreveport and
detained there, ostensibly to
<note id="note45" n="45" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref45">1.  This was written before I had heard of General Beauregard's command in
the battle of Bull Run.</note>
<pb id="boggs76" n="76"/>
be equipped. The animus of change was that Dr. Smith
disliked General Taylor as much as he liked General
Smith. Taylor was to harass Banks up to the last
moment and then General Smith was to move down
with additional troops, take command, and carry off the
glory of the pitched battle. In the meantime we, at
department headquarters, were having reviews, balls
and a gay time generally.</p>
          <p>On the morning of the battle of Mansfield, April 8th,
1864, a dispatch came from General Taylor, which to
me was unmistakable. He informed General Smith that
he had been skirmishing with the enemy all day, he
complained bitterly at the detention of the troops that
had been promised him, and had he anticipated it he
would have first fought at least one battle for Louisiana
without them. This last I construed to mean that he
intended to fight that day. I took the dispatch in to
General Smith and told him what I thought. He said no,
that Taylor did not have troops enough to fight. Orders
were issued at once for all troops to move towards
Mansfield, but to halt and await further orders at
Keachi. Headquarter transportation was gotten ready
and those officers who were to accompany General
Smith in the field, myself among the number, were to
be ready for an early start next day. So sure was I that
the battle would be fought that day, and so uneasy
about the result, that I made arrangements to move my
wife and the children into Texas, upon the first
intimation of disaster. General Smith had sent his
family off some time before. A little after midnight I
was called by a courier with dispatches from General
Taylor, stating that he had
<pb id="boggs77" n="77"/>
fought Banks, defeated him, captured many prisoners,
artillery and wagons and that Banks was in full retreat.
I sent the courier to General Smith's quarters and
followed soon as possible myself. I found General
Smith of the opinion that Taylor had engaged only the
advance guard and the battle was still to be fought this
side of Mansfield. He told me that he should start at
once with his aides-de-camp and that I must follow in
the morning with the rest of the staff. With the coming
light there was great excitement and I was soon on the
road with the body of the staff. Some of them got very
excited and wished to proceed at a gallop. I finally told
Allston and Williamson that they could go on faster if
they wished to. Shortly after they left I received a
message from General Smith directing me to halt the
staff wherever the messenger should find me and
await further orders. When General Smith reached
Mansfield he found only the wounded and prisoners
with their guards and nurses. General Taylor had
followed Banks and was again fighting him at Pleasant
Hill.</p>
          <p>The morning after the battle, General Taylor
returned to Mansfield for an interview with General
Smith; he wished to retain the additional troops and
push Banks, whom he believed to be thoroughly
demoralized and could be destroyed. General Steele
being within ninety miles of Shreveport, General Smith
was fearful that if the entire army continued to follow
Banks, Steele might easily reach Shreveport and then
come down in our rear, so he ordered all the Arkansas
and Texas troops to return to Arkansas, leaving
General Taylor his original command only.</p>
          <pb id="boggs78" n="78"/>
          <p>I was sent on to Magnolia, Arkansas, for the purpose
of establishing rapid communication with General Price.
I remained there until the army was concentrated in the
neighborhood of Camden. The day after rejoining the
army, I rode with General Smith to General Price's
headquarters, in front General Price was still
commanding all the cavalry that had been left in
Arkansas. From this interview, General Fagan was
given a division of cavalry and directed to proceed to
Little Rock and to destroy all supplies he might find
there, then to Pine Bluff and do the same thing. He was
to move rapidly and <hi rend="italics">stop for nothing</hi>. He was
informed of the importance attached to his movements
and promised promotion if successful. Unfortunately on
the second day out he ran across a return train with a
number of convalescents and some plunder which he
decided to secure. The time required for this prevented
the surprise of Little Rock and destroyed the only
object for which he had been sent.</p>
          <p>The return of Fagan's command rendered further
delay in bringing Steele to battle useless and
arrangements for so doing were being made, when a
deserter from our army having informed Steele of
Banks' disaster, he stole away quietly one night and
retreated toward Little Rock.</p>
          <p>General Smith had a long conversation with me
about following Steele. He knew that he ought not to
fight except under the most favorable circumstances,
and if he followed at all he must follow rapidly, thus
giving Steele the advantage of selecting his own
ground to receive him and to force a fight that he
wished to avoid. He also ought to have known that
<pb id="boggs79" n="79"/>
his army should have been pushed across country
toward Alexandria.</p>
          <p>I was left at Camden to facilitate the movement of
the troops.</p>
          <p>After crossing the Saline River at Jenkin's ferry,
General Steele formed line of battle and waited for
General Smith. The battle was simply sharpshooting
from different sides of the river. Our troops were
severely punished! In the Texas command Generals
Scurry and Randle, two of our best officers, were
killed and General Wall wounded. From the Federal
accounts, they also suffered severely. If Steele's object
was to prevent Smith from following him, or returning
to the aid of Taylor in the destruction of Banks, he was
successful. General Steele continued his march to
Little Rock unmolested and General Smith and staff
returned to Shreveport.</p>
          <p>General Taylor continued an active campaign against
General Banks until he was relieved from duty in our
department and ordered across to command the
department of Mississippi. He captured many prisoners
and stands of colors: among the latter a most beautiful
flag manufactured by Ball, Black&amp; Co., for one of the
favorite New York regiments. There was a
quartermaster in our service, who was almost too
successful in crossing the river back and forth between
us and Richmond. On the last trip he made he brought
back an order from the war department for us to send
all captured flags to Richmond. To me it was a singular
order, and as it did not specify by whom, I tried to
persuade General Smith not to send them or if he did to
select some one connected with his staff, and
<pb id="boggs80" n="80"/>
send them by him unknown to anyone. Not succeeding
I took the responsibility of retaining the regimental flags
and sending only the national ones and these I took
precaution to do up in such a manner as not to be
conveniently opened and examined. Our messenger
and his flags were captured at the river. I got Miss
Eliza Dean to take care of the handsome flag; she
afterwards claimed that General Taylor had given her
permission to keep it.</p>
          <p>Towards the fall of the year Governor Reynolds, the
Confederate Governor of Missouri, and General Price
requested and were permitted to make a demonstration
into Missouri. They seemed to think that the people had
suffered so severely at the hands of the Federals, that
upon their appearance with an army a sufficient
number of able bodied men would join them to enable
them to regain possession of the State. They got within
sight of the Indian Territory. There came out with this
command a splendid company of mounted men
commanded by a Captain Lee. General Price asked
that they be dismounted and sent to fill up his infantry
regiments. Lee objected. Finally General Smith ordered
Lee to report with his command to General Price. He
started with his command in the direction of Arkansas,
but soon turned to the right and went into swamps
opposite Vicksburg where he was a terror to
contraband traders until the close of the war. When
General Price went into Missouri Magruder was
ordered to the command of Arkansas and George
Walker to Texas. The style of living in Arkansas was
not in accord with Magruder's taste and in a very short
time he was at department headquarters and
<pb id="boggs81" n="81"/>
closeted with General Smith. At the end of the
interview General Smith directed that an order be
issued ordering Magruder back to the command of the
district of Texas. The peculiar feature of this order
was that Magruder was not to return to be relieved but
was to proceed at once to Texas with the order in his
pocket and I was not permitted to notify Walker either
by telegraph or otherwise.</p>
          <p>General Buckner was ordered from Richmond to
the command of the district of Louisiana.</p>
          <p>In the spring of '65 General Mason Graham of
Bayou Rapides came to my office, and after waiting
some time to catch me at leisure, wrote on a scrap of
paper, “Do you know that General Smith is seeking to
have you removed as chief of staff?” I at once invited
General Graham into a private place, where I informed
him that I had not the slightest intimation of it by word,
act or deed. He informed me that there was not the
slightest doubt about it, that his information came from
Richmond and that my removal had been opposed by
representatives from Louisiana and Texas.</p>
          <p>I returned to my office, gathered up all the papers
and took them to Colonel Anderson; informing Captain Thompson that I would not return until I had
an interview with General Smith.</p>
          <p>For the next three days General Smith did not come
to his office. On the fourth day I went to his residence
and asked a private interview.</p>
          <p>General Smith made the interview a very painful
one; he exhibited and expressed a great deal of
feeling. He stated that he had, at some time past,
applied to
<pb id="boggs82" n="82"/>
have Doctor Sol Smith appointed his chief of staff and
with the rank of Brigadier General; but that Mr. Davis
had refused. Among other things he stated that I knew
he always wanted Doctor Smith for his chief of staff.
That I denied, and assured him that had I been aware
of it, or that he was in any way dissatisfied with the
manner in which I had administered my office, I should,
most certainly, have asked to be relieved as I then did.
He assured me that it had been a long past action, and
as he could not have Doctor Smith, he preferred me to
all others. The interview lasted a long time and ended
in my consenting to go back to the office and resuming
duty as chief of staff.</p>
          <p>Not very long after that interview the Colonel of an
Arkansas regiment came to my office and asked me if
I would object to letting him have a copy of a letter,
written by General Smith, recommending his promotion.
I had heard nothing of such a letter and knew of no
reason for it; nevertheless I instituted enquiries among
the officers and clerks, but could not find that such a
letter had been sent. He seemed so positive about it,
that I suggested he interview General Smith. He
hesitated and asked me to do so. At first General Smith
could not or would not recall it; finally he took a small
book, with a bright red cover, from his desk, remarking
it must be among some memoranda he had given in
person to Senator Johnson of Arkansas, and
commenced to examine the book. As the book was
new and contained but little, he soon found it and
handed it to me to read. It was more of a memorandum
than a letter and was for the guidance of Senator
Johnson, with reference to General Smith's wishes,
<pb id="boggs83" n="83"/>
when he reached Richmond. Among other things, he
was to urge the change he desired to make at the head
of his staff. I handed the book to General Smith,
remarking that after reading the letter I could not think
of remaining in his way, and requested him to order me
to Richmond. He asked me to remain on duty until he
could send for Slaughter to take my place. I declined to
be considered a member of his staff on any conditions.
A few days after, General Smith, finding that he
needed rest, sent for General Buckner to take
temporary command of the department. On taking
command General Buckner sent for me and gave me
some orders as chief of staff, and I had in General
Smith's presence to explain my position and desire to
be ordered to Richmond. Instead I was ordered to take
command of the district of Louisiana.</p>
          <p>I have never been able to understand General
Smith's actions in this matter. I was appointed the chief
of staff at his own request, and at a time most
favorable for him to have Doctor Smith appointed. I
am not aware that he was required to take me with
him when he crossed the Mississippi River: but
supposing he had been, when General Taylor asked to
have me ordered to him for the express purpose of
placing me in command opposite Vicksburg, he had an
opportunity of relieving me from the staff in a most
complimentary manner, and under circumstances to
which no possible exception could have been taken in
Richmond. Again if General Smith was so anxious for
the Doctor's advice and counsel, why did he take me
into the field with him, leaving the Doctor at home?
Why was it that he always delegated to me every
delicate or
<pb id="boggs84" n="84"/>
dangerous duty? Finally General Smith knew that
there was no power that could compel Doctor Smith to
attend to office work or routine duty.</p>
          <p>I went to Natchitoches and assumed command of
the district; but my command was short lived, for, upon
the surrender of General Lee, General Harry Hayes,
who had been sent to our department to gather up the
absentees from his command in General Lee's army,
went to Shreveport and asked to be assigned to duty.
Being a Louisiana officer, he was assigned to the
command of the district, and I returned to Shreveport.</p>
          <p>I found General Smith still there, he had not yet
taken his intended absence nor had he resumed the
command: but he had sent his family through the lines.
I found an expedition being organized to go to Mexico
and enrolled my name; but when I found it was to go
to Maximillian, and not Juarez, I withdrew and
determined to await the end at Shreveport.</p>
          <p>One day Major Ezell informed me, confidentially,
that General Smith was having relays put on the road
towards Mexico and that he, Major Ezell, believed that
the General was going to run away. General Smith had
but started upon his supposed recreation trip, before it
was believed that he had gone for good.<ref id="ref46" n="46" rend="sc" target="note46" targOrder="U">2</ref> General
Buckner proceeded at once to New Orleans, and
having agreed with General Canby upon the terms of
surrender, a swift steamer was sent to
<note id="note46" n="46" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref46">2.  It is true that General Smith had intended to go to Mexico in case
of the collapse of the Confederacy. However, the “recreation trip”
here referred to was the transfer of headquarters to
Houston, Texas. Arrived at Houston, he found that the Texas
troops had disbanded. He then formally approved such a course and
started for Mexico via Galveston. See Noll, <hi rend="italics">General Kirby
Smith</hi>, pp. 250-262.  -  (ED.)</note>
<pb id="boggs85" n="85"/>
Galveston to intercept General Smith and have him
sign the articles. General Buckner never explained
why he sent the articles to Smith to sign: but after
signing them Smith continued his flight to Mexico.</p>
          <p>Until the arrival of the Federals there was no law of
any kind. All things considered our soldiers behaved
remarkably well: but it was a time of intense anxiety.
Night after night the headquarter clerks sat up at my
residence with loaded arms of various kinds close at
hand. Colonel Allston had been turned out of his house
with a dying child, because he had neither gold nor
greenbacks. I took them into my already crowded
house and it was there his child died. The funeral
procession was moving when the first Federal
transport arrived.</p>
          <p>Upon the arrival of Brigadier General George L.
Andrews, Provost-Marshall General of the United
States Army, I was, once more, ordered on duty as
commissioner on the part of the Confederate States to
act with him in paroling the officers of the Confederate
army. This was probably the last authoritative order
issued in connection with the Confederate States
Army.</p>
          <p>From the following, which is a copy of my own
parole, it appears that we paroled five hundred and
eighty officers:</p>

            <p>All of the above are more or less associated with
happening to have served with Bragg and not Beauregard.
My preference would have been Beauregard, although my
remaining with Bragg was my own choice, and solely on
account of my surroundings.</p>
            <p>Going to Savannah at the time mentioned in Beauregard's

Montgomery. Bartow, the Chairman of the Committee on
Military Affairs, was in Savannah at that time. He urging and
Governor Brown consenting, I went to Montgomery. I was

Captain of Engineers and assigned to the duty of organizing
the Ordnance Department. I soon became heart-sick,
disgusted and weary with the apathy and imbecility of the
whole Confederate Government, and would have been only
too glad to have come to Beauregard, had I known he
wanted me, but I never heard of the request, until now, thirty-five 
years after. The whole business of some of the Cabinet
seemed to be to provide places for their friends; and all of
them, including the President, seemed to think we should
soon have a social committee visiting us to beg us to return
to the Union upon any terms we should be pleased to
dictate. While so loafing, I obtained permission to make a
tour of inspection to the different Forts and Arsenals on the
Gulf. After a while I was told that Col. Gorgas was coming
South and would be chief of Ordnance (see Beauregard's
suggestion in his letter of March 11).</p>
            <p>I went to Bragg on April 9th; for the details of my going I
refer you to my Reminiscences: as well as for the part played
by Mr. Davis with reference to Lieutenant Worden, of the U.

I find upon reading Lieutenant Worden's statement of his
visit to the fleet off Pensacola, that General Bragg was
misinformed as to Mr. Davis having authorized that visit.
It appears from that statement that Worden did not stop in
Montgomery, but went straight through from Washington to
Pensacola, and received his permit to visit the fleet direct
from General Bragg.</note>

valuable service. That is how I came to serve with

State had seceded I was sent for by Governor Brown.
I found him fully alive to the situation. After an
interview, I was sent to Richmond and elsewhere, with
ample authority to provide war materials. At the
Tredeger Works, the only ones in the South then
capable of making heavy guns, I found that there were
no drawings of modern guns. I had been on special
detail with reference to that branch of service, and was
the only officer in the South at that time, or at any time,
with the exception of General Huger, who was at all
familiar with that subject. My friend and class mate
McPherson had been on a special detail to ascertain
the effects of modern ordnance on

walls and ramparts of various construction, and had
arrived at the conclusion that guns of less than 10-inch
calibre were useless. Concerning the rifle-gun, then in
its experimental stage I shall have more to say further
on.</p>
            <p>The Rodman gun, for the manufacture of which I
had been serving on special detail, was the accepted
pattern. I had found that its outside dimensions,
consisting of scientific curved surfaces, could be made
as parts of spheres (the breech), a cylinder, and two
cones and still be within the limits allowed to the
Inspector, so finding no drawing or models at the
Tredeger Works, I sketched out a good serviceable
gun of easy construction and great strength, and
ordered Mr. Anderson to manufacture them as fast as
possible, only limiting him to making at the same time a
full compliment of shot and shell and the necessary
irons for the guncarriages, and to ship as fast as made,
by the Georgia and Tennessee Railroad. These guns
were diverted, by Leroy Pope Walker, Secretary of
War, to Mobile, Alabama, and it was these that were
seen <hi rend="italics">en route</hi>, not for Pensacola, but Mobile, and the loss
of which to Georgia caused the easy fall of Fort
Pulaski.</p>

battery came from I cannot tell, but admitting we had them, I
defy anyone to have transferred them to the point claimed,
the entire route being along a beach directly under the fire of
all the guns in Fort Pickens. Why this letter was written I
cannot conceive, except the hope that the spies about
Richmond would inform the Federals. Again Col. Brown's
report shows that the coast survey charts were right and
there was not sufficient depth of water for the ships to
interfere with this battery or come within reach of it. On
another page I shall have more to say on the subject of the
battery that did not exist south of McRee.</p>

              <p>I ordered Captain Duryea, First Artillery, Commanding
Battery Scott, ably assisted as he was by Lieutenant Closson

consisting of two 10-inch Columbiads, one 42-pounder rifled
gun, and two lo-inch seacoast mortars, to fire on Fort McRee
and the sand battery south of it. I at the same time ordered
the four 10-inch seacoast mortars in the ditch, commanded by
Lieutenant Langdon, and one 13-inch and one 12-inch seacoast
mortars, Battery Totten, commanded by Captain Blount,
and one 8-inch Columbiad and two 42-pounders in casement,
of Lieutenant Jackson's battery to fire on Fort McRee and
sand battery south of it, for the purpose of co-operating
with the Navy in endeavouring to take and destroy that important
Fort and its outworks, which guard the enemy's right flank
and the entrance to the harbor of Pensacola. The direct fire
of these guns was excellent, and, together with the
heavy firing from the United States Steamships Niagara and
Richmond, produced a marked impression on this stronghold of
the enemy, by silencing the guns of the fort and driving the

detachments from the guns in the sand battery, which would
no doubt have decided the fate of Fort McRee, by enabling
the command from the Navy to take the Fort, but for the opening
of an unexpected and concealed battery, armed with rifled cannon
of large calibre or possibly a 10-inch Columbiad which was
served with effect on Richmond.</p>

              <p>When the difficulties began there were but two ports
in the South in which the forts had their armaments,
viz., Charleston and Pensacola. In the case of
Charleston, the South Carolina congressmen had seen
to it that when money was appropriated for armament
of its forts, that the forts got the armaments. At
Pensacola, in 1858 or '57, Lieutenant Balch, of the
Ordnance Corps, being a man of infinite detail, he went
to work and completely fitted out all the forts.</p>
              <p>When the principal object of my going to Pensacola
had been defeated by Mr. Davis' permit to Lieutenant
Worden of the U. S. Navy, and I determined to remain,
the first care was to examine all the surroundings, and
then discuss the subjects in detail with General Bragg.
With his consent I moved, one by one, all the Barbette
guns, but two, from the Forts, and distributed them
along the line of bluff and beach, in one and two gun
batteries, for several miles. I had recommended the
same to be done at Forts Jackson and St. Phillipi on the
river below New Orleans, and some of the guns,
diverted by the Secretary of War, were intended for
the same purpose on Tybee Island.

My idea being to keep a fleet under a continuous fire
for a long time, and also to prevent a concentrated fire
by a fleet upon all of my own guns at one time. At
Pensacola it was a hard matter to cover the entrance
channel. I did not approve a battery south of McRee,
for it would be exposed to a flank fire from Pickens at
comparatively short range. Eventually I decided upon
the “unexpected and concealed battery” referred to
above.</p>
              <p>On the 7th of October, 1861, General Bragg's
command was extended to cover Mobile, and shortly
afterwards I was sent to inspect the defences. On the
morning after my return, when I went to report, a dead
silence followed my entrance, implying that I was the
subject of conversation. Shortly after I went to
O'Bannon's camp: he hinted that there had been some
“Piney Woods Engineering” during my absence. I made
no reply, but that afternoon rode over south of McRee,
to find that two casement gun carriages and their guns
had been hauled out in the open and fitted up as a
battery. The men were by this time perfectly familiar
with the construction of sand batteries, but not with the
use of guns and gun carriages. With a Barbette
carriage you can get a wide field and long range, with
a casemate, a very limited field and less than half
range, reliance being upon richochet. The whole affair
was such an exhibition of stupidity as to prevent any
remarks by me. The Georgians who did this work with
Bragg's approval, were very proud of it and during the
bombardment fought it with great gallantry, for from its
nature they were very much exposed. But every shot
they fired was wasted, and did
<pb id="boggs98" n="98"/>
not reach half way, but being in a direct line, and the
richochet throwing up fountains of water deceived them.</p>
              <p>When the bombardment commenced, I was in a small boat,
half across the bay, on my way to Deer Point, where General
Bragg had decided to put the Florida Regiment as an
outpost, as he already had a Mississippi Regiment on the
west towards Perdido Bay. How he was persuaded to
establish these outposts I never knew; but from what I did
know, they appear to have been to get away from the regular
discipline of the army, and to have a high old time all around.
However, I turned at once. Shortly after joining General
Bragg, I ventured to suggest that Brown would hardly waste
so much ammunition simply for practice, and I thought it
probable it was to cover a landing at Perdido Bay which
would effectually cut us off on all sides; further that we did
not seem to be making much impression and that ammunition
was very scarce. He decided to order our batteries only to
fire occasionally, not oftener than once an hour, which made
Brown no doubt think he was silencing our guns.</p>
              <p>After a while he asked me why the above mentioned
battery was not firing at the fleet. I informed him that it had
instructions not to fire without special orders. He turned
sharply, and ordered me to go there at once. I knew the fleet
to be entirely out of effective range. So when I reached the
gun, the men were all there waiting, I dismounted and sat
down. After an hour or so an aide came to know why I was
not firing. I asked him to please give my compliments to
General
<pb id="boggs99" n="99"/>
Bragg and say that so soon as the ships came within range
he would hear from us.</p>
              <p>It was some time in the afternoon, when I observed them
swing round head on, and saw them move slowly up to a
new position. Having no other means, after they had taken
up their new position and commenced firing, I got the
distance by sight and sound. My first shot, afterwards so
reported, passed between masts, and the second one hulled
the ship so effectually as to disable her. When some of her
timbers floated ashore next day, my Georgians claimed them,
and Bragg endorsed their claim. The above official report of
Major Arnold is the first <sic>acknowledgement</sic> of the effective
work of the battery.</p>

              <p>On the receipt of your letter of the 6th. instant a short reply
was made to the first point and a further one promised on the
main subject.</p>
              <p>Though very grateful to my wounded feelings, yours was not
entirely satisfactory to me, nor to those on whose behalf I had
presumed to complain. I now propose to controvert your
positions knowing the danger I encounter.</p>
              <p>Nothing, it seems, can be done for my neglected officers
under the legislation as it now exists. How does it happen
that so much has been done for others, their juniors, under
this same legislation? You acknowledge this in your letter.
<pb id="boggs100" n="100"/>
You admit one case in Colonel Wheeler. Others present themselves 
to my mind. A private in one of my companies, a
gentleman of high attainment and merit, only equaled by his
modesty, was offered the Colonelcy of a regiment. He declined
it in favor of one of my regular officers, but saying, “If
civilians must be appointed, then I will accept.” He was at
once commissioned, and removed from a position he adorned on
my staff to one he was unprepared to fill. He will in time make
a fine officer, but those he preferred seeing appointed were
already made. Other regiments raised at the same time were
officered by <sic>civillians</sic> in the same way. All of my staff officers
here of the old Regular Army, the first to quit it, some even
before their states seceeded, were allowed to rest in subordinate
positions, while their inferiors in rank, of the eleventh hour converts
and civilians, were placed over their heads. Certainly the legislation
of Congress never required this. You now propose that whenever I
can spare them you will find means to give them increased rank in
the Provisional Army. I will not spare them if I can help it, nor are
they delirious of leaving me, but I claim consideration for them
equal to that accorded their inferiors in other armies. My officers
and myself have remained at our posts faithfully laboring in the
cause we so early espoused. We have not united in the “On to
Richmond” seeking high places. We considered it unmilitary and
unbecoming. We were ardently serving the cause, not ourselves but,
nevertheless, we did not suppose our government would so soon
forget we were in its service and degrade us. This state of things,
my dear sir, we believe has been brought about to some extent
without the knowledge of the President and against his wishes, but
it is nevertheless a rankling sore, which he only can cure. I am
candid, perhaps harsh, but I am doing him more service than by
permitting the evil to grow while he is in ignorance. I do not hesitate
to say, “I impugn the action of your predecessor.” He has done the
service more harm in the Cabinet than he will ever repair in the field.</p>
              <p>Let me now appeal to you for an old brother soldier, who is
more aggrieved and with more cause than any of us. Brigadier-General 
<pb id="boggs101" n="101"/>
Ruggles first reported to me as second in command
under the impression derived from the Adjutant General, and I
believed it from the precedence given his name in his order. We soon
learned that Brigadier-General Anderson, his junior by many years
in the old service, and it is no disparagement to say, very far his
inferior as a soldier, was his senior in rank. General Ruggles soon
after raising this question, was ordered to New Orleans, as a means,
we hoped, of removing this cause of complaint. What was his and
our dismay, then, to learn that another junior, just from the enemy,
who had been up to a late hour lecturing them on the art and science
of war, was promoted over his head, and assigned to a command the
highest and most important in the southern country. That command
includes my home and my fireside, and all that is dear to me in life. I
can appreciate the feelings of sullen dissatisfaction which prevades
my neighbors. The appointee is competent, but he does not and
cannot possess the confidence of many who look with distrust on
his eleventh-hour conversion. A great element of strength is thus
lost to us. You will never preserve the morale of this army by thus
degrading the commanders they so much admire and love. The
feeling of discontent has reached the rank and file intelligent enough
to read and digest these things, and where I expected to re-enlist
hundreds for the war tens cannot be found. They will not abandon
the cause, but will try and find a service less obscure and more
appreciated  -  one in which their commanders possess sufficiently
the confidence of the Government to justify them in expecting more
consideration.</p>
              <p>The result of all of your deliberations has not been to preserve
the morale of this army. Soldiers who have confidence in and
respect for their commanders are never demoralized by seeing them
advanced in their rank or command or by seeing their sphere of
usefulness increased nor will you encourage the zeal of those
commanders by making known to them that success in their ardous
labors of organization and instruction is to consign them to inferior
positions, as mere drill masters.</p>
              <pb id="boggs102" n="102"/>
              <p>Feeling so deeply it-was due to myself, to you, and the
President, that I should give free expression to my sentiments it is
done in no spirit of insubordination. All that I have all that I am,
shall remain in this cause whenever and wherever it may please the
Government to employ me.</p>

              <p>The intense bitterness of this letter does not come
from any consideration of his staff: if you will follow
his career to the end, you will find that those members
of his staff who remained with him never received
rank commensurate to the services rendered. Again,
General Cooper, Adjutant General, informed me
personally, that Bragg never made an application
calling for the promotion of any member of his staff,
that it was not accompanied by a private note saying,
that the application was a public acknowledgement of
the merits of its officers, but that he could not spare
them. They in fact organized and disciplined his army,
and each and all of them did all that an earnest zeal in
their profession and the cause could urge them to do.</p>
              <p>Again, he complains of the promotion of civilians and
untried men to positions to which tried soldiers should
be appointed, yet, very soon after this letter, you will
find J. K. Jackson, of Georgia, Patton Anderson, of
Florida and J. R. Chalmers, of Mississippi, appointed
Brigadiers at his solicitation, and that too without much
urging. He had begun to feel, that, maybe, a few
political appointments might help his own

              <pb id="boggs103" n="103"/>
              <p>The bitterness of this letter is excusable and more
than just. He had, from the beginning, been engaged in
organizing an army of over seven thousand men, had
been for months engaged upon this arduous duty when
all at once Mansfield Lovell, formerly his subordinate in
the U. S. Army, comes South, with the rank of Major
General and is assigned to the command, of all others,
which Bragg coveted and which, of right, should be his.
Benjamin's letter of the 6th conveying the intelligence
of his own promotion and extension of command,
conveyed also in a general order the appointment of
Mansfield Lovell to be a Major-General, and his
assignment to the command at New Orleans.</p>
              <p>Now, after seven months of delay, Mr. Davis has in
command of his principal armies men whom he
conscientiously believed to be the greatest soldiers of
the age: Joseph E. Johnston, in Virginia, with G. W.
Smith for his second in command, Albert Sidney
Johnston in Kentucky, Mansfield Lovell at New
Orleans and J. C. Pemberton at Charleston. Now, the
heads of all his army bureaus, except that of
quartermaster, which is still waiting for Emory  -  Bold
Emory  -  in hopes that he may once more change his
mind  -  he did resign in May, but suddenly withdrew
his resignation  -  are all filled to his satisfaction. Bragg
is still drillmaster at Pensacola, and Beauregard, who
had blown Anderson out of Sumpter and rolled big
McDowell back upon Washington, has been shelved in
the center of Mississippi. But he, Beauregard, seeing
the inevitable, is quietly organizing a small army and
selecting his line of battle, ready to turn back the
Federals at Shiloh.</p>
              <pb id="boggs104" n="104"/>
              <p>During these seven months, the best material, as fine as
the world ever saw, for soldiers have been moving eagerly to
the front ready to engage the enemy, but are kept rotting in
camps, without arms, equipments, supplies, and with the
exception of a small number, without organization. Waiting
these special heads!</p>
              <p>In the meantime the Federals have not been idle. Scott's
“Anaconda” has been getting into position: with its head at
Cairo, its glistening eyes looking down the Mississippi
River, its body stretching up the Ohio Valley, across West
Virginia and Maryland, down the Atlantic Coast and around
into the Gulf with its tail at Ship Island.</p>
              <p>It was the last Merry Christmas and Happy New Year for
the Confederacy. In a few months, McClellan is within seven
miles of Richmond, with scarcely the loss of a man. Albert
Sidney Johnston has abandoned Kentucky and Tennessee,
and is endeavoring to assemble his scattered army about
Beauregard's in Mississippi; and is soon to lose his life
fighting on Beauregard's battlefield, with Beauregard's army,
reinforced by his own and such other troops as could be
hurriedly assembled. Roanoke Island, Port Royal and Fort
Pulaski have fallen; New Orleans taken and Pensacola
abandoned.</p>

              <p>On my way to this point from Mobile on the first instant I was
privately advised by telegraph that firing was going on between our
batteries and Fort Pickens. I hastened as rapidly as possible, and
reached here at 4 a. m. the 2nd. It appears that a small private
steamer had been imprudently allowed to run to the Navy Yard,
and was fired on by the enemy at Fort Pickens. This fire was
returned by order of Brigadier-General Anderson, in temporary
command, and a brisk cannonade was kept up on both sides until
dark, when the enemy ceased. Ours was continued irregularly and
apparently without effect or an object until stopped by my order.
No <sic>casuality</sic> is reported on our side, and we can see no damage to
the enemy. A large and valuable storehouse, with considerable
property, in the Navy Yard, was burned by the enemy's shells.</p>
              <p>I regret exceedingly to add that concurrent testimony of many
officers of rank represent Brigadier-General Anderson as so much
intoxicated as to be entirely unfit for duty, and that his conduct
was very reprehensible. It is being investigated, and I fear that an
arrest and a prosecution will be necessary. Holding juniors to a
rigid accountability, I shall not overlook a similar offense in a
commanding General under such <sic>aggregavating</sic> circumstances.</p>
              <p>Not the least cause of regret was the large and criminal waste of

              <p>I must again urge on the Department my request for a second in
command here who could be entrusted with this army during my
necessary absence. Mobile demands much of my time; indeed, the

              <p>The foregoing is a vile libel on a gallant officer and
honorable gentleman, and it is an exceeding shame that
it should be handed down to posterity without
opportunity for correction in the records in which it is
printed. General Bragg not only does not confine
himself to the facts, but states what is absolutely false.
First, that “This fire was returned by order of General
Anderson.” It was New Years' day, and I was at
General Anderson's private quarters, where he and his
estimable wife were receiving New Year calls. There
were several other officers present  -  all seated and
chatting familiarly. First we heard a gun, evidently from
Fort Pickens, and almost at once a roar of guns from all
along the line. We all mounted as quickly as possible
and made our way to the Navy Yard. General
Anderson's gallant conduct in dismounting, getting upon
the parapet and calling upon the officers of the battery
to come up there with him and watch the effects of
their shot, in order to regulate their firing with more
accuracy, may have appeared to a new soldier an act of
intoxication, rather than that of a commander who
wished to instill confidence in his command.</p>
              <p>Again, General Bragg says: “It appears that a small
private steamer had been imprudently allowed to run
<note id="note57" n="57" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref57">10.  <hi rend="italics">Official Records</hi>, Series I, Vol. 6, p. 497.</note>
<pb id="boggs107" n="107"/>
to the navy yard, and was fired on by the enemy at
Fort Pickens.” That small private steamer was one of
our transports, under the direct charge of an officer of
the First Louisiana Regulars, who had been put upon a
special detail, by special favor of General Bragg, in
charge of our transports, and up to this time was not
known by General Anderson or even many of Bragg's
staff to be so detailed. When called to account for
permitting the steamer to run to the navy yard, he
stated “That it was done with the knowledge and
consent of General Bragg.”<ref id="ref58" n="58" rend="sc" target="note58" targOrder="U">11</ref>
</p>
              <p>After leaving Pensacola, I learned that General
Bragg had preferred charges against General
Anderson, and I at once wrote to Bragg, telling him
what I knew of the case, and expressing my regret at
his action. He replied, giving me to understand, that I
had put a different phase on the case. At the same
time I wrote to General Anderson, telling him, that I
should be happy to appear as his witness whenever
and wherever he might desire it.</p>
              <p>Concerning that part of Bragg's report which says, “I
must again urge on the Department my request for a
second in command here who could be entrusted with
his army in my necessary absence.”</p>
              <p>Before reading this, I was not aware of any
prejudice on the part of Bragg against Anderson, nor
can I now understand it, and will show why I cannot.</p>
              <note id="note58" n="58" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref58">11.  The
skirmish here described took place Jan. 1, 1862. It was the cause of a
quarrel among the Confederate officers after Bragg's return. A
contemporary
newspaper dispatch has the following on the point: “Report has it
that there was
quite a flare up all round;  -  Bragg's man Friday, chief engineers,
ordnance
officers, and everything else. An obscure individual by the name of Boggs
is said to have resigned. It won't make much difference to us, one way or
the other; but will affect Bragg's arrangements a good
deal.”</note>

            <p>Sam Jones graduated at the U. S. Military Academy in
1841. In 1846 he was detailed as an instructor at West
Point; and from that day until the breaking out of the war, I
never heard of him doing one hour's duty with his company.
In January, 1860, I met him

in Willard's Hotel, Washington City. He was lobbying for a
bill to retire superannuated and disabled officers, stating to
me that as the old men were not capable, and the young men
who had the duty to do should have the rank, pay and
emoluments. I told him I had just returned from the Rio
Grande where I had been in action with the Mexican
marauders in company with three companies of artillery,
everyone of which was commanded by a second lieutenant,
two of the very recent appointments from civil life; and
asked him if his bill included the three captains and six first
lieutenants who were absent. One was his company. Pulling
his mustache fiercely, he informed me that he did not intend
to do infantry duty; being commissioned as a captain of
artillery  -  entirely forgetting that the law which organized the
artillery service of the United States was worded “To serve
as Infantry except, etc.” So that, I am somewhat at a loss to
know where the veteran or experienced artillerist comes in.</p>

              <p>The cotton speculation on the Mississippi River has been carried
on for the last ten or twelve months on a very extensive scale, under
the pretense of obtaining clothing for the army, which has had, and is
still having, a very demoralizing 
<pb id="boggs110" n="110"/>
influence in the Confederate Army in the Trans-Mississippi
District. In my opinion nothing but the timely movement of
General Steele from Little Rock last spring, in the direction of
Shreveport, ever prevented this army from becoming completely
demoralized, and disbanding and going home. The same influence is
at work now. The soldiers, I am sorry to say, are deserting and
going home and to the enemy in consequence of the cotton
speculation that is now going on, on the Mississippi River, and
unless there is a stop put to it I fear the consequences. Last spring
a Mr. Chttisto (a considerable stage contractor) and others, sold
thousands of bales of cotton to the enemy on the Mississippi
River. He had, I understand, permission from General E. Kirby
Smith to pass any amount of cotton through our lines and sell to
the Federals, for the purpose of procuring clothing for the army,
cotton cards, medicine etc. Not a suit of clothing for the soldiers, or
any cotton cards or medicines, has ever been received that I am
aware of. This fall General E. Kirby Smith has appointed Colonel
Polk the head of the Cotton Bureau established on or near the
Mississippi River. Colonel Parsons was ordered to report to
Colonel Polk to protect the cotton trade that is carried on with the
enemy. The trade is carried on, as I understand, in the following
manner: Each planter or individual who has cotton to sell is first
required to give or make a present of one half of his cotton to the
Government of the Confederate States without any compensation,
the remaining half he has the privilege of selling to whom he
pleases under the permit and and protection of General Smith.
Thousands of bales of cotton have recently been sold to the enemy
in this way. The wagons are guarded and escorted to the River by
soldiers. the above statement I submit to you for your
consideration. The whole matter can be clearly established by
abundant proof. There is, I presume, a large quantity of cotton
formerly purchased by the Confederate States of America returned
to Richmond as being burned. A large quantity of cotton so
returned has been stolen, and a portion sold to the enemy. There is
yet remaining in the country a good portion of the
<pb id="boggs111" n="111"/>
cotton, which might be brought to light by a strict investigation,
and unless the cotton trade is stopped I would not give the
Government (comparatively speaking) much for the cotton which
she owns in this country. The above statement I respectfully
submit for your consideration.</p>
