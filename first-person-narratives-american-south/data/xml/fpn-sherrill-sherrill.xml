        <p>[From Newton Enterprise.]</p>
        <p>I have been requested to write some incidents, experiences
and observations of prison life during the war of 1861-'65.
After thirty-eight or thirty-nine years it is somewhat difficult to
recall anything like all that transpired in those dark days. Some
people say it is time to stop talking about that war. Now, that
would be a hard thing for those who lived in those days to do:
stop talking about the war. The men, women and children at
home had almost as hard a time as those at the front  -  not
quite so dangerous, yet it required courage and true patriotism
to stand in their places. Furthermore, it seems necessary, in
order to keep history straight, that those who lived and
participated in that part of our history should occasionally be
heard from, otherwise those who write so much, who live north
of the Mason and Dixon's line, would make our rising
generation believe what is false. So I say to all such: “Nothing
in the past is dead to the man who would learn how the present
came to be what it is.” Much has been written and said by our
Northern friends as to the suffering of the Union soldiers in
Southern prisons  -  Andersonville, Salisbury and other places  - 
during that war. They draw an awful picture of their poor
soldiers suffering and dying in Southern prisons. In some
respects this was true. To be in prison of itself was bad enough,
but to be there without proper food or medicine was very bad
indeed. The South did not have the means, neither the medicine,
but the prisoners in our care were put on the same footing as
our own poor soldiers. The question is: Who was to blame for
this state of things? The Confederate authorities made
proposition after proposition for exchange of prisoners, but the
Government at Washington positively declined. It is said that
<pb id="sherr4" n="4"/>
General Grant said: “It was hard, and a great sacrifice, to leave
the Union soldiers in Southern prisons, but it must be made; that
the Confederates could not afford to leave their men in prison for
want of men to take their place, but the United States could; to
exchange the prisoners the Confederates would return to the
army and go to fighting again.” So here is the key to the
responsibility for all the suffering and deaths on both sides in
the prisons. The Confederate Government offered to let them
send medicine South for their sick prisoners, but they declined
to do that. It must be remembered the Confederate
Government was shut in from the outside world, and could not
secure necessary medicine, etc. Now, as to Andersonville, it
was under the command of Wirtz, and since men have had time
to cool off it has long since been decided that the hanging of
that poor man was simply murder. He did the best he could for
the poor prisoners there. General Dick Taylor in his book,
“Destruction and Reconstruction,” gives the following account
of meeting with Wirtz, as his troops were passing
Andersonville, during the march of Sherman through Georgia, in
1864: “In this journey through Georgia, at Andersonville, we
passed in sight of a large stockade inclosing prisoners of war.
The train stopped for a few moments, and there entered the
carriage to speak to me a man who said his name was Wirtz,
and that he was in charge of the prisoners near by. He
complained of the inadequacy of his guard and the want of
supplies, as the adjacent country was sterile and thinly
populated. He also said that the prisoners were suffering from
cold, were destitute of blankets, and that he had not wagons to
supply fuel. He showed me duplicates of requisitions and
appeals for relief that he had made to different authorities, and
these I endorsed in the strongest terms possible, hoping to
accomplish some good. I know nothing of this (man) Wirtz,
whom I then met for the first and only time, but he appeared to
be in earnest in his desire to mitigate the condition of his
prisoners. There can be but little doubt that his execution was
a 'sop' to the
<pb id="sherr5" n="5"/>
passions of the ‘many-headed.’” So, then, poor Wirtz was made
a scape-goat to cover the sins of those who could have had
those poor prisoners released at any time but would not. The
sacrifice was made to quiet the poor prisoners and their
friends. Many things will be settled at the great Assize, when
the Judge of all shall sit in judgment.</p>
        <p>Let us have the official record on prison life, and see the
truth of history:</p>
        <list type="simple">
          <item>United States prisoners held in Southern prisons, . 270,000</item>
          <item>United States prisoners died in Southern prisons, . 22,000</item>
          <item>About 8 per cent.</item>
        </list>
        <list type="simple">
          <item>Confederate prisoners held in Northern prisons, . . 220,000</item>
          <item>Confederate prisoners died in Northern prisons, . . 26,000</item>
          <item>About 12 per cent.</item>
        </list>
        <p>The North is said to be more healthy than the South, and yet
of the 270,000 Northern soldiers in Southern prisons, only
22,000 died, while of the 220,000 Confederates in Northern
prisons (50,000 less than we had of theirs) 26,000 died. The
deaths in Northern prisons exceeded the deaths in Southern
prisons four thousand men. While about eight per cent of the
Union prisoners died, about twelve per cent of the Southern
prisoners in Northern prisons died. “Tell it not in Gath, and
publish it not in the streets of Askelon.” Facts and figures are
wonderful things. Now, I have made this long statement before
coming to the “incidents of prison life,” as seen by myself <hi rend="italics">et al</hi>. I
have done so for the purpose of trying to keep the record
correct, that justice might be done to all, and history speak the
truth.</p>
        <p>I was shot in the first charge that was made at Spottsylvania
Court-House, Virginia, early on the morning of the 9th day of
May, 1864. The charge was made by our brigade, composed
of the Fifth, Twelfth, Twentieth and Twenty-third N. C.
Regiments, led by General R. D. Johnston. The charge was a
success so far as the enemy in our front were concerned, but
our lines were overlapped by Burnside's troops. Our regiment
(the Twelfth) and our company (A), being on the extreme
<pb id="sherr6" n="6"/>
right, were exposed to an enfilading fire clear across an
open field; so we were exposed to a fire from front and from
the right. The enemy had torn down a rail fence and made
temporary breast-works in our front, from which our men
drove them, but could not hold the position because Burnside's
whole army corps was on hand, and could easily have cut off
our little brigade; so General Johnston gave the command to fall
back. As our troops fell back, Sergeant Silas Smyre (now
county commissioner of Catawba) and Corporal E. G. Bost
endeavored to carry me from the battlefield. They were so
exhausted from marching and fighting that they could not hold
me up so as to prevent the crushed leg from dragging on the
ground. To prevent their being captured, I begged them to
leave me to my fate. (May I never forget this act of kindness
by these brave men, who risked so much for me.) I was in the
broiling hot sun, without water, my canteen having been shot
in the fight, and the water all run out.</p>
        <p>I was concealed from the enemy by some shrubbery. Late in
the afternoon I realized that I could not live without water. The
loss of blood, together with the burning rays of the sun, made
me feel that life was about to ebb out; so I called to the enemy
and surrendered. Here I commenced the life of a prisoner,
which lasted ten months. Besides the suffering from wounds,
the humility, the loss of liberty, the absence of all friends and
loved ones, no face but that of enemies, was just about as
much as I could bear up under in my condition. In that hour
home and friends would have been “a haven of rest” sure
enough.</p>
        <p>The day following, May 10, 1864, when I was laid on the
slaughter table, my eyes caught the sight of arms and legs piled
on the ground  -  an indication of what I might expect. Dr. Cox,
of Ohio, examined my leg. The only conversation that passed
between us was this: I said, “Doctor, can you save my leg?” He
replied, “I fear not, Johnny.” Chloroform was applied, and when
restored to consciousness I was minus one limb. I lay there in
what was designated “a field hospital”
<pb id="sherr7" n="7"/>
for two or three days without any further attention to the
wound, and the result was the flies “blowed” the amputated
limb, and when I reached Alexandria City, some days later, the
nurse who dressed the wound found that I was being eat up by
the vermin. Just here I will state that on the last day spent at
the field hospital there was a great rush in gathering us up in
ambulances. Under great excitement, I said to the doctor who
was supervising the movement: “Doctor, what is the matter?”
He replied that “Burnside was falling back to get a better
position.” I had been in the army long enough to know that was
an evasive answer. The fact was that our troops were driving
Burnside back, and the Federals were not willing to lose any of
their prisoners though maimed for life. The roads from this
place were cut to pieces by the artillery and wagon trains of the
Union army going to the front. Those of us who were badly
wounded cried for mercy. No mercy came until we reached
the boat-landing, where we (those living) were transferred from
ambulance to the boat. I do not know how many died en route
from the battlefield to the boat-landing. I do know that Charles
P. Powell, Adjutant of the Twenty-third North Carolina
Regiment, who had lost his leg just as I had, died on this trip,
and they stopped on the roadside and covered him up. This
young man Powell was from Richmond County, N. C. He was
a private soldier at Malvern Hill, July, 1862. When in line of
battle, in front of the artillery, a shell fell in the ranks. The men
could not leave the line of battle. There lay the shell, sputtering,
ready to explode. Young Powell sprang up, grappled the shell
and “soused” it into a pool of water near by. What a risk was
that! Yet that heroic act may have saved the lives of several
men. Later that day he was wounded, and again at the battle of
Gettysburg in July, 1863, and died as above stated. On page
189 of Volume II, North Carolina Regimental Histories, it is
stated that C. P. Powell, Adjutant, was killed on the 9th of
May, 1864, whereas the truth is he was shot on the 9th and his
leg was
<pb id="sherr8" n="8"/>
amputated, and about the 11th or 12th of May he was jolted
to death between Spottsylvania Court-House and Bell Plains. I
venture the assertion that he was not buried two and a half feet
deep; and the place is unknown to his people, who think he was
buried on the battlefield. We were shipped to Alexandria City,
where I spent three months in the “Marshall House,” where the
proprietor, Jackson, shot and killed Colonel Ellsworth, who tore
down his Confederate flag in April, 1861, and Jackson was
killed by Frank Brownwell, of Colonel Ellsworth's regiment.
This hotel was used as a prison hospital for those who were
permanently disabled. For awhile the patriotic women of
Alexandria were permitted to visit us, and often when they
would bid us good-bye a “green-back” bill or something else
was left in our hand. However, before we were removed from
there the good women were prohibited from coming to see
us.</p>
        <p>While a prisoner here our troops, under General Early came
down near Washington City, and there was great excitement in
Washington and Alexandria, for it did seem that the
Confederates were going into Washington. We prisoners were
expecting to be released and get home, but our expectations
were soon blasted by the Confederates having to retreat back
to the south side of the Potomac, and did not come <hi rend="italics">via</hi>
Alexandria. My next move was to the Lincoln Hospital in
Washington City. Here I spent about two months. After I could
walk with crutches I was transferred to the old Capitol Prison.
I was honored with a seat in the old Capitol, but had to look
through iron bars. While here I was guilty of “cruelty to bugs,”
if not to animals, in the common acceptation of that term. (Just
here by way of parenthesis.) I know how to appreciate the
traveling man's experience given by “Red Buck,” in
<hi rend="italics">Charlotte Observer</hi>, of September 11, 1903. Night after night
I suffered from the onslaughts of those “bugs”  -  no telling how
much I endured. “Weeping endureth for the night, but joy
cometh in the morning.” They had all the “innings” at night, but
in the morning I
<pb id="sherr9" n="9"/>
would take my turn at the bat. As soon as it was light enough
to see I would sit upon my humble couch (I was myself a
picture of humility) and commence a war of revenge. As they
would take to the wall I would go for them, and before I left
that prison many, many “bugs” were slaughtered, as the
blood-stained wall bore testimony. Yes, that wall was well striped
with Confederate blood. The loss of blood in that way, if not
with as much pain, was attended with much more genuine
disgust. How much I would have liked to “express myself,” but
my lips were hermetically sealed. I learned how to sympathize
with Pharaoh and his people, though there is no statement that
any of this kind were sent on him when Moses and the
Israelites were asking permission to leave. In November, 1864,
I (with others) was shipped off to Elmyra, N. Y. “Thus when
I shun Scylla, your father, I fall into Charybdis, your mother.”</p>
        <p>Leaving the old Capitol Prison, I got away at least from the
multitude of B. B.'s, but I ran into the B. L.'s  -  army body
lice, or what the soldiers call “grey backs.” Later on I may
speak of my experience with this pest while in the small-pox
camp.</p>
        <p>We reached Elmyra, N. Y., on Sunday morning. Being in the
mountains, the ground was covered with snow. Arriving at the
barracks, we were lined up (I was on my crutches, and had
to stand there on one foot for what seemed to me a very long
time) just inside the gate, negro soldiers on guard. The
commanding officer, Major Beal, greeted us with the most
bitter oaths that I ever heard. He swore that he was going to
send us out and have us shot; said he had no room for us, and
that we (meaning the Confederate soldiers) had no mercy on
their colored soldiers or prisoners. He was half drunk, and I
was not sure but that we might be dealt with then and there.
Then we were searched and robbed of knives, cash, etc., and
sent into various wards. While we were standing in the snow,
hearing the abuse of Major Beal, some poor ragged
Confederate prisoners were marched by with what was
<pb id="sherr10" n="10"/>
designated as barrel shirts, with the word “thief” written in large
letters pasted on the back of each barrel, and a squad of little
drummer boys following beating the drums. The mode of
wearing the barrel shirts was to take an ordinary flour barrel,
cut a hole through the bottom large enough for the head to go
through, with arm-holes on the right and left, through which the
arms were to be placed. This was put on the poor fellow,
resting on his shoulders, his head and arms coming through as
indicated above; thus they were made to march around for so
many hours and so many days. Now, what do you suppose they
had stolen? Why, something to eat. Yes, they had stolen
cabbage leaves and other things from slop barrels, which was a
violation of the rules of the prison. One large, robust prisoner
from Virginia was brought into the surgical ward where I was,
having been seriously wounded by one of the guards. On
inquiry, I learned that the poor fellow was caught fishing out
scraps from a slop barrel and was shot for it. A small, very thin
piece of light-bread with a tin pint cup full of what purported to
be soup twice a day was the rations for the prisoners. I heard
the men say: “My soup has only three eyes on it”  -  meaning
there was no grease in it  -  only hot water. Now, this fare was
not enough to sustain life in healthy, able-bodied men. The result
was that where they could not make something  -  make rings,
etc.  -  and thus secure something from the sutlers, many, yea
hundreds of the poor fellows would be attacked with dysentery  - 
so common and often so fatal in camp, and especially in prison
life. The food they had seemed to be only enough to feed the
disease; the result was that scores and hundreds died. Speaking
of the light-bread, the Confederates would sometimes hold it up
and declare “that it was so thin that they could read the <hi rend="italics">New
York Herald</hi> through it”; then they would grab it and squeeze it
up in one hand till it looked about like a small biscuit. Men died
there for the want of food. I do not know, it may be that the
Government issued enough rations, but it had to pass through too
many hands
<pb id="sherr11" n="11"/>
before reaching <sic corr="the">th</sic> soldiers. The truth is that there was a great
deal of speculation and swindling carried on in the prisons; and
I am ashamed to say it, yet it is true that sometimes some of
our own men were engaged in the conspiracy to cheat and
defraud their fellow-prisoners. It was in this way: those in
charge of the prison would take Confederates and make
ward-masters, etc., of them (like in prisons now a few are made
“trusties”); and a little authority, even of that kind, would ruin
some men. Some prisoners, like Jeshrun, grew fat, but others
starved for want of suitable food and enough of it. Well, to go
back a little, while standing there, receiving the profane blessing
from Major Beal, I saw drawing near as he dared to venture an
old fellow-prisoner that I had met in Washington, who had
preceded me to this place. I do not remember his name. I had
at Washington nicknamed him “Softy.” He recognized me, and
as Beal closed his eloquent abuse, and we were ordered to
march into the barracks, “Softy” ventured in a low tone to
speak to me. His greeting was: “Sherrill, you have come to hell
at last. Did you see those four-horse wagons going out? They
were full of dead men, who died last night. They are dying by
hundreds here with small-pox and other diseases.” He was
discovered by one of the guards (standing too near us). He
hollowed at him: “Get away from there.” He got away
immediately, if not sooner. When I reflected on the situation  - 
the cursing major, the colored guards, the robbing us of our little
stock of valuables, the barrel shirts, the wagons with the dead,
the appearance of some of the living, the earth covered with
snow  -  I thought, “Well, ‘Softy’ has given a true bill.” When I
was located, I found I had kinsfolk there: J. U. Long (now
chairman of the board of county commissioners), Nicholas
Sherrill and W. P. Sherrill. There may have been others, but I
do not recall them now. My haversack had been supplied with
rations on leaving Washington. When I was located in the
ward, “Nick” Sherrill came to see me. Of course we were glad
to see each other, for it had been many moons
<pb id="sherr12" n="12"/>
since we had met. We were not in the same command in the
army. “Nick” asked me if I had anything to eat. I replied, “Yes.”
He said: “I want to trade you a cup, spoon, etc., for some bread;
I am about perished.” Poor fellow, he looked the picture of
despair. I said: “Nick, I do not want your cup and spoons, but
you are welcome to what I have.” He devoured in short order
all that I had, and wanted more. Poor fellow, he soon died, as
did W. P. Sherrill; died away from home and loved ones, buried
by their enemies. I had to spend several days in the barracks
before I was transferred to the surgical or hospital ward. I was
there long enough to know why Cousin Nicholas was so
anxious for my bread. After I was placed in the surgical ward
of the hospital I fared fairly well  -  a great improvement over
the fare out in the wards of the regular prison. After a few
weeks I was taken with small-pox, and of course was
transferred over S. Creek to the small-pox camp. I was
carried over on a cot, or “stretcher,” with blanket thrown over
my face. When I reached the place, and the blanket was
removed, I found myself in a large “wall tent,” with several
cots, or “bunks,” about two and a half feet wide, with two
Confederates on each “bunk,” in reverse order, <hi rend="italics">i. e.</hi>, A's head
at one end and B's at the other  -  so your bed-fellow's feet
were in very close proximity to your face. They were all
sandwiched in this way, because the bed was too narrow to
admit of the two to lay shoulder to shoulder. On waking up on a
morning one of these poor fellows would be dead and the other
alive; this, of course, occurred day after day, and night after
night. Well might those poor fellows, who had spent at least a
part of the night with a corpse for a bed-fellow, have exclaimed
with St. Paul, “Who shall deliver me from the body of this
death?” When I took in the situation, I told the man who was
going to place me on a bunk by the side of a poor fellow bad off
with that awful disease (and who finally died) “that he could not
put me on there.” He replied “that he would show me whether
he could or not.” I stuck to it that I would not be put there. The
<pb id="sherr13" n="13"/>
fellow went and brought in the ward-master, and when he
appeared it was Jack Redman, from Cleveland County, Company
E, my regiment. Redman said, “Why, hello, Sherrill, was it you
that was raising such a racket?” I told him it was. He wanted
to know what was the matter. I explained that with my
amputated limb it would never do to put me on a bunk with
another fellow, and he finally consented to arrange for me to
have one to myself. I said: “Redman, you must grant me
another favor.” He wished to know what it was. I replied: “I
want you to let me keep my blanket that came over from the
surgical ward.” “Why so, Sherrill?” I said: “Jack, you see those
blankets that you fellows have been using on these men  - 
there are five ‘army lice’ to every hair on the blanket.” Redman
took a hearty laugh. He knew there was more truth in it than
poetry, so he granted my request. Redman had had small-pox
and was an “immune,” hence was made a ward-master. He
was especially kind and considerate towards me. When I got
well and was carried away, I never knew what became of him.
Some of our men who felt that the thing was gone, and that we
could not succeed, never came back South. I am inclined to
think that Redman did that thing. After the doctor had declared
me well, and directed that I should be removed back to the
hospital ward from whence I came, this was indeed glorious
news; for of all the diseases that flesh is heir to, small-pox is
the filthiest. The small-pox such as we had there was “sure
enough” small-pox. Such as we have in North Carolina these
days, in comparison with that, is only make-believe. I don't think
it an exaggeration to say that seven out of ten who had it died. I
was carried over into what was called a bath-house, where I
was placed in a large bath-tub of water, almost too hot to bear.
The Yankee soldier who had charge went out to look after
something else or to loiter around, and I waited and waited for
his return (the water was beginning to get cold) so I could get
out and get clothing to put on. The atmosphere of the room was
colder, if anything, than the
<pb id="sherr14" n="14"/>
water. I was in great distress, and it seemed that I could make
no one hear me; so I had to wait the return of the villain, who
finally came when the water in the bath-tub seemed to me to
be nearly to the freezing point. He came, bringing a full Yankee
suit, and when I gave him a piece of my mind he apologized
and begged me not to speak of it  -  said he had actually
forgotten me. When I reached the hospital ward I was a blue
man in feelings and in appearance. I was dressed in a Yankee
suit, even to a cap. I felt humiliated, and my skin was blue from
cold. But for the kindness of my comrades there, giving me of their
allowance of spirits that night, I don't know but what I would
have gone hence.
Along toward the close of February, 1865, I with others, was
marched to the train and shipped to Richmond. I think that was
the happiest day that I ever experienced in my life. To get out
of that death-hole was enough to make one happy; and to add
to it the prospect of getting home to friends and loved ones,
from whom I had been so long separated, not having heard
from them in ten months, was indeed a treat. Many and great
changes had taken place since I had left Dixie. I
never did doubt that we would eventually succeed. I presume I
was cheered up and was kept optimistic from the many rumors
all the time in circulation that France and England would soon
recognize our independence; which, of course, never took
place. The air was filled with that and other rumors, not only in
the Confederate army, but even in prison. Such rumors of great
victories for the Confederate arms were all the time circulating
among the poor fellows. As I came on from New York it
looked to me as if the whole world was being uniformed in blue
and moving toward General Grant's army. As we came up the
James River, both sides were lined with soldiers dressed in
blue. When we came to the Confederate lines, seeing such few
ragged men confronting all that blue host, my courage came
near failing me. In fact, I could not see how this little thin line
of Confederates could hold at bay such a multitude of
well-fed, well-equipped men. The
<pb id="sherr15" n="15"/>
patriotic women of Richmond tried to be cheerful, but I could
see plainly enough that they were depressed. While they were
just as kind in their attention to the returning soldiers as in
former days, yet it was evident that the cheerful hope of former
days was gone. When I reached home I soon learned that
many who were living on the 9th of May, 1864, when we made
that charge, had been numbered with the dead. Among others
was my nephew, James Ferdinand Robinson, a young man a
few months younger than myself, a great favorite in the
company, full of humor and wit. He was a sharp-shooter, and
was found dead on the 12th of May, 1864, by Frank Turbyfield,
of the Twenty-third Regiment. After the fighting on the
morning of the 9th, he wrote a letter in pencil to his father,
Marion Robinson, in which he stated: “My Uncle Miles was
killed in the charge made early this morning.” Two days later he
was killed. I got home to read his letter relative to my death;
but he, poor fellow, was gone. I have not seen the letter since
1865; so I only quote from memory what I remember.</p>
        <p>Such is war. Many people have an erroneous idea about that
war. They blame President Davis and President Lincoln for the
whole thing; when in fact they were only placed at the head.
Both made blunders; so would any one else in their positions.
Davis was not an original secessionist, but went with his State.
He was a United States Senator at the time, from Mississippi.
He had served with distinction in the war with Mexico. Who
has not read of “Colonel Jeff. Davis and his brave Mississippi
riflemen”? Mr. Davis did not desire to be President; he desired
to go in the army. He had been Secretary of War of the United
States; had, as stated above, served in the United States army;
so it was natural for him to prefer the army to being President.
As to his taking the responsibility of making peace sooner, I
have seen it stated that had he attempted to do so in 1864, on
any terms save independence, the army and the people of the
South would not have submitted to it. I think myself this is true.
He, as
<pb id="sherr16" n="16"/>
well as General Lee, had a hard time; they were both weighed
down with trouble, cares and responsibilities. He had no more
to do with the assassination of President Lincoln than you or I.
He was cast into prison, manacled and placed in a dungeon.
(General Miles would be glad now if he never had put
shackles on him.) A soldier was placed where an eye always
rested on Mr. Davis. This was a great annoyance to him.</p>
        <p>General Dick Taylor, who succeeded in getting permission
from President Johnson to visit President Davis at Fortress
Monroe, makes the following statement: “It was with some
emotion that I reached the casement in which Mr. Davis was
confined. There were two rooms, in the outer of which, near
the entrance, stood a sentinel, and in the inner was Jefferson
Davis. We met in silence, with grasp of hands. Afterwards he
said: ‘This is kind, but no more than I expected of you.’ Pallid,
worn, gray, bent, feeble, suffering from inflammation of the
eyes, he was a painful sight to a friend. He uttered no plaint,
and made no allusion to the irons. He said <corr>‘</corr>the light kept all night
in his room hurt his eyes, and the noise made every two hours
by relieving the sentry prevented much sleep; but that matters
had changed for the better since the arrival of General Burton,
who was all kindness, and strained his orders to the utmost in
his behalf,’ etc.” Mr. Davis was no doubt a great and good man,
for General Taylor, on speaking of some kindness shown to him
during the war, said: “No wonder that all who enjoy the
friendship of Jefferson Davis love him as Jonathan did David.”
Had Mr. Davis been a traitor and rebel any more than
other leaders of the South, and had he been guilty as charged,
of course he would have been tried and executed. It was not done
simply because it would have been an open violation of law, and
the people of our country had had time to cool off. So Mr.
Davis was released. We all believe that had Mr. Lincoln lived
we never would have had to go through the farce and humility
of reconstruction. Excuse me, Mr. Editor, for this divergence. I
have done so “lest we forget; lest we
<pb id="sherr17" n="17"/>
forget.” There are many humorous, ludicrous, laughable things
that occurred in prison life, connected with the negro soldiers
(sparring between the colored guard and the Confederate
prisoners) that will not do to publish; so I forbear to give any of
them.</p>
        <p>It is indeed wonderful how the prisoners would work to make
a little money. One of the most common occupations was to
make finger rings; they did some real nice work. Some of the
men would secure a few cents, and on that little capital build up
quite a business. Some had teachers and attended school. The
teachers were, of course, fellow-prisoners with the pupils. As
before stated, I was in the surgical ward while in New York,
and had no personal experience in the traffic and trading above
alluded to, for it was not allowed in the hospital wards. Mr. John
Gray Bynum, of Mountain Creek township, was a ward-master
while a prisoner at Elmyra (and made a good one, too). He
could give some rich incidents of prison life; and so could our
mutual friend Phillip A Hoyle, who was a prisoner at Point
Lookout, Md. It may not be generally known that Mr. A. A.
Shuford, of Hickory, one of our successful business men, made
his start as a trader while a prisoner of war. It is my
understanding that such is the case. It was while in prison that
Mr. Shuford manifested a talent and a liking for trade and
traffic, and on a small scale made a success while in prison.
Having thus imbibed the business spirit while in prison, on his
liberation and return home he left the farm and old homestead
and went to Hickory and engaged in business with his brother
“Dolph” and W. H. Ellis. How well he has succeeded is a
matter of history, and who can tell what influence his
experience in prison may have had on his subsequent life? A.
A. Shuford and P. A. Hoyle belonged to the gallant Twenty-
third North Carolina Regiment and suffered together at Point
Lookout, where the water was impregnated with copperas, thus
causing the death of thousands of as brave men as ever
carried a gun. I am reminded that General Lee says in his
memoirs
<pb id="sherr18" n="18"/>
that he used every effort and means at his command to effect an
exchange of prisoners, but General Grant refused.</p>
        <p>As before stated, General Grant refused to exchange as a
war measure, and it had the desired effect.</p>
        <p>That there were some men in uniforms who might be classed
as brutes is not to be denied; we are thankful the number was
comparatively small. In the campaign into Maryland in 1862, our
regiment was in the division commanded by the gallant Gen. D.
H. Hill, who held the mountain passes against overwhelming
numbers. My younger brother, James Albert Sherrill, who had
been with us only six months, fell dangerously wounded just at
the time the command was given to fall back. Of course he fell
into the hands of the enemy; there, lying weltering in his blood,
the enemy came on him, and instead of ministering to his wants,
a brute in human form in uniform took his bayonet and stabbed
the poor boy to death. I did not see this, but Alfred Sigmon, of
Catawba County, who was also wounded, was an eyewitness
to the tragedy. I give this incident as it came near to me; many
others just as cruel might be given. It would not do to hold
General McClelland or his true soldiers responsible for the
conduct of a drunken, cowardly brute. The Union army was
afflicted by having foreign soldiers who could not speak the
English language. We have met the Union soldiers when many
of them were so drunk they could hardly tell what they were
doing.</p>
        <p>There never was any trouble between true soldiers, whether
they wore the blue or the gray. It was the warlike civilians who
did not fight and the soldiers who were mere hangers-on
and camp followers that made the trouble. But for the influence
of General Grant and other army officers we would have fared
much worse in the South after the close of the war
than we did; they, as conquerors, became our protectors. The
true soldiers could be seen exchanging coffee for tobacco,
going in bathing at the same time, in the same river; and
when the enemy fell into his hands as a prisoner he would
<pb id="sherr19" n="19"/>
empty his own haversack and the canteen to relieve his
prisoner. When there was no fighting going on, the soldiers of
the two armies were on the best of terms. The outrages
committed on either side during the war were not attributable
to the true soldier; neither can the outrages perpetrated on the
South after the war be charged up to the United States Army
proper, but to the “bummers,” who were no good in the army or
at home.</p>
        <p>The storm has long since gone by. The true soldier has no
prejudice against the soldier who fought on the other side. The
blue and the gray have since worn the blue in the war with
Spain  -  an evidence of reconciliation between the
Confederate and Union soldiers of 1861-'65.</p>

        <p>Since writing the foregoing sketch I have received the
following “Memorial Day Ode,” from the pen of my friend,
Rev. G. R. Rood, preacher in charge of Millbrook Circuit. It is
so appropriate I let it be the closing chapter:</p>

            <l>Leaps on its way an untamed flood.</l>
