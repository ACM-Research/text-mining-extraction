        <head>INTRODUCTION</head>
        <head>THE AUTHOR AND HER BOOK</head>
        <p>IN Mrs. Chesnut's Diary are vivid pictures of the social 
life that went on uninterruptedly in the midst of 
war; of the economic conditions that resulted from 
blockaded ports; of the manner in which the spirits of the 
people rose and fell with each victory or defeat, and of the 
momentous events that took place in Charleston, Montgomery, 
and Richmond.  But the Diary has an importance 
quite apart from the interest that lies in these pictures.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Chesnut was close to forty years of age when the 
war began, and thus had lived through the most stirring 
scenes in the controversies that led to it. In this Diary, as 
perhaps nowhere else in the literature of the war, will be 
found the Southern spirit of that time expressed in words 
which are not alone charming as literature, but genuinely 
human in their spontaneousness, their delightfully unconscious 
frankness.  Her words are the farthest possible removed 
from anything deliberate, academic, or purely intellectual 
They ring so true that they start echoes.  The 
most uncompromising Northern heart can scarcely fail to 
be moved by their abounding sincerity, surcharged though 
it be with that old Southern fire which overwhelmed the 
army of McDowell at Bull Run.</p>
        <p>In making more clear the unyielding tenacity of the 
South and the stern conditions in which the war was prosecuted, 
the Diary has further importance.  At the beginning 
there was no Southern leader, in so far as we can gather 
<pb id="mchesxiv" n="xiv"/>
from Mrs. Chesnut's reports of her talks with them, who
had any hope that the South would win in the end, 
provided the North should be able to enlist her full 
resources.  The result, however, was that the South struck 
something like terror to many hearts, and raised serious 
expectations that two great European powers would recognize 
her independence.  The South fought as long as she had 
any soldiers left who were capable of fighting, and at last 
“robbed the cradle and the grave.” Nothing then remained 
except to “wait for another generation to grow 
up.” The North, so far as her stock of men of fighting 
age was concerned, had done scarcely more than make a 
beginning, while the South was virtually exhausted when 
the war was half over.</p>
        <p>Unlike the South, the North was never reduced to 
extremities which led the wives of Cabinet officers and 
commanding generals to gather in Washington hotels and 
private drawing-rooms, in order to knit heavy socks for 
soldiers whose feet otherwise would go bare: scenes like 
these were common in Richmond, and Mrs. Chesnut often 
made one of the company.  Nor were gently nurtured women 
of the North forced to wear coarse and ill-fitting shoes, such 
as negro cobblers made, the alternative being to dispense 
with shoes altogether.  Gold might rise in the North to 2.80, 
but there came a time in the South, when a thousand dollars 
in paper money were needed to buy a kitchen utensil, which 
before the war could have been bought for less than one 
dollar in gold.  Long before the conflict ended it was a 
common remark in the South that, “in going to market, 
you take your money in your basket, and bring your purchases
home in your pocket.”</p>
        <p>In the North the counterpart to these facts were such 
items as butter at 50 cents a pound and flour at  12 a barrel.  
People in the North actually thrived on high prices.  Villages 
and small towns, as well as large cities, had their 
“bloated bondholders” in plenty, while farmers everywhere
<pb id="mchesxv" n="xv"/>
were able to clear their lands of mortgages and put 
money in the bank besides.  Planters in the South, meanwhile, 
were borrowing money to support the negroes in 
idleness at home, while they themselves were fighting at 
the front.  Old Colonel Chesnut, the author's father-in-law, 
in April, 1862, estimated that he had already lost half 
a million in bank stock and railroad bonds.  When the 
war closed, he had borrowed such large sums himself and 
had such large sums due to him from others, that he saw no 
likelihood of the obligations on either side ever being discharged.</p>
        <p>Mrs.  Chesnut wrote her Diary from day to day, as the 
mood or an occasion prompted her to do so.  The fortunes 
of war changed the place of her abode almost as frequently 
as the seasons changed, but wherever she might be the 
Diary was continued.  She began to write in Charleston 
when the Convention was passing the Ordinance of Secession.  
Thence she went to Montgomery, Ala., where the 
Confederacy was organized and Jefferson Davis was inaugurated 
as its President.  She went to receptions where, 
sitting aside on sofas with Davis, Stephens, Toombs, Cobb, 
or Hunter, she talked of the probable outcome of the war, 
should war come, setting down in her Diary what she heard 
from others and all that she thought herself.  Returning to 
Charleston, where her husband, in a small boat, conveyed 
to Major Anderson the ultimatum of the Governor of South 
Carolina, she saw from a housetop the first act of war committed 
in the bombardment of Fort Sumter.  During the 
ensuing four years, Mrs. Chesnut's time was mainly passed 
between Columbia and Richmond.   For shorter periods she 
was at the Fauquier White Sulphur Springs in Virginia, 
Flat Rock in North Carolina, Portland in Alabama (the 
home of her mother), Camden and Chester in South Carolina, 
and Lincolnton in North Carolina.</p>
        <p>In all these places Mrs.  Chesnut was in close touch 
with men and women who were in the forefront of the 
<pb id="mchesxvi" n="xvi"/>
social, military, and political life of the South.  Those
who live in her pages make up indeed a catalogue of the 
heroes of, the Confederacy-President Jefferson Davis, 
Vice-President Alexander H. Stephens, General Robert E.
Lee, General “Stonewall” Jackson,  General Joseph E. 
Johnston, General Pierre G. T. Beauregard, General Wade 
Hampton, General Joseph B. Kershaw, General John B. 
Hood, General John S. Preston, General Robert Toombs, 
R. M. T. Hunter, Judge Louis T. Wigfall, and so many 
others that one almost hears the roll-call.  That this 
statement is not exaggerated may be judged from a 
glance at the index, which has been prepared with a 
view to the inclusion of all important names mentioned in
the text.</p>
        <p>As her Diary constantly shows, Mrs. Chesnut was a 
woman of society in the best sense.  She had love of 
companionship, native wit, an acute mind, knowledge of books, 
and a searching insight into the motives of men and women.  
She was also a notable housewife, much given to hospitality; 
and her heart was of the warmest and tenderest, as those 
who knew her well bore witness.</p>
        <p>Mary Boykin Miller, born March 31, 1823, was the 
daughter of Stephen Decatur Miller, a man of distinction 
in the public affairs of South Carolina.  Mr. Miller was 
elected to Congress in 1817, became Governor in 1828, and 
was chosen United States Senator in 1830.  He was a 
strong supporter of the Nullification movement.  In 1833, 
owing to ill-health, he resigned his seat in the Senate and 
not long afterward removed to Mississippi, where he engaged 
in cotton planting until his death, in March, 1838.</p>
        <p>His daughter, Mary, was married to James Chesnut, Jr., 
April 23, 1840, when seventeen years of age.  Thenceforth 
her home was mainly at Mulberry, near Camden, one of 
several plantations owned by her father-in-law.  Of the 
domestic life at Mulberry a pleasing picture has come down 
<pb id="mchesxvii" n="xvii"/>
to us, as preserved in a time-worn scrap-book and written
some years before the war:</p>
        <p>“In our drive of about three miles to Mulberry,
we were struck with the wealth of forest 
trees along our way for which the environs of 
Camden are noted.  Here is a bridge completely 
canopied with overarching branches; and, for the 
remainder of our journey, we pass through an 
aromatic avenue of crab-trees with the Yellow Jessamine 
and the Cherokee rose, entwining every 
shrub, post, and pillar within reach and lending 
an almost tropical luxuriance and sweetness to 
the way.</p>
        <p>“But here is the house—a brick building, 
capacious and massive, a house that is a home for 
a large family, one of the homesteads of the olden 
times, where home comforts and blessings cluster, 
sacred alike for its joys and its sorrows.  Birthdays, 
wedding-days, ‘Merry Christmases,’ departures 
for school and college, and home returnings 
have enriched this abode with the treasures 
of life.</p>
        <p>“A warm welcome greets us as we enter.  
The furniture within is in keeping with things 
without; nothing is tawdry; there is no gingerbread 
gilding; all is handsome and substantial.  
In the ‘old arm-chair’ sits the venerable mother.  
The father is on his usual ride about the plantation; 
but will be back presently.  A lovely old 
age is this mother's, calm and serene, as the soft 
mellow days of our own gentle autumn.  She 
came from the North to the South many years 
ago, a fair young bride.</p>
        <p>“The Old Colonel enters.  He bears himself 
erect, walks at a brisk gait, and needs no spectacles,
<pb id="mchesxviii" n="xviii"/>
yet he is over eighty.  He is a typical Southern 
planter.  From the beginning he has been one 
of the most intelligent patrons of the Wateree 
 Mission to the Negroes, taking a personal interest 
  in them, attending the mission church and 
worshiping with his own people.  May his children 
see to it that this holy charity is continued to their 
servants forever!”</p>
        <p>James Chesnut, Jr., was the son and heir of Colonel 
James Chesnut, whose wife was Mary Coxe, of Philadelphia.  
Mary Coxe's sister married Horace Binney, the eminent 
Philadelphia lawyer.  James Chesnut, Jr., was born in 1815 
and graduated from Princeton.  For fourteen years he 
served in the legislature of South Carolina, and in January, 
1859, was appointed to fill a vacancy in the United States
 Senate.  In November, 1860, when South Carolina was 
about to secede, he resigned from the Senate and thenceforth
 was active in the Southern cause, first as an aide to 
General Beauregard, then as an aide to President Davis, 
and finally as a brigadier-general of reserves in command
of the coast of South Carolina.</p>
        <p>General Chesnut was active in public life in South Carolina 
after the war, in so far as the circumstances of Reconstruction 
permitted, and in 1868 was a delegate from that
State to the National convention which nominated Horatio 
Seymour for President.  His death occurred at Sarsfield,
 February 1, 1885.  One who knew him well wrote:</p>
        <p>“While papers were teeming with tribute to 
this knightly gentleman, whose services to his 
State were part of her history in her prime—tribute 
that did him no more than justice, in recounting 
his public virtues—I thought there was another 
phase of his character which the world did 
not know and the press did not chronicle—that 
<pb id="mchesxix" n="xix"/>
which showed his beautiful kindness and his courtesy 
to his own household, and especially to his 
dependents.</p>
        <p>“Among all the preachers of the South Carolina 
Conference, a few remained of those who ever 
counted it as one of the highest honors conferred 
upon them by their Lord that it was permitted to 
them to preach the gospel to the slaves of the 
Southern plantations.  Some of these retained 
kind recollections of the cordial hospitality shown 
the plantation missionary at Mulberry and Sandy 
Hill, and of the care taken at these places that the 
plantation chapel should be neat and comfortable, 
and that the slaves should have their spiritual as
well as their bodily needs supplied.</p>
        <p>“To these it was no matter of surprise to learn 
that at his death General Chesnut, statesman and 
soldier, was surrounded by faithful friends, born 
in slavery on his own plantation, and that the last 
prayer he ever heard came from the lips of a negro 
man, old Scipio, his father's body-servant; and 
that he was borne to his grave amid the tears and 
lamentations of those whom no Emancipation 
Proclamation could sever from him, and who cried 
aloud:  ‘0 my master! my master! he was so good 
to me!  He was all to us!  We have lost our best 
friend!’</p>
        <p>“Mrs. Chesnut's anguish when her husband 
died, is not to be forgotten; the ‘bitter cry’ never 
quite spent itself, though she was brave and 
bright to the end.  Her friends were near in that 
supreme moment at Sarsfield, when, on November 
22, 1886, her own heart ceased to beat.  Her servants 
had been true to her; no blandishments of 
freedom had drawn Ellen or Molly away from
‘Miss Mary.’   Mrs. Chesnut lies buried in the 
<pb id="mchesxx" n="xx"/>
 family cemetery at Knight's Hill, where also sleep  
her husband and many other members of the
 Chesnut family.”</p>
        <p>The Chesnuts settled in South Carolina at the close of 
the war with France, but lived originally on the frontier of
 Virginia.  Their Virginia home had been invaded by French 
and Indians, and in an expedition to Fort Duquesne the 
father was killed.  John Chesnut removed from Virginia 
to South Carolina soon afterward and served in the 
Revolution as a captain.  His son James, the “Old Colonel,” 
was educated at Princeton, took an active part in public 
affairs in South Carolina, and prospered greatly as a 
planter.  He survived until after the War, being a 
nonogenarian when the conflict closed.  In a charming sketch of
him in one of the closing pages of this Diary, occurs the 
following passage: “Colonel Chesnut, now ninety-three, 
blind and deaf, is apparently as strong as ever, and certainly 
as resolute of will.  Partly patriarch, partly grand 
seigneur, this old man is of a species that we shall see no 
more; the last of a race of lordly planters who ruled this 
Southern world, but now a splendid wreck.”</p>
        <p>Three miles from Camden still stands Mulberry.  During 
one of the raids committed in the neighborhood by Sherman's 
men early in 1865, the house escaped destruction 
almost as if by accident.  The picture of it in this book 
is from a recent photograph.  A change has indeed come 
over it, since the days when the household servants and 
dependents numbered between sixty and seventy, and its owner 
was lord of a thousand slaves.  After the war, Mulberry 
ceased to be the author's home, she and General Chesnut 
building for themselves another to which they gave the 
name of Sarsfield.  Sarsfield, of which an illustration is 
given, still stands in the pine lands not far from Mulberry.  
Bloomsbury, another of old Colonel Chesnut's plantation 
dwellings, survived the march of Sherman, and is now the 
<pb id="mchesxxi" n="xxi"/>
home of David R. Williams, Jr., and Ellen Manning, his 
wife, whose children roam its halls, as grandchildren of the 
author's sister Kate.  Other Chesnut plantations were Cool 
Spring, Knight's Hill, The Hermitage, and Sandy Hill.</p>
        <p>The Diary, as it now exists in forty-eight thin volumes, 
of the small quarto size, is entirely in Mrs. Chesnut's handwriting. 
She originally wrote it on what was known 
as “Confederate paper,” but transcribed it afterward.  
When Richmond was threatened, or when Sherman was 
coming, she buried it or in some other way secreted it from 
the enemy.  On occasion it shared its hiding-place with 
family silver, or with a drinking-cup which had been presented 
to General Hood by the ladies of Richmond.  Mrs. 
Chesnut was fond of inserting on blank pages of the Diary 
current newspaper accounts of campaigns and battles, or
lists of killed and wounded.  One item of this kind, a 
newspaper “extra,” issued in Chester, S. C., and announcing 
the assassination of Lincoln, is reproduced in this volume.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Chesnut, by oral and written bequest, gave the 
Diary to her friend whose name leads the signatures to this 
Introduction.  In the Diary, here and there, Mrs. Chesnut's 
expectation that the work would some day be printed 
is disclosed, but at the time of her death it did not seem 
wise to undertake publication for a considerable period.  
Yellow with age as the pages now are, the only harm that 
has come to them in the passing of many years, is that a 
few corners have been broken and frayed, as shown in one 
of the pages here reproduced in facsimile.</p>
        <p>In the summer of 1904, the woman whose office it 
has been to assist in preparing the Diary for the press, 
went South to collect material for another work to follow 
her A Virginia Girl in the Civil War.  Her investigations 
led her to Columbia, where, while the guest of Miss 
Martin, she learned of the Diary's existence.  Soon afterward 
an arrangement was made with her publishers under 
which the Diary's owner and herself agreed to condense 
<pb id="mchesxxii" n="xxii"/>
and revise the manuscript for publication.  The Diary 
was found to be of too great length for reproduction in 
full, parts of it being of personal or local interest rather 
than general.  The editing of the book called also for the
insertion of a considerable number of foot-notes, in order 
that persons named, or events referred to, might be the
better understood by the present generation.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Chesnut was a conspicuous example of the well-born 
and high-bred woman, who, with active sympathy and 
unremitting courage, supported the Southern cause.  Born 
and reared when Nullification was in the ascendant, and 
acquiring an education which developed and refined her 
natural literary gifts, she found in the throes of a great 
conflict at arms the impulse which wrought into vital 
expression in words her steadfast loyalty to the waning fortunes 
of a political faith, which, in South Carolina, had
become a religion.</p>
        <p>Many men have produced narratives of the war between 
the States, and a few women have written notable chronicles 
of it but none has given to the world a record more radiant
than hers, or one more passionately sincere.  Every line in 
this Diary throbs with the tumult of deep spiritual passion, 
and bespeaks the luminous mind, the unconquered soul, of
the woman who wrote it.</p>

        <head>I. CHARLESTON, S. C.</head>
        <head><hi rend="italics">November</hi> 8, 1860—<hi rend="italics">December</hi> 27, 1860</head>
        <p>CHARLESTON, S. C., <hi rend="italics">November</hi> 8, 1860.—Yesterday 
on the train, just before we reached Fernandina, a 
woman called out: “That settles the hash.” Tanny 
touched me on the shoulder and said: “Lincoln's elected.”
 “How do you know?” “The man over there has a telegram.”</p>
        <p>The excitement was very great.  Everybody was talking 
at the same time.  One, a little more moved than the 
others, stood up and said despondently: “The die is cast; 
no more vain regrets; sad forebodings are useless; the
stake is life or death.” “Did you ever!” was the prevailing 
exclamation, and some one cried out: “Now that the 
black radical Republicans have the power I suppose they
will Brown <ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" target="note1">1</ref>  us all. ” No doubt of it.</p>
        <p>I have always kept a journal after a fashion of my 
own, with dates and a line of poetry or prose, mere quotations, 
which I understood and no one else, and I have kept 
letters and extracts from the papers.  From to-day forward 
I will tell the story in my own way.  I now wish I had a 
chronicle of the two delightful and eventful years that have
 just passed.  Those delights have fled and one's breath is 
taken away to think what events have since crowded in.  
Like the woman's record in her journal, we have had 
“earthquakes, as usual”—daily shocks.</p>
        <note id="note1" n="1" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1">1. A reference to John Brown of Harper's Ferry.</note>
        <pb id="mches2" n="2"/>
        <p>At Fernandina I saw young men running up a Palmetto 
flag, and shouting a little prematurely, “South Carolina 
has seceded!”  I was overjoyed to find Florida so 
sympathetic, but Tanny told me the young men were Gadsdens, 
Porchers, and Gourdins, <ref targOrder="U" id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2">1</ref>  names as inevitably South 
Carolinian as Moses and Lazarus are Jewish.</p>
        <p>From my window I can hear a grand and mighty 
flow of eloquence.  Bartow and a delegation from Savannah 
are having a supper given to them in the dining-room 
below.  The noise of the speaking and cheering is pretty 
hard on a tired traveler.  Suddenly I found myself listening 
with pleasure.  Voice, tone, temper, sentiment, language, 
all were perfect.  I sent Tanny to see who it was 
that spoke.  He came back saying, “Mr. Alfred Huger, 
the old postmaster.” He may not have been the wisest or 
wittiest man there, but he certainly made the best aftersupper 
speech.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 10th</hi>.—We have been up to the Mulberry 
Plantation with Colonel Colcock and Judge Magrath, who 
were sent to Columbia by their fellow-citizens in the low 
country, to hasten the slow movement of the wisdom assembled 
in the State Capital.  Their message was, they said: 
“Go ahead, dissolve the Union, and be done with it, or 
it will be worse for you.  The fire in the rear is hottest.” 
And yet people talk of the politicians leading!  Everywhere 
that I have been people have been complaining bitterly 
of slow and lukewarm public leaders.</p>
        <p>Judge Magrath is a local celebrity, who has been 
stretched across the street in effigy, showing him tearing off 
his robes of office.  The painting is in vivid colors, the 
canvas huge, and the rope hardly discernible.  He is 
depicted with a countenance flaming with contending 
emotions—rage, disgust, and disdain.  We agreed that the time
<note id="note2" n="2" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref2">1. This and other French names to be met with in this Diary are of
Huguenot origin.</note>
<pb id="mches3" n="3"/>
had now come.  We had talked so much heretofore.  Let the 
fire-eaters have it out. Massachusetts and South Carolina 
are always coming up before the footlights.</p>
        <p>As a woman, of course, it is easy for me to be brave
under the skins of other people; so I said: “Fight it out.  
Bluffton <ref targOrder="U" id="ref3" n="3" rend="sc" target="note3">1</ref>  I has brought on a fever that only bloodletting will 
cure.” My companions breathed fire and fury, but I dare 
say they were amusing themselves with my dismay, for, 
talk as I would, that I could not hide.</p>
        <p>At Kingsville we encountered James Chesnut, fresh
from Columbia, where he had resigned his seat in the 
United States Senate the day before.  Said some one spitefully, 
“Mrs. Chesnut does not look at all resigned.” For 
once in her life, Mrs. Chesnut held her tongue: she was 
dumb.  In the high-flown style which of late seems to have 
gotten into the very air, she was offering up her life to 
the cause.</p>
        <p>We have had a brief pause.  The men who are all, like 
Pickens, <ref targOrder="U" id="ref4" n="4" rend="sc" target="note4">2</ref> “insensible to fear,” are very sensible in case of 
small-pox.  There being now an epidemic of small-pox in 
Columbia, they have adjourned to Charleston.  In Camden 
we were busy and frantic with excitement, drilling, marching, 
arming, and wearing high blue cockades.  Red sashes, 
guns, and swords were ordinary fireside accompaniments.  
So wild were we, I saw at a grand parade of the home-guard 
a woman, the wife of a man who says he is a secessionist 
<hi rend="italics">per se</hi>, driving about to see the drilling of this new company, 
although her father was buried the day before.</p>
        <p>Edward J. Pringle writes me from San Francisco 
on November 30th: “I see that Mr. Chesnut has resigned
<note id="note3" n="3" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref3">1. A reference to what was known as “the Bluffton movement” of
 1844, in South Carolina.  It aimed at secession, but was voted down.</note>

been elected to Congress in 1834 as a Nullifier, but had voted against 
the “Bluffton movement.” From 1858 to 1860, he was Minister to Russia. 
He was a wealthy planter and had fame as an orator.</note>
<pb id="mches4" n="4"/>
and that South Carolina is hastening into a Convention, 
perhaps to secession.  Mr.  Chesnut is probably to 
be President of the Convention.  I see all of the leaders 
in the State are in favor of secession.  But I confess I 
hope the black Republicans will take the alarm and submit 
some treaty of peace that will enable us now and forever 
to settle the question, and save our generation from
the prostration of business and the decay of prosperity 
that must come both to the North and South from a disruption 
of the Union.  However, I won't speculate.  Before 
this reaches you, South Carolina may be off on her own 
hook—a separate republic.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 21st</hi>.—Mrs. Charles Lowndes was sitting with 
us to-day, when Mrs. Kirkland brought in a copy of the 
Secession Ordinance.  I wonder if my face grew as white 
as hers.  She said after a moment: “God help us.  As our 
day, so shall our strength be.” How grateful we were for 
this pious ejaculation of hers!  They say I had better take 
my last look at this beautiful place, Combahee.  It is on the
coast, open to gunboats.</p>
        <p>We mean business this time, because of this convocation 
of the notables, this convention.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref5" n="5" rend="sc" target="note5">1</ref> In it are all our wisest 
and best.  They really have tried to send the ablest men,

splendidly represented.  Patriotism aside, it makes society 
delightful.  One need not regret having left Washington.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 27th</hi>.—Mrs. Gidiere came in quietly from her 
marketing to-day, and in her neat, incisive manner exploded 
this bombshell:.  “Major Anderson <ref targOrder="U" id="ref6" n="6" rend="sc" target="note6">2</ref> has moved into

Fort Sumter, while Governor Pickens slept serenely.”  The 
row is fast and furious now.  State after State is taking its 
forts and fortresses.  They say if we had been left out in 
the cold alone, we might have sulked a while, but back we 
would have had to go, and would merely have fretted and 
fumed and quarreled among ourselves.  We needed a little 
wholesome neglect.  Anderson has blocked that game, but 
now our sister States have joined us, and we are strong.  
I give the condensed essence of the table-talk:  “Anderson
has united the cotton States.  Now for Virginia!”   “Anderson
has opened the ball.”  Those who want a row are in
high glee.  Those who dread it are glum and thoughtful
enough.</p>

folded the United States Army flag just before dinnertime.  
Ours was run up in its place.  You know the Arsenal 
is in sight.  What is the next move?  I pray God to guide 
us. We stand in need of wise counsel; something more 
than courage.  The talk is: ‘Fort Sumter must be taken; 
and it is one of the strongest forts.’ How in the name of 
sense are they to manage?  I shudder to think of rash
moves.”</p>

        <p>MONTGOMERY, Ala., <hi rend="italics">February</hi> 19, 1861.—The brand-new 
Confederacy is making or remodeling its Constitution.  
Everybody wants Mr. Davis to be General-in-Chief 
or President.  Keitt and Boyce and a party 
preferred Howell Cobb <ref targOrder="U" id="ref7" n="7" rend="sc" target="note7">1</ref> for President.  And the fire-eaters
 per se wanted Barnwell Rhett.</p>
        <p>My brother Stephen brought the officers of the “Montgomery 
Blues” to dinner.  “Very soiled Blues,” they said, 
apologizing for their rough condition.  Poor fellows! they 
had been a month before Fort Pickens and not allowed to 
attack it.  They said Colonel Chase built it, and so were 
sure it was impregnable.  Colonel Lomax telegraphed to
 Governor Moore <ref targOrder="U" id="ref8" n="8" rend="sc" target="note8">2</ref> if he might try to take it, “Chase or no
Chase,” and got for his answer, “No.”   “And now,” say
the Blues, “we have worked like niggers, and when the 
fun and fighting begin, they send us home and put regulars

The wheel of the car in which it was carried took fire.  
There was an escape for you!  We are packing a hamper
of eatables for them.</p>
        <p>I am despondent once more.  If I thought them in earnest 
because at first they put their best in front, what now?
We have to meet tremendous odds by pluck, activity, zeal, 
dash, endurance of the toughest, military instinct.  We
have had to choose born leaders of men who could attract
love and secure trust.  Everywhere political intrigue is as
rife as in Washington.</p>
        <p>Cecil's saying of Sir Walter Raleigh that he could “toil 
terribly” was an electric touch.  Above all, let the men who 
are to save South Carolina be young and vigorous.  While 
I was reflecting on what kind of men we ought to choose, I 
fell on Clarendon, and it was easy to construct my man 
out of his portraits.  What has been may be again, so the 
men need not be purely ideal types.</p>
        <p>Mr. Toombs <ref targOrder="U" id="ref9" n="9" rend="sc" target="note9">1</ref>  told us a story of General Scott and himself.  
He said he was dining in Washington with Scott, 
who seasoned every dish and every glass of wine with the 
eternal refrain, “Save the Union; the Union must be preserved.”
Toombs remarked that he knew why the Union 
was so dear to the General, and illustrated his point by a 
steamboat anecdote, an explosion, of course.  While the 
passengers were struggling in the water a woman ran up
and down the bank crying, “Oh, save the red-headed

was active in the Compromise measures of 1850.  He served in the 
United States Senate from 1853 to 1861, where he was a pronounced 
advocate of the sovereignty of States, the extension of slavery, and secession. 
He was a member of the Confederate Congress at its first session 
and, by a single vote, failed of election as President of the Confederacy.  
After the war, he was conspicuous for his hostility to the Union.</note>

after landing him noticed with surprise how little interest in 
him the woman who had made such moving appeals seemed 
to feel.  He asked her  “Why did you make that pathetic
outcry?”  She answered, “Oh,  he owes me ten thousand 
dollars.”  “Now General,”  said Toombs, “the Union
owes you seventeen thousand dollars a year!”  I can imagine	
the scorn on old Scott's face.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February</hi> 25th—Find every one working very hard
here.  As I dozed on the sofa last night, could hear the
scratch, scratch of my husband's pen as he wrote at the
table until midnight.</p>
        <p>After church to-day, Captain Ingraham called.  He left
me so uncomfortable.  He dared to express regrets that he
had to leave the United States Navy.  Ha had been stationed
in the Mediterranean, where he liked to be , and
expected to be these two years, and to take those lovely
daughters of his to Florence.  Then came Abraham Lincoln,
and rampant black Republicanism, and he must lay
down his life for South Carolina.  He, however, does not
make any moan.  He says we lack everything necessary in
naval gear to retake Fort Sumter.  Of course, he only
expects the navy to take it.  He is a fish out of water here.
He is one of the finest sea-captains; so I suppose they will
soon give him a ship and send him back to his own element.</p>
        <p>At dinner Judge—  was loudly abusive of Congress.
He said: “They have trampled the Constitution underfoot.  
They have provided President Davis with a house.”
He was disgusted with the folly of parading the President
at the inauguration in a coach drawn by four white horses.
Then some one said Mrs. Fitzpatrick was the only lady
who sat with the Congress.  After the inaugural she poked
Jeff Davis in the back with her parasol that he might turn
and speak to her.  “I am sure that was democratic
enough,” said some one.</p>
        <p>Governor Moore came in with the latest news—a telegram
<pb id="mches9" n="9"/>
from Governor Pickens to the President, “ that a 
war steamer is lying off the Charleston bar laden with 
reenforcements for Fort Sumter, and what must we do?” 
Answer: “Use your own discretion!”  There is faith for 
you, after all is said and done.  It is believed there is still 
some discretion left in South Carolina fit for use.</p>
        <p>Everybody who comes here wants an office, and the 
many who, of course, are disappointed raise a cry of corruption 
against the few who are successful.  I thought we 
had left all that in Washington.  Nobody is willing to be 
out of sight, and all will take office.</p>
        <p>“Constitution” Browne says he is going to Washington
 for twenty-four hours.  I mean to send by him to Mary 
Garnett for a bonnet ribbon.  If they take him up as a 
traitor, he may cause a civil war.  War is now our dread. 
Mr.  Chesnut told him not to make himself a bone of contention.</p>
        <p>Everybody means to go into the army.  If Sumter is 
attacked, then Jeff Davis's troubles will begin.  The Judge
says a military despotism would be best for us—anything 
to prevent a triumph of the Yankees.  All right, but every 
man objects to any despot but himself.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chesnut, in high spirits, dines to-day with the 
Louisiana delegation.  Breakfasted with “Constitution” 
Browne, who is appointed Assistant Secretary of State, 
and so does not go to Washington.  There was at table the 
man who advertised for a wife, with the wife so obtained.  
She was not pretty.  We dine at Mr. Pollard's and go to 
a ball afterward at Judge Bibb's.  The New York Herald 
says Lincoln stood before Washington's picture at his inauguration, 
which was taken by the country as a good sign.  
We are always frantic for a good sign.  Let us pray that a 
Cæsar or a Napoleon may be sent us.  That would be our 
best sign of success.  But they still say, “No war.” Peace 
let it be, kind Heaven!</p>
        <p>Dr. De Leon called, fresh from Washington, and says 
<pb id="mches10" n="10"/>
General Scott is using all his power and influence to prevent 
officers from the South resigning their commissions, 
among other things promising that they shall never be sent 
against us in case of war.  Captain Ingraham, in his short, 
curt way, said: “That will never do.  If they take their 
government's pay they must do its fighting.”</p>
        <p>A brilliant dinner at the Pollards's.  Mr. Barnwell <ref targOrder="U" id="ref10" n="10" rend="sc" target="note10">1</ref>  took 
me down.  Came home and found the Judge and Governor 
Moore waiting to go with me to the Bibbs's.  And they say it 
is dull in Montgomery!  Clayton, fresh from Washington, 
was at the party and told us “there was to be peace.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February</hi> 28th.—In the drawing-room a literary lady 
began a violent attack upon this mischief-making South 
Carolina.  She told me she was a successful writer in the 
magazines of the day, but when I found she used “incredible”
for “incredulous,” I said not a word in defense of 
my native land.  I left her “incredible.” Another person 
came in, while she was pouring upon me her home troubles, 
and asked if she did not know I was a Carolinian.  Then 
she gracefully reversed her engine, and took the other tack, 
sounding our praise, but I left her incredible and I remained 
incredulous, too.</p>
        <p>Brewster says the war specks are growing in size.  Nobody 
at the North, or in Virginia, believes we are in earnest.

Virginia delegates were insulted at the peace conference;

        <p>The Judge thought Jefferson Davis rude to him 
when the latter was Secretary of War.  Mr. Chesnut persuaded 
the Judge to forego his private wrong for the public 
good, and so he voted for him, but now his old grudge 
has come back with an increased venomousness.  What a

 It seems to me already men are willing to risk an injury to 
our cause, if they may in so doing hurt Jeff Davis.</p>

individual who, for Christian scruples, refused to 
fight a duel with Stephens.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref13" n="13" rend="sc" target="note13">2</ref>  She seemed very proud of 
him for his conduct in the affair.  Ignoramus that I am, I 
had not heard of it.  I am having all kinds of experiences.  
Drove to-day with a lady who fervently wished her husband 
would go down to Pensacola and be shot.  I was dumb with 
amazement, of course.  Telling my story to one who knew
the parties, was informed, “Don't you know he beats

became a prominent supporter of secession.  He was a member of the 
Confederate Congress, which met in Montgomery in 1861, and served 
in the Confederate Senate until the end of the war.  After the war, he 
was elected to Congress and opposed the Reconstruction policy of that

        <p>Brewster says Lincoln passed through Baltimore disguised, 
and at night, and that he did well, for just now Baltimore 
is dangerous ground.  He says that he hears from 
all quarters that the vulgarity of Lincoln, his wife, and his 
son is beyond credence, a thing you must see before you 
can believe it.  Senator Stephen A. Douglas told Mr. Chesnut 
that “Lincoln is awfully clever, and that he had
 found him a heavy handful.”</p>
        <p>Went to pay my respects to Mrs. Jefferson Davis.  She 
met me with open arms.  We did not allude to anything 
by which we are surrounded.  We eschewed politics and 
our changed relations.</p>

They have one and all spoken in the Congress <ref targOrder="U" id="ref14" n="14" rend="sc" target="note14">1</ref>  to their

took me aside, and, after delivering a panegyric upon himself 
(but here, later, comes in the amazement), he praised 
my husband to the skies, and said he was the fittest man of 
all for a foreign mission.  Aye; and the farther away they 
send us from this Congress the better I will like it.</p>
        <p>Saw Jere Clemens and Nick Davis, social curiosities.  
They are Anti-Secession leaders; then George Sanders and 
George Deas.  The Georges are of opinion that it is 
folly to try to take back Fort Sumter from Anderson and 
the United States; that is, before we are ready.  They saw 
in Charleston the devoted band prepared for the sacrifice; 
I mean, ready to run their heads against a stone wall.  
Dare devils they are.  They have dash and courage enough,

        <p>I have seen a negro woman sold on the block at auction.  
She overtopped the crowd.  I was walking and felt faint, 
seasick.  The creature looked so like my good little Nancy, 
a bright mulatto with a pleasant face.  She was magnificently 
gotten up in silks and satins.  She seemed delighted 
with it all, sometimes ogling the bidders, sometimes looking 
quiet, coy, and modest, but her mouth never relaxed from 
its expanded grin of excitement.  I dare say the poor 
thing knew who would buy her.  I sat down on a stool in a 
shop and disciplined my wild thoughts.  I tried it Sterne 
fashion.  You know how women sell themselves and are 
sold in marriage from queens downward, eh?  You know
what the Bible says about slavery and marriage; poor 
women! poor slaves!  Sterne, with his starling—what did 
he know?  He only thought, he did not feel.</p>

female, she believed in her own inflexible virtue, but never 
trusted her husband out of sight.”</p>

bomb-proof; so he does not drive out.” Two flags and a

The sticks are to break our heads with.  The English are 
gushingly unhappy as to our family quarrel.  Magnanimous

        <p><hi rend="italics">March 5th</hi>.—We stood on the balcony to see our Confederate
flag go up.  Roars of cannon, etc., etc.  Miss Sanders 
complained (so said Captain Ingraham) of the deadness of 
the mob.  “It was utterly spiritless,” she said; “no cheering, 
or so little, and no enthusiasm.” Captain Ingraham 
suggested that gentlemen “are apt to be quiet,” and this 
was “a thoughtful crowd, the true mob element with us 
just -now is hoeing corn.” And yet!  It is uncomfortable 
that the idea has gone abroad that we have no joy, no 
pride, in this thing.  The band was playing “Massa in the
cold, cold ground.” Miss Tyler, daughter of the former 
President of the United States, ran up the flag.</p>
        <p>Captain Ingraham pulled out of his pocket some verses 
sent to him by a Boston girl.  They were well rhymed and 
amounted to this: she held a rope ready to hang him, 
though she shed tears when she remembered his heroic rescue
of Koszta.  Koszta, the rebel!  She calls us rebels, too.  
So it depends upon whom one rebels against—whether to 
save or not shall be heroic.</p>
        <p>I must read Lincoln's inaugural.  Oh, “comes he in

States.</p>
        <p>The people, the natives, I mean, are astounded that I

not like the people I knew in Washington.</p>

—William, Mrs. de Saussure's former coachman.  I remember 
him on his box, driving a handsome pair of bays, 
dressed sumptuously in blue broadcloth and brass buttons; 
a stout, respectable, fine-looking, middle-aged mulatto. 
He was very high and mighty.</p>
        <p>Night after night we used to meet him as fiddler-in-chief 
of all our parties.  He sat in solemn dignity, making faces 
over his bow, and patting his foot with an emphasis that 
shook the floor.  We gave him five dollars a night; that was 
his price.  His mistress never refused to let him play for 
any party. He had stable-boys in abundance.  He was far 
above any physical fear for his sleek and well-fed person. 
How majestically he scraped his foot as a sign that he was 
tuned up and ready to begin!</p>
        <p>Now he is a shabby creature indeed.  He must have felt 
his fallen fortunes when he met me—one who knew him in 
his prosperity.  He ran away, this stately yellow gentleman, 
from wife and children, home and comfort.  My

know.”  I wonder who owns him now; he looked forlorn.</p>

our neighborhood, in whom my father <ref targOrder="U" id="ref17" n="17" rend="sc" target="note17">1</ref> saw promise of better 
things, and so helped him in every way to rise, with 
books, counsel, sympathy.  I was enjoying his conversation
immensely, for he was praising my father I without stint, 
when the Judge came in, breathing fire and fury.  Congress 
has incurred his displeasure.  We are abusing one another

Dr. Boykin behaved strangely.  All day he had been gaily

To-night, in this brilliant company, he sat dead still as if
in a trance.  Once, he waked somewhat—when a high public

gondola, “A perfect Venetian specimen,” he assured me 
again and again.  In an undertone Dr. Boykin muttered:
“That fellow has been drinking.” “Why do you think 
so?” “Because he has told you exactly the same thing 
four times.” Wonderful!  Some of these great statesmen 
always tell me the same thing—and have been telling me 
the same thing ever since we came here.</p>
        <p>A man came in and some one said in an undertone, 
“The age of chivalry is not past, O ye Americans!”
“What do you mean?”  “That man was once nominated 
by President Buchanan for a foreign mission, but some Senator 
stood up and read a paper printed by this man abusive 
of a woman, and signed by his name in full.  After that 
the Senate would have none of him; his chance was gone
forever.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 11th</hi>.—In full conclave to-night, the drawing-room 
crowded with Judges, Governors, Senators, Generals, 
Congressmen.  They were exalting John C. Calhoun's hospitality.  
He allowed everybody to stay all night who chose 
to stop at his house.  An ill-mannered person, on one occasion,
refused to attend family prayers. Mr.  Calhoun said 
to the servant, “Saddle that man's horse and let him go.” 
From the traveler Calhoun would take no excuse for the 
“Deity offended.” I believe in Mr. Calhoun's hospitality,
but not in his family prayers. Mr.  Calhoun's piety was of
the most philosophical type, from all accounts. <ref targOrder="U" id="ref18" n="18" rend="sc" target="note18">1</ref></p>
        <p>The latest news is counted good news; that is, the last 
man who left Washington tells us that Seward is in the 
ascendancy.  He is thought to be the friend of peace.
<note id="note18" n="18" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref18">1. John C. Calhoun had died in March, 1850.</note>
<pb id="mches18" n="18"/>
The man did say, however that “that serpent Seward is
in the ascendancy just now.”</p>
        <p>Harriet Lane has eleven suitors.  One is described as
likely to win, or he would be likely to win, except that he is 
too heavily weighted.  He has been married before and 
goes about with children and two mothers.  There are limits
beyond which!  Two mothers-in-law!</p>
        <p>Mr. Ledyard spoke to Mrs. Lincoln in behalf of a doorkeeper 
who almost felt he had a vested right, having been 
there since Jackson's time; but met with the same answer; 
she had brought her own girl and must economize.  Mr. 
Ledyard thought the twenty thousand (and little enough it 
is) was given to the President of these United States to 
enable him to live in proper style, and to maintain an establishment 
of such dignity as befits the head of a great nation.  
It is an infamy to economize with the public money
and to put it into one's private purse.  Mrs. Browne was 
walking with me when we were airing our indignation 
against Mrs. Lincoln and her shabby economy.  The Herald 
says three only of the <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">élite</hi></foreign> Washington families attended 
the Inauguration Ball.</p>
        <p>The Judge has just come in and said: “Last night,
after Dr. Boykin left on the cars, there came a telegram 
that his little daughter, Amanda, had died suddenly.” In 
some way he must have known it beforehand.  He changed 
so suddenly yesterday, and seemed so careworn and unhappy. 
He believes in clairvoyance, magnetism, and all 
that.  Certainly, there was some terrible foreboding of 
this kind on his part.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Tuesday</hi>.—Now this, they say, is positive: “Fort Sumter 
is to be released and we are to have no war.” After 
all, far too good to be true.  Mr. Browne told us that, at 
one of the peace intervals (I mean intervals in the interest 
of peace), Lincoln flew through Baltimore, locked up in an
express car.  He wore a Scotch cap.</p>
        <p>We went to the Congress.  Governor Cobb, who presides 
<pb id="mches19" n="19"/>
over that august body, put James Chesnut in the
chair, and came down to talk to us.  He told us why the 
pay of Congressmen was fixed in secret session, and why the
amount of it was never divulged—to prevent the lodginghouse 
and hotel people from making their bills of a size to 
cover it all.  “The bill would be sure to correspond with
the pay,” he said.</p>
        <p>In the hotel parlor we had a scene.  Mrs. Scott was 
describing Lincoln, who is of the cleverest Yankee type. 
She said: “Awfully ugly, even grotesque in appearance, 
the kind who are always at the corner stores, sitting on 
boxes, whittling sticks, and telling stories as funny as they
are vulgar.” Here I interposed: “But Stephen A.
Douglas said one day to Mr. Chesnut,  ‘Lincoln is the hardest 
fellow to handle I have ever encountered yet.’ ”  Mr.  
Scott is from California, and said Lincoln is “an utter 
American specimen, coarse, rouge, and strong; a good-natured, 
kind creature; as pleasant-tempered as he is clever, 
and if this country can be joked and laughed out of 
its rights he is the kind-hearted fellow to do it.  Now if 
there is a war and it pinches the Yankee pocket instead of
filling it—”</p>
        <p>Here a shrill voice came from the next room (which 
opened upon the one we were in by folding doors thrown 
wide open) and said: “Yankees are no more mean and 
stingy than you are.  People at the North are just as good 
as people at the South.” The speaker advanced upon us 
in great wrath.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Scott apologized and made some smooth, polite remark, 
though evidently much embarrassed.  But the vinegar 
face and curly pate refused to receive any concessions, 
and replied: “That comes with a very bad grace after what
you were saying,” and she harangued us loudly for several 
minutes.  Some one in the other room giggled outright, 
but we were quiet as mice.  Nobody wanted to hurt her 
feelings.  She was one against so many.  If I were at the 
<pb id="mches20" n="20"/>
North, I should expect them to belabor us, and should hold 
my tongue.  We separated North from South because of 
incompatibility of temper.  We are divorced because we 
have hated each other so.  If we could only separate, a
“<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">separation à l'agréable</hi></foreign>,” as the French say it, and not 
have a horrid fight for divorce.</p>
        <p>The poor exile had already been insulted, she said.  
She was playing “Yankee Doodle” on the piano before 
breakfast to soothe her wounded spirit, and the Judge came 
in and calmly requested her to “leave out the Yankee 
while she played the Doodle.” The Yankee end of it did
not suit our climate, he said; was totally out of place and
had got out of its latitude.</p>
        <p>A man said aloud: “This war talk is nothing.  It will 
soon blow over.  Only a fuss gotten up by that Charleston 
clique.” Mr. Toombs asked him to show his passports, for 
a man who uses such language is a suspicious character.</p>

        <p>CHARLESTON, S. C., <hi rend="italics">March 26, 1861</hi>.—I have just 
come from Mulberry, where the snow was a foot 
deep—winter at last after months of apparently
May or June weather.  Even the climate, like everything 
else, is upside down.  But after that den of dirt and horror, 
Montgomery Hall, how white the sheets looked, luxurious
bed linen once more, delicious fresh cream with my 
coffee!  I breakfasted in bed.</p>
        <p>Dueling was rife in Camden.  William M. Shannon 
challenged Leitner.  Rochelle Blair was Shannon's second and 
Artemus Goodwyn was Leitner's.  My husband was riding 
hard all day to stop the foolish people.  Mr. Chesnut 
finally arranged the difficulty.  There was a court of honor 
and no duel. Mr.  Leitner had struck Mr. Shannon at a 
negro trial.  That's the way the row began.  Everybody 
knows of it.  We suggested that Judge Withers should arrest 
the belligerents.  Dr. Boykin and Joe Kershaw <ref targOrder="U" id="ref19" n="19" rend="sc" target="note19">1</ref> aided 
Mr. Chesnut to put an end to the useless risk of life.</p>
        <p>John Chesnut is a pretty soft-hearted slave-owner.  He 
had two negroes arrested for selling whisky to his people 
on his plantation, and buying stolen corn from them.  The 
culprits in jail sent for him.  He found them (this snowy

weather) lying in the cold on a bare floor, and he thought 
that punishment enough; they having had weeks of it.  
But they were not satisfied to be allowed to evade justice 
and slip away.  They begged of him (and got) five dollars
to buy shoes to run away in.  I said: “Why, this is flat 
compounding a felony.” And Johnny put his hands in the 
armholes of his waistcoat and stalked majestically before 
me, saying, “Woman, what do you know about law?”</p>
        <p>Mrs. Reynolds stopped the carriage one day to tell me 
Kitty Boykin was to be married to Savage Heyward.  He 
has only ten children already.  These people take the old 
Hebrew pride in the number of children they have.  This 
is the true colonizing spirit.  There is no danger of crowding 
here and inhabitants are wanted.  Old Colonel Chesnut <ref targOrder="U" id="ref20" n="20" rend="sc" target="note20">1</ref>
 said one day: “Wife, you must feel that you have 
not been useless in your day and generation.  You have 
now twenty-seven great-grandchildren.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Wednesday</hi>.—I have been mobbed by my own house servants. 
 Some of them are at the plantation, some hired out 
at the Camden hotel, some are at Mulberry.  They agreed 
to come in a body and beg me to stay at home to keep my 
own house once more, “as I ought not to have them scattered 
and distributed every which way.” I had not been 
a month in Camden since 1858.  So a house there would be 
for their benefit solely, not mine.  I asked my cook if she
lacked anything on the plantation at the Hermitage.
“Lack anything?” she said, “I lack everything.  What 
are corn-meal, bacon, milk, and molasses?  Would that be

as you does all these years?  When I cook for you, didn't I
have some of all?  Dere, now!”  Then she doubled herself
up laughing.  They all shouted, “Missis, we is crazy for
you to stay home.”</p>
        <p>Armsted, my butler, said he hated the hotel.  Besides, 
he heard a man there abusing Marster, but Mr. Clyburne 
took it up and made him stop short.  Armsted said he 
wanted Marster to know Mr.  Clyburne was his friend and 
would let nobody say a word behind his back against him,
etc., etc.  Stay in Camden? Not if I can help it.  “Festers 
in provincial sloth”—that's Tennyson's way of putting it.</p>
        <p>“We” came down here by rail, as the English say.  
Such a crowd of Convention men on board.  John Manning <ref targOrder="U" id="ref21" n="21" rend="sc" target="note21">1</ref> 
flew in to beg me to reserve a seat by me for a young 
lady under his charge.  “<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">Place aux dames</hi></foreign>,” said my husband 
politely, and went off to seek a seat somewhere else.  
As soon as we were fairly under way, Governor Manning 
came back and threw himself cheerily down into the vacant 
place.  After arranging his umbrella and overcoat to his 
satisfaction, he coolly remarked: “I am the young lady.” 
He is always the handsomest man alive (now that poor 
William Taber has been killed in a duel), and he can be 
very agreeable that is, when he pleases to be so.  He does 
not always please.  He seemed to have made his little 
maneuver principally to warn me of impending danger to 
my husband's political career.  “Every election now will 
be a surprise.  New cliques are not formed yet.  The old 
ones are principally bent upon displacing one another.” 
“But the Yankees, those dreadful Yankees!” “Oh,

never mind, we are going to take care of home folks first!  
How will you like to rusticate?—go back and mind your 
own business?”  “If I only knew  what that was—what 
was my own business.”</p>
        <p>Our round table consists of the Judge, Langdon 
Cheves, <ref targOrder="U" id="ref22" n="22" rend="sc" target="note22">1</ref> Trescott, <ref targOrder="U" id="ref23" n="23" rend="sc" target="note23">2</ref> and ourselves.  Here are four of the 
cleverest men that we have, but such very different people, 
as opposite in every characteristic as the four points of 
the compass.  Langdon Cheves and my husband have feelings 
and ideas in common.   Mr.  Petigru, <ref targOrder="U" id="ref24" n="24" rend="sc" target="note24">3</ref>  said of the brilliant 
Trescott: “He is a man without indignation.” Trescott 
and I laugh at everything.</p>
        <p>The Judge, from his life as solicitor, and then on the 
bench, has learned to look for the darkest motives for every 
action.  His judgment on men and things is always so 
harsh, it shocks and repels even his best friends.  To-day 
he said: “Your conversation reminds me of a flashy
second-rate novel.” “How?” “By the quantity of French 
you sprinkle over it.  Do you wish to prevent us from understanding 
you?” “No,” said Trescott, “ we are using 
French against Africa.  We know the black waiters are all 
ears now, and we want to keep what we have to say dark.

survived among lawyers because of the fine work he did in codifying 
the laws of South Carolina.</note>

We can't afford to take them into our confidence, you
know.”</p>
        <p>This explanation Trescott gave with great rapidity and 
many gestures toward the men standing behind us.  Still 
speaking the French language, his apology was exasperating, 
so the Judge glared at him, and, in unabated rage, 
turned to talk with Mr. Cheves, who found it hard to keep 
a calm countenance.</p>
        <p>On the Battery with the Rutledges, Captain Hartstein 
was introduced to me.  He has done some heroic things—
brought home some ships and is a man of mark.  Afterward
he sent me a beautiful bouquet, not half so beautiful, 
however, as Mr. Robert Gourdin's, which already occupied 
the  place of honor on my center table.  What a dear, delightful 
place is Charleston!</p>
        <p>A lady (who shall be nameless because of her story) 
came to see me to-day.  Her husband has been on the Island 
with the troops for months.  She has just been down to see 
him.  She meant only to call on him, but he persuaded her
to stay two days.  She carried him some clothes made from
his old measure.  Now they are a mile too wide.  “So 
much for a hard life!” I said.</p>
        <p>“No, no,” said she, “they are all jolly down there.  
He has trained down; says it is good for him, and he likes 
the life.” Then she became confidential, although it was 
her first visit to me, a perfect stranger.  She had taken 
no clothes down there—pushed, as she was, in that manner 
under Achilles's tent.  But she managed things; she tied 
her petticoat around her neck for a nightgown.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 2d</hi>.—Governor Manning came to breakfast at 
our table.  The others had breakfasted hours before.  I 
looked at him in amazement, as he was in full dress, ready 
for a ball, swallow-tail and all, and at that hour.  “What 
is the matter with you?” “Nothing, I am not mad, most 
noble madam.  I am only going to the photographer.  My 
wife wants me taken thus.” He insisted on my going, too,
<pb id="mches26" n="26"/>
and we captured Mr. Chesnut and Governor Means. <ref targOrder="U" id="ref25" n="25" rend="sc" target="note25">1</ref> The 
latter presented me with a book, a photo-book, in which I 
am to pillory all the celebrities.</p>
        <p>Doctor Gibbes says the Convention is in a snarl.  It was 
called as a Secession Convention.  A secession of places 
seems to be what it calls for first of all.  It has not stretched 
its eyes out to the Yankees yet; it has them turned inward;
introspection is its occupation still.</p>
        <p>Last night, as I turned down the gas, I said to myself: 
“Certainly this has been one of the pleasantest days of my 
life.” I can only give the skeleton of it, so many pleasant
people, so much good talk, for, after all, it was talk, talk, 
talk <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">à la Caroline du Sud</hi></foreign>.  And yet the day began rather 
dismally.  Mrs.  Capers and Mrs. Tom Middleton came for 
me and we drove to Magnolia Cemetery.  I saw William 
Taber's broken column.  It was hard to shake off the
blues after this graveyard business.</p>
        <p>The others were off at a dinner party.  I dined <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">tête-à-tête</hi></foreign>
with Langdon Cheves, so quiet, so intelligent, so very 
sensible withal.  There never was a pleasanter person, or a 
better man than he.  While we were at table, Judge Whitner, 
Tom Frost, and Isaac Hayne came.  They broke up 
our deeply interesting conversation, for I was hearing 
what an honest and brave man feared for his country, and 
then the Rutledges dislodged the newcomers and bore me 
off to drive on the Battery.  On the staircase met Mrs. 
Izard, who came for the same purpose.  On the Battery 
Governor Adams <ref targOrder="U" id="ref26" n="26" rend="sc" target="note26">2</ref> stopped us.  He had heard of my saying 
he looked like Marshal Pelissier, and he came to say

that at last I had made a personal remark which pleased 
him, for once in my life.  When we came home Mrs. Isaac 
Hayne and Chancellor Carroll called to ask us to join 
their excursion to the Island Forts to-morrow.  With them 
was William Haskell.  Last summer at the White Sulphur 
he was a pale, slim student from the university.  To-day 
he is a soldier, stout and robust.  A few months in camp, 
with soldiering in the open air, has worked this wonder.  
Camping out proves a wholesome life after all.  Then came
those nice, sweet, fresh, pure-looking Pringle girls.  We 
had a charming topic in common—their clever brother
Edward.</p>
        <p>A letter from Eliza B., who is in Montgomery: “Mrs. 
Mallory got a letter from a lady in Washington a few days 
ago, who said that there had recently been several attempts 
to be gay in Washington, but they proved dismal failures.  
The Black Republicans were invited and came, and stared 
at their entertainers and their new Republican companions 
looked unhappy while they said they were enchanted 
showed no ill-temper at the hardly stifled grumbling and 
growling of our friends, who thus found themselves condemned 
to meet their despised enemy.”</p>
        <p>I had a letter from the Gwinns to-day.  They say
Washington  offers a perfect realization of Goldsmith's Deserted 
Village.</p>
        <p>Celebrated my 38th birthday, but I am too old now to 
dwell in public on that unimportant anniversary.  A long, 
dusty day ahead on those windy islands; never for me, so 
I was up early to write a note of excuse to Chancellor Carroll. 
My husband went.  I hope Anderson will not pay 
them the compliment of a salute with shotted guns, as they 
pass Fort Sumter, as pass they must.</p>
        <p>Here I am interrupted by an exquisite bouquet from the 
Rutledges.  Are there such roses anywhere else in the 
world?  Now a loud banging at my door.  I get up in a
pet and throw it wide open.  “Oh!” said John Manning,
<pb id="mches28" n="28"/>
standing there, smiling radiantly; “pray excuse the noise
I made.  I mistook the number; I thought it was Rice's 
room; that is my excuse.  Now that I am here, come, go 
with us to Quinby's.  Everybody will be there who are
not at the Island.  To be photographed is the rage just
now. </p>
        <p>We had a nice open carriage, and we made a number 
of calls, Mrs. Izard, the Pringles, and the Tradd Street 
Rutledges, the handsome ex-Governor doing the honors 
gallantly.  He had ordered dinner at six, and we dined tete-a-tete. 
If he should prove as great a captain in ordering his 
line of battle as he is in ordering a dinner, it will be as well
for the country as it was for me to-day.</p>
        <p>Fortunately for the men, the beautiful Mrs. Joe Heyward 
sits at the next table, so they take her beauty as one 
of the goods the gods provide.  And it helps to make life 
pleasant with English grouse and venison from the West. 
Not to speak of the salmon from the lakes which began 
the feast.  They have me to listen, an appreciative audience, 
while they talk, and Mrs. Joe Heyward to look at.</p>

is, he is believed to be capable of great things.  A hero 
worshiper was struck dumb because I said: “So far, he
has only been a captain of artillery, or engineers, or something.”
I did not see him.  Mrs. Wigfall did and reproached 
my laziness in not coming out.</p>

        <p>Not one word of what is going on now.  “Out of the
fulness of the heart the mouth speaketh,” says the Psalmist.  
Not so here.  Our hearts are in doleful dumps, but we 
are as gay, as madly jolly, as sailors who break into the 
strong-room when the ship is going down.  At first in our 
great agony we were out alone.  We longed for some of 
our big brothers to come out and help us.  Well, they are 
out, too, and now it is Fort Sumter and that ill-advised 
Anderson.  There stands Fort Sumter, <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">en evidence</hi></foreign>, and

Governor, and Trescott were openly against secession; 
Trescott does not pretend to like it now.  He grumbles all 
the time, but Governor Pickens is fire-eater down to the 
ground.  “At the White House Mrs.  Davis wore a badge. 
Jeff Davis is no seceder,” says Mrs. Wigfall.</p>
        <p>Captain Ingraham comments in his rapid way, words 
tumbling over each other out of his mouth: “Now, Charlotte 
Wigfall meant that as a fling at those people.  I think 
better of men who stop to think; it is too rash to rush on 
as some do.” “And so,” adds Mrs. Wigfall, “the 
eleventh-hour men are rewarded; the half-hearted are traitors 
in this row.”</p>

        <p>“And you, who are laughing in your sleeves at the

of heartsease on the well-known inquirer who, once

after heartsease cometh rue.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 4th</hi>.—Mr. Hayne said his wife moaned over the 
hardness of the chaperones' seats at St. Andrew's Hall at 
a Cecilia Ball. <ref targOrder="U" id="ref29" n="29" rend="sc" target="note29">1</ref> She was hopelessly deposited on one for 
hours.  “And the walls are harder, my dear.  What are your 
feelings to those of the poor old fellows leaning there, with,
their beautiful young wives waltzing as if they could never 
tire and in the arms of every man in the room.  Watch 
their haggard, weary faces, the old boys, you know.  At 
church I had to move my pew.  The lovely Laura was too 
much for my boys.  They all made eyes at her, and nudged 
each other and quarreled so,  for she gave them glance for 
glance.  Wink, blink, and snicker as they would, she liked
it.  I say, my dear, the old husbands have not exactly a 
bed of roses; their wives  twirling in the arms of young 
men, they hugging the wall.”</p>

sent for to address a crowd before the Mills House piazza.  
Like James Fitz James when he visits Glen Alpin again, 
it is to be in the saddle, etc.  So let Washington beware.

        <p>A ship was fired into yesterday, and went back to sea.  
Is that the first shot?  How can one settle down to anything; 
one's heart is in one's mouth all the time.  Any moment 
the cannon may open on us, the fleet come in.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 6th.</hi>—The plot thickens, the air is red hot with 
rumors; the mystery is to find out where these utterly 
groundless tales originate.  In spite of all, Tom Huger 
came for us and we went on the Planter to take a look 
at Morris Island and its present inhabitants—Mrs.  Wigfall 
and the Cheves girls, Maxcy Gregg and Colonel Whiting, 
also John Rutledge, of the Navy, Dan Hamilton, and William 
Haskell.  John Rutledge was a figurehead to be proud 
of. He did not speak to us.  But he stood with a Scotch 
shawl draped about him, as handsome and stately a creature 
as ever Queen Elizabeth loved to look upon.</p>
        <p>There came up such a wind we could not land.  I was 
not too sorry, though it blew so hard (I am never seasick).  
Colonel Whiting explained everything about the forts, what 
they lacked, etc., in the most interesting way, and Maxcy 
Gregg supplemented his report by stating all the deficiencies 
and shortcomings by land.</p>
        <p>Beauregard is a demigod here to most of the natives, 
but there are always seers who see and say.  They give 
you to understand that Whiting has all the brains now in 
use for our defense.  He does the work and Beauregard 
reaps the glory.  Things seem to draw near a crisis.  And 
one must think.  Colonel Whiting is clever enough for 
anything, so we made up our minds to-day, Maxcy Gregg 
and I, as judges.  Mr. Gregg told me that my husband was 
in a minority in the Convention; so much for cool sense 
when the atmosphere is phosphorescent.  Mrs. Wigfall says 
we are mismatched.  She should pair with my cool, quiet, 
self-poised Colonel. And her stormy petrel is but a male
reflection of me.</p>
        <pb id="mches32" n="32"/>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 8th</hi>.—Yesterday Mrs. Wigfall and I made a few 
visits.  At the first house they wanted Mrs. Wigfall to settle 
a dispute.  “Was she, indeed, fifty-five?” Fancy her 
face, more than ten years bestowed upon her so freely.  
Then Mrs. Gibbes asked me if I had ever been in Charleston 
before.  Says Charlotte Wigfall (to pay me for my 
snigger when that false fifty was flung in her teeth),  “and 
she thinks this is her native heath and her name is McGregor.”
She said it all came upon us for breaking the 
Sabbath, for indeed it was Sunday.</p>
        <p>Allen Green came up to speak to me at dinner in all his 
soldier's toggery.  It sent a shiver through me.  Tried to
read Margaret Fuller Ossoli, but could not.  The air is 
too full of war news, and we are all so restless.</p>
        <p>Went to see Miss Pinckney, one of the last of the old-world 
Pinckneys.  She inquired particularly about a portrait 
of her father, Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, <ref targOrder="U" id="ref30" n="30" rend="sc" target="note30">1</ref> which 
she said had been sent by him to my husband's grandfather. 
I gave a good account of it.  It hangs in the place 
of honor in the drawing-room at Mulberry.  She wanted 
to see my husband, for “his grandfather, my father's 
friend, was one of the handsomest men of his day.”  We 
came home, and soon Mr. Robert Gourdin and Mr.  Miles 
called.  Governor Manning walked in, bowed gravely, and 
seated himself by me.  Again he bowed low in mock heroic 
style, and with a grand wave of his hand, said: “Madame, 
your country is invaded.” When I had breath to speak,
I asked, “What does he mean?” He meant this: there

and a member of the Convention that framed the Constitution

States Minister to France.  He was the Federalist candidate for Vice-President 
in 1800 and for President in 1804 and 1808.  Other distinguished 
men in this family were Thomas, Charles, Henry Laurens, and 
Charles Cotesworth Pinckney, the second.</note>
<pb id="mches33" n="33"/>
are six men-of-war outside the bar.  Talbot and Chew have
come to say that hostilities are to begin.  Governor Pickens
and Beauregard are holding a council of war.  Mr. Chesnut
then came in and confirmed the story.  Wigfall next entered
in boisterous spirits, and said: “There was a sound
of revelry by night.”  In any stir or confusion my heart
is apt to beat so painfully.   Now the agony was so stifling 
I could hardly see or hear.  The men went off almost immediately.  
And I crept silently to my room, where I sat
down to a good cry.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Wigfall came in and we had it out on the subject 
of civil war.  We solaced ourselves with dwelling on all its 
known horrors, and then we added what we had a right 
to expect with Yankees in front and negroes in the rear. 
“The slave-owners must expect a servile insurrection, of 
course,” said Mrs. Wigfall, to make sure that we were
unhappy enough.</p>
        <p>Suddenly loud shooting was heard.  We ran out.  Cannon 
after cannon roared.  We met Mrs. Allen Green in 
the passageway with blanched cheeks and streaming eyes.  
Governor Means rushed out of his room in his dressing-gown 
and begged us to be calm.  “Governor Pickens,” 
said he, “has ordered in the plenitude of his wisdom, 
seven cannon to be fired as a signal to the Seventh Regiment.  
Anderson will hear as well as the Seventh Regiment.  
Now you go back and be quiet; fighting in the
streets has not begun yet.”</p>
        <p>So we retired.  Dr. Gibbes calls Mrs. Allen Green Dame 
Placid.  There was no placidity to-day, with cannon bursting 
and  Allen on the Island.  No sleep for anybody last 
night.  The streets were alive with soldiers, men shouting, 
marching, singing.  Wigfall, the “stormy petrel,” is in 
his glory, the only thoroughly happy person I see.  To-day 
things seem to have settled down a little.  One can but 
hope still.  Lincoln, or Seward, has made such silly advances 
and then far sillier drawings back.  There may be a 
<pb id="mches34" n="34"/>
chance for peace after all.  Things are happening so fast. 
My husband has been made an aide-de-camp to General 
Beauregard.</p>
        <p>Three hours ago we were quickly packing to go home.  
The Convention has adjourned.  Now he tells me the attack 
on Fort Sumter may begin to-night; depends upon Anderson 
and the fleet outside.  The Herald says that this show 
of war outside of the bar is intended for Texas.  John Manning 
came in with his sword and red sash, pleased as a boy 
to be on Beauregard's staff, while the row goes on.  He 
has gone with Wigfall to Captain Hartstein with instructions. 
Mr.  Chesnut is finishing a  report he had to make 
to the Convention.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hayne called.  She had, she said, but one feeling;
pity for those who are not here.  Jack Preston, Willie
Alston,  “the take-life-easys,” as they are called, with John
Green, “the big brave,” have gone down to the islands—
volunteered as privates.  Seven hundred men were sent 
over.  Ammunition wagons were rumbling along the streets 
all night.  Anderson is burning blue lights, signs, and 
signals for the fleet outside, I suppose.</p>
        <p>To-day at dinner there was no allusion to things as they 
stand in Charleston Harbor.  There was an undercurrent 
of intense excitement.  There could not have been a more 
brilliant circle.  In addition to our usual quartette (Judge 
Withers, Langdon Cheves, and Trescott), our two ex-Governors 
dined with us, Means and Manning.  These men all 
talked so delightfully.  For once in my life I listened.  
That over, business began in earnest.  Governor Means had 
rummaged a sword and red sash from somewhere and 
brought it for Colonel Chesnut, who had gone to demand 
the surrender of Fort Sumter.  And now patience—we 
must wait.</p>
        <p>Why did that green goose Anderson go into Fort Sumter? 
Then everything began to go wrong.  Now they have 
intercepted a letter from him urging them to let him surrender.
<pb id="mches35" n="35"/>
He paints the horrors likely to ensue if they will 
not.  He ought to have thought of all that before he put 
his head in the hole.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 12th</hi>.—Anderson will not capitulate.  Yesterday's 
was the merriest, maddest dinner we have had yet.  Men 
were audaciously wise and witty.  We had an unspoken 
foreboding that it was to be our last pleasant meeting. 
Mr.  Miles dined with us to-day.  Mrs. Henry King rushed 
in saying, “The news, I come for the latest news.  All the 
men of the King family are on the Island,” of which fact 
she seemed proud.</p>
        <p>While she was here our peace negotiator, or envoy, 
came in—that is, Mr. Chesnut returned.  His interview 
with Colonel Anderson had been deeply interesting, but 
Mr. Chesnut was not inclined to be communicative.  He 
wanted his dinner.  He felt for Anderson and had telegraphed 
to President Davis for instructions—what answer 
to give Anderson, etc.  He has now gone back to Fort Sumter 
with additional instructions.  When they were about to 
leave the wharf A. H. Boykin sprang into the boat in great 
excitement.  He thought himself ill-used, with a likelihood 
of fighting and he to be left behind!</p>
        <p>I do not pretend to go to sleep.  How can I?  If Anderson 
does not accept terms at four, the orders are, he shall be 
fired upon.  I count four, St. Michael's bells chime out and 
I begin to hope.  At half-past four the heavy booming of a 
cannon.  I sprang out of bed, and on my knees prostrate I 
prayed as I never prayed before.</p>
        <p>There was a sound of stir all over the house, pattering 
of feet in the corridors.  All seemed hurrying one way.  
I put on my double-gown and a shawl and went, too.  It 
was to the housetop.  The shells were bursting.  In the 
dark I heard a man say, “Waste of ammunition.”  I knew 
my husband was rowing about in a boat somewhere in that 
dark bay, and that the shells were roofing it over, bursting 
toward the fort.  If Anderson was obstinate, Colonel   
<pb id="mches36" n="36"/>
Chesnut was to order the fort on one side to open fire.  
Certainly fire had begun.  The regular roar of the cannon, 
there it was.  And who could tell what each volley accomplished 
of death and destruction?</p>
        <p>The women were wild there on the housetop.  Prayers 
came from the women and imprecations from the men.  
And then a shell would light up the scene.  To-night they 
say the forces are to attempt to land.  We watched up 
there, and everybody wondered that Fort Sumter did not 
fire a shot.</p>
        <p>To-day Miles and Manning, colonels now, aides to 
Beauregard, dined with us.  The latter hoped I would keep 
the peace.  I gave him only good words, for he was to be 
under fire all day and night, down in the bay carrying 
orders, etc.</p>
        <p>Last night, or this morning truly, up on the housetop 
I was so weak and weary I sat down on something that 
looked like a black stool.  “Get up, you foolish woman.  
Your dress is on fire,” cried a man.  And he put me out. 
I was on a chimney and the sparks had caught my clothes. 
Susan Preston and Mr. Venable then came up.  But my 
fire had been extinguished before it burst out into a regular 
blaze.</p>
        <p>Do you know, after all that noise and our tears and 
prayers, nobody has been hurt; sound and fury signifying 
nothing—a delusion and a snare.</p>
        <p>Louisa Hamilton came here now.  This is a sort of news 
center.  Jack Hamilton, her handsome young husband, has 
all the credit of a famous battery, which is made of railroad 
iron.  Mr. Petigru calls it the boomerang, because it 
throws the balls back the way they came; so Lou Hamilton 
tells us.  During her first marriage, she had no children; 
hence the value of this lately achieved baby.  To divert 
Louisa from the glories of “the Battery,” of which she 
raves, we asked if the baby could talk yet.  “No, not 
exactly, but he imitates the big gun when he hears that.
<pb id="mches37" n="37"/>
He claps his hands and cries ‘Boom, boom.’ ” Her mind 
is distinctly occupied by three things: Lieutenant Hamilton, 
whom she calls “Randolph,” the baby, and the big
gun, and it refuses to hold more.</p>
        <p>Pryor, of Virginia, spoke from the piazza of the Charleston 
hotel.  I asked what he said.  An irreverent woman replied: 
“Oh, they all say the same thing, but he made 
great play with that long hair of his, which he is always
tossing aside!”</p>
        <p>Somebody came in just now and reported Colonel Chesnut 
asleep on the sofa in General Beauregard's room.  
After two such nights he must be so tired as to be able
to sleep anywhere.</p>
        <p>Just bade farewell to Langdon Cheves.  He is forced to 
go home and leave this interesting place.  Says he feels 
like the man that was not killed at Thermopylae.  I think 
he said that unfortunate had to hang himself when he got 
home for very shame.  Maybe he fell on his sword, which 
was the strictly classic way of ending matters.</p>
        <p>I do not wonder at Louisa Hamilton's baby; we hear 
nothing, can listen to nothing; boom, boom goes the cannon 
all the time.  The nervous strain is awful, alone in this 
darkened room.  “Richmond and Washington ablaze,” 
say the papers—blazing with excitement.  Why not?  To 
us these last days' events seem frightfully great.  We 
were all women on that iron balcony.  Men are only seen 
at a distance now.  Stark Means, marching under the piazza 
at the head of his regiment, held his cap in his hand all 
the time he was in sight.  Mrs. Means was leaning over and 
looking with tearful eyes, when an unknown creature 
asked, “Why did he take his hat off?” Mrs. Means stood 
straight up and said: “He did that in honor of his mother; 
he saw me.” She is a proud mother, and at the same time 
most unhappy.  Her lovely daughter Emma is dying in 
there, before her eyes, of consumption.  At that moment 
I am sure Mrs. Means had a spasm of the heart; at least,
<pb id="mches38" n="38"/>
she looked as I feel sometimes.  She took  my arm and we 
came in.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 13th</hi>.—Nobody has been hurt after all.  How gay 
we were last night.  Reaction after the dread of all the 
slaughter we thought those dreadful cannon were making.  
Not even a battery the worse for wear.  Fort Sumter has 
been on fire.  Anderson has not yet silenced any of our 
guns.  So the aides, still with swords and red sashes by 
way of uniform, tell us.  But the sound of those guns 
makes regular meals impossible.  None of us go to table.  
Tea-trays pervade the corridors going everywhere.  Some 
of the anxious hearts lie on their beds and moan in solitary 
misery.  Mrs. Wigfall and I solace ourselves with tea in 
my room.  These women have all a satisfying faith.  “God 
is on our side,” they say.  When we are shut in Mrs. Wigfall 
and I ask “Why?” “Of course, He hates the Yankees, 
we are told.  You'll think that well of Him.”</p>
        <p>Not by one word or look can we detect any change in 
the demeanor of these negro servants.  Lawrence sits at 
our door, sleepy and respectful, and profoundly indifferent. 
So are they all, but they carry it too far.  You could 
not tell that they even heard the awful roar going on in 
the bay, though it has been dinning in their ears night and 
day.  People talk before them as if they were chairs and 
tables.  They make no sign.  Are they stolidly stupid? or 
wiser than we are; silent and strong, biding their time?</p>
        <p>So tea and toast came; also came Colonel Manning, red 
sash and sword, to announce that he had been under fire, 
and didn't mind it.  He said gaily: “It is one of those 
things a fellow never knows how he will come out until he 
has been tried.  Now I know I am a worthy descendant of 
my old Irish hero of an ancestor, who held the British officer 
before him as a shield in the Revolution, and backed 
out of danger gracefully.” We talked of St. Valentine's 
eve, or the maid of Perth, and the drop of the white doe's 
blood that sometimes spoiled all.</p>

        <p>The war-steamers are still there, outside the bar.  And 
there are people who thought the Charleston bar “no 
good” to Charleston.  The bar is the silent partner, or 
sleeping partner, and in this fray it is doing us yeoman 
service.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 15th</hi>.—I did not know that one could live such 
days of excitement.  Some one called: “Come out!  There 
is a crowd coming.” A mob it was, indeed, but it was 
headed by Colonels Chesnut and Manning.  The crowd was 
shouting and showing these two as messengers of good 
news.  They were escorted to Beauregard's headquarters.  
Fort Sumter had surrendered!  Those upon the housetops 
shouted to us “The fort is on fire.” That had been the 
story once or twice before.</p>
        <p>When we had calmed down, Colonel Chesnut, who had 
taken it all quietly enough, if anything more unruffled 
than usual in his serenity, told us how the surrender came 
about.  Wigfall was with them on Morris Island when they 
saw the fire in the fort; he jumped in a little boat, and 
with his handkerchief as a white flag, rowed over.  Wigfall 
went in through a porthole.  When Colonel Chesnut 
arrived shortly after, and was received at the regular 
entrance, Colonel Anderson told him he had need to pick his 
way warily, for the place was all mined.  As far as I can 
make out the fort surrendered to Wigfall.  But it is all confusion.  
Our flag is flying there.  Fire-engines have been 
sent for to put out the fire.  Everybody tells you half of 
something and then rushes off to tell something else or to
hear the last news.</p>
        <p>In the afternoon, Mrs. Preston, <ref targOrder="U" id="ref31" n="31" rend="sc" target="note31">1</ref>  Mrs. Joe Heyward, 
and I drove around the Battery.  We were in an open carriage.

<pb id="mches40" n="40"/>
What a changed scene—the very liveliest crowd I 
think I ever saw, everybody talking at once.  All glasses 
were still turned on the grim old fort.</p>
        <p>Russell, <ref targOrder="U" id="ref32" n="32" rend="sc" target="note32">1</ref> the correspondent of the London Times, was 
there.  They took him everywhere.  One man got out 
Thackeray to converse with him on equal terms.  Poor 
Russell was awfully bored, they say.  He only wanted 
to see the fort and to get news suitable to make up into 
an interesting article.  Thackeray had become stale over 
the water.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Frank Hampton <ref targOrder="U" id="ref33" n="33" rend="sc" target="note33">2</ref>  and I went to see the camp of the 
Richland troops.  South Carolina College had volunteered
to a boy.  Professor Venable (the mathematical), intends to 
raise a company from among them for the war, a permanent

at least.  Even the staid and severe of aspect, Clingman, 
is here.  He says Virginia and North Carolina are 
arming to come to our rescue, for now the North will 
swoop down on us.  Of that we may be sure.  We have 
burned our ships.  We are obliged to go on now.  He calls 
us a poor, little, hot-blooded, headlong, rash, and troublesome 
sister State.  General McQueen is in a rage because
we are to send troops to Virginia.</p>
        <p>Preston Hampton is in all the flush of his youth and 
beauty, six feet in stature; and after all only in his teens; 
he appeared in fine clothes and lemon-colored kid gloves to

bombarding did not kill anybody.  Before that, we wept 
and prayed and took our tea in groups in our rooms, away
from the haunts of men.</p>
        <p>Captain Ingraham and his kind also took Fort Sumter 
—from the Battery with field-glasses and figures made with 
their sticks in the sand to show what ought to be done.</p>
        <p>Wigfall, Chesnut, Miles, Manning, took it rowing about 
the harbor in small boats from fort to fort under the 
enemy's guns, with bombs bursting in air.</p>
        <p>And then the boys and men who worked those guns so 
faithfully at the forts—they took it, too, in their own way.</p>
        <p>Old Colonel Beaufort Watts told me this story and 
many more of the <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">jeunesse dorée</hi></foreign> under fire.  They took the 
fire easily, as they do most things.  They had cotton bag 
bomb-proofs at Fort Moultrie, and when Anderson's shot 
knocked them about some one called out “Cotton is falling.” 
Then down went the kitchen chimney, loaves of 
<pb id="mches43" n="43"/>
bread flew out, and they cheered gaily, shouting,  “Breadstuffs
are rising.”</p>
        <p>Willie  Preston fired the shot which broke Anderson's 
flag-staff.  Mrs. Hampton from Columbia telegraphed him,
“Well done, Willie!” She is his grandmother, the wife, 
or widow, of General Hampton, of the Revolution, and the 
mildest, sweetest, gentlest of old ladies.  This shows how
the war spirit is waking us all up.</p>
        <p>Colonel Miles (who won his spurs in a boat, so William 
Gilmore Simms <ref targOrder="U" id="ref34" n="34" rend="sc" target="note34">1</ref> said) gave us this characteristic anecdote.  
They met a negro out in the bay rowing toward the city 
with some plantation supplies, etc.  “Are you not afraid 
of Colonel Anderson's cannon?” he was asked.  “No, 
sar,  Mars Anderson ain't daresn't hit me; he know Marster
wouldn't  'low it.”</p>
        <p>I have been sitting idly to-day looking out  upon this 
beautiful lawn, wondering if this can be the same world 
I was in a few days ago.  After the smoke and the din of
the battle, a calm.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 22d</hi>.—Arranging my photograph book.  On the 
first page, Colonel Watts.  Here goes a sketch of his life; 
romantic enough, surely: Beaufort Watts; bluest blood; 
gentleman to the tips of his fingers; chivalry incarnate.  
He was placed in charge of a large amount of money, in 
bank bills.  The money belonged to the State and he was 
to deposit it in the bank.  On the way he was obliged to 
stay over one night.  He put the roll on a table at his bedside, 
locked himself in, and slept the sleep of the righteous.  
Lo, next day when he awaked, the money was gone.  Well! 
all who knew him believed him innocent, of course.  He 
searched and they searched, high and low, but to no purpose.  
The money had vanished.  It was a damaging story,
<note id="note34" n="34" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref34">1. William Gilmore Simms, the Southern novelist, was born in
Charleston in 1806.  He was the author of a great many volumes dealing
with Southern life, and at one time they were widely read.</note>
<pb id="mches44" n="44"/>
in spite of his previous character, and a cloud rested on
him.</p>
        <p>Years afterward the house in which he had taken 
that disastrous sleep was pulled down.  In the wall, behind 
the wainscot, was found his pile of money.  How the rats 
got it through so narrow a crack it seemed hard to realize.  
Like the hole mentioned by Mercutio, it was not as deep as 
a well nor as wide as a church door, but it did for Beaufort 
Watts until the money was found.  Suppose that house had 
been burned or the rats had gnawed up the bills past 
recognition?</p>
        <p>People in power understood how this proud man suffered 
those many years in silence.  Many men looked 
askance at him.  The country tried to repair the work of 
blasting the man's character.  He was made Secretary of 
Legation to Russia, and was afterward our Consul at 
Santa Fe de Bogota.  When he was too old to wander far 
afield, they made him Secretary to all the Governors of
 South Carolina in regular succession.</p>
        <p>I knew him more than twenty years ago as Secretary 
to the Governor.  He was a made-up old battered dandy, 
the soul of honor.  His eccentricities were all humored.  
Misfortune had made him sacred.  He stood hat in hand 
before ladies and bowed as I suppose Sir Charles Grandison 
might have done.  It was hard not to laugh at the purple 
and green shades of his overblack hair.  He came at 
one time to show me the sword presented to Colonel Shelton 
for killing the only Indian who was killed in the Seminole 
war.  We bagged Osceola and Micanopy under a flag 
of truce—that is, they were snared, not shot on the wing.</p>
        <p>To go back to my knight-errant: he knelt, handed me the 
sword, and then kissed my hand.  I was barely sixteen and 
did not know how to behave under the circumstances.  He 
said, leaning on the sword, “My dear child, learn that it is 
a much greater liberty to shake hands with a lady than to 
kiss her hand.  I have kissed the Empress of Russia's hand 
<pb id="mches45" n="45"/>
and she did not make faces at me.” He looks now just as
he did then.  He is in uniform, covered with epaulettes, 
aigulettes, etc., shining in the sun, and with his plumed hat 
reins up his war-steed and bows low as ever.</p>
        <p>Now I will bid farewell for a while as Othello did to all 
the “pomp, pride, and circumstance of glorious war,” and 
come down to my domestic strifes and troubles.  I have a 
sort of volunteer maid, the daughter of my husband's 
nurse, dear old Betsy.  She waits on me because she so 
pleases.  Besides, I pay her.  She belongs to my father-in-law, 
who has too many slaves to care very much about their 
way of life.  So Maria Whitaker came, all in tears.  She 
brushes hair delightfully, and as she stood at my back I 
could see her face in the glass.  “Maria, are you crying 
because all this war talk scares you?” said I. “No,
ma'am.” “What is the matter with you?” “Nothing 
more than common.” “Now listen.  Let the war end 
either way and you will be free.  We will have to free you 
before we get out of this thing.  Won't you be glad?” 
“Everybody knows Mars Jeems wants us free, and it is 
only old Marster holds hard.  He ain't going to free anybody 
any way, you see.”</p>
        <p>And then came the story of her troubles.  “Now, 
Miss Mary, you see me married to Jeems Whitaker yourself. 
I was a good and faithful wife to him, and we were comfortable 
every way—good house, everything.  He had no 
cause of complaint, but he has left me.” “For heaven's 
sake!  Why?” “Because I had twins.  He says they are 
not his because nobody named Whitaker ever had twins.”</p>
        <p>Maria is proud in her way, and the behavior of this bad 
husband has nearly mortified her to death.  She has had 
three children in two years.  No wonder the man was 
frightened.  But then Maria does not depend on him for 
anything.  She was inconsolable, and I could find nothing 
better to say than, “Come, now, Maria!  Never mind, your 
old Missis and Marster are so good to you.  Now let us 
<pb id="mches46" n="46"/>
look up something for the twins.”  The twins are named
“John and Jeems,” the latter for her false loon of a husband.  
Maria is one of the good colored women.  She deserved 
a better fate in her honest matrimonial attempt.  
But they do say she has a trying temper.  Jeems was tried, 
and he failed to stand the trial.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 23d</hi>.—Note the glaring inconsistencies of life.  
Our chatelaine locked up Eugene Sue, and returned even 
Washington Allston's novel with thanks and a decided
hint that it should be burned; at least it should not remain 
in her house.  Bad books are not allowed house room, except 
in the library under lock and key, the key in the Master's 
pocket; but bad women, if they are not white, or serve in a 
menial capacity, may swarm the house unmolested; the 
ostrich game is thought a Christian act.  Such women are 
no more regarded as a dangerous contingent than canary 
birds would be.</p>
        <p>If you show by a chance remark that you see some particular 
creature, more shameless than the rest, has no end 
of children, and no beginning of a husband, you are 
frowned down; you are talking on improper subjects.  
There are certain subjects pure-minded ladies never touch 
upon, even in their thoughts.  It does not do to be so hard 
and cruel.  It is best to let the sinners alone, poor things.  
If they are good servants otherwise, do not dismiss them; 
all that will come straight as they grow older, and it does!  
They are frantic, one and all, to be members of the church.  
The Methodist Church is not so pure-minded as to shut its 
eyes; it takes them up and turns them out with a high hand 
if they are found going astray as to any of the ten 
commandments.</p>

        <p>MONTGOMERY, Ala., <hi rend="italics">April</hi> 27, 1861.—Here we are
once more.  Hon.  Robert Barnwell came with us.  His
benevolent spectacles give him a most Pickwickian
expression.  We Carolinians revere his goodness above all 
things.  Everywhere, when the car stopped, the people 
wanted a speech, and we had one stream of fervid oratory.  
We came along with a man whose wife lived in Washington.  
He was bringing her to Georgia as the safest place.</p>
        <p>The Alabama crowd are not as confident of taking
Fort Pickens as we were of taking Fort Sumter.</p>
        <p>Baltimore is in a blaze.  They say Colonel Ben Huger 
is in command there—son of the “Olmutz” Huger.  General 
Robert E. Lee, son of Light Horse Harry Lee, has been 
made General-in-Chief of Virginia.  With such men to the 
fore, we have hope.  The New York Herald says, “Slavery 
must be extinguished, if in blood.” It thinks we are shaking 
in our shoes at their great mass meetings.  We are jolly
as larks, all the same.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chesnut has gone with Wade Hampton <ref targOrder="U" id="ref35" n="35" rend="sc" target="note35">1</ref>  to see 
President  Davis about the legion Wade wants to get up.
<note id="note35" n="35" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref35">1.  Wade Hampton was a son of another Wade Hampton, who was
an aide to General Jackson at the battle of New Orleans, and a grandson
of still another Wade Hampton, who was a general in the Revolution.
He was not in favor of secession, but when the war began he enlisted as
a private and then raised a command of infantry, cavalry, and artillery,
which as “Hampton's Legion” won distinction in the war.  After the
war, he was elected Governor of South Carolina and was then elected 
to the United States Senate.</note>

The President came across the aisle to speak to me at 
church to-day.  He was very cordial, and I appreciated the 
honor.</p>
        <p>Wigfall is black with rage at Colonel Anderson's account 
of the fall of Sumter.  Wigfall did behave magnanimously, 
but Anderson does not seem to see it in that light.  
“Catch me risking my life to save him again,” says Wigfall.  
“He might have been man enough to tell the truth 
to those New Yorkers, however unpalatable to them a good 
word for us might have been.  We did behave well to him.  
The only men of his killed, he killed himself, or they killed 
themselves firing a salute to their old striped rag.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Chesnut was delighted with the way Anderson spoke 
to him when he went to demand the surrender.  They 
parted quite tenderly.  Anderson said: “If we do not 
meet again on earth, I hope we may meet in Heaven.” 
How Wigfall laughed at Anderson   “giving Chesnut a 
howdy in the other world!”</p>
        <p>What a kind welcome the old gentlemen gave me!  One, 
more affectionate and homely than the others, slapped me 
on the back.  Several bouquets were brought me, and I put 
them in water around my plate.  Then General Owens 
gave me some violets, which I put in my breastpin.</p>
        <p>“Oh,” said my “Gutta Percha”  Hemphill,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref36" n="36" rend="sc" target="note36">1</ref>  “if I 
had known how those bouquets were to be honored I would 
have been up by daylight seeking the sweetest flowers!” 
Governor Moore came in, and of course seats were offered 
him.  “This is a most comfortable chair,” cried an 
overly polite person.  “The most comfortable chair is beside 
Mrs. Chesnut,” said the Governor, facing the music 
gallantly, as he sank into it gracefully.  Well done, old 
fogies!</p>

        <p>Browne said: “These Southern men have an awfully

        <p>At Mrs. Davis's reception dismal news, for civil war
seems certain.  At Mrs. Toombs's reception Mr. Stephens	
came by me. Twice before we have had it out on the subject	
of this Confederacy, once on the cars, coming from
Georgia here, once at a supper, where he sat next to me.
To-day he was not cheerful in his views.  I called him
half-hearted, and accused him of looking back.  Man after
man came and interrupted the conversation with some
frivle-fravle, but we held on.  He was deeply interesting, 
and he gave me some new ideas as to our dangerous situation.  
Fears for the future and not exultation at our successes
pervade his discourse.</p>
        <p>Dined at the President's and never had a pleasanter 
day.  He is as witty as he is wise.  He was very agreeable; 
he took me in to dinner.  The talk was of Washington; nothing 
of our present difficulties.</p>
        <p>A General Anderson from Alexandria, D. C., was in 
doleful dumps.  He says the North are so much better prepared 
than we are.  They are organized, or will be, by 
General Scott.  We are in wild confusion.  Their army is 
the best in the world.  We are wretchedly armed, etc., etc.  
They have ships and arms that were ours and theirs.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Walker, resplendently dressed, one of those gorgeously 
arrayed persons who fairly shine in the sun, tells 
me she mistook the inevitable Morrow for Mr. Chesnut, and 
added, “Pass over the affront to my powers of selection.” 
I told her it was “an insult to the Palmetto flag.”  Think
of a South Carolina Senator like that!</p>
        <p>Men come rushing in from Washington with white lips, 
crying, “Danger, danger!” It is very tiresome to have

these people always harping on this: “The enemy's 
troops are the finest body of men we ever saw.”  “Why 
did you not make friends of them,” I feel disposed to say. 
We would have war, and now we seem to be letting our 
golden opportunity pass; we are not preparing for war.  
There is talk, talk, talk in that Congress—lazy legislators, 
and rash, reckless, headlong, devil-may-care, proud, passionate, 
unruly, raw material for soldiers.  They say we have 
among us a regiment of spies, men and women, sent here 
by the wily Seward.  Why?  Our newspapers tell every 
word there is to be told, by friend or foe.</p>
        <p>A two-hours' call from Hon.  Robert Barnwell.  His 
theory is, all would have been right if we had taken Fort 
Sumter six months ago.  He made this very plain to me.  
He is clever, if erratic.  I forget why it ought to have been 
attacked before.  At another reception, Mrs. Davis was in 
fine spirits.  Captain Dacier was here.  Came over in his 
own yacht.  Russell, of The London Times, wondered how 
we had the heart to enjoy life so thoroughly when all the 
Northern papers said we were to be exterminated in such a
short time.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">May 9th</hi>.—Virginia Commissioners here.  Mr. Staples

        <p>Sumter Anderson has been offered a Kentucky regiment.  
Can they raise a regiment in Kentucky against us?
In Kentucky, our sister State?</p>
        <p>Suddenly General Beauregard and his aide (the last 
left him of the galaxy who surrounded him in Charleston), 
John Manning, have gone—Heaven knows where, but out 
on a war-path certainly.  Governor Manning called himself

Texas.  Senator Ward in appearance is the exact opposite 
of Senator Hemphill.  The latter, with the face of an old 
man, has the hair of a boy of twenty.  Mr.  Ward is fresh 
and fair, with blue eyes and a boyish face, but his head is 
white as snow.  Whether he turned it white in a single 
night or by slower process I do not know, but it is strangely 
out of keeping with his clear young eye.  He is thin, and
has a queer stooping figure.</p>
        <p>This story he told me of his own experience.  On a
Western steamer there was a great crowd and no unoccupied 
berth, or sleeping place of any sort whatsoever in 
the gentlemen's cabin—saloon, I think they called it.  He 
had taken a stateroom, 110, but he could not eject the people 
who had already seized it and were asleep in it.  Neither 
could the Captain.  It would have been a case of revolver
or “ 'leven inch Bowie-knife.”</p>
        <p>Near the ladies' Saloon the steward took pity on him.
“This man,” said he, “is 110, and I can find no place for 
him, poor fellow.”  There was a peep out of bright eyes:
“I say, steward, have you a man 110 years old out there?
Let us see him.  He must be a natural curiosity.”  “We 
are overcrowded,” was the answer, “and we can't find a 
place for him to sleep.”  “Poor old soul; bring him in
here.  We will take care of him.”</p>
        <p>“Stoop and totter,” sniggered the steward to No. 110,
“and go in.”</p>
        <p>“Ah,” said Mr. Ward, “how those houris patted and
pitied me and hustled me about and gave me the best berth!
I tried not to look;  I knew it was wrong,  but I looked.  I saw

        <p>One beauty who was disporting herself near his curtain 
suddenly caught his eye.  She stooped and gathered 
up her belongings as she said: “I say, stewardess, your 
old hundred and ten is a humbug.  His eyes are too blue 
for anything,” and she fled as he shut himself in, nearly 
frightened to death.  I forget how it ended.  There was so 
much laughing at his story I did not hear it all.  So much 
for hoary locks and their reverence-inspiring power!</p>
        <p>Russell, the wandering English newspaper correspondent, 
was telling how very odd some of our plantation habits 
were.  He was staying at the house of an ex-Cabinet Minister, 
and Madame would stand on the back piazza and 
send her voice three fields off, calling a servant.  Now that 
is not a Southern peculiarity.  Our women are soft, and 
sweet, low-toned, indolent, graceful, quiescent.  I dare say 
there are bawling, squalling, vulgar people everywhere.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">May 13th</hi>.—We have been down from Montgomery on 
the boat to that God-forsaken landing, Portland, Ala.  
Found everybody drunk—that is, the three men who were 
there.  At last secured a carriage to carry us to my 
brother-in-law's house.  Mr. Chesnut had to drive seven miles, 
pitch dark, over an unknown road.  My heart was in my 
mouth, which last I did not open.</p>
        <p>Next day a patriotic person informed us that, so great 
was the war fever only six men could be found in Dallas 
County.  I whispered to Mr. Chesnut: “We found three 
of the lone ones <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">hors de combat</hi></foreign> at Portland.” So much

        <p>Saw for the first time the demoralization produced by 
hopes of freedom.  My mother's butler (whom I taught 
to read, sitting on his knife-board) contrived to keep from 
speaking to us.  He was as efficient as ever in his proper 
place, but he did not come behind the scenes as usual and 
have a friendly chat.  Held himself aloof so grand and

stately we had to send him a “tip” through his wife
Hetty, mother's maid, who, however, showed no signs of
disaffection.  She came to my bedside next morning with
everything that was nice for breakfast.  She had let me
sleep till midday, and embraced me over and over again.
I remarked: “What a capital cook they have here!”  She 
curtsied to the ground.   “I cooked every mouthful on that
tray—as if I did not know what you liked to eat since you
was a baby.”</p>

money count so in war.   “As they do everywhere else,”
said I, doubting her accurate account of  Mr. Davis's
spoken words, though she tried to give them faithfully.  
We need patience and persistence.  There is enough and to
spare of pluck and dash among us, the do-and-dare style.</p>

came.  In college they called him from his initials, R. 
M. T.,  “Run Mad Tom” Hunter.  Just now I think he is 
the sanest, if not the wisest, man in our new-born Confederacy. 
I remember when I first met him.  He sat next to 
me at some state dinner in Washington.  Mr. Clay had 
taken me in to dinner, but seemed quite satisfied that my
“other side” should take me off his hands.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hunter did not know me, nor I him.  I suppose he 
inquired, or looked at my card, lying on the table, as I 
looked at his.  At any rate, we began a conversation which 
lasted steadily through the whole thing from soup to 
dessert.  Mr. Hunter, though in evening dress, presented a 
rather tumbled-up appearance.  His waistcoat wanted pulling 
down, and his hair wanted brushing. He delivered 
unconsciously that day a lecture on English literature which, 
if printed, I still think would be a valuable addition to 
that literature.  Since then, I have always looked forward 
to a talk with the Senator from Virginia with undisguised 
pleasure.  Next came Mr. Miles and Mr. Jameson, of 
South Carolina.  The latter was President of our Secession 
Convention; also has written a life of Du Guesclin that is 
not so bad.  So my unexpected reception was of the most 
charming.  Judge Frost came a little later.  They all 
remained until the return of the crowd from Mrs. Toombs's.</p>
        <p>These men are not sanguine—I can't say, without hope, 
exactly.  They are agreed in one thing: it is worth while 
to try a while, if only to get away from New England.  
Captain Ingraham was here, too.  He is South Carolina to 
the tips of his fingers; yet he has it dyed in the wool—it is

        <p><hi rend="italics">May 20th</hi>.—Lunched at Mrs. Davis's; everything nice 
to eat, and I was ravenous.  For a fortnight I have not 
even gone to the dinner table.  Yesterday I was forced to 
dine on cold asparagus and blackberries, so repulsive in 
aspect was the other food they sent me.   Mrs.  Davis was 
as nice as the luncheon.  When she is in the mood, I do not 
know so pleasant a person.  She is awfully clever, always.</p>
        <p>We talked of this move from Montgomery.  Mr. Chesnut 
opposes it violently, because this is so central a position 
for our government.  He wants our troops sent into 
Maryland in order to make our fight on the border, and so 
to encompass Washington.  I see that the uncomfortable 
hotels here will at last move the Congress.  Our statesmen 
love their ease, and it will be hot here in summer.  “I do 
hope they will go,” Mrs. Davis said.  “The Yankees will 
make it hot for us, go where we will, and truly so if war 
comes.”  “And it, has come,” said I.  “Yes, I fancy 
these dainty folks may live to regret losing even the fare 
of the Montgomery hotels.”   “Never.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Chesnut has three distinct manias.  The Maryland 
scheme is one, and he rushes off to Jeff Davis, who, I dare 
say, has fifty men every day come to him with infallible 
plans to save the country.  If only he can keep his temper.  
Mrs. Davis says he answers all advisers in softly modulated,
dulcet accents.</p>
        <p>What a rough menagerie we have here.  And if nice 
people come to see you, up walks an irate Judge, who engrosses 
the conversation and abuses the friends of the company 
generally; that is, abuses everybody and prophesies 
every  possible evil to the country, provided he finds that
denouncing your friends does not sufficiently depress  you.  
Everybody has manias—up North, too, by the papers.</p>
        <p>But of  Mr. Chesnut's three crazes: Maryland is to be
 made the seat of war, old Morrow's idea of buying up

steamers abroad for our coast defenses should be adopted,
and, last of all, but far from the least, we must make much 
cotton and send it to England as a bank to draw on.  The 
very cotton we have now, if sent across the water, would
be a gold mine to us.</p>

        <head>VI. CHARLESTON, S. C.</head>
        <head><hi rend="italics">May</hi>  25, 1861—<hi rend="italics">June</hi> 24, 1861</head>
        <p>CHARLESTON, S. C., <hi rend="italics">May 25,1861</hi>.—We have come
 back to South Carolina from the Montgomery 
Congress, stopping over at Mulberry.  We came with 
R. M. T. Hunter and Mr. Barnwell.  Mr. Barnwell has 
excellent reasons for keeping cotton at home, but I forget 
what they are.  Generally, people take what he says, also 
Mr. Hunter's wisdom, as unanswerable.  Not so Mr. Chesnut, 
who growls at both, much as he likes them.  We also 
had Tom Lang and his wife, and Doctor Boykin.  Surely 
there never was a more congenial party.  The younger men 
had been in the South Carolina College while Mr. Barnwell 
was President.  Their love and respect for him were 
immeasurable and he benignly received it, smiling behind 
those spectacles.</p>
        <p>Met John Darby at Atlanta and told him he was Surgeon 
of the Hampton Legion, which delighted him.  He 
had had adventures.  With only a few moments on the 
platform to interchange confidences, he said he had 
remained a little too long in the Medical College in Philadelphia, 
where he was some kind of a professor, and they had 
been within an ace of hanging him as a Southern spy. 
“Rope was ready,” he sniggered.  At Atlanta when he 
unguardedly said he was fresh from Philadelphia, he barely 
escaped lynching, being taken for a Northern spy.  “Lively 
life I am having among you, on both sides,” he said, hurrying 
away.  And I moaned, “Here was John Darby like 
<pb id="mches58" n="58"/>
to have been killed by both sides, and no time to tell me 
the curious coincidences.”  What marvelous experiences a
little war begins to produce.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">May 27th</hi>.—They look for a fight at Norfolk.  Beauregard 
is there.  I think if I were a man I'd be there, too.  
Also Harper's Ferry is to be attacked.  The Confederate 
flag has been cut down at Alexandria by a man named 
Ellsworth,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref40" n="40" rend="sc" target="note40">1</ref> who was in command of Zouaves.  Jackson was the 
name of the person who shot Ellsworth in the act.  Sixty 
of our cavalry have been taken by Sherman's brigade.  
Deeper and deeper we go in.</p>
        <p>Thirty of Tom Boykin's company have come home from 
Richmond.  They went as a rifle company, armed with muskets.  
They were sandhill tackeys—those fastidious ones, 
not very anxious to fight with anything, or in any way, 
I fancy.  Richmond ladies had come for them in carriages, 
feted them, waved handkerchiefs to them, brought them 
dainties with their own hands, in the faith that every 
Carolinian was a gentleman, and every man south of Mason 
and Dixon's line a hero.  But these are not exactly descendants 
of the Scotch Hay, who fought the Danes with his 
plowshare, or the oxen's yoke, or something that could 
hit hard and that came handy.</p>
        <p>Johnny has gone as a private in Gregg's regiment.  He 
could not stand it at home any longer.  Mr. Chesnut was 
willing for him to go, because those sandhill men said 
“this was a rich man's war,” and the rich men would be 
the officers and have an easy time and the poor ones would

Colonel.  He accompanied Lincoln to Washington in 1861 and was soon 
sent with his regiment to Alexandria, where, on seeing a Confederate 
flag floating from a hotel, he personally rushed to the roof and tore it 
down.  The owner of the hotel, a man named Jackson, met him as he 
was descending and shot him dead.  Frank E. Brownell, one of Ellsworth's 
men, then killed Jackson.</note>

be privates.  So he said: “Let the gentlemen set the example; 
let them go in the ranks.”  So John Chesnut is a 
gentleman private.  He took his servant with him all the
same. </p>
        <p>Johnny reproved me for saying, “If I were a man, I 
would not sit here and dole and drink and drivel and forget 
the fight going on in Virginia.”  He said it was my 
duty not to talk so rashly and make enemies.  He  “had the 
money in his pocket to raise a company last fall, but it has 
slipped through his fingers, and now he is a common soldier.” 
“You wasted it or spent it foolishly,” said I. 
“I do not know where it has gone,” said he.  “There was 
too much consulting over me, too much good counsel was 
given to me, and everybody gave me different advice.” 
“Don't you ever know your own mind?” “We will do 
very well in the ranks; men and officers all alike; we know 
everybody.”</p>
        <p>So I repeated Mrs. Lowndes's solemn words when she 
heard that South Carolina had seceded alone: “As thy 
days so shall thy strength be.” Don't know exactly what 
I meant, but thought I must be impressive as he was going 
away.  Saw him off at the train.  Forgot to say anything 
there, but cried my eyes out.</p>
        <p>Sent Mrs. Wigfall a telegram—“Where shrieks the 
wild sea-mew?”  She answered: “Sea-mew at the Spotswood
Hotel.  Will shriek soon.  I will remain here.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 6th</hi>.—Davin!  Have had a talk concerning him
to-day with two opposite extremes of people.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Chesnut, my mother-in-law, praises everybody, 
good and bad.  “Judge not,” she says.  She is a philosopher; 
she would not give herself the pain to find fault.  
The Judge abuses everybody, and he does it so well—short,
sharp, and incisive are his sentences, and he revels 
in condemning the world <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">en bloc</hi></foreign>, as the French say.  So 
nobody is the better for her good word, or the, worse for
his bad one.</p>
        <pb id="mches60" n="60"/>
        <p>In Camden I found myself in a flurry of women.
“Traitors,” they cried.  “Spies; they ought to be 
hanged; Davin is taken up, Dean and Davis are his accomplices.” 
“What has Davin done?”   “He'll be hanged,
never you mind.”   “For what?”  “They caught him 
walking on the trestle work in the swamp, after no good, 
you may be sure.”   “They won't hang him for that!” 
“Hanging is too good for him!”  “You wait till Colonel 
Chesnut comes.”  “He is a lawyer,” I said, gravely. 
“Ladies, he will disappoint you.  There will be no lynching 
if he goes to that meeting to-day.  He will not move a 
step except by habeas corpus and trial by jury, and a 
quantity of bench and bar to speak long speeches.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Chesnut did come, and gave a more definite 
account of poor Davin's precarious situation.  They had 
intercepted treasonable letters of his at the Post Office.  I 
believe it was not a very black treason after all.  At any 
rate, Mr.  Chesnut spoke for him with might and main at 
the meeting.  It was composed (the meeting) of intelligent 
men with cool heads.  And they banished Davin to Fort 
Sumter.  The poor Music Master can't do much harm in 
the casemates there.  He may thank his stars that Mr. Chesnut 
gave him a helping hand.  In the red hot state our 
public mind now is in there will be a short shrift for spies.  
Judge Withers said that Mr. Chesnut never made a more 
telling speech in his life than he did to save this poor 
Frenchman for whom Judge Lynch was ready.  I had 
never heard of Davin in my life until I heard he was to 
be hanged.</p>
        <p>Judge Stephen A. Douglas, the “little giant,” is dead; 
one of those killed by the war, no doubt; trouble of mind.</p>
        <p>Charleston people are thin-skinned.  They shrink from 
Russell's touches.  I find his criticisms mild.  He has a 
light touch.  I expected so much worse.  Those Englishmen 
come, somebody says, with three P's—pen, paper, prejudices. 
I dread some of those after-dinner stories.  As to

that day in the harbor, he let us off easily.  He says our 
men are so fine looking.  Who denies it?  Not one of us.  
Also that it is a silly impression which has gone abroad 
that men can not work in this climate.  We live in the open 
air, and work like Trojans at all manly sports, riding hard, 
hunting, playing at being soldiers.  These fine, manly specimens 
have been in the habit of leaving the coast when it 
became too hot there, and also of fighting a duel or two, 
if kept long sweltering under a Charleston sun.  Handsome 
youths, whose size and muscle he admired so much 
as they prowled around the Mills House, would not relish 
hard work in the fields between May and December.  Negroes 
stand a tropical or semitropical sun at noon-day better
than white men.  In fighting it is different.  Men will
not then mind sun, or rain, or wind.</p>
        <p>Major Emory,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref41" n="41" rend="sc" target="note41">1</ref>  when he was ordered West, placed his 
resignation in the hands of his Maryland brothers.  After 
the Baltimore row the brothers sent it in, but Maryland 
declined to secede.  Mrs. Emory, who at least is two-thirds 
of that copartnership, being old Franklin's granddaughter, 
and true to her blood, tried to get it back.  The President 
refused point blank, though she went on her knees.  
That I do not believe.  The Franklin race are stiff-necked 
and stiff-kneed; not much given to kneeling to God or man
from all accounts.</p>
        <p>If Major Emory comes to us won't he have a good time?
Mrs. Davis adores Mrs. Emory.     No wonder I fell in

Treaty of 1853.  In 1854 he was in Kansas and in 1858 in Utah.  After

this wise.  Little Banks told me the story.  She was dancing 
at a ball when some bad accident maker for the Evening 
News rushed up and informed her that Major Emory 
had been massacred by ten Indians somewhere out West.  
She coolly answered him that she had later intelligence; 
it was not so.  Turning a deaf ear then, she went on 
dancing.  Next night the same officious fool met her with 
this congratulation: “Oh, Mrs. Emory, it was all a hoax!  
The Major is alive.” She cried: “You are always running 
about with your bad news,” and turned her back on 
him; or, I think it was, “You delight in spiteful stories,” 
or, “You are a harbinger of evil.” Banks is a newspaper
man and knows how to arrange an anecdote for effect.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 12th</hi>.—Have been looking at Mrs. O'Dowd as she 
burnished the “Meejor's arrms” before Waterloo.  And 
I have been busy, too.  My husband has gone to join 
Beauregard, somewhere beyond Richmond.  I feel blue-black 
with melancholy.  But I hope to be in Richmond before 
long myself.  That is some comfort.</p>
        <p>The war is making us all tenderly sentimental.  No 
casualties yet, no real mourning, nobody hurt.  So it is all 
parade, fife, and fine feathers.  Posing we are <hi rend="italics">en grande tenue.</hi>  There is no imagination here to forestall woe, and 
only the excitement and wild awakening from every-day 
stagnant life are felt.  That is, when one gets away from 
the two or three sensible men who are still left in the world.</p>
        <p>When Beauregard's report of the capture of Fort Sumter 
was printed, Willie Ancrum said: “How is this?  Tom
Ancrum and Ham Boykin's names are not here.  We 
thought from what they told us that they did most of the
fighting.”</p>

        <p>Our people, Southerners, I mean, continue to drop in 
from the outside world.  And what a contempt those who 
seceded a few days sooner feel for those who have just 
come out!  A Camden notable, called Jim Velipigue, said 
in the street to-day:  “At heart Robert E. Lee is against 
us; that I know.”  What will not people say in war times! 
Also, he said that Colonel Kershaw wanted General Beauregard 
to change the name of the  stream near Manassas 
Station.  Bull's Run is so unrefined.  Beauregard answered:
“Let us try and make it as great a name as your
South Carolina Cowpens.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref43" n="43" rend="sc" target="note43">1</ref></p>
        <p>Mrs. Chesnut, born in Philadelphia, can not see what 
right we have to take Mt.  Vernon from our Northern sisters.  
She thinks that ought to be common to both parties.  
We think they will get their share of this world's goods, 
do what we may, and we will keep Mt.  Vernon if we can. 
No comfort in Mr. Chesnut's letter from Richmond.  
Unutterable confusion prevails, and discord already.</p>

from my husband dated, “Headquarters, Manassas 
Junction, June 16, 1861”:</p>
        <div2 type="letter">
          <p>MY DEAR MARY: I wrote you a short letter from Richmond 
last Wednesday, and came here next day.  Found the camp all 
busy and preparing for a vigorous defense.  We have here at this 
camp seven regiments, and in the same command, at posts in the 
neighborhood, six others—say, ten thousand good men.  The General 
and the men feel confident that they can whip twice that 
number of the enemy, at least.</p>
          <p>I have been in the saddle for two days, all day, with the General, 
to become familiar with the topography of the country, and 
the posts he intends to assume, and the communications between 
them.</p>
          <p>We learned General Johnston has evacuated Harper's Ferry, 
and taken up his position at Winchester, to meet the advancing 
column of McClellan, and to avoid being cut off by the three columns 
which were advancing upon him.  Neither Johnston nor 
Beauregard considers Harper's Ferry as very important in a strategic
point of view.</p>
          <p>I think it most probable that the next battle you will hear of 
will be between the forces of Johnston and McClellan.</p>
          <p>I think what we particularly need is a head in the field—a 
Major-General to combine and conduct all the forces as well as 
plan a general and energetic campaign.  Still, we have all 
confidence that we will defeat the enemy whenever and wherever we 
meet in general engagement.  Although the majority of the people
<pb id="mches66" n="66"/>
just around here are with us, still there are many who are 
against us.</p>

          <p>Isaac Hayne, the man who fought a duel with Ben 
<sic>Alston</sic> across the dinner-table and yet lives, is the bravest 
of the brave.  He attacks Russell in the Mercury—in the 
public prints—for saying we wanted an English prince to 
the fore.  Not we, indeed!  Every man wants to be at the 
head of affairs himself.  If he can not be king himself, 
then a republic, of course.  It was hardly necessary to do 
more than laugh at Russell's absurd idea.  There was a 
great deal of the wildest kind of talk at the Mills House.  
Russell writes candidly enough of the British in India.  We 
can hardly expect him to suppress what is to our detriment.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">June 24th</hi>.—Last night I was awakened by loud talking 
and candles flashing, tramping of feet, growls dying away 
in the distance, loud calls from point to point in the yard.  
Up I started, my heart in my mouth.  Some dreadful thing 
had happened, a battle, a death, a horrible accident.  Some 
one was screaming aloft—that is, from the top of the stairway, 
hoarsely like a boatswain in a storm.  Old Colonel 
Chesnut was storming at the sleepy negroes looking for fire, 
with lighted candles, in closets and everywhere else.  I 
dressed and came upon the scene of action.</p>
          <p>“What is it?  Any news?”  “No, no, only mamma 
smells a smell; she thinks something is burning somewhere.” 
The whole yard was alive, literally swarming.  
There are sixty or seventy people kept here to wait upon 
this household, two-thirds of them too old or too young 
to be of any use, but families remain intact.  The old 
Colonel has a magnificent voice.  I am sure it can be heard 
for  miles.  Literally, be was roaring from the piazza, giving
<pb id="mches67" n="67"/>
orders to the busy crowd who were hunting the smell 
of fire.</p>
          <p>Old Mrs. Chesnut is deaf; so she did not know what a 
commotion she was creating.  She is very sensitive to bad 
odors.  Candles have to be taken out of the room to be 
snuffed.  Lamps are extinguished only in the porticoes, or 
farther afield.  She finds violets oppressive; can only tolerate 
a single kind of sweet rose.  A tea-rose she will not 
have in her room.  She was totally innocent of the storm 
she had raised, and in a mild, sweet voice was suggesting 
places to be searched.  I was weak enough to laugh hysterically.  
The bombardment of Fort Sumter was nothing to this.</p>
          <p>After this alarm, enough to wake the dead, the smell was 
found.  A family had been boiling soap.  Around the soap-pot 
they had swept up some woolen rags.  Raking up the 
fire to make all safe before going to bed, this was heaped 
up with the ashes, and its faint smoldering tainted the air, 
at least to Mrs.  Chesnut's nose, two hundred yards or more 
away.</p>
          <p>Yesterday some of the negro men on the plantation 
were found with pistols.  I have never before seen aught 
about any negro to show that they knew we had a war on 
hand in which they have any interest.</p>
          <p>Mrs. John de Saussure bade me good-by and God bless 
you.  I was touched.  Camden people never show any more 
feeling or sympathy than red Indians, except at a funeral.  
It is expected of all to howl then, and if you don't  “show 
feeling,” indignation awaits the delinquent.</p>

        <p>RICHMOND, Va., <hi rend="italics">June 27, 1861</hi>.—Mr. Meynardie was 
perfect in the part of traveling companion.  He had 
his pleasures, too.  The most pious and eloquent 
of parsons is human, and he enjoyed the converse of the 
“eminent persons” who turned up on every hand and 
gave their views freely on all matters of state.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lawrence Keitt joined us <hi rend="italics">en route</hi>.  With him came 
his wife and baby.  We don't think alike, but Mr. Keitt 
is always original and entertaining.  Already he 
pronounces Jeff Davis a failure and his Cabinet a farce.  
“Prophetic,” I suggested, as he gave his opinion before 
the administration had fairly got under way.  He was 
fierce in his fault-finding as to Mr. Chesnut's vote for Jeff 
Davis.  He says Mr. Chesnut overpersuaded the Judge, 
and those two turned the tide, at least with the South Carolina 
delegation.  We wrangled, as we always do.  He says 
Howell Cobb's common sense might have saved us.</p>
        <p>Two quiet, unobtrusive Yankee school-teachers were on 
the train.  I had spoken to them, and they had told me all 
about themselves.  So I wrote on a scrap of paper, “Do 
not abuse our home and house so before these Yankee 
strangers, going North.  Those girls are schoolmistresses 
returning from whence they came.”</p>
        <p>Soldiers everywhere.  They seem to be in the air, and 
certainly to fill all space.  Keitt quoted a funny Georgia 
man who says we try our soldiers to see if they are hot 
<pb id="mches69" n="69"/>
enough before we enlist them.  If , when water is thrown 
on them they do not sizz, they won't do; their patriotism is
too cool.</p>
        <p>To show they were wide awake and sympathizing 
enthusiastically, every woman from every window of every 
house we passed waved a handkerchief, if she had one.  This
fluttering of white flags from every side never ceased from 
Camden to Richmond.  Another new symptom—Parties of 
girls came to every station simply to look at the troops 
passing.  They always stood (the girls , I mean) in solid
phalanx, and as the sun was generally in their eyes, they 
made faces.  Mary Hammy never tired of laughing at this
peculiarity of her sister patriots.</p>
        <p>At the depot in Richmond, Mr. Mallory, with Wigfall 
and Garnett, met us.  We had no cause to complain of the 
warmth of our reception.  They had a carriage for us, and 
our rooms were taken at the Spotswood.  But then the people
who were in the rooms engaged for us had not departed 
at the time they said they were going.  They lingered among 
the delights of Richmond, and we knew of no law to make 
them keep their words and go.  Mrs. Preston had gone for 
a few days to Manassas.  So we took her room.  Mrs. Davis 
is as kind as ever.  She met us in one of the corridors 
accidentally, and asked us to join her party and to take our 
meals at her table.  Mr. Preston came, and we moved into 
a room so small there was only space for a bed, wash-stand, 
and glass over it.  My things were hung up out of the way 
on nails behind the door.</p>
        <p>As soon as my husband heard we had arrived, he came, 
too.  After dinner he sat smoking, the solitary chair of the 
apartment tilted against the door as he smoked, and my 
poor dresses were fumigated.  I remonstrated feebly.  
“War times,” said he; “nobody is fussy now.  When I 
go back to Manassas to-morrow you will be awfully sorry 
you snubbed me about those trumpery things up there.”
So he smoked the pipe of peace, for I knew that his remarks
<pb id="mches70" n="70"/>
were painfully true.  As soon as he was once 
more under the enemy's guns, I would repent in sackcloth
and ashes.</p>
        <p>Captain Ingraham came with Colonel Lamar.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref45" n="45" rend="sc" target="note45">1</ref>  The latter 
said he could only stay five minutes; he was obliged 
to go back at once to his camp.  That was a little before 
eight.  However, at twelve he was still talking to us on 
that sofa.  We taunted him with his fine words to the 
the F. F. V. crowd before the Spotswood: “Virginia has 
no grievance.  She raises her strong arm to catch the blow 
aimed at her weaker sisters.”  He liked it well, however, 
that we knew his speech by heart.</p>
        <p>This Spotswood is a miniature world.  The war topic 
is not so much avoided, as that everybody has some 
personal dignity to take care of and everybody else is indifferent 
to it.  I mean the “personal dignity of” <hi rend="italics">autrui</hi>.  In 
this wild confusion everything likely and unlikely is told 
you, and then everything is as flatly contradicted.  At any
rate, it is safest not to talk of the war.</p>
        <p>Trescott was telling us how they laughed at little South 
Carolina in Washington.  People said it was almost as 
large as Long Island, which is hardly more than a tailfeather 
of New York.  Always there is a child who sulks 
and won't play; that was our role.  And we were posing 
as San Marino and all model-spirited, though small, 
republics, pose.</p>

Huguenot descent, who got his classical names from his father: his 
father got them from an uncle who claimed the privilege of bestowing 
upon his nephew the full name of his favorite hero.  When the war
began, Mr. Lamar had lived for some years in Mississippi, where he
had become successful. as a lawyer and had been elected to Congress. 
He entered the Confederate Army as the Colonel of a Mississippi regiment.  
He served in Congress after the war and was elected to the 
United States Senate in 1877.  In 1885 he became Secretary of the
Interior, and in 1888, a justice of the United States Supreme Court.</note>

        <p>He tells us that Lincoln is a humorist.  Lincoln sees 
the fun of things; he thinks if they had left us in a corner 
or out in the cold a while pouting, with our fingers in our 
mouth, by hook or by crook he could have got us back, but
Anderson spoiled all.</p>
        <p>In Mrs. Davis's drawing-room last night, the President 
took a seat by me on the sofa where I sat.  He talked for 
nearly an hour.  He laughed at our faith in our own powers.  
We are like the British.  We think every Southerner 
equal to three Yankees at least.  We will have to be equivalent 
to a dozen now.  After his experience of the fighting 
qualities of Southerners in Mexico, he believes that we will 
do all that can be done by pluck and muscle, endurance, 
and dogged courage, dash, and red-hot patriotism.  And
yet his tone was not sanguine.  There was a sad refrain 
running through it all.  For one thing, either way, he 
thinks it will be a long war.  That floored me at once.  It 
has been too long for me already.  Then he said, before the 
end came we would have many a bitter experience.  He said 
only fools doubted the courage of the Yankees, or their 
willingness to fight when they saw fit.  And now that we 
have stung their pride, we have roused them till they will
fight like devils.</p>
        <p>Mrs.  Bradley Johnson is here, a regular heroine.  She 
outgeneraled the Governor of North Carolina in some way 
and has got arms and clothes and ammunition for her 
husband's regiment.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref46" n="46" rend="sc" target="note46">1</ref>  There was some joke.  The regimental 
breeches were all wrong, but a tailor righted that—hind
part before, or something odd.</p>
        <p>Captain Hartstein came to-day with Mrs. Bartow. 
Colonel Bartow is Colonel of a Georgia regiment  now in

Virginia.  He was the Mayor of Savannah who helped to 
wake the patriotic echoes the livelong night under my 
sleepless head into the small hours in Charleston in 
November last.  His wife is a charming person, witty and wise, 
daughter of Judge Berrien.  She had on a white muslin 
apron with pink bows on the pockets.  It gave her a gay 
and girlish air, and yet she must be as old as I am.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamar, who does not love slavery more than Sumner 
does, nor than I do, laughs at the compliment New England 
pays us.  We want to separate from them; to be rid of the 
Yankees forever at any price.  And they hate us so, and 
would clasp us, or grapple us, as Polonius has it, to their 
bosoms  “with hooks of steel.”  We are an unwilling bride.  
I think incompatibility of temper began when it was made 
plain to us that we got all the opprobrium of slavery and 
they all the money there was in it with their tariff.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lamar says, the young men are light-hearted because 
there is a fight on hand, but those few who look 
ahead, the clear heads, they see all the risk, the loss of land, 
limb, and life, home, wife, and children.  As in “the brave 
days of old,”  they take to it for their country's sake.  
They are ready and willing, come what may.  But not so
light-hearted as the <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">jeunesse dorée.</hi></foreign></p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 29th</hi>.—Mrs. Preston, Mrs. Wigfall, Mary Hammy 
and I drove in a fine open carriage to see the <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">Champ de 
Mars</hi></foreign>.  It was a grand tableau out there.  Mr. Davis rode 
a beautiful gray horse, the Arab Edwin de Leon brought 
him from Egypt.  His worst enemy will allow that he is a 
consummate rider, graceful and easy in the saddle, and Mr. 
Chesnut, who has talked horse with his father ever since he
was born, owns that Mr. Davis knows more about horses 
than any man he has met yet.  General Lee was there with 
him; also Joe Davis and Wigfall acting as his aides.</p>
        <p>Poor Mr. Lamar has been brought from his camp—
paralysis or some sort of shock.  Every woman in the house 
is ready to rush into the Florence Nightingale business.  I 
<pb id="mches73" n="73"/>
think I will wait for a wounded man, to make my first effort 
as Sister of Charity.  Mr. Lamar sent for me.  As everybody 
went, Mr. Davis setting the example, so did I. Lamar 
will not die this time.  Will men flatter and make eyes, 
until their eyes close in death, at the ministering angels?  
He was the same old Lamar of the drawing-room.</p>
        <p>It is pleasant at the President's table.  My seat is next 
to Joe Davis, with Mr. Browne on the other side, and Mr. 
Mallory opposite.  There is great constraint, however.  As 
soon as I came I repeated what the North Carolina man 
said on the cars, that North Carolina had 20,000 men ready 
and they were kept back by Mr. Walker, etc.  The President 
caught something of what I was saying, and asked me 
to repeat it, which I did, although I was scared to death.  
“Madame, when you see that person tell him his statement 
is false.  We are too anxious here for troops to refuse a 
man who offers himself, not to speak of 20,000 men.” 
Silence ensued—of the most profound.</p>
        <p>Uncle H. gave me three hundred dollars for his daughter 
Mary's expenses, making four in all that I have of hers.  
He would pay me one hundred, which he said he owed my 
husband for a horse.  I thought it an excuse to lend me 
money.  I told him I had enough and to spare for all my 
needs until my Colonel came home from the wars.</p>
        <p>Ben Allston, the Governor's son, is here—came to see 
me; does not show much of the wit of the Petigrus; pleasant 
person, however.  Mr. Brewster and Wigfall came at 
the same time.  The former, chafing at Wigfall's anomalous 
position here, gave him fiery advice.  Mr. Wigfall was 
calm and full of common sense.  A brave man, and without 
a thought of any necessity for displaying his temper, 
he said: “Brewster, at this time, before the country is 
strong and settled in her new career, it would be disastrous 
for us, the head men, to engage in a row among ourselves.”</p>
        <p>As I was brushing flies away and fanning the prostrate 
Lamar, I reported Mr. Davis's conversation of the night 
<pb id="mches74" n="74"/>
before.  “He is all right,” said Mr. Lamar, “the fight had 
to come.  We are men, not women.  The quarrel had lasted 
long enough.  We hate each other so, the fight had to come.  
Even Homer's heroes, after they had stormed and scolded 
enough, fought like brave men, long and well.  If the athlete, 
Sumner, had stood on his manhood and training and 
struck back when Preston Brooks assailed him, Preston 
Brooks's blow need not have been the opening skirmish of 
the war.  Sumner's country took up the fight because he 
did not.  Sumner chose his own battle-field, and it was the 
worse for us.  What an awful blunder that Preston 
Brooks business was!”   Lamar said Yankees did not fight 
for the fun of it; they always made it pay or let it alone.</p>
        <p>Met Mr. Lyon with news, indeed—a man here in the 
midst of us, taken with Lincoln's passports, etc., in his 
pocket—a palpable spy.  Mr. Lyon said he would be hanged
—in all human probability, that is.</p>
        <p>A letter from my husband written at Camp Pickens, 
and saying: “If you and Mrs. Preston can make up your 
minds to leave Richmond, and can come up to a nice little 
country house near Orange Court House, we could come to 
see you frequently while the army is stationed here.  It 
would be a safe place for the present, near the scene of 
action, and directly in the line of news from all sides.”  So 
we go to Orange Court House.</p>
        <p>Read the story of Soulouque,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref47" n="47" rend="sc" target="note47">1</ref> the Haytian man: he has 
wonderful interest just now.  Slavery has to go, of course, 
and joy go with it.  These Yankees may kill us and lay 
waste our land for a while, but conquer us—never!</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 4th</hi>.—Russell abuses us in his letters.  People here 
care a great deal for what Russell says, because he represents
<note id="note47" n="47" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref47">1.  Faustin Elie Soulouque, a negro slave of Hayti, who, having been
freed, took part in the insurrection against the French in 1803, and rose
by successive steps until in August, 1849, by the unanimous action of
the parliament, he was proclaimed emperor.</note>
<pb id="mches75" n="75"/>
the London Times, and the Times reflects the 
sentiment of the English people.  How we do cling to 
the idea of an alliance with England or France!  Without 
France even Washington could not have done it.</p>
        <p>We drove to the camp to see the President present a 
flag to a Maryland regiment.  Having lived on the battlefield 
(Kirkwood), near Camden,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref48" n="48" rend="sc" target="note48">1</ref>  we have an immense respect 
for the Maryland line.  When our militia in that 
fight ran away, Colonel Howard and the Marylanders held 
their own against Rawdon, Cornwallis, and the rest, and 
everywhere around are places named for a doughty captain 
killed in our defense—Kirkwood, De Kalb, etc.  The 
last, however, was a Prussian count.  A letter from my 
husband, written June 22d, has just reached me.  He 
says:</p>
        <p>“We are very strongly posted, entrenched, and have 
now at our command about 15,000 of the best troops in the 
world.  We have besides, two batteries of artillery, a  regiment 
of cavalry, and daily expect a battalion of flying 
artillery from Richmond.  We have sent forward seven regiments 
of infantry and rifles toward Alexandria.  Our outposts 
have felt the enemy several times, and in every 
instance the enemy recoils.  General Johnston has had several 
encounters—the advancing columns of the two armies 
—and with him, too, the enemy, although always superior
in numbers, are invariably driven back.</p>
        <p>“There is great deficiency in the matter of ammunition. 
General Johnston's command, in the very  face of 
overwhelming numbers, have only thirty rounds each.  If 
they had been well provided in this respect, they could and 
would have defeated Cadwallader and Paterson with great 
ease.  I find the opinion prevails throughout the army that
<note id="note48" n="48" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref48">1. At Camden in August, 1780, was fought a battle between General 
Gates and Lord Cornwallis, in which Gates was defeated.  In April of 
the following year near Camden, Lord Rawdon defeated General Greene.</note>
<pb id="mches76" n="76"/>
there is great imbecility and shameful neglect in the War 
Department.</p>
        <p>“Unless the Republicans fall back, we must soon come 
together on both lines, and have a decided engagement.  
But the opinion prevails here that Lincoln's army will not 
meet us if they can avoid it.  They have already fallen 
back before a slight check from 400 of Johnston's men. 
They had 700 and were badly beaten.  You have no idea 
how dirty and irksome the camp life is.  You would hardly 
know your best friend in camp guise.”</p>
        <p>Noise of drums, tramp of marching regiments all day 
long; rattling of artillery wagons, bands of music, friends 
from every quarter coming in.  We ought to be miserable 
and anxious, and yet these are pleasant days.  Perhaps we 
are unnaturally exhilarated and excited.</p>
        <p>Heard some people in the drawing-room say:  “Mrs. 
Davis's ladies are not young, are not pretty,” and I am one 
of them.  The truthfulness of the remark did not tend to 
alleviate its bitterness.  We must put Maggie Howell and 
Mary Hammy in the foreground, as youth and beauty are 
in request.  At least they are young things—bright spots 
in a somber-tinted picture.  The President does not forbid 
our going, but he is very much averse to it.  We are 
consequently frightened by our own audacity, but we are 
wilful women, and so we go.</p>

        <head>VIII. FAUQUIER WHITE  SULPHUR SPRINGS, VA.</head>
        <head><hi rend="italics">July</hi> 6, 1861—<hi rend="italics">July</hi> 11, 1861</head>
        <p>FAUQUIER WHITE SULPHUR SPRINGS, Va.,
<hi rend="italics">July 6, 1861</hi>.—Mr. Brewster came here with us.  The 
cars were jammed with soldiers to the muzzle.  They 
were very polite and considerate, and we had an agreeable 
journey, in spite of heat, dust, and crowd.  Rev.  Robert 
Barnwell was with us.  He means to organize a hospital for 
sick and wounded.  There was not an inch of standing-room 
even; so dusty, so close, but everybody in tip-top 
spirits.</p>
        <p>Mr. Preston and Mr. Chesnut met us at Warrenton.
Saw across the lawn, but did not speak to them, some of
Judge Campbell's family.  There they wander disconsolate,
just outside the gates of their Paradise: a resigned
Judge of the Supreme Court of the United States; resigned,
and for a cause that he is hardly more than half in sympathy
with, Judge Campbell's is one of the hardest cases.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 7th</hi>.—This water is making us young again.  How  
these men enjoy the baths.  They say Beauregard can stop
the way with sixty thousand; that many are coming.</p>
        <p>An antique female, with every hair curled and frizzed,
said to be a Yankee spy, sits opposite us.  Brewster solemnly
wondered “with eternity and the judgment to come
so near at hand, how she could waste her few remaining
minutes curling her hair.”  He bade me be very polite, for
she would ask me questions.  When we were walking away
<pb id="mches78" n="78"/>
from table, I demanded his approval of my self-control 
under such trying circumstances.  It seems I was not as 
calm and forbearing as I thought myself.  Brewster answered 
with emphasis: “Do you always carry brickbats 
like that in your pocket ready for the first word that 
offends you?  You must not do so, when you are with spies
from the other side.”  I do not feel at all afraid of spies 
hearing anything through me, for I do not know anything.</p>
        <p>But our men could not tarry with us in these cool 
shades and comfortable quarters, with water unlimited, 
excellent table, etc.  They have gone back to Manassas, and 
the faithful Brewster with them to bring us the latest news.  
They left us in excellent spirits, which we shared until they 
were out of sight.  We went with them to Warrenton, and 
then heard that General Johnston was in full retreat, and 
that a column was advancing upon Beauregard.  So we
came back, all forlorn.  If our husbands are taken prisoners, 
what will they do with them?  Are they soldiers or
traitors?</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ould read us a letter from Richmond.  How 
horrified they are there at Joe Johnston's retreating.  And the 
enemies of the War Department accuse Walker of not sending 
General Johnston ammunition in sufficient quantities; 
say that is the real cause of his retreat.  Now will they 
not make the ears of that slow-coach, the Secretary of War, 
buzz?</p>
        <p>Mrs. Preston's maid Maria has a way of rushing in—
“Don't you hear the cannon?”  We fly to the windows, 
lean out to our waists, pull all the hair away from our ears, 
but can not hear it.  Lincoln wants four hundred millions 
of money and men in proportion.  Can he get them?  He 
will find us a heavy handful.  Midnight.  I hear Maria's  
guns. </p>
        <p>We are always picking up some good thing of the rough 
Illinoisan's saying.  Lincoln objects to some man—“Oh, 
he is too <hi rend="italics">interruptious</hi> ”; that is a horrid style of man or 
<pb id="mches79" n="79"/>
woman, the interruptious.  I know the thing, but had no
name for it before.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 9th</hi>.—Our battle summer.  May it be our first and 
our last, so called.  After all we have not had any of the 
horrors of war.  Could there have been a gayer, or pleasanter, 
life than we led in Charleston.  And Montgomery, 
how exciting it all was there!  So many clever men and 
women congregated from every part of the South.  
Mosquitoes, and a want of neatness, and a want of good things 
to eat, drove us away.  In Richmond the girls say it is perfectly 
delightful.  We found it so, too, but the bickering
and quarreling have begun there.</p>
        <p>At table to-day we heard Mrs. Davis's ladies described.  
They were said to wear red frocks and flats on their heads.  
We sat mute as mice.  One woman said she found the 
drawing-room of the Spotswood was warm, stuffy, and 
stifling.  “Poor soul,” murmured the inevitable Brewster, 
“and no man came to air her in the moonlight stroll, you 
know.  Why didn't somebody ask her out on the piazza to 
see the comet?”   Heavens above, what philandering was 
done in the name of the comet!  When you stumbled on a 
couple on the piazza they lifted their eyes, and  “comet” 
was the only word you heard.  Brewster came back with
a paper from Washington with terrific threats of what
they will do to us.  Threatened men live long.</p>
        <p>There was a soft, sweet, low, and slow young lady opposite 
to us.  She seemed so gentle and refined, and so uncertain 
of everything.  Mr. Brewster called her Miss Albina 
McClush, who always asked her maid when a new book was 
mentioned, “Seraphina, have I perused that volume?”</p>
        <p>Mary Hammy, having a <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">fiancé</hi></foreign> in the wars, is inclined 
at times to be sad and tearful.  Mrs. Preston quoted her 
negro nurse to her: “Never take any more trouble in 
your heart than you can kick off at the end of your toes.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 11th</hi>.—We did hear cannon to-day.  The woman 
who slandered Mrs. Davis's republican court, of which we 
<pb id="mches80" n="80"/>
are honorable members, by saying they—well, were not 
young; that they wore gaudy colors, and dressed badly—I 
took an inventory to-day as to her charms.  She is darkly, 
deeply, beautifully freckled; she wears a wig which is 
kept in place by a tiara of mock jewels; she has the fattest 
of arms and wears black bead bracelets.</p>
        <p>The one who is under a cloud, shadowed as a Yankee 
spy, has confirmed our worst suspicions.  She exhibited unholy 
joy, as she reported seven hundred sick soldiers in the 
hospital at Culpeper, and that Beauregard had sent a 
flag of truce to Washington.</p>
        <p>What a night we had!  Maria had seen suspicious persons 
hovering about all day, and Mrs. Preston a ladder 
which could easily be placed so as to reach our rooms.  
Mary Hammy saw lights glancing about among the trees, 
and we all heard guns.  So we sat up.  Consequently, I am 
writing in bed to-day.  A letter from my husband saying, 
in particular: “Our orders are to move on,” the date, July 
10th.  “Here we are still and no more prospect of movement 
now than when I last wrote to you.  It is true, however, 
that the enemy is advancing slowly in our front, and 
we are preparing to receive him.  He comes in great force, 
being more than three times our number.”</p>
        <p>The spy, so-called, gave us a parting shot: said Beauregard 
had arrested her brother in order that he might take a 
fine horse which the aforesaid brother was riding.  Why?  
Beauregard, at a moment's notice, could have any horse in 
South Carolina, or Louisiana, for that matter.  This man 
was arrested and sent to Richmond, and  “will be acquitted 
as they always are,” said Brewster.   “They send them 
first to Richmond to see and hear everything there; then 
they acquit them, and send them out of the country by way 
of Norfolk to see everything there.  But, after all, what 
does it matter?  They have no need for spies: our newspapers 
keep no secrets hid.  The thoughts of our hearts are all

        <p>RICHMOND, Va., <hi rend="italics">July 13,1861</hi>.—Now we feel safe
and comfortable.  We can not be flanked.  Mr. Preston 
met us at Warrenton.  Mr. Chesnut doubtless 
had too many spies to receive from Washington, galloping 
in with the exact numbers of the enemy done up in their 
back hair.</p>
        <p>Wade Hampton is here; Doctor Nott also—Nott and 
Glyddon known to fame.  Everybody is here, <foreign lang="fr">en route</foreign> for
the army, or staying for the meeting of Congress.</p>
        <p>Lamar is out on crutches.  His father-in-law, once 
known only as the humorist Longstreet, <ref targOrder="U" id="ref49" n="49" rend="sc" target="note49">1</ref>  author of Georgia 
Scenes, now a staid Methodist, who has outgrown the 
follies of his youth, bore him off to-day.  They say Judge 
Longstreet has lost the keen sense of fun that illuminated 
his life in days of yore.  Mrs. Lamar and her daughter 
were here.</p>
        <p>The President met us cordially, but he laughed at our 
sudden retreat, with baggage lost, etc.  He tried to keep us 
from going; said it was a dangerous experiment.  Dare say 
he knows more about the situation of things than he 
chooses to tell us.</p>
        <p>To-day in the drawing-room, saw a <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">vivandière</hi></foreign> in the

flesh.  She was in the uniform of her regiment, but wore
Turkish pantaloons.  She frisked about in her hat and
feathers; did not uncover her head as a man would have
done; played the piano; and sang war-songs.  She had no
drum, but she gave us rataplan.  She was followed at  
every step by a mob of admiring soldiers and boys.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, as we left the cars,  we had a glimpse of war.
It was the saddest  sight: the memory of it is hard to shake
off—sick soldiers, not wounded ones.  There were quite two
hundred (they said) lying about as best they might on the
platform.  Robert Barnwell<ref targOrder="U" id="ref50" n="50" rend="sc" target="note50">1</ref> was there doing all he could.
Their pale, ghastly faces!  So here is one of the horrors of
war we had not reckoned on.  There were many good men
and women with Robert Barnwell, rendering all the service
possible in the circumstances.</p>
        <p>Just now I happened to look up and saw Mr. Chesnut
with a smile on his face watching me from the passageway.
I flew across the room, and as I got half-way saw Mrs. Davis
touch him on the shoulder.  She said he was to go at once
into Mr. Davis's room, where General Lee and General
Cooper were.  After he left us, Mrs. Davis told me General
Beauregard had sent Mr. Chesnut here on , some army 
business.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 14th</hi>.—Mr. Chesnut remained closeted with the 
President and General Lee all the afternoon.  The news 
does not seem pleasant.  At least, he is not inclined to tell
me any of it.  He satisfied himself with telling me how sensible
and soldierly this handsome General Lee is.  General 
Lee's military sagacity was also his theme. of course the 
President dominated the party, as well by his weight of 
brain as by his position.  I did not care a fig for a description 
of the war council.  I wanted to know what is in
the wind now?</p>
        <note id="note50" n="50" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref50">1. Rev.  Robert Barnwell, nephew of Hon.  Robert Barnwell, established
in Richmond a hospital for  South Carolinians.</note>
        <pb id="mches84" n="84"/>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 16th</hi>.—Dined to-day at the President's table.  Joe 
Davis, the nephew, asked me if I liked white port wine.  I 
said I did not know;  “all that I had ever known had been 
dark red.” So he poured me out a glass.  I drank it, and 
it nearly burned up my mouth and throat.  It was horrid, 
but I did not let him see how it annoyed me.  I pretended to 
be glad that any one found me still young enough to play 
off a practical joke upon me.  It was thirty years since I 
had thought of such a thing.</p>
        <p>Met Colonel Baldwin in the drawing-room.  He pointed 
significantly to his Confederate colonel's buttons and gray 
coat.  At the White Sulphur last summer he was a  “Union 
man” to the last point.      “How much have you changed 
besides your coat?”  “I was always true to our country,” 
he said.  “She leaves me no choice now.”</p>
        <p>As far as I can make out, Beauregard sent Mr. Chesnut 
to the President to gain permission for the forces of Joe 
Johnston and Beauregard to join, and, united, to push the 
enemy, if possible, over the Potomac.  Now every day we 
grow weaker and they stronger; so we had better give a 
telling blow at once.  Already, we begin to cry out for 
more ammunition, and already the blockade is beginning to 
shut it all out.</p>
        <p>A young Emory is here.  His mother writes him to go 
back.  Her Franklin blood certainly calls him with no 
uncertain sound to the Northern side, while his fatherland is 
wavering and undecided, split in half by factions.  Mrs. 
Wigfall says he is half inclined to go.  She wondered that 
he did not.  With a father in the enemy's army, he will 
always be  “suspect” here,  let the President and Mrs. Davis 
do for him what they will.</p>
        <p>I did not know there was such a  “bitter cry”  left in 
me, but I wept my heart away to-day when my husband 
went off.  Things do look so black.  When he comes up 
here he rarely brings his body-servant, a negro man.  Lawrence 
has charge of all Mr. Chesnut's things—watch,
<pb id="mches85" n="85"/>
clothes, and two or three hundred gold pieces that lie in the 
tray of his trunk.  All these, papers, etc., he tells Lawrence 
to bring to me if anything happens to him.  But I said:
“Maybe he will pack off to the Yankees and freedom 
with all that.”   “Fiddlesticks!  He is not going to leave 
me for anybody else.  After all, what can he ever be, better 
than he is now—a gentleman's gentleman?”    “He is 
within sound of the enemy's guns, and when he gets to the 
other army he is free.”  Maria said of Mr. Preston's man: 
“What he want with anything more, ef he was free?  
Don't he live just as well as Mars John do now?”</p>
        <p>Mrs. McLane, Mrs. Joe Johnston, Mrs. Wigfall, all came. 
 I am sure so many clever women could divert a soul <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">in 
extremis</hi></foreign>.  The Hampton Legion all in a snarl—about, I 
forget what; standing on their dignity, I suppose.  I have 
come to detest a man who says, “My own personal dignity 
and self-respect require.”   I long to cry, “No need to 
respect yourself until you can make other people do it.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 19th</hi>.—Beauregard telegraphed yesterday (they 
say, to General Johnston),  “Come down and help us, or we 
shall be crushed by numbers.”   The President telegraphed 
General Johnston to move down to Beauregard's aid.  At 
Bull Run, Bonham's Brigade, Ewell's, and Longstreet's 
encountered the foe and repulsed him.  Six hundred prisoners 
have been sent here.</p>
        <p>I arose, as the Scriptures say, and washed my face 
and anointed my head and went down-stairs.  At the 
foot of them stood General Cooper, radiant, one finger nervously 
arranging his shirt collar, or adjusting his neck to 
it after his fashion.  He called out:  “Your South Carolina 
man, Bonham, has done a capital thing at Bull Run—driven 
back the enemy, if not defeated him; with killed and 
prisoners,”  etc. , etc.   Clingman came to tell the particulars, 
and Colonel Smith (one of the trio with Garnett, McClellan, 
who were sent to Europe to inspect and report on military 
matters).  Poor Garnett is killed.  There was cowardice
<pb id="mches86" n="86"/>
or treachery on the part of natives up there, or 
some of Governor Letcher's appointments to military posts.  
I hear all these things said.  I do not understand, but it 
was a fatal business.</p>
        <p>Mrs. McLane says she finds we do not believe a word of 
any news unless it comes in this guise:  “A great battle 
fought.  Not one Confederate killed.  Enemy's loss in 
killed, wounded, and prisoners taken by us, immense.”   I 
was in hopes there would be no battle until Mr. Chesnut 
was forced to give up his amateur aideship to come and attend 
to his regular duties in the Congress.</p>
        <p>Keitt has come in.  He says Bonham's battle was a skirmish 
of outposts.  Joe Davis, Jr., said:  “Would Heaven 
only send us a Napoleon!”   Not one bit of use.  If 
Heaven did, Walker would not give him a commission.  
Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Joe Johnston,   “her dear Lydia,” were 
in fine spirits.  The effect upon <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">nous autres</hi></foreign> was evident; 
we rallied visibly.  South Carolina troops pass every day.  
They go by with a gay step.  Tom Taylor and John Rhett 
bowed to us from their horses as we leaned out of the windows.  
Such shaking of handkerchiefs.  We are forever at
the windows.</p>
        <p>It was not such a mere skirmish.  We took three rifled 
cannon and six hundred stands of arms.  Mr. Davis has 
gone to Manassas.  He did not let Wigfall know he was 
going.  That ends the delusion of Wigfall's aideship.  No 
mistake to-day.  I was too ill to move out of my bed.  So 
they all sat in my room.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 22d</hi>.—Mrs. Davis came in so softly that I did not 
know she was here until she leaned over me and said:  “A 
great battle has been fought.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref51" n="51" rend="sc" target="note51">1</ref>   Joe Johnston led the right
<note id="note51" n="51" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref51">1. The first battle of Bull Run, or Manassas, fought on July 21, 1861,

Federals by General McDowell.  Bull Run is a small stream tributary

<pb id="mches87" n="87"/>
wing, and Beauregard the left wing of the army.  Your 
husband is all right.  Wade Hampton is wounded.  
Colonel Johnston of the Legion killed; so are Colonel Bee 
and Colonel Bartow.  Kirby Smith<ref targOrder="U" id="ref52" n="52" rend="sc" target="note52">1</ref> is wounded or killed.”</p>
        <p>I had no breath to speak; she went on in that desperate, 
calm way, to which people betake themselves under the 
greatest excitement: “Bartow, rallying his men, leading 
them into the hottest of the light, died gallantly at the head 
of his regiment.  The President telegraphs me only that  ‘it 
is a great victory.’   General Cooper has all the other 
telegrams.”</p>
        <p>Still I said nothing; I was stunned; then I was so grateful. 
Those nearest and dearest to me were safe still.  She 
then began, in the same concentrated voice, to read from a 
paper she held in her hand:   “Dead and dying cover the 
field.  Sherman's battery taken.  Lynchburg regiment cut 
to pieces.  Three hundred of the Legion wounded.”</p>
        <p>That got me up.  Times were too wild with excitement 
to stay in bed.  We went into Mrs. Preston's room, and she 
made me lie down on her bed.  Men, women, and children 
streamed in.  Every living soul had a story to tell.   “Complete 
victory,”  you heard everywhere.  We had been such 
anxious wretches.  The revulsion of feeling was almost too
much to bear.</p>
        <p>To-day I met my friend, Mr. Hunter.  I was on my 
way to Mrs. Bartow's room and begged him to call at some 
other time.  I was too tearful just then for a morning visit
from even the most sympathetic person.</p>
        <p>A woman from Mrs. Bartow's country was in a fury 
because they had stopped her as she rushed to be the first 
to tell Mrs. Bartow her husband was killed, it having been
<note id="note52" n="52" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref52">1. Edmund Kirby Smith, a native of Florida, who had graduated
from West Point, served in the Mexican War, and been Professor of
Mathematics at West Point.  He resigned his commission in the United
States Army after the secession of Florida.</note>
<pb id="mches88" n="88"/>
decided that Mrs. Davis should tell her.  Poor thing!  She 
was found lying on her bed when Mrs. Davis knocked.  
“Come in,” she said.  When she saw it was Mrs. Davis, she 
sat up, ready to spring to her feet, but then there was something 
in Mrs. Davis's pale face that took the life out of her.  
She stared at Mrs. Davis, then sank back, and covered her 
face as she asked: “Is it bad news for me?”   Mrs. Davis 
did not speak.  “Is he killed?”   Afterward Mrs. Bartow 
said to me:  “As soon as I saw Mrs. Davis's face I could not 
say one word.  I knew it all in an instant.  I knew it before
I wrapped the shawl about my head.”</p>
        <p>Maria, Mrs. Preston's maid, furiously patriotic, came 
into my room.  “These colored people say it is printed in 
the papers here that the Virginia people done it all.  Now 
Mars Wade had so many of his men killed and he 
wounded, it stands to reason that South Carolina was no 
ways backward.  If there was ever anything plain, that's 
plain.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Tuesday</hi>.—Witnessed for the first time a military 
funeral.  As that march came wailing up, they say Mrs. 
Bartow fainted.  The empty saddle and the led war-horse 
—we saw and heard it all, and now it seems we are never out 
of the sound of the Dead March in Saul.  It comes and it 
comes, until I feel inclined to close my ears and scream.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Mrs. Singleton and ourselves sat on a bedside 
and mingled our tears for those noble spirits—John 
Darby, Theodore Barker, and James Lowndes.  To-day we 
find we wasted our grief; they are not so much as wounded.  
I dare say all the rest is true about them—in the face of the 
enemy, with flags in their hands, leading their men.   “But 
Dr. Darby is a surgeon.”   He is as likely to forget that as I 
am.   He is grandson of Colonel Thomson of the Revolution, 
called, by way of pet name, by his soldiers, “Old Danger.” 
Thank Heaven they are all quite alive.  And we will not 
cry next time until officially notified.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 24th</hi>.—Here Mr. Chesnut opened my door and 
<pb id="mches89" n="89"/>
walked in.  Out of the fulness of the heart the mouth 
speaketh.  I had to ask no questions.  He gave me an account 
of the battle as he saw it (walking up and down my 
room, occasionally seating himself on a window sill, but 
too restless to remain still many moments) ; and told what 
regiments he was sent to bring up.  He took the orders to 
Colonel Jackson, whose regiment stood so stock still under
file that they were called a  “stone wall.”  Also, they call 
Beauregard, Eugene, and Johnston, Marlboro.  Mr. Chesnut 
rode with Lay's cavalry after the retreating enemy in 
the pursuit, they following them until midnight.  Then 
there came such a fall of rain—rain such as is only known 
in semitropical lands.</p>
        <p>In the drawing-room, Colonel Chesnut was the “belle 
of the ball”;  they crowded him so for news.  He was the 
first arrival that they could get at from the field of 
battle.  But the women had to give way to the dignitaries 
of the land, who were as filled with curiosity as 
themselves—Mr.  Barnwell, Mr. Hunter, Mr. Cobb, Captain 
Ingraham, etc.</p>
        <p>Wilmot de Saussure says Wilson of Massachusetts, a 
Senator of the United States,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref53" n="53" rend="sc" target="note53">1</ref> came to Manassas, <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">en route</hi></foreign> 
to Richmond, with his dancing shoes ready for a festive 
scene which was to celebrate a triumph.  The New York 
Tribune said:  “In a few days we shall have Richmond, 
Memphis, and New Orleans.  They must be taken and at 
once.”  For  “a few days”  maybe now they will modestly 
substitute  “in a few years.”</p>
        <p>They brought me a Yankee soldier's portfolio from the 
battle-field.  The letters had been franked by Senator 
<note id="note53" n="53" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref53">1. Henry Wilson, son of a farm laborer and self-educated, who rose 
to much prominence in the Anti-Slavery contests before the war.  He 
was elected United States Senator from Massachusetts in 1855, holding 
the office until 1873, when he resigned, having been elected Vice-President 
of the United States on the ticket with Ulysses S. Grant.</note>
<pb id="mches90" n="90"/>
Harlan.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref54" n="54" rend="sc" target="note54">1</ref>  One might shed tears over some of the letters.  
Women, wives and mothers, are the same everywhere.  
What a comfort the spelling was!  We had been willing to 
admit that their universal free-school education had put 
them, rank and file, ahead of us <hi rend="italics">literarily</hi>, but these letters
do not attest that fact.  The spelling is comically bad.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 27th</hi>.—Mrs. Davis's drawing-room last night was 
brilliant, and  she was in great force.  Outside a mob called 
for the President.  He did speak—an old war-horse, who 
scents the battle-fields from afar.  His enthusiasm was 
contagious.  They called for Colonel Chesnut, and he gave 
them a capital speech, too.  As public speakers say 
sometimes,  “It was the proudest moment of my life.”   I did 
not hear a great deal of it, for always, when anything happens 
of any moment, my heart beats up in my ears, but the 
distinguished Carolinians who crowded round told me 
how good a speech he made.  I was dazed.  There goes the
Dead March for some poor soul.</p>
        <p>To-day, the President told us at dinner that Mr. Chesnut's 
eulogy of Bartow in the Congress was highly praised.  
Men liked it.  Two eminently satisfactory speeches in 
twenty-four hours is doing pretty well.  And now I could be 
happy, but this Cabinet of ours are in such bitter quarrels 
among themselves—everybody abusing everybody.</p>
        <p>Last night, while those splendid descriptions of the battle 
were being given to the crowd below from our windows, 
I said:  “Then, why do we not go on to Washington?”
“You mean why did they not; the opportunity is lost.” 
Mr. Barnwell said to me: “Silence, we want to 
listen to the speaker,” and Mr. Hunter smiled compassionately,
“Don't ask awkward questions.”</p>
        <p>Kirby Smith came down on the turnpike in the very 
nick of time.  Still, the heroes who fought all day and

<pb id="mches91" n="91"/>
held the Yankees in check deserve credit beyond words, or 
it would all have been over before the Joe Johnston contingent 
came.  It is another case of the eleventh-hour scrape; 
the eleventh-hour men claim all the credit, and they who 
bore the heat and brunt and burden of the day do not 
like that.</p>
        <p>Everybody said at first,  “Pshaw!  There will be no 
war.”   Those who foresaw evil were called ravens, ill-foreboders.  
Now the same sanguine people all cry,  “The war 
is over”—the very same who were packing to leave Richmond 
a few days ago.  Many were ready to move on at a 
moment's warning, when the good news came.  There are 
such owls everywhere.</p>
        <p>But, to revert to the other kind, the sage and circumspect, 
those who say very little, but that little shows they 
think the war barely begun.  Mr. Rives and Mr. Seddon 
have just called.  Arnoldus Van der Horst came to see me 
at the same time.  He said there was no great show of victory 
on our side until two o'clock, but when we began to 
win, we did it in double-quick time.  I mean, of course, the 
battle last Sunday.</p>
        <p>Arnold Harris told Mr. Wigfall the news from Washington 
last Sunday.  For hours the telegrams reported at 
rapid intervals, “Great victory,”   “Defeating them at all 
points.”  The couriers began to come in on horseback, and 
at last, after two or three o'clock, there was a sudden cessation 
of all news, About nine messengers with bulletins 
came on foot or on horseback—wounded, weary, draggled, 
footsore, panic-stricken—spreading in their path on every 
hand terror and dismay.  That was our opportunity.  Wigfall 
can see nothing that could have stopped us, and when 
they explain why we did not go to Washington  I understand 
it all less than ever.  Yet here we will dilly-dally, 
and Congress orate, and generals parade, until they in 
the North, get up an army three times as large as McDowell's, 
which we have just defeated.</p>
        <pb id="mches92" n="92"/>
        <p>Trescott says this victory will be our ruin.  It lulls us 
into a fool's paradise of conceit at our superior valor, and 
the shameful farce of their flight will wake every inch of 
their manhood.  It was the very fillip they needed.  There 
are a quieter sort here who know their Yankees well.  They 
say if the thing begins to pay—government contracts, and 
all that—we will never hear the end of it, at least, until 
they get their pay in some way out of us.  They will not 
lose money by us.  Of that we may be sure.  Trust Yankee
shrewdness and vim for that.</p>
        <p>There seems to be a battle raging at Bethel, but no mortal 
here can be got to think of anything but Manassas. 
Mrs. McLean says she does not see that it was such a great 
victory, and if it be so great, how can one defeat hurt a
nation like the North.</p>
        <p>John Waties fought the whole battle over for me.  Now 
I understand it.  Before this nobody would take the time 
to tell the thing consecutively, rationally, and in order.  
Mr. Venable said he did not see a braver thing done than 
the cool performance of a Columbia negro.  He carried his 
master a bucket of ham and rice, which he had cooked for 
him, and he cried: “You must be so tired and hungry, 
marster; make haste and eat.”  This was in the thickest of 
the fight, under the heaviest of the enemy's guns.</p>
        <p>The Federal Congressmen had been making a picnic of
it: their luggage was all ticketed to Richmond.  Cameron
has issued a proclamation.  They are making ready to come
after us on a magnificent scale.  They acknowledge us at 
last foemen worthy of their steel.  The Lord help us, since 
England and France won't, or don't.  If we could only 
get a friend outside and open a port.</p>
        <p>One of these men told me he had seen a Yankee prisoner, 
who asked him  “what sort of a diggins Richmond was for 
trade.”  He was tired of the old concern, and would like 
to take the oath and settle here.  They brought us handcuffs 
found in the <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">débacle</hi></foreign> of the Yankee army.  For whom 
<pb id="mches93" n="93"/>
were they?  Jeff Davis, no doubt, and the ringleaders.  
“Tell that to the marines.”  We have outgrown the handcuff 
business on this side of the water.</p>
        <p>Dr. Gibbes says he was at a country house near Manassas, 
when a Federal soldier, who had lost his way, came in 
exhausted.  He asked for brandy, which the lady of the 
house gave him.  Upon second thought, he declined it.  She 
brought it to him so promptly he said he thought it might 
be poisoned; his mind was; she was enraged, and said: 
“Sir, I am a Virginia woman.  Do you think I could be as 
base as that?  Here, Bill, Tom, disarm this man.  He is our 
prisoner.”  The negroes came running, and the man 
surrendered without more ado.</p>
        <p>Another Federal was drinking at the well.  A negro 
girl said: “You go in and see Missis.”   The man went in 
and she followed, crying triumphantly: “Look here, Missis,
I got a prisoner, too!”  This lady sent in her two prisoners, 
and Beauregard complimented her on her pluck and 
patriotism, and her presence of mind.  These negroes were 
rewarded by their owners.</p>
        <p>Now if slavery is as disagreeable to negroes as we think 
it, why don't they all march over the border where they 
would be received with open arms?  It all amazes me.  I 
am always studying these creatures.  They are to me 
inscrutable in their way and past finding out.  Our negroes 
were not ripe for John Brown.</p>
        <p>This is how I saw Robert E. Lee for the first time: 
though his family, then living at Arlington, called to see 
me while I was in Washington (I thought because of old 
Colonel Chesnut's intimacy with Nellie Custis in the old 
Philadelphia days, Mrs. Lee being Nelly Custis's niece),  I 
had not known the head of the Lee family.  He was somewhere 
with the army then.</p>
        <p>Last summer at the White Sulphur were Roony Lee and 
his wife, that sweet little Charlotte Wickam, and I spoke of 
Roony with great praise.  Mrs. Izard said:  “Don't waste 
<pb id="mches94" n="94"/>
your admiration on him; wait till you see his father.  He 
is the nearest to a perfect man I ever saw.”   “How?” 
“In every way—handsome, clever, agreeable, high-bred.”</p>
        <p>Now, Mrs. Stanard came for Mrs. Preston and me to 
drive to the camp in an open carriage.  A man riding a 
beautiful horse joined us.  He wore a hat with something 
of a military look to it, sat his horse gracefully, and was 
so distinguished at all points that I very much regretted 
not catching his name as Mrs. Stanard gave it to us.  He, 
however, heard ours, and bowed as gracefully as he rode, 
and the few remarks he made to each of us showed he knew 
all about us.</p>
        <p>But Mrs. Stanard was in ecstasies of pleasurable excitement.  
I felt that she had bagged a big fish, for just then 
they abounded in Richmond.  Mrs. Stanard accused him 
of being ambitious, etc.  He remonstrated and said his 
tastes were “of the simplest.” He only wanted  “a 
Virginia farm, no end of cream and fresh butter and fried 
chicken—not one fried chicken, or two, but unlimited fried
chicken.”</p>
        <p>To all this light chat did we seriously incline, because 
the man and horse and everything about him were 
so fine-looking; perfection, in fact; no fault to be found if 
you hunted for it.  As he left us, I said eagerly,  “Who is 
he?”  “You did not know!  Why, it was Robert E. Lee, 
son of Light Horse Harry Lee, the first man in Virginia,” 
raising her voice as she enumerated his glories.  All the 
same, I like Smith Lee better, and I like his looks, too.  I 
know Smith Lee well.  Can anybody say they know his 
brother?  I doubt it.  He looks so cold, quiet, and grand.</p>
        <p>Kirby Smith is our Blücher; he came on the field in the 
nick of time, as Blücher at Waterloo, and now we are as the 
British, who do not remember Blücher.  It is all Wellington.  
So every individual man I see fought and won the 
battle.  From Kershaw up and down, all the eleventh-hour 
men won the battle;  turned the tide.  The Marylanders—

Elzey &amp; Co.—one never hears of—as little as one hears of

        <p>Mr. Venable was praising Hugh Garden and Kershaw's 
regiment generally.  This was delightful.  They are my 
friends and neighbors at home.  I showed him Mary Stark's 
letter, and we agreed with her.  At the bottom of our hearts 
we believe every Confederate soldier to be a hero, <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">sans peur 
et sans reproche.</hi></foreign></p>
        <p>Hope for the best to-day.  Things must be on a pleasanter 
footing all over the world.  Met the President in the 
corridor.  He took me by both hands.  “Have you
breakfasted?” said he.  “Come in and breakfast with me?”  
Alas!  I had had my breakfast.</p>
        <p>At the public dining-room, where I had taken my 
breakfast with Mr. Chesnut, Mrs. Davis came to him, while we 
were at table.  She said she had been to our rooms.  She 
wanted Wigfall hunted up.  Mr. Davis thought Chesnut 
would be apt to know his whereabouts.  I ran to Mrs.  Wigfall's 
room, who told me she was sure he could be found 
with his regiment in camp, but Mr. Chesnut had not to go to
the camp, for Wigfall came to his wife's room while I was 
there.  Mr. Davis and Wigfall would be friends, if—if—</p>
        <p>The Northern papers say we hung and quartered a 
Zouave; cut him into four pieces; and that we tie prisoners 
to a tree and bayonet them.  In other words, we are savages.  
It ought to teach us not to credit what our papers 
say of them.  It is so absurd an imagination of evil.  We are 
absolutely treating their prisoners as well as our own men: 
we are complained of for it here.  I am going to the hospitals 
for the enemy's sick and wounded in order to see for 
myself.</p>
        <p>Why did we not follow the flying foe across the Potomac?  
That is the question of the hour in the drawing-room
with those of us who are not contending as to  “who 
took Rickett's Battery?”  Allen Green, for one, took it.  
Allen told us that, finding a portmanteau with nice clean 
<pb id="mches96" n="96"/>
shirts, he was so hot and dusty he stepped behind a tree 
and put on a clean Yankee shirt, and was more comfortable.</p>
        <p>The New York Tribune soothes the Yankee self-conceit, 
which has received a shock, by saying we had 100,000 men 
on the field at Manassas; we had about 15,000 effective men 
in all.  And then, the Tribune tries to inflame and envenom 
them against us by telling lies as to our treatment of prisoners.  
They say when they come against us next it will be 
in overwhelming force.  I long to see Russell's letter to the 
London Times about Bull Run and Manassas.  It will be 
rich and rare.  In Washington, it is crimination and 
recrimination.  Well, let them abuse one another to their
hearts' content.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 1st.</hi>—Mrs. Wigfall, with the “Lone Star” flag 
in her carriage, called for me.  We drove to the fair 
grounds.  Mrs. Davis's landau, with her spanking bays, 
rolled along in front of us.  The fair grounds are as covered 
with tents, soldiers, etc., as ever.  As one regiment 
moves off  to the army, a fresh one from home comes to be
mustered in and take its place.</p>
        <p>The President, with his aides, dashed by.  My husband
was riding with him.  The President presented the flag to 
the Texans.  Mr. Chesnut came to us for the flag, and bore 
it aloft to the President.  We seemed to come in for part of 
the glory.  We were too far off to hear the speech, but Jeff 
Davis is very good at that sort of thing, and we were satisfied
that it was well done.</p>
        <p>Heavens! how that redoubtable Wigfall did rush those 
poor Texans about!  He maneuvered and marched them 
until I was weary for their sakes.  Poor fellows; it was a  
hot afternoon in August and the thermometer in the nineties.  
Mr. Davis uncovered to speak.  Wigfall replied with
his hat on.  Is that military?</p>
        <p>At the fair grounds to-day, such music, mustering, and 
marching, such cheering and flying of flags, such firing of 
guns and all that sort of thing.  A gala day it was, with 
<pb id="mches97" n="97"/>
double-distilled Fourth-of-July feeling.  In the midst of 
it all, a messenger came to tell Mrs. Wigfall that a telegram 
had been received, saying her children were safe across the 
lines in Gordonsville.  That was something to thank God 
for, without any doubt.</p>
        <p>These two little girls came from somewhere in Connecticut, 
with Mrs. Wigfall's sister—the one who gave me my 
Bogotsky, the only person in the world, except Susan Rutledge 
who ever seemed to think I had a soul to save.  Now 
suppose Seward had held Louisa and Fanny as hostages 
for Louis Wigfall's good behavior; eh?</p>
        <p>Excitement number two: that bold brigadier, the Georgia 
General Toombs, charging about too recklessly, got 
thrown.  His horse dragged him up to the wheels of our 
carriage.  For a moment it was frightful.  Down there 
among the horses' hoofs was a face turned up toward us, 
purple with rage.  His foot was still in the stirrup, and he 
had not let go the bridle.  The horse was prancing over him, 
tearing and plunging; everybody was hemming him in, and 
they seemed so slow and awkward about it.  We felt it an 
eternity, looking down at him, and expecting him to be 
killed before our very faces.  However, he soon got it all 
straight, and, though awfully tousled and tumbled, dusty, 
rumpled, and flushed, with redder face and wilder hair
than ever, he rode off gallantly, having to our admiration 
bravely remounted the recalcitrant charger.</p>
        <p>Now if I were to pick out the best abused one, where all 
catch it so bountifully, I should say Mr. Commissary-General 
Northrop was the most  “cussed ” and villified man in 
the Confederacy.  He is held accountable for everything 
that goes wrong in the army.  He may not be efficient, but 
having been a classmate and crony of Jeff Davis at West 
Point, points the moral and adorns the tale.  I hear that 
alluded to oftenest of his many crimes.  They say Beauregard 
writes that his army is upon the verge of starvation.  
Here every man, woman, and child is ready to hang to the 
<pb id="mches98" n="98"/>
first lamp-post anybody of whom that army complains.  
Every Manassas soldier is a hero dear to our patriotic 
hearts.  Put up with any neglect of the heroes of the 21st 
July—never!</p>
        <p>And now they say we did not move on right after the 
flying foe because we had no provisions, no wagons, no 
ammunition, etc.  Rain, mud, and Northrop.  Where were 
the enemy's supplies that we bragged so of bagging?  Echo 
answers where?  Where there is a will there is a way.  We 
stopped to plunder that rich convoy, and somehow, for a 
day or so, everybody thought the war was over and stopped 
to rejoice: so it appeared here.  All this was our dinner-table 
talk to-day.  Mr. Mason dined with us and Mr. Barnwell 
sits by me always.  The latter reproved me sharply, 
but Mr. Mason laughed at   “this headlong, unreasonable 
woman's harangue and female tactics and their war-ways.”
A freshet in the autumn does not compensate for a drought 
in the spring.  Time and tide wait for no man, and there 
was a tide in our affairs which might have led to Washington, 
and we did not take it and lost our fortune this 
round.  Things which nobody could deny.</p>
        <p>McClellan virtually supersedes the Titan Scott.  
Physically General Scott is the largest man I ever saw.  
Mrs. Scott said,  “nobody but his wife could ever know 
how little he was.”  And yet they say, old Winfield Scott 
could have organized an army for them if they had had 
patience.  They would not give him time.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 2d</hi>.—Prince Jerome<ref targOrder="U" id="ref55" n="55" rend="sc" target="note55">1</ref> has gone to Washington.

<pb id="mches99" n="99"/>
and we have to meet disciplined and armed men, soldiers 
who understand war, Frenchmen, with all the elan we 
boast of .</p>
        <p>Ransom Calhoun, Willie Preston, and Doctor Nott's 
boys are here.  These foolish, rash, hare-brained Southern 
lads have been within an ace of a fight with a Maryland 
company for their camping grounds.  It is much too Irish 
to be so ready to fight anybody, friend or foe.  Men are 
thrilling with fiery ardor.  The red-hot Southern martial 
spirit is in the air.  These young men, however, were all 
educated abroad.  And it is French or German ideas that 
they are filled with.  The Marylanders were as rash and 
reckless as the others, and had their coat-tails ready for 
anybody to tread on, Donnybrook Fair fashion.  One would 
think there were Yankees enough and to spare for any killing 
to be done.  It began about picketing their horses.  But 
these quarrelsome young soldiers have lovely manners.  
They are so sweet-tempered when seen here among us at 
the Arlington.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 5th</hi>.—A heavy, heavy heart.  Another missive 
from Jordan, querulous and fault-finding; things are all 
wrong—Beauregard's Jordan had been crossed, not the 
stream  “in Canaan's fair and happy land, where our 
possessions lie.”  They seem to feel that the war is over here, 
except the President and Mr. Barnwell; above all that 
foreboding friend of mine, Captain Ingraham.  He thinks it 
hardly begun.</p>
        <p>Another outburst from Jordan.  Beauregard is not 
seconded properly.  <hi rend="italics">Hélas!</hi>  To think that any mortal general 
(even though he had sprung up in a month or so from 
captain of artillery to general) could be so puffed up with 
vanity, so blinded by any false idea of his own consequence 
as to write, to intimate that man, or men, would sacrifice 
their country, injure themselves, ruin their families, to 
spite the aforesaid general!  Conceit and self-assertion can 
never reach a higher point than that.  And yet they give 
<pb id="mches100" n="100"/>
you to understand Mr. Davis does not like Beauregard.  In 
point of fact they fancy he is jealous of him, and rather 
than Beauregard shall have a showing the President (who 
would be hanged at least if things go wrong) will cripple 
the army to spite Beauregard.  Mr. Mallory says,  “How 
we could laugh, but you see it is no laughing matter to have 
our fate in the hands of such self-sufficient, vain, army 
idiots.”  So the amenities of life are spreading.</p>
        <p>In the meantime we seem to be resting on our oars, 
debating in Congress, while the enterprising Yankees are 
quadrupling their army at their leisure.  Every day some 
of our regiments march away from here.  The town is 
crowded with soldiers.  These new ones are fairly running 
in; fearing the war will be over before they get a sight of 
the fun.  Every man from every little precinct wants a
place in the picture.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Tuesday</hi>.—The North requires 600,000 men to invade us.  
Truly we are a formidable power!  The Herald says it is 
useless to move with a man less than that.  England has made 
it all up with them, or rather, she will not break with them.  
Jerome Napoleon is in Washington and not our friend.</p>
        <p>Doctor Gibbes is a bird of ill omen.  To-day he tells me
eight of our men have died at the Charlottesville Hospital.
It seems sickness is more redoubtable in an army than the 
enemy's guns.  There are 1,100 there <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">hors de combat</hi></foreign>, and 
typhoid fever is with them.  They want money, clothes, 
and nurses.  So, as I am writing, right and left the letters 
fly, calling for help from the sister societies at home.  Good 
and patriotic women at home are easily stirred to their work.</p>
        <p>Mary Hammy has many strings to her bow—a <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">fiancé</hi></foreign> in 
the army, and Doctor Berrien in town.  To-day she drove 
out with Major Smith and Colonel Hood.  Yesterday, Custis 
Lee was here.  She is a prudent little puss and needs no 
good advice, if I were one to give it.</p>
        <p>Lawrence does all our shopping.  All his master's money

when gold is at such a premium to leave it lying loose in 
the tray of a trunk.  So I have sewed it up in a belt, which 
I can wear upon an emergency.  The cloth is wadded and 
my diamonds are there, too.  It has strong strings, and can 
be tied under my hoops about my waist if the worst comes 
to the worst, as the saying is.  Lawrence wears the same 
bronze mask.  No sign of anything he may feel or think of 
my latest fancy.  Only, I know he asks for twice as much 
money now when he goes to buy things.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 8th</hi>.—To-day I saw a sword captured at Manassas.  
The man who brought the sword, in the early part 
of the fray, was taken prisoner by the Yankees.   They 
stripped him, possessed themselves of his sleeve-buttons, 
and were in the act of depriving him of his boots when the 
rout began and the play was reversed; proceedings then 
took the opposite tack.</p>
        <p>From a small rill in the mountain has flowed the mighty 
stream which has made at last Louis Wigfall the worst 
enemy the President has in the Congress, a fact which 
complicates our affairs no little.  Mr. Davis's hands ought to 
be strengthened; he ought to be upheld.  A divided house 
must fall, we all say.</p>
        <p>Mrs.  Sam Jones, who is called Becky by her friends and 
cronies, male and female, said that Mrs.  Pickens had 
confided to the aforesaid Jones (<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">née</hi></foreign> Taylor, and so of the 
President Taylor family and cousin of Mr. Davis's first 
wife), that Mrs. Wigfall  “described Mrs. Davis to Mrs.
Pickens as a coarse Western woman.”   Now the fair Lucy 
Holcombe and Mrs. Wigfall had a quarrel of their own out 
in Texas, and, though reconciled, there was bitterness 
underneath.  At first, Mrs. Joe Johnston called Mrs. Davis 
“a Western belle,”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref56" n="56" rend="sc" target="note56">1</ref>  but when the quarrel between General

<pb id="mches102" n="102"/>
Johnston and the President broke out, Mrs. Johnston
took back the  “belle” and substituted  “woman” in the
narrative derived from Mrs. Jones.</p>
        <p>Commodore Barron<ref targOrder="U" id="ref57" n="57" rend="sc" target="note57">1</ref> came with glad tidings.  We had 
taken three prizes at sea, and brought them in safely, one 
laden with molasses.  General Toombs told us the President 
complimented Mr. Chesnut when he described the battle 
scene to his Cabinet, etc.  General Toombs is certain Colonel 
Chesnut will be made one of the new batch of brigadiers.  
Next came Mr. Clayton, who calmly informed us Jeff Davis 
would not get the vote of this Congress for President, so 
we might count him out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Meynardie first told us how pious a Christian Soldier 
was Kershaw, how he prayed, got up, dusted his knees 
and led his men on to victory with a dash and courage 
equal to any Old Testament mighty man of war.</p>
        <p>Governor Manning's account of Prince Jerome Napoleon:
“He is stout and he is not handsome.  Neither 
is he young, and as he reviewed our troops he was terribly 
overheated.”  He heard him say “<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">en avant</hi></foreign>,” of 
that he could testify of his own knowledge, and he was 
told he had been heard to say with unction “<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">Allons</hi></foreign>” 
more than once.  The sight of the battle-field had made 
the Prince seasick, and he received gratefully a draft of 
fiery whisky.</p>
        <p>Arrago seemed deeply interested in Confederate statistics, 
and praised our doughty deeds to the skies.  It was 
but soldier fare our guests received, though we did our 
best.  It was hard sleeping and  worse eating in camp.  
Beauregard is half Frenchman and speaks French like a 
native.  So one awkward mess was done away with, and it 
was a comfort to see Beauregard speak without the agony

of finding words in the foreign language and forming them, 
with damp brow, into sentences.  A different fate befell 
others who spoke  “a little French.”</p>
        <p>General and Mrs. Cooper came to see us.  She is Mrs. 
Smith Lee's sister.  They were talking of old George 
Mason—in Virginia a name to conjure with.  George Mason 
violently opposed the extension of slavery.  He was a 
thorough aristocrat, and gave as his reason for refusing the 
blessing of slaves to the new States, Southwest and Northwest, 
that vulgar new people were unworthy of so sacred a 
right as that of holding slaves.  It was not an institution 
intended for such people as they were.  Mrs. Lee said: 
“After all, what good does it do my sons that they are 
Light Horse Harry Lee's grandsons and George Mason's?  
I do not see that it helps them at all.”</p>
        <p>A friend in Washington writes me that we might have 
walked into Washington any day for a week after Manassas, 
such were the consternation and confusion there.  But the 
god Pan was still blowing his horn in the woods.  Now she 
says Northern troops are literally pouring in from all quarters.  
The horses cover acres of ground.  And she thinks
we have lost our chance forever.</p>
        <p>A man named Grey (the same gentleman whom Secretary 
of War Walker so astonished by greeting him with, 
“Well, sir, and what is your business?”) described the
battle of the 21st as one succession of blunders, redeemed by 
the indomitable courage of the two-thirds who did not run 
away on our side.  Doctor Mason said a fugitive on the 
other side informed him that  “a million of men with the 
devil at their back could not have whipped the rebels at
Bull Run.”  That's nice.</p>
        <p>There must be opposition in a free country.  But it is 
very uncomfortable.   “United we stand, divided we fall.” 
Mrs. Davis showed us in The New York Tribune an extract 
from an Augusta (Georgia) paper saying,  “Cobb is our 
man.  Davis is at heart a reconstructionist.” We may be 
<pb id="mches104" n="104"/>
flies on the wheel, we know our insignificance; but Mrs.
Preston and myself have entered into an agreement; our 
oath is recorded on high.  We mean to stand by our President 
and to stop all fault-finding with the powers that be, 
if we can and  where we can, be the fault-finders generals 
or Cabinet Ministers.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 13th</hi>.—Hon. Robert Barnwell says,  “The Mercury's 
influence began this opposition to Jeff Davis before 
he had time to do wrong.  They were offended, not with him 
so much as with the man who was put into what they 
considered Barnwell Rhett's rightful place.  The latter had 
howled nullification and secession so long that when he 
found his ideas taken up by all the Confederate world, he 
felt he had a vested right to leadership.”</p>
        <p>Jordan, Beauregard's aide, still writes to Mr. Chesnut 
that the mortality among the raw troops in that camp is 
fearful.  Everybody seems to be doing all they can.  Think 
of the British sick and wounded away off in the Crimea. 
Our people are only a half-day's journey by rail from 
Richmond.  With a grateful heart I record the fact of 
reconciliation with the Wigfalls.  They dined at the 
President's yesterday and the little Wigfall girls stayed all 
night.</p>
        <p>Seward is fêting the outsiders, the cousin of the 
Emperor, Napoleon III., and Russell, of the omnipotent
London Times.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 14th</hi>.—Last night there was a crowd of men to 
see us and they were so markedly critical.  I made a futile 
effort to record their sayings, but sleep and heat overcame
me. To-day I can not remember a word.  One of Mr. 
Mason's stories relates to our sources of trustworthy 
information.  A man of very respectable appearance standing on 
the platform at the depot, announced,   “I am just from the 
seat of war.”  Out came pencil and paper from the newspaper 
men on the <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">qui vive</hi></foreign>.    “Is Fairfax Court House
burned?”  they asked.  “Yes, burned yesterday.”  “But 
<pb id="mches105" n="105"/>
I am just from there,” said another; “left it standing 
there all right an hour or so ago.”  “Oh!  But I must do
them justice to say they burned only the tavern, for they
did not want to tear up and burn anything else after the
railroad.”  “There is no railroad at Fairfax Court
House,” objected the man just from Fairfax.  “Oh!  
Indeed!”  said the seat-of-war man, “I did not know that;
is that so?”  And he coolly seated himself and began talking
of something else.</p>
        <p>Our people are lashing themselves into a fury against
the prisoners.  Only the mob in any country would do that.
But I am told to be quiet.  Decency and propriety will not
be forgotten, and the prisoners will be treated as prisoners
of war ought to be in a civilized country.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 15th</hi>.—Mrs. Randolph came.  With her were the
Freelands, Rose and Maria.  The men rave over Mrs.
Randolph's beauty; called her a magnificent specimen of
the finest type of dark-eyed, rich, and glowing Southern
woman-kind.  Clear brunette she is, with the reddest lips,
the whitest teeth, and glorious eyes; there is no other word
for them.  Having given Mrs. Randolph the prize among
Southern beauties, Mr. Clayton said Prentiss was the finest
Southern orator.  Mr. Marshall and Mr. Barnwell dissented;
they preferred William C. Preston.  Mr. Chesnut had
found Colquitt the best or most effective stump orator.</p>
        <p>Saw Henry Deas Nott.  He is just from Paris, via New
York.  Says New York is ablaze with martial fire.  At no
time during the Crimean war was there ever in Paris the
show of soldiers preparing for the war such as he saw at
New York.  The face of the earth seemed covered with
marching regiments.</p>
        <p>Not more than 500 effective men are in Hampton's
Legion, but they kept the whole Yankee army at bay until
half-past two.  Then just as Hampton was wounded and
half his colonels shot, Cash and Kershaw (from Mrs. Smith
Lee audibly, “How about Kirby Smith?”) dashed in and
<pb id="mches106" n="106"/>
not only turned the tide,  but would have driven the 
fugitives into Washington, but Beauregard recalled them.  Mr.
Chesnut finds all this very amusing, as he posted many of
the regiments and all the time was carrying orders over the
filed.  The discrepancies in all these private memories amuse
him, but he smiles pleasantly and lets every man tell the
tale in his own way.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 16th</hi>.—Mr. Barnwell says, Fame is an article
usually home made; you must create your own puffs or

will give you half the credit you take to yourself.  No one
will look after your fine name before the world with the
loving interest and faith you have yourself.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 17th</hi>.—Captain Shannon, of the Kirkwood Rangers,
called and stayed three hours.  Has not been under fire
yet, but is keen to see or to hear the flashing of the guns;
proud of himself, proud of his company, but proudest of all
that he has no end of the bluest blood of the low country in
his troop.  He seemed to find my knitting a pair of socks a
day for the soldiers droll in some way.  The yarn is coarse.
He has been so short a time from home he does not know how
the poor soldiers need them.  He was so overpoweringly
flattering to my husband that I found him very pleasant
company.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 18th</hi>.—Found it quite exciting to have a spy
drinking his tea with us—perhaps because I knew his 
profession.  I did not like his face.  He is said to have a
scheme by which Washington will fall into our hands like
an overripe peach.</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnwell urges Mr. Chesnut to remain in the Senate.
There are so many generals, or men anxious to be.  He
says Mr. Chesnut can do his country most good by wise
counsels where they are most needed.  I do not say to the
contrary; I dare not throw my influence on the army side,
for if anything happened!</p>

        <p>Mr. Miles told us last night that he had another letter 
from General Beauregard.  The General wants to know 
if Mr. Miles has delivered his message to Colonel Kershaw.  
Mr. Miles says he has not done so; neither does he mean to 
do it.  They must settle these matters of veracity according 
to their own military etiquette.  He is a civilian once more.  
It is a foolish wrangle.  Colonel Kershaw ought to have 
reported to his commander-in-chief, and not made an 
independent report and published it.  He meant no harm.  He
is not yet used to the fine ways of war.</p>
        <p>The New York Tribune is so unfair.  It began by howling 
to get rid of us: we were so wicked.  Now that we are 
so willing to leave them to their overrighteous self-consciousness, 
they cry: “Crush our enemy, or they will subjugate 
us.”  The idea that we want to invade or subjugate 
anybody; we would be only too grateful to be left alone.  
We ask no more of gods or men. </p>
        <p>Went to the hospital with a carriage load of peaches and 
grapes.  Made glad the hearts of some men thereby.  When 
my supplies gave out, those who had none looked so 
wistfully as I passed out that I made a second raid on the 
market.  Those eyes sunk in cavernous depths and following me
from bed to bed haunt me.</p>
        <p>Wilmot de Saussure, harrowed my soul by an account 
of a recent death by drowning on the beach at Sullivan's
Island.  Mr. Porcher, who was trying to save his sister's 
life, lost his own and his child's.  People seem to die out 
of the army quite as much as in it.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Randolph presided in all her beautiful majesty at 
an aid association.  The ladies were old, and all wanted 
their own way.  They were cross-grained and contradictory, 
and the blood mounted rebelliously into Mrs. Randolph's 
clear-cut cheeks, but she held her own with dignity and 
grace.  One of the causes of disturbance was that Mrs. 
Randolph proposed to divide everything sent on equally with 
the Yankee wounded and sick prisoners.  Some were enthusiastic
<pb id="mches108" n="108"/>
from a Christian point of view; some shrieked in 
wrath at the bare idea of putting our noble soldiers on a par 
with Yankees, living, dying, or dead.  Fierce dames were 
some of them, august, severe matrons, who evidently had not 
been accustomed to hear the other side of any question from 
anybody, and just old enough to find the last pleasure in 
life to reside in power—the power to make their claws felt.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 23d</hi>.—A brother of Doctor Garnett has come 
fresh and straight from Cambridge, Mass., and says (or is 
said to have said, with all the difference there is between the 
two), that  “recruiting up there is dead.”  He came by 
Cincinnati and Pittsburg and says all the way through it 
was so sad, mournful, and quiet it looked like Sunday.</p>
        <p>I asked Mr. Brewster if it were true Senator Toombs 
had turned brigadier.  “Yes, soldiering is in the air.  
Every one will have a touch of it.  Toombs could not stay 
in the Cabinet.”  “Why?”  “Incompatibility of temper.  
He rides too high a horse; that is, for so despotic a 
person as Jeff Davis.  I have tried to find out the sore, but 
I can't.  Mr. Toombs has been out with them all for 
months.” Dissension will break out.  Everything does, 
but it takes a little time.  There is a perfect magazine of 
discord and discontent in that Cabinet; only wants a hand 
to apply the torch, and up they go.  Toombs says old 
Memminger has his back up as high as any.</p>
        <p>Oh, such a day!  Since I wrote this morning, I have 
been with Mrs. Randolph to all the hospitals.  I can never 
again shut out of view the sights I saw there of human 
misery.  I sit thinking, shut my eyes, and see it all; thinking, 
yes, and there is enough to think about now, God 
knows.  Gilland's was the worst, with long rows of ill men 
on cots, ill of typhoid fever, of every human ailment; on 
dinner-tables for eating and drinking, wounds being 
dressed; all the horrors to be taken in at one glance.</p>
        <p>Then we went to the St. Charles.  Horrors upon horrors
again; want of organization, long rows of dead and 
<pb id="mches109" n="109"/>
dying; awful sights.  A boy from home had sent for me.  
He was dying in a cot, ill of fever.  Next him a man died 
in convulsions as we stood there.  I was making arrangements 
with a nurse, hiring him to take care of this lad; but 
I do not remember any more, for I fainted.  Next that I 
knew of, the doctor and Mrs. Randolph were having me, a 
limp rag, put into a carriage at the door of the hospital.  
Fresh air, I dare say, brought me to.  As we drove home
the doctor came along with us, I was so upset.  He said: 
“Look at that Georgia regiment marching there; look at 
their servants on the sidewalk.  I have been counting them, 
making an estimate.  There is $16,000—sixteen thousand 
dollars' worth of negro property which can go off on its 
own legs to the Yankees whenever it pleases.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 24th</hi>.—Daniel, of The Examiner, was at the 
President's.  Wilmot de Saussure wondered if a fellow did 
not feel a little queer, paying his respects in person at the 
house of a man whom he abused daily in his newspaper.</p>
        <p>A fiasco: an aide engaged to two young ladies in the 
same house.  The ladies had been quarreling, but became 
friends unexpectedly when his treachery, among many 
other secrets, was revealed under that august roof.  Fancy 
the row when it all came out.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lowndes said we have already reaped one good 
result from the war.  The orators, the spouters, the furious 
patriots, that could hardly be held down, and who were so 
wordily anxious to do or die for their country—they had 
been the pest of our lives.  Now they either have not tried 
the battle-field at all, or have precipitately left it at their 
earliest convenience: for very shame we are rid of them for 
a while.  I doubt it.  Bright's speech<ref targOrder="U" id="ref58" n="58" rend="sc" target="note58">1</ref>  is dead against us. 
Reading this does not brighten one.</p>
        <note id="note58" n="58" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref58">1.  The reference is to John Bright, whose advocacy of the cause of
        the Union in the British Parliament attracted a great deal of attention
        at the time.</note>
        <pb id="mches110" n="110"/>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 25th</hi>.—Mr. Barnwell says democracies lead to 
untruthfulness.  To be always electioneering is to be 
always false; so both we and the Yankees are unreliable as 
regards our own exploits.  “How about empires?  Were 
there ever more stupendous lies than the Emperor Napoleon's?” 
Mr. Barnwell went on:   “People dare not tell 
the truth in a canvass; they must conciliate their 
constituents.  Now everybody in a democracy always wants an 
office; at least, everybody in Richmond just now seems to 
want one.”   Never heeding interruptions, he went on: 
“As a nation, the English are the most truthful in the 
world.”  “And so are our country gentlemen: they own 
their constituents—at least, in some of the parishes, where 
there are few whites; only immense estates peopled by 
negroes. ”  Thackeray speaks of the lies that were told 
on both sides in the British wars with France; England 
kept quite alongside of her rival in that fine art.  England 
lied then as fluently as Russell lies about us now.</p>
        <p>Went to see Agnes De Leon, my Columbia school friend. 
She is fresh from Egypt, and I wished to hear of the Nile, 
the crocodiles, the mummies, the Sphinx, and the Pyramids.  
But her head ran upon Washington life, such as we knew 
it, and her soul was here.  No theme was possible but a 
discussion of the latest war news.</p>
        <p>Mr. Clayton, Assistant Secretary of State, says we 
spend two millions a week.  Where is all that money to 
come from?  They don't want us to plant cotton, but to 
make provisions.  Now, cotton always means money, or did 
when there was an outlet for it and anybody to buy it.  
Where is money to come from now?</p>
        <p>Mr. Barnwell's new joke, I dare say, is a Joe Miller, 
but Mr. Barnwell  laughed in telling it till he cried.  A man 
was fined for contempt of court and then, his case coming 
on, the Judge talked such arrant nonsense and was so 
warped in his mind against the poor man, that the “fined 
one”   walked up and handed the august Judge a five-dollar 
<pb id="mches111" n="111"/>
bill.  “Why?  What is that for?”  said the Judge.  “Oh,
I feel such a contempt of this court coming on again!”</p>
        <p>I came up tired to death; took down my hair; had it 
hanging over me in a Crazy Jane fashion; and sat still, 
hands over my head (half undressed, but too lazy and 
sleepy to move).  I was sitting in a rocking-chair by an 
open window taking my ease and the cool night air, when 
suddenly the door opened and Captain ———walked in.  
He was in the middle of the room before he saw his mistake; 
he stared and was transfixed, as the novels say.  I dare say 
I looked an ancient Gorgon.  Then, with a more frantic 
glare, he turned and fled without a word.  I got up and 
bolted the door after him, and then looked in the glass and 
laughed myself into hysterics.  I shall never forget to lock 
the door again.  But it does not matter in this case.  I 
looked totally unlike the person bearing my name, who, 
covered with lace cap, etc., frequents the drawing-room.  I 
doubt if he would know me again.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 26th</hi>.—The Terror has full swing at the North 
now.  All the papers favorable to us have been suppressed.  
How long would our mob stand a Yankee paper here?  
But newspapers against our government, such as the 
Examiner and the Mercury flourish like green bay-trees.  A 
man up to the elbows in finance said to-day: “Clayton's 
story is all nonsense.  They do sometimes pay out two 
millions a week; they paid the soldiers this week, but they don't 
pay the soldiers every week.”  “Not by a long shot,” cried 
a soldier laddie with a grin.</p>
        <p>“Why do you write in your diary at all,” some one said 
to me,  “if, as you say, you have to contradict every day 
what you wrote yesterday?”  “Because I tell the tale as 
it is told to me.  I write current rumor.  I do not vouch for 
anything.”</p>
        <p>We went to Pizzini's, that very best of Italian 
confectioners.  From there we went to Miss Sally Tompkins's 
hospital, loaded with good things for the wounded.  The 
<pb id="mches112" n="112"/>
men under Miss Sally's kind care looked so clean and 
comfortable—cheerful, one might say.  They were pleasant and 
nice to see.  One, however, was dismal in tone and aspect, 
and he repeated at intervals with no change of words, in a 
forlorn monotone: “What a hard time we have had since 
we left home.”  But nobody seemed to heed his wailing, 
and it did not impair his appetite.</p>
        <p>At Mrs. Toombs's, who was raging; so anti-Davis she 
will not even admit that the President is ill.  “All humbug.” 
“But what good could pretending to be ill do 
him?”  “That reception now, was not that a humbug? 
Such a failure.  Mrs. Reagan could have done better than 
that. ”</p>
        <p>Mrs. Walker is a Montgomery beauty, with such 
magnificent dresses.  She was an heiress, and is so dissatisfied 
with Richmond, accustomed as she is to being a belle under 
different conditions.  As she is as handsome and well 
dressed as ever, it must be the men who are all wrong.</p>
        <p>“Did you give Lawrence that fifty-dollar bill to go out 
and change it?”   I was asked.   “Suppose he takes himself 
off to the Yankees.  He would leave us with not too many 
fifty-dollar bills.”  He is not going anywhere, however.   I 
think his situation suits him.  That wadded belt of mine, 
with the gold pieces quilted in, has made me ashamed more 
than once.  I leave it under my pillow and my maid finds 
it there and hangs it over the back of a chair, in evidence 
as I reenter the room after breakfast.  When I forget and 
leave my trunk open, Lawrence brings me the keys and tells 
me,  “You oughten to do so, Miss Mary.”   Mr. Chesnut 
leaves all his little money in his pockets, and Lawrence says 
that's why he can't let any one but himself brush Mars 
Jeems's clothes.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 27th</hi>.—Theodore Barker and James Lowndes 
came; the latter has been wretchedly treated.  A man said, 
“All that I wish on earth is to be at peace and on my own 
plantation,” to which Mr. Lowndes replied quietly,   “I  
<pb id="mches113" n="113"/>
wish I had a plantation to be on, but just now I can't see 
how any one would feel justified in leaving the army.”  Mr. 
Barker was bitter against the spirit of braggadocio so 
rampant among us.  The gentleman who had been answered so 
completely by James Lowndes said, with spitefulness: 
“Those women who are so frantic for their husbands to
join the army would like them killed, no doubt.”</p>
        <p>Things were growing rather uncomfortable, but an 
interruption came in the shape of a card.  An old classmate 
of Mr. Chesnut's—Captain Archer, just now fresh from 
California—followed his card so quickly that Mr. Chesnut 
had hardly time to tell us that in Princeton College they 
called him  “Sally.”  Archer he was so pretty—when he 
entered.  He is good-looking still, but the service and consequent 
rough life have destroyed all softness and girlishness.  
He will never be so pretty again.</p>
        <p>The North is consolidated; they move as one man, with 
no States, but an army organized by the central power.  
Russell in the Northern camp is cursed of Yankees for that 
Bull Run letter.  Russell, in his capacity of Englishman, 
despises both sides.  He divides us equally into North and 
South.  He prefers to attribute our victory at Bull Run to 
Yankee cowardice rather than to Southern courage.  He 
gives no credit to either side; for good qualities, we are 
after all mere Americans!  Everything not “national” is 
arrested.  It looks like the business of Seward.</p>
        <p>I do not know when I have seen a woman without knitting 
in her hand.  Socks for the soldiers is the cry. One 
poor man said he had dozens of socks and but one shirt.  
He preferred more shirts and fewer stockings.  We make 
a quaint appearance with this twinkling of needles and the 
everlasting sock dangling below.</p>
        <p>They have arrested Wm.  B. Reed and Miss Winder, she 
boldly proclaiming herself a secessionist.  Why should she 
seek a martyr's crown?  Writing people love notoriety.  It 
is so delightful to be of enough consequence to be arrested. 
<pb id="mches114" n="114"/>
I have often wondered if such incense was ever offered as
Napoleon's so-called persecution and alleged jealousy of 
Madame de Staël.</p>

        <p>Russell once more, to whom London, Paris, and India 
have been an every-day sight, and every-night, too, streets 
and all.  How absurd for him to go on in indignation because 
there have been women on negro plantations who 
were not vestal virgins.  Negro women get married, and 
after marriage behave as well as other people.  Marrying is 
the amusement of their lives.  They take life easily; so do 
their class everywhere.  Bad men are hated here as 
elsewhere. </p>
        <p>“I hate slavery.  I hate a man who— You say there 
are no more fallen women on a plantation than in London 
in proportion to numbers.  But what do you say to this 
—to a magnate who runs a hideous black harem, with its 
consequences, under the same roof with his lovely white 
wife and his beautiful and accomplished daughters?  He 
holds his head high and poses as the model of all human 
virtues to these poor women whom God and the laws have 
given him.  From the height of his awful majesty he scolds 
and thunders at them as if he never did wrong in his life.  
Fancy such a man finding his daughter reading Don 
Juan.   ‘You with that immoral book!’  he would say, 
and then he would order her out of his sight.  You see Mrs. 
Stowe did not hit the sorest spot.  She makes Legree a
bachelor.”  “ Remember George II. and his likes.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, I know half a Legree—a man said to be as cruel as 
Legree, but the other half of him did not correspond.  He 
was a man of polished manners, and the best husband and 
father and member of the church in the world.”  “Can 
that be so?”</p>
        <p>“Yes, I know it.  Exceptional case, that sort of thing, 
always.  And I knew the dissolute half of Legree well.  He 
<pb id="mches115" n="115"/>
was high and mighty, but the kindest creature to his slaves.  
And the unfortunate results of his bad ways were not sold, 
had not to jump over ice-blocks.  They were kept in full
view, and provided for handsomely in his will.”</p>
        <p>“The wife and daughters in the might of their purity 
and innocence are supposed never to dream of what is as 
plain before their eyes as the sunlight, and they play their 
parts of unsuspecting angels to the letter.  They profess to 
adore the father as the model of all saintly goodness.” 
“Well, yes; if he is rich he is the fountain from whence all 
blessings flow.”</p>
        <p>“The one I have in my eye—my half of Legree, the dissolute 
half—was so furious in temper and thundered his 
wrath so at the poor women, they were glad to let him 
do as he pleased in peace if they could only escape his 
everlasting fault-finding, and noisy bluster, making everybody 
so uncomfortable.”  “Now—now, do you know any 
woman of this generation who would stand that sort of 
thing?  No, never, not for one moment.  The make-believe 
angels were of the last century.  We know, and we won't
have it.”</p>
        <p>“The condition of women is improving, it seems.”  
“Women are brought up not to judge their fathers or 
their husbands.  They take them as the Lord provides and 
are thankful.”</p>
        <p>“If they should not go to heaven after all; think what 
lives most women lead.”  “No heaven, no purgatory, no—
the other thing?  Never.  I believe in future rewards and 
punishments.”</p>
        <p>“How about the wives of drunkards?  I heard a woman 
say once to a friend of her husband, tell it as a cruel matter 
of fact, without bitterness, without comment,  ‘Oh, you 
have not seen him!  He has changed.  He has not gone to 
bed sober in thirty years.’   She has had her purgatory, if 
not  ‘the other thing,’   here in this world.  We all know 
what a drunken man is.  To think, <hi rend="italics">for no crime</hi>, a person 
<pb id="mches116" n="116"/>
may be condemned to live with one thirty years.”  “You 
wander from the question I asked.  Are Southern men 
worse because of the slave system and the facile black 
women?  Not a bit.  They see too much of them.  The 
barroom people don't drink, the confectionery people loathe
candy.  They are sick of the black sight of them.”</p>
        <p>“You think a nice man from the South is the nicest 
thing in the world?  I know it.  Put him by any other 
man and see!”</p>

        <p>Have seen Yankee letters taken at Manassas.  The spelling 
is often atrocious, and we thought they had all gone 
through a course of blue-covered Noah Webster spelling-books.  
Our soldiers do spell astonishingly.  There is Horace 
Greeley: they say he can't read his own handwriting.  But, 
he is candid enough and disregards all time-serving.  He 
says in his paper that in our army the North has a hard
 nut to crack, and that the rank and file of our army is 
superior in education and general intelligence to theirs.</p>
        <p>My wildest imagination will not picture Mr. Mason<ref targOrder="U" id="ref59" n="59" rend="sc" target="note59">1</ref>  as 
a diplomat.  He will say chaw for chew, and he will call 
himself Jeems, and he will wear a dress coat to breakfast. 
Over here, whatever a Mason does is right in his own eyes.  
He is above law.  Somebody asked him how he pronounced 
his wife's maiden name: she was a Miss Chew from 
Philadelphia.</p>
        <note id="note59" n="59" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref59">1.  James Murray Mason was a grandson of George Mason, and had 
been elected United States Senator from Virginia in 1847.  In 1851 
he drafted the Fugitive Slave Law.  His mission to England in 1861
was shared by John Slidell.  On November 8, 1861, while on board the
British steamer Trent, in the Bahamas, they were captured by an 
American named Wilkes, and imprisoned in Boston until January 2, 
1862.  A famous diplomatic difficulty arose with England over this 
affair.  John Slidell was a native of New York, who had settled in 
Louisiana and became a Member of Congress from that State in 1843.  In 
1853 he was elected to the United States Senate.</note>
        <pb id="mches117" n="117"/>
        <p>They say the English will like Mr. Mason; he is so 
manly, so straightforward, so truthful and bold.  “A fine 
old English gentleman,” so said Russell to me, “but for 
tobacco.”  “I like Mr. Mason and Mr. Hunter better than 
anybody else.”  “And yet they are wonderfully unlike.” 
“Now you just listen to me,” said I.  “Is Mrs. Davis in 
hearing—no?  Well, this sending  Mr.  Mason to London is 
the maddest thing yet.  Worse in some points of view than 
Yancey, and that was a catastrophe.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 29th</hi>.—No more feminine gossip, but the 
licensed slanderer, the mighty Russell, of the Times.  He 
says the battle of the 21st was fought at long range: 500 
yards apart were the combatants.  The Confederates were 
steadily retreating when some commotion in the wagon 
train frightened the “Yanks,” and they made tracks.  In 
good English, they fled amain.  And on our side we were 
too frightened to follow them—in high-flown English, to 
pursue the flying foe.</p>
        <p>In spite of all this, there are glimpses of the truth 
sometimes, and the story leads to our credit with all the 
sneers and jeers.  When he speaks of the Yankees' cowardice, 
falsehood, dishonesty, and braggadocio, the best words 
are in his mouth.  He repeats the thrice-told tale, so often 
refuted and denied, that we were harsh to wounded prisoners.  
Dr. Gibson told me that their surgeon-general has 
written to thank our surgeons: Yankee officers write very 
differently from Russell.  I know that in that hospital with 
the Sisters of Charity they were better off than our men 
were at the other hospitals: that I saw with my own eyes.  
These poor souls are jealously guarded night and day. 
It is a hideous tale—what they tell of their sufferings.</p>
        <p>Women who come before the public are in a bad box 
now.  False hair is taken off and searched for papers.  
Bustles are “suspect.”  All manner of things, they say, 
come over the border under the huge hoops now worn; so 
they are ruthlessly torn off.  Not legs but arms are looked 
<pb id="mches118" n="118"/>
for under hoops, and, sad to say, found.  Then women are 
used as detectives and searchers, to see that no men slip 
over in petticoats.  So the poor creatures coming this way
are humiliated to the deepest degree.  To men, glory, 
honor, praise, and power, if they are patriots.  To women,
daughters of Eve, punishment comes still in some shape, do 
what they will.</p>
        <p>Mary Hammy's eyes were starting from her head with 
amazement, while a very large and handsome South Carolinian 
talked rapidly.  “What is it?” asked I after he had 
gone.  “Oh, what a year can bring forth—one year!  Last 
summer you remember how he swore he was in love with 
me? He told you, he told me, he told everybody, and if I 
did refuse to marry him I believed him.  Now he says he 
has seen, fallen in love with, courted, and married another 
person, and he raves of his little daughter's beauty.  And 
they say time goes slowly” thus spoke Mary Hammy, 
with a sigh of wonder at his wonderful cure.</p>
        <p>“Time works wonders,” said the explainer-general.
“What conclusion did you come to as to Southern men at 
the grand pow-wow, you know?”  “They are nicer than 
the nicest—the gentlemen, you know.  There are not too 
many of that kind anywhere.  Ours are generous, truthful, 
brave, and—and—devoted to us, you know.  A Southern 
husband is not a bad thing to have about the house.”</p>
        <p>Mrs. Frank Hampton said: “For one thing, you could
not flirt with these South Carolinians.  They would not
stay at the tepid degree of flirtation.  They grow so horridly 
in earnest before you know where you are.”   “Do
you think two married people ever lived together without 
finding each other out?  I mean, knowing exactly how 
good or how shabby, how weak or how strong, above all,
how selfish each was?”  “Yes; unless they are dolts, they 
know to a tittle; but you see if they have common sense 
they make believe and get on, so so.”  Like the Marchioness's 
orange-peel wine in Old Curiosity Shop.</p>

        <p>A violent attack upon the North to-day in the Albion.  
They mean to let freedom slide a while until they subjugate 
us. The Albion says they use <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">lettres de cachet</hi></foreign>, passports, 
and all the despotic apparatus of regal governments.  Russell 
hears the tramp of the coming man—the king and 
kaiser tyrant that is to rule them.  Is it McClellan?—
“Little Mac”?  We may tremble when he comes.  We 
down here have only  “the many-headed monster thing,” 
armed democracy.  Our chiefs quarrel among themselves.</p>
        <p>McClellan is of a forgiving spirit.  He does not resent 
Russell's slurs upon Yankees, but with good policy has Russell 
with him as a guest.</p>
        <p>The Adonis of an aide avers, as one who knows, that 
 “Sumter” Anderson's heart is with us; that he will not 
fight the South.  After all is said and done that sounds like 
nonsense.  “Sumter” Anderson's wife was a daughter of 
Governor Clinch, of Georgia.  Does that explain it?  He 
also told me something of Garnett (who was killed at Rich 
Mountain).<ref targOrder="U" id="ref60" n="60" rend="sc" target="note60">1</ref>   He had been an unlucky man clear through. 
In the army before the war, the aide had found him proud, 
reserved, and morose, cold as an icicle to all.  But for his 
wife and child he was a different creature.  He adored 
them and cared for nothing else.</p>
        <p>One day he went off on an expedition and was gone six 
weeks.  He was out in the Northwest, and the Indians were 
troublesome.  When he came back, his wife and child were 
underground.  He said not one word, but they found him 
more frozen, stern, and isolated than ever; that was all.  
The night before he left Richmond he said in his quiet way: 
“They have not given me an adequate force.  I can do 
nothing.  They have sent me to my death.”  It is acknowledged
<note id="note60" n="60" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref60">1. The battle of Rich Mountain, in Western Virginia, was fought July 
11, 1861, and General Garnett, Commander of the Confederate forces, 
pursued by General McClellan, was killed at Carrick's Ford, July 13th, 
while trying to rally his rear-guard.</note>
<pb id="mches120" n="120"/>
that he threw away his life—  “a dreary-hearted
man,” said the aide, “and the unluckiest.”</p>

        <p>On the front steps every evening we take our seats and 
discourse at our pleasure.  A nicer or more agreeable set of 
people were never assembled than our present Arlington 
crowd.  To-night it was Yancey<ref targOrder="U" id="ref61" n="61" rend="sc" target="note61">1</ref>  who occupied our tongues. 
 Send a man to England who had killed his father-in-law 
in a street brawl!  That was not knowing England or 
Englishmen, surely.  Who wants eloquence?  We want 
somebody who can hold his tongue. People avoid great 
talkers, men who orate, men given to monologue, as they 
would avoid fire, famine, or pestilence.  Yancey will have 
no mobs to harangue.  No stump speeches will be possible, 
superb as are his of their kind, but little quiet conversation 
is best with slow, solid, common-sense people, who begin to 
suspect as soon as any flourish of trumpets meets their ear.  
If Yancey should use his fine words, who would care for 
them over there?</p>
        <p>Commodore Barron, when he was a middy, accompanied 
Phil Augustus Stockton to claim his bride.  He, the said 
Stockton, had secretly wedded a fair heiress (Sally Cantey).  
She was married by a magistrate and returned to Mrs. 
Grillaud's boarding-school until it was time to go home 
—that is, to Camden.</p>
        <p>Lieutenant Stockton (a descendant of the Signer) was 
the handsomest man in the navy, and irresistible.  The 
bride was barely sixteen.  When he was to go down South 
among those fire-eaters and claim her, Commodore Barron, 
then his intimate friend, went as his backer.  They were to 
announce the marriage and defy the guardians.  Commodore
<note id="note61" n="61" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref61">1.  William Lowndes Yancey was a native of Virginia, who settled in
Alabama, and in 1844 was elected to Congress, where he became a leader
among the supporters of slavery and an advocate of secession.  He was 
famous in his day as an effective public speaker.</note>
<pb id="mches121" n="121"/>
Barron said he anticipated a rough job of it all, but 
they were prepared for all risks.  “You expected to find 
us a horde of savages, no doubt,” said I.  “We did not 
expect to get off under a half-dozen duels.”  They looked 
for insults from every quarter and they found a polished 
and refined people who lived <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">en prince</hi></foreign>, to say the least of it.  
They were received with a cold, stately, and faultless 
politeness, which made them feel as if they had been 
sheep-stealing.</p>
        <p>The young lady had confessed to her guardians and 
they were for making the best of it; above all, for saving 
her name from all gossip or publicity.  Colonel John Boykin, 
one of them, took Young Lochinvar to stay with him.  
His friend, Barron, was also a guest.  Colonel Deas sent for 
a parson, and made assurance doubly sure by marrying 
them over again.  Their wish was to keep things quiet and 
not to make a nine-days' wonder of the young lady.</p>
        <p>Then came balls, parties, and festivities without end.  
He was enchanted with the easy-going life of these people, 
with dinners the finest in the world, deer-hunting, and 
fox-hunting, dancing, and pretty girls, in fact everything that 
heart could wish.  But then, said Commodore Barron, “the 
better it was, and the kinder the treatment, the more 
ashamed I grew of my business down there.  After all, it
was stealing an heiress, you know.”</p>
        <p>I told him how the same fate still haunted that estate in 
Camden.  Mr.  Stockton sold it to a gentleman, who later sold 
it to an old man who had married when near eighty, and 
who left it to the daughter born of that marriage.  This 
pretty child of his old age was left an orphan quite young.  
At the age of fifteen, she ran away and married a boy of 
seventeen, a canny Scotchman.  The young couple lived to 
grow up, and it proved after all a happy marriage.  This 
last heiress left six children; so the estate will now be 
divided, and no longer tempt the fortune-hunters.</p>
        <p>The Commodore said: “To think how we two youngsters
<pb id="mches122" n="122"/>
in our blue uniforms went down there to bully those 
people.” He was much at Colonel Chesnut's.  Mrs. Chesnut 
being a Philadelphian, he was somewhat at ease with 
them.  It was the most thoroughly appointed establishment 
he had then ever visited.</p>
        <p>. . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . </p>
        <p>Went with our leviathan of loveliness to a ladies' meeting.  
No scandal to-day, no wrangling, all harmonious, 
everybody knitting.  Dare say that soothing occupation 
helped our perturbed spirits to be calm.  Mrs. C—— is 
lovely, a perfect beauty.  Said Brewster: “In Circassia, 
think what a price would be set upon her, for there beauty 
sells by the pound!”</p>
        <p>Coming home the following conversation: “So Mrs. 
Blank thinks purgatory will hold its own—never be abolished 
while women and children have to live with drunken 
fathers and brothers.”  “She knows.”  “She is too bitter.  
She says worse than that.  She says we have an institution 
worse than the Spanish Inquisition, worse than Torquemada, 
and all that sort of thing.”   “What does she 
mean?”  “You ask her.  Her words are sharp arrows.  I 
am a dull creature, and I should spoil all by repeating what
she says.”</p>
        <p>“It is your own family that she calls the familiars of 
the Inquisition.  She declares that they set upon you, fall 
foul of you, watch and harass you from morn till dewy 
eve.  They have a perfect right to your life, night and day, 
unto the fourth and fifth generation.  They drop in at 
breakfast and say,  ‘Are you not imprudent to eat that?’
‘Take care now, don't overdo it.’   ‘I think you eat too 
much so early in the day.’  And they help themselves to the 
only thing you care for on the table.  They abuse your 
friends and tell you it is your duty to praise your enemies. 
They tell you of all your faults candidly, because they love 
you so; that gives them a right to speak.  What family 
<pb id="mches123" n="123"/>
interest they take in you.  You ought to do this; you ought 
to do that, and then the everlasting  ‘you ought to have 
done,’ which comes near making you a murderer,  at least 
in heart.  ‘Blood's thicker than water,’ they say, and 
there is where the longing to spill it comes in.  No locks
or bolts or bars can keep them out.  Are they not your 
nearest family?  They dine with you, dropping in after 
you are at soup.  They come after you have gone to bed, 
when all the servants have gone away, and the man of the 
house, in his nightshirt, standing sternly at the door with 
the huge wooden bar in his hand, nearly scares them to
death, and you are glad of it.”</p>
        <p>“Private life, indeed!” She says her husband entered 
public life and they went off to live in a far-away city.  
Then for the first time in her life she knew privacy.  She 
never will forget how she jumped for joy as she told her 
servant not to admit a soul until after two o'clock in the
day.  Afterward, she took a fixed day at home.  Then she 
was free indeed.  She could read and write, stay at home, 
go out at her own sweet will, no longer sitting for hours 
with her fingers between the leaves of a frantically 
interesting book, while her kin slowly driveled nonsense by the 
yard—waiting, waiting, yawning.  Would they never go?  
Then for hurting you, who is like a relative?  They do it 
from a sense of duty.  For stinging you, for cutting you 
to the quick, who like one of your own household?  In point 
of fact, they alone can do it.  They know the sore, and how 
to hit it every time.  You are in their power.  She says, did 
you ever see a really respectable, responsible, revered and 
beloved head of a family who ever opened his mouth at 
home except to find fault?  He really thinks that is his 
business in life and that all enjoyment is sinful.  He is 
there to prevent the women from such frivolous things as 
pleasure, etc., etc.</p>
        <p>I sat placidly rocking in my chair by the window, trying 
to hope all was for the best.  Mary Hammy rushed in
<pb id="mches124" n="124"/>
literally drowned in tears.  I never saw so drenched a face 
in my life.  My heart stopped still.  “Commodore Barron 
is taken prisoner,” said she.  “The Yankees have captured 
him and all his lieutenants.  Poor Imogen—and 
there is my father scouting about, the Lord knows where.  
I only know he is in the advance guard.  The Barron's 
time has come.  Mine may come any minute.  Oh, Cousin 
Mary, when Mrs. Lee told Imogen, she fainted!   Those
poor girls; they are nearly dead with trouble and fright.”</p>
        <p>“Go straight back to those children,” I said.  “Nobody 
will touch a hair of their father's head.  Tell them I 
say so.  They dare not.  They are not savages quite.  This
is a civilized war, you know.”</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lee said to Mrs. Eustis (Mr.  Corcoran's daughter)
yesterday: “Have you seen those accounts of arrests in 
Washington?”  Mrs. Eustis answered calmly: “Yes, I 
know all about it.  I suppose you allude to the fact that my 
father has been imprisoned.”    “No, no,” interrupted the 
explainer,  “she means the incarceration of those mature 
Washington belles suspected as spies.”  But Mrs. Eustis 
continued, “I have no fears for my father's safety.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 31st</hi>.—Congress adjourns to-day.  Jeff Davis 
ill.  We go home on Monday if I am able to travel.  Already 
I feel the dread stillness and torpor of our Sahara 
of a Sand Hill creeping into my veins.  It chills the marrow 
of my bones.  I am reveling in the noise of city life.  I 
know what is before me.  Nothing more cheering than the 
cry of the lone whippoorwill will break the silence at Sandy 
Hill, except as night draws near, when the screech-owl will 
add his mournful note.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">September 1st</hi>.—North Carolina writes for arms for her
 soldiers.  Have we any to send?  No.  Brewster, the plainspoken, 
says, “The President is ill, and our affairs are in 
the hands of noodles.  All the generals away with the 
army; nobody here; General Lee in Western Virginia.  
Reading the third Psalm.  The devil is sick, the devil a 
<pb id="mches125" n="125"/>
saint would be.  Lord, how are they increased that trouble 
me?  Many are they that rise up against me!”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">September 2d</hi>.—Mr. Miles says he is not going anywhere 
at all, not even home.  He is to sit here permanently—chairman 
of a committee to overhaul camps, commissariats, etc., 
etc.</p>
        <p>We exchanged our ideas of Mr. Mason, in which we 
agreed perfectly.  In the first place, he has a noble 
presence—really a handsome man; is a manly old Virginian, 
straightforward, brave, truthful, clever, the very beau-ideal 
of an independent, high-spirited F. F. V.   If the English
value a genuine man they will have one here.  In every 
particular he is the exact opposite of Talleyrand.  He has 
some peculiarities.  He had never an ache or a pain himself; 
his physique is perfect, and he loudly declares that he 
hates to see persons ill; seems to him an unpardonable 
weakness.</p>
        <p>It began to grow late.  Many people had come to say 
good-by to me.  I had fever as usual to-day, but in the 
excitement of this crowd of friends the invalid forgot fever. 
Mr.  Chesnut held up his watch to me warningly and 
intimated  “it was late, indeed, for one who has to travel 
tomorrow.”  So, as the Yankees say after every defeat, I 
“retired in good order.”</p>
        <p>Not quite, for I forgot handkerchief and fan.  Gonzales 
rushed after and met me at the foot of the stairs.  In 
his foreign, pathetic, polite, high-bred way, he bowed low 
and said he had made an excuse for the fan, for he had a 
present to make me, and then, though  “startled and
amazed, I paused and on the stranger gazed.” Alas!  I am 
a woman approaching forty, and the offering proved to be 
a bottle of cherry bounce.  Nothing could have been more 
opportune, and with a little ice, etc., will help, I am sure, 
to save my life on that dreadful journey home.</p>
        <p>No discouragement now felt at the North.  They take 
our forts and are satisfied for a while.  Then the English 
<pb id="mches126" n="126"/>
are strictly neutral.  Like the woman who saw her husband 
fight the bear,  “It was the first fight she ever saw when she 
did not care who whipped.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis was very kind about it all.  He told Mr. Chesnut 
to go home and have an eye to all the State defenses, 
etc., and that he would give him any position he asked for 
if he still wished to continue in the army.  Now, this would 
be all that heart could wish, but Mr. Chesnut will never ask 
for anything.  What will he ask for?  That's the rub.  I 
am certain of very few things in life now, but this is one 
I am certain of : Mr. Chesnut will never ask mortal man 
for any promotion for himself or for one of his own family.</p>

        <p>CAMDEN, S. C., <hi rend="italics">September 9,1861</hi>.—Home again at 
Mulberry, the fever in full possession of me.  My 
sister, Kate, is my ideal woman, the most agreeable 
person I know in the world, with her soft, low, and sweet 
voice, her graceful, gracious ways, and her glorious gray 
eyes, that I looked into so often as we confided our very 
souls to each other.</p>
        <p>God bless old Betsey's yellow face!  She is a nurse in a 
thousand, and would do anything for “Mars Jeems' wife.” 
My small ailments in all this comfort set me mourning over 
the dead and dying soldiers I saw in Virginia.  How feeble 
my compassion proves, after all.</p>
        <p>I handed the old Colonel a letter from his son in the 
army.  He said, as he folded up the missive from the seat 
of war, “With this war we may die out.  Your husband is 
the last—of my family.”  He means that my husband is 
his only living son; his grandsons are in the army, and 
they, too, may be killed—even Johnny, the gallant and gay, 
may not be bullet-proof.  No child have I.</p>
        <p>Now this old man of ninety years was born when it was 
not the fashion for a gentleman to be a saint, and being 
lord of all he surveyed for so many years, irresponsible, in 
the center of his huge domain, it is wonderful he was not a 
greater tyrant—the softening influence of that angel wife,
no doubt.  Saint or sinner, he understands the world about 
him—<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">au fond.</hi></foreign></p>
        <pb id="mches128" n="128"/>
        <p>Have had a violent attack of something wrong about my 
heart.  It stopped beating, then it took to trembling, creaking 
and thumping like a Mississippi high-pressure steamboat, 
and the noise in my ears was more like an ammunition 
wagon rattling over the stones in Richmond.  That was 
yesterday, and yet I am alive.  That kind of thing makes 
one feel very mortal.</p>
        <p>Russell writes how disappointed Prince Jerome Napoleon 
was with the appearance of our troops, and  “he did 
not like Beauregard at all.”  Well!  I give Bogar up to him. 
But how a man can find fault with our soldiers, as I have 
seen them individually and collectively in Charleston, 
Richmond, and everywhere—that beats me.</p>
        <p>The British are the most conceited nation in the world, 
the most self-sufficient, self-satisfied, and arrogant.  But 
each individual man does not blow his own penny whistle; 
they brag wholesale.  Wellington—he certainly left it for 
others to sound his praises—though Mr. Binney thought the 
statue of Napoleon at the entrance of Apsley House was a 
little like “ ‘Who killed Cock Robin?’  ‘I, said the sparrow,  with my bow and arrow.’ ”  But then it is 
so pleasant  to hear them when it is a lump sum of praise, with no 
private crowing—praise of Trafalgar, Waterloo, the Scots 
Greys.</p>
        <p>Fighting this and fighting that, with their crack corps 
stirs the blood and every heart responds—three times three!  
Hurrah!</p>
        <p>But our people feel that they must send forth their own 
reported prowess: with an, “I did this and I did that.”  I 
know they did it; but I hang my head.</p>
        <p>In those Tarleton Memoirs, in Lee's Memoirs, in Moultrie's, 
and in Lord Rawdon's letters, self is never brought 
to the front.  I have been reading them over and admire 
their modesty and good taste as much as their courage and 
cleverness.  That kind of British eloquence takes me.  It 
is not, “<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">Soldats!  marchons, gloire!</hi></foreign>”  Not a bit of it; but,

        <p>Our name has not gone out of print.  To-day, the
Examiner, as usual, pitches into the President.  It thinks 
Toombs, Cobb, Slidell, Lamar, or Chesnut would have been 
far better in the office.  There is considerable choice in that 
lot.  Five men more utterly dissimilar were never named 
in the same paragraph.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">September 19th</hi>.—A painful piece of news came to us 
yesterday—our cousin, Mrs. Witherspoon, of Society Hill, 
was found dead in her bed.  She was quite well the night 
before.  Killed, people say, by family sorrows.  She was a 
proud and high-strung woman.  Nothing shabby in word, 
thought, or deed ever came nigh her.  She was of a warm 
and tender heart, too; truth and uprightness itself.  Few 
persons have ever been more loved and looked up to.  She 
was a very handsome old lady, of fine presence, dignified 
and commanding.</p>
        <p>“Killed by family sorrows,” so they said when Mrs. 
John N. Williams died.  So Uncle John said yesterday of 
his brother, Burwell.   “Death deserts the army,” said that 
quaint old soul,  “and takes fancy shots of the most 
eccentric kind nearer home.”</p>
        <p>The high and disinterested conduct our enemies seem to 
expect of us is involuntary and unconscious praise.  They 
pay us the compliment to look for from us (and execrate 
us for the want of it) a degree of virtue they were never
able to practise themselves.  It is a crowning misdemeanor 
for us to hold still in slavery those Africans whom they 
brought here from Africa, or sold to us when they found it 
did not pay to own them themselves.  Gradually, they slid 
or sold them off down here; or freed them prospectively, 
giving themselves years in which to get rid of them in a 
remunerative way.  We want to spread them over other 
lands, too—West and South, or Northwest, where the 
climate would free them or kill them, or improve them out 
<pb id="mches130" n="130"/>
of the world, as our friends up North do the Indians.  If
they had been forced to keep the negroes in New England, 
I dare say the negroes might have shared the Indians' fate, 
for they are wise in their generation, these Yankee children 
of light.  Those pernicious Africans!  So have just spoken 
Mr. Chesnut and Uncle John, both <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">ci-devant</hi></foreign> Union men,
now utterly for State rights.</p>
        <p>It is queer how different the same man may appear 
viewed from different standpoints.  “What a perfect 
gentleman,” said one person of another;  “so fine-looking, 
high-bred, distinguished, easy, free, and above all graceful 
in his bearing; so high-toned!  He is always indignant at 
any symptom of wrong-doing.  He is charming—the man 
of all others I like to have strangers see—a noble representative 
of our country.”  “Yes, every word of that is true,” 
was the reply.  “He is all that.  And then the other side 
of the picture is true, too.  You can always find him.  You 
know <hi rend="italics">where</hi> to find him!  Wherever there is a looking-glass, 
a bottle, or a woman, there will he be also.”  “My
God! and you call yourself his friend.”  “Yes, I know 
him down to the ground.”</p>
        <p>This conversation I overheard from an upper window 
when looking down on the piazza below—a complicated 
character truly beyond La Bruyère—with what Mrs. Preston 
calls refinement spread thin until it is skin-deep only.</p>
        <p>An iron steamer has run the blockade at Savannah.  We

locked the door and sat still as a mouse.  Rap, rap, came 
at the door.  “I say, Chesnut, they are calling for you.” 
At last we heard Janney (hotel-keeper) loudly proclaiming 
from the piazza that “Colonel Chesnut was not here at all, 
at all. ”  After a while, when they had all gone from the 
street, and the very house itself had subsided into perfect 
quiet, the door again was roughly shaken.  “I say, Chesnut, 
old fellow, come out—I know you are there.  Nobody 
here now wants to hear you make a speech.  That crowd has 
all gone.  We want a little quiet talk with you.  I am just 
from Richmond.”  That was the open sesame, and to-day I

        <p>A lady wrote to Mrs. Bunch: “Dear Emma: When 
shall I call for you to go and see Madame de St. André?”
She was answered: “Dear Lou: I can not go with you to 
see  Madame de St. Andre, but will always retain the kindest 
feeling toward you on account of our past relations,” 
etc.  The astounded friend wrote to ask what all this meant.  
No answer came, and then she sent her husband to ask and 
demand an explanation.  He was answered thus: “My 
dear fellow, there can be no explanation possible.  Hereafter 
there will be no intercourse between my wife and 
yours; simply that, nothing more.”  So the men meet at 
the club as before, and there is no further trouble between 
them.  The lady upon whom the slur is cast says,  “and I

the Prestons.  John Cochran and some other prisoners had 
asked to walk over the grounds, visit the Hampton Gardens, 
and some friends in Columbia.  After the dreadful 
state of the public mind at the escape of one of the prisoners, 
General Preston was obliged to refuse his request.  Mrs. 
Preston and the rest of us wanted him to say  “Yes,” and 
so find out who in Columbia were his treacherous friends.  
Pretty bold people they must be, to receive Yankee invaders 
in the midst of the row over one enemy already turned 
loose amid us. </p>
        <p>General Preston said: “We are about to sacrifice life 
and fortune for a fickle multitude who will not stand up 
to us at last.”  The harsh comments made as to his lenient 
conduct to prisoners have embittered him.  I told him 
what I had heard Captain Trenholm say in his speech.  He 
said he would listen to no criticism except from a man with 
a musket on his shoulder, and who had beside enlisted for 
the war, had given up all, and had no choice but to succeed

Venable added bitterly, “Giving up our soldiers to the

The up-country men were Union men generally, and the 
low-country seceders.  The former growl; they never liked 
those aristocratic boroughs and parishes, they had 
themselves a good and prosperous country, a good constitution,
and were satisfied.  But they had to go—to leave all and 
fight for the others who brought on all the trouble, and who 
do not show too much disposition to fight for themselves.</p>

        <p>A letter in a morning paper accused Mr. Chesnut of 
staying too long in Charleston.  The editor was asked for 
the writer's name.  He gave it as Little Moses, the Governor's 
secretary.  When Little Moses was spoken to, in a 
great trepidation he said that Mrs. Pickens wrote it, and 
got him to publish it; so it was dropped, for Little Moses is 
such an arrant liar no one can believe him.  Besides, if that

to take her in to dinner—Tom Boykin, who is six  feet four, 
the same height as her father.  Tom was very handsome in 
his uniform, and Mary prepared for a nice time, but he 
looked as if he would so much rather she did not talk to 
him, and he set her such a good example, saying never 
a word.</p>
        <p>Old Colonel Chesnut came for us.  When the train 
stopped, Quashie, shiny black, was seen on his box, as 
glossy and perfect in his way as his blooded bays, but the 
old Colonel would stop and pick up the dirtiest little negro 
I ever saw who was crying by the roadside.  This ragged 
little black urchin was made to climb up and sit beside 
Quash.  It spoilt the symmetry of the turn-out, but it was 
a character touch, and the old gentleman knows no law but 
his own will.  He had a biscuit in his pocket which he gave 
this sniffling little negro, who proved to be his man Scip's
son. </p>
        <p>I was ill at Mulberry and never left my room.  Doctor 
Boykin came, more military than medical.  Colonel Chesnut 
brought him up, also Teams, who said he was down in 
the mouth.  Our men were not fighting as they should.
We had only pluck and luck and a dogged spirit of fighting,
to offset their weight in men and munitions of war, I
wish I could remember Team's  words; this is only his idea.
His language was quaint and striking—no grammar, but 
no end of sense and good feeling.  Old Colonel Chesnut, 
catching a word, began his litany, saying,  “Numbers will 
tell,”  “Napoleon, you know,” etc., etc.</p>
        <p>At Mulberry the war has been ever afar off, but threats 
to take the silver came very near indeed—silver that we had

        <p><hi rend="italics">March 11th</hi>.—A freshman came quite eager to be 
instructed in all the wiles of society.  He wanted to try his
hand at a flirtation, and requested minute instructions, as 
he knew nothing whatever: he was so very fresh.  “Dance 
with her,” he was told, “and talk with her; walk with her 
and flatter her; dance until she is warm and tired; then 
propose to walk in a cool, shady piazza.  It must be a 
somewhat dark piazza.  Begin your promenade slowly; warm 
up to your work; draw her arm closer and closer; then,
break her wing.”</p>
        <p>“Heavens, what is that—break her wing?”  “Why, 
you do not know even that?  Put your arm round her waist 
and kiss her.  After that, it is all plain sailing.  She comes 
down when you call like the coon to Captain Scott: ‘You
need not fire, Captain,’ etc.”</p>
        <p>The aspirant for fame as a flirt followed these lucid 
directions literally, but when he seized the poor girl and 
kissed her, she uplifted her voice in terror, and screamed 
as if the house was on fire.  So quick, sharp, and shrill
were her yells for help that the bold flirt sprang over the 
banister, upon which grew a strong climbing rose.  This he 
struggled through, and ran toward the college, taking a bee 
line.  He was so mangled by the thorns that he had to go 
home and have them picked out by his family.  The girl's 
brother challenged him.  There was no mortal combat, 
however, for the gay young fellow who had led the freshman's

colored ladies.  It is not a nice topic, but Mrs. Stowe revels 
in it.  How delightfully Pharisaic a feeling it must be to 
rise superior and fancy we are so degraded as to defend 
and like to live with such degraded creatures around us—
such men as Legree and his women.</p>
        <p>The best way to take negroes to your heart is to get as
far away from them as possible.  As far as I can see,
Southern women do all that missionaries could do to 
prevent and alleviate evils.  The social evil has not been 
suppressed in old England or in New England, in London or in
Boston.  People in those places expect more virtue from a 
plantation African than they can insure in practise among 
themselves with all their own high moral surroundings—
light, education, training, and support.  Lady Mary Montagu 
says, “Only men and women at last.”  “Male and
female, created he them,” says the Bible.  There are cruel, 
graceful, beautiful mothers of angelic Evas North as well 
as South, I dare say.  The Northern men and women who 
came here were always hardest, for they expected an African 
to work and behave as a white man.  We do not.</p>
        <p>I have often thought from observation truly that perfect 
beauty hardens the heart, and as to grace, what so
graceful as a cat, a tigress, or a panther.  Much love, 
admiration, worship hardens an idol's heart.  It becomes 
utterly callous and selfish.  It expects to receive all and to 
give nothing.  It even likes the excitement of seeing people 
suffer.  I speak now of what I have watched with horror 
and amazement.</p>

imagination.  People can't love things dirty, ugly, and 
repulsive, simply because they ought to do so, but they can be
good to them at a distance; that's easy.  You see, I can not

seraglio, and all.  But she rolls up the whites of her eyes

every moment through Christian civilization.  They do not 
grudge the Turk even his bag and Bosphorus privileges.  
To a recalcitrant wife it is, “Here yawns the sack ; there

girls here to dine.  At my door met J. F., who wanted 
me then and there to promise to help him with his 
commission or put him in the way of one.  At the carriage steps I 
was handed in by Gus Smith, who wants his brother made 
commissary.  The beauty of it all is they think I have some 
influence, and I have not a particle.  The subject of Mr. 
Chesnut's military affairs, promotions, etc., is never
mentioned by me.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 15th</hi>.—When we came home from Richmond, 
there stood Warren Nelson, propped up against my door, 
lazily waiting for me, the handsome creature.  He said he 
meant to be heard, so I walked back with him to the drawing-room.
<pb id="mches144" n="144"/>
They are wasting their time dancing attendance 
on me.  I can not help them.  Let them shoulder their
musket and go to the wars like men.</p>
        <p>After tea came  “Mars Kit”—he said for a talk, but 
that Mr. Preston would not let him have, for Mr. Preston 
had arrived some time before him.  Mr. Preston said 
“Mars Kit”  thought it  “bad form” to laugh.  After that
you may be sure a laugh from “Mars Kit” was secured.  
Again and again, he was forced to laugh with a will.  I 
reversed Oliver Wendell Holmes's good resolution—never
to be as funny as he could.  I did my very utmost.</p>
        <p>Mr. Venable interrupted the fun, which was fast and 
furious, with the very best of bad news!  Newbern shelled
and burned , cotton, turpentine—everything—There were
5,000 North Carolinians in the fray, 12,000 Yankees.  Now 
there stands Goldsboro.  One more step and we are cut in 
two.  The railroad is our backbone, like the Blue Ridge and 
the Alleghanies, with which it runs parallel.  So many discomforts, 
no wonder we are down-hearted.</p>
        <p>Mr. Venable thinks as we do—Garnett is our most thorough 
scholar; Lamar the most original, and the cleverest of 
our men—L. Q. C. Lamar—time fails me to write all his 
name.  Then, there is R. M. T. Hunter.  Muscoe Russell 
Garnett and his Northern wife: that match was made at my 
house in Washington when Garnett was a member of the 
United States Congress.</p>
        <p>March 17th.—Back to the Congaree House to await my 
husband, who has made a rapid visit to the Wateree region. 
As we drove up Mr. Chesnut said: “Did you see the stare 
of respectful admiration E. R. bestowed upon you, so 
curiously prolonged?  I could hardly keep my countenance.” 
“Yes, my dear child, I feel the honor of it, though my 
individual self goes for nothing in it.  I am the wife of the 
man who has the appointing power just now, with so many 
commissions to be filled.  I am nearly forty, and they do my 
understanding the credit to suppose I can be made to 
<pb id="mches145" n="145"/>
believe they admire my mature charms.  They think they fool 
me into thinking that they believe me charming.  There is 
hardly any farce in the world more laughable.”</p>
        <p>Last night a house was set on fire; last week two houses.  
“The red cock crows in the barn!”  Our troubles thicken, 
indeed, when treachery comes from that dark quarter.</p>
        <p>When the President first offered Johnston Pettigrew a 
brigadier-generalship, his answer was: “Not yet.  Too 
many men are ahead of me who have earned their 
promotion in the field.  I will come after them, not before.  So 
far I have done nothing to merit reward,” etc.  He would
not take rank when he could get it.  I fancy he may cool his 
heels now waiting for it.  He was too high and mighty.  
There was another conscientious man—Burnet, of Kentucky.  
He gave up his regiment to his lieutenant-colonel 
when he found the lieutenant-colonel could command the 
regiment and Burnet could not maneuver it in the field.  He 
went into the fight simply as an aide to Floyd.  Modest 
merit just now is at a premium.</p>
        <p>William Gilmore Simms is here; read us his last poetry; 
have forgotten already what it was about.  It was not tiresome, 
however, and that is a great thing when people will 
persist in reading their own rhymes.</p>
        <p>I did not hear what Mr. Preston was saying.  “The 
last piece of Richmond news,” Mr. Chesnut said as he went 
away, and he looked so fagged out I asked no questions.  I
knew it was bad.</p>
        <p>At daylight there was a loud knocking at my door.  I 
hurried on a dressing-gown and flew to open the door.  
“Mrs. Chesnut, Mrs. M. says please don't forget her son.  
Mr. Chesnut, she hears, has come back.  Please get her son a 
commission.  He must have an office.”  I shut the door in 
the servant's face.  If I had the influence these foolish 
people attribute to me why should I not help my own?  I 
have a brother, two brothers-in-law, and no end of kin, all 
gentlemen privates, and privates they would stay to the 
<pb id="mches146" n="146"/>
end of time before they said a word to me about commissions.  
After a long talk we were finally disgusted and the 
men went off to the bulletin-board.  Whatever else it shows, 
good or bad, there is always woe for some house in the killed 
and wounded.  We have need of stout hearts.  I feel a 
sinking of mine as we drive near the board.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 18th</hi>.—My war archon is beset for commissions, 
and somebody says for every one given, you make one 
ingrate and a thousand enemies.</p>
        <p>As I entered Miss Mary Stark's I whispered: “He 
has promised to vote for Louis.”  What radiant faces.  To 
my friend, Miss Mary said, “Your son-in-law, what is he 
doing for his country?” “He is a tax collector.”  Then 
spoke up the stout old girl: “Look at my cheek; it is red 
with blushing for you.  A great, hale, hearty young man!  
Fie on him! fie on him! for shame!  Tell his wife; run him 
out of the house with a broomstick; send him down to the 
coast at least.”  Fancy my cheeks.  I could not raise my 
eyes to the poor lady, so mercilessly assaulted.  My face 
was as hot with compassion as the outspoken Miss Mary 
pretended hers to be with vicarious mortification.</p>
        <p>Went to see sweet and saintly Mrs. Bartow.  She read 
us a letter from Mississippi—not so bad: “More men 
there than the enemy suspected, and torpedoes to blow up 
the wretches when they came.”   Next to see Mrs. Izard.  
She had with her a relative just from the North.  This lady 
had asked Seward for passports, and he told her to “hold 
on a while; the road to South Carolina will soon be open to 
all, open and safe.”  To-day Mrs. Arthur Hayne heard 
from her daughter that Richmond is to be given up.  Mrs. 
Buell is her daughter.</p>
        <p>Met Mr.  Chesnut, who said: “New Madrid<ref targOrder="U" id="ref74" n="74" rend="sc" target="note74">1</ref> has been 
given up.  I do not know any more than the dead where 
New Madrid is.  It is bad, all the same, this giving up.  I
<note id="note74" n="74" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref74">1. New Madrid, Missouri, had been under siege since March 3, 1862.</note>
<pb id="mches147" n="147"/>
can't stand it.  The hemming-in process is nearly complete.  
The ring of fire is almost unbroken.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Chesnut's negroes offered to fight for him if he 
would arm them.  He pretended to believe them.  He says 
one man can not do it.  The whole country must agree to it.  
He would trust such as he would select, and he would give 
so many acres of land and his freedom to each one as he 
enlisted.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Albert Rhett came for an office for her son John.  
I told her Mr. Chesnut would never propose a kinsman for 
office, but if any one else would bring him forward he would 
vote for him certainly, as he is so eminently fit for position.
Now he is a private.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 19th</hi>.—He who runs may read.  Conscription 
means that we are in a tight place.  This war was a volunteer 
business.  To-morrow conscription begins—the <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">dernier 
ressort</hi></foreign>.  The President has remodeled his Cabinet, leaving 
Bragg for North Carolina.  His War Minister is Randolph, 
of Virginia.  A Union man <hi rend="italics">par excellence</hi>, Watts, of Alabama, 
is Attorney-General.  And now, too late by one year, 
when all the mechanics are in the army, Mallory begins to 
telegraph Captain Ingraham to build ships at any expense.  
We are locked in and can not get  “the requisites for naval 
architecture,” says a magniloquent person.</p>
        <p>Henry Frost says all hands wink at cotton going out.  
Why not send it out and buy ships?   “Every now and then 
there is a holocaust of cotton burning,” says the magniloquent.  
Conscription has waked the Rip Van Winkles.  The 
streets of Columbia were never so crowded with men.  To 
fight and to be made to fight are different things.</p>
        <p>To my small wits, whenever people were persistent,
united, and rose in their might, no general, however great, 
succeeded in subjugating them.  Have we not swamps, forests, 
rivers, mountains—every natural barrier?  The  Carthaginians 
begged for peace because they were a luxurious 
people and could not endure the hardship of war, though 
<pb id="mches148" n="148"/>
the enemy suffered as sharply as they did!   “Factions 
among themselves” is the rock on which we split.  Now for 
the great soul who is to rise up and lead us.  Why tarry his 
footsteps?</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 20th</hi>.—The Merrimac is now called the Virginia.  
I think these changes of names so confusing and so senseless.  
Like the French  “Royal Bengal Tiger,”  “National 
Tiger,” etc.  <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">Rue</hi></foreign> this, and next day <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">Rue</hi></foreign> that, the very 
days and months a symbol, and nothing signified.</p>
        <p>I was lying on the sofa in my room, and two men slowly 
walking up and down the corridor talked aloud as if necessarily 
all rooms were unoccupied at this midday hour.  I 
asked Maum Mary who they were.   “Yeadon and 
Barnwell Rhett, Jr.”  They abused the Council roundly, and 
my husband's name arrested my attention.  Afterward, 
when Yeadon attacked Mr. Chesnut, Mr. Chesnut 
surprised him by knowing beforehand all he had to say.  
Naturally I had repeated the loud interchange of views I had 
overheard in the corridor.</p>
        <p>First, Nathan Davis called.  Then Gonzales, who 
presented a fine, soldierly appearance in his soldier clothes, 
and the likeness to Beauregard was greater than ever.  
Nathan, all the world knows, is by profession a handsome 
man.</p>
        <p>General Gonzales told us what in the bitterness of his 
soul he had written to Jeff Davis.  He regretted that he had 
not been his classmate; then he might have been as well 
treated as Northrop.  In any case he would not have been 
refused a brigadiership, citing General Trapier and Tom 
Drayton.  He had worked for it, had earned it; they had 
not.  To his surprise, Mr.  Davis answered him, and in a 
sharp note of four pages.  Mr. Davis demanded from whom 
he quoted, “not his classmate.”  General Gonzales responded, 
“from the public voice only.”  Now he will fight 
for us all the same, but go on demanding justice from Jeff 
Davis until he get his dues—at least, until one of them gets 
<pb id="mches148a" n="148a"/>
<figure id="ill7" entity="ches148"><p>A GROUP OF CONFEDERATE WOMEN.<lb/>MISS S. B. C. PRESTON. MISS ISABELLA D. MARTIN. MRS. JEFFERSON DAVIS. MRS. LOUISA S. MCCORD. MRS. FRANCIS W. PICKENS. MRS. DAVID R WILLIAMS.</p></figure>
<pb id="mches149" n="149"/>
his dues, for he means to go on hitting Jeff Davis over the
head whenever he has a chance.</p>
        <p>“I am afraid,” said I,  “you will find it a hard head 
to crack.”  He replied in his flowery Spanish way: “Jeff 
Davis will be the sun, radiating all light, heat, and patronage;
he will not be a moon reflecting public opinion, for he 
has the soul of a despot; he delights to spite public opinion.  
See, people abused him for making Crittenden brigadier.  
Straightway he made him major-general, and just after a 
blundering, besotted defeat, too.”  Also, he told the President 
in that letter:  “Napoleon made his generals after 
great deeds on their part, and not for having been educated 
at St. Cyr, or Brie, or the Polytechnique,” etc., etc.  Nathan 
Davis sat as still as a Sioux warrior, not an eyelash moved.  
And yet he said afterward that he was amused while the 
Spaniard railed at his great namesake.</p>
        <p>Gonzales said: “Mrs. Slidell would proudly say that she 
was a Creole.  They were such fools, they thought Creole 
meant—”  Here Nathan interrupted pleasantly: “At the 
St. Charles, in New Orleans, on the bill of fare were 
‘Creole eggs.’   When they were brought to a man who had 
ordered them, with perfect simplicity, he held them up, 
‘Why, they are only hens' eggs, after all.’   What in Heaven's 
name he expected them to be, who can say?”  smiled 
Nathan the elegant.</p>
        <p>One lady says (as I sit reading in the drawing-room
window while Maum Mary puts my room to rights):  “I
clothe my negroes well.  I could not bear to see them in
dirt and rags; it would be unpleasant to me.”  Another 
lady:  “Yes.  Well, so do I.   But not fine clothes, you 
know.  I feel—now—it was one of our sins as a nation, the 
way we indulged them in sinful finery.  We will be 
punished for it.”</p>
        <p>Last night, Mrs. Pickens met General Cooper.  Madam 
knew General Cooper only as our adjutant-general, and 
Mr. Mason's brother-in-law.  In her slow, graceful, impressive
<pb id="mches150" n="150"/>
way, her beautiful eyes eloquent with feeling, she inveighed 
against Mr. Davis's wickedness in always sending 
men born at the North to command at Charleston.  General 
Cooper is on his way to make a tour of inspection there now.  
The dear general settled his head on his cravat with the aid 
of his forefinger; he tugged rather more nervously with the 
something that is always wrong inside of his collar, and 
looked straight up through his spectacles.  Some one 
crossed the room, stood back of Mrs. Pickens, and 
murmured in her ear,  “General Cooper was born in New 
York.”  Sudden silence.</p>
        <p>Dined with General Cooper at the Prestons.  General 
Hampton and Blanton Duncan were there also; the latter 
a thoroughly free-and-easy Western man, handsome and 
clever; more audacious than either, perhaps.  He pointed 
to Buck—Sally Buchanan Campbell Preston.   “What's 
that girl laughing at?”  Poor child, how amazed she 
looked.  He bade them  “not despair; all the nice young men 
would not be killed in the war; there would be a few left.  
For himself, he could give them no hope Mrs. Duncan was 
uncommonly healthy.”   Mrs. Duncan is also lovely.  We 
have seen her.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 24th</hi>.—I was asked to the Tognos' tea, so refused 
a drive with Mary Preston.  As I sat at my solitary casemate, 
waiting for the time to come for the Tognos, saw 
Mrs. Preston's landau pass, and Mr. Venable making Mary 
laugh at some of his army stories, as only Mr. Venable can.  
Already I felt that I had paid too much for my whistle—
that is, the Togno tea.  The Gibbeses, Trenholms, Edmund 
Rhett, there.  Edmund Rhett has very fine eyes and makes 
fearful play with them.  He sits silent and motionless, with 
his hands on his knees, his head bent forward, and his eyes 
fixed upon you.  I could think of nothing like it but a setter 
and a covey of partridges.</p>
        <p>As to President Davis, he sank to profounder deeps of 
abuse of him than even Gonzales.  I quoted Yancey:  “A 
<pb id="mches151" n="151"/>
crew may not like their captain, but if they are mad enough 
to mutiny while a storm is raging, all hands are bound 
to go to the bottom.”  After that I contented myself with a 
mild shake of the head when I disagreed with him, and at 
last I began to shake so persistently it amounted to 
incipient palsy.   “Jeff Davis,” he said,  “is conceited, 
wrong-headed, wranglesome, obstinate—a traitor.”  “Now 
I have borne much in silence,” said I at last, “but that is 
pernicious nonsense.  Do not let us waste any more time 
listening to your quotations from the Mercury.”</p>
        <p>He very good-naturedly changed the subject, which was 
easy just then, for a delicious supper was on the table 
ready for us.  But Doctor Gibbes began anew the fighting.  
He helped me to some <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">pâté</hi></foreign>—“Not <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">foie gras</hi></foreign>,”  said 
Madame Togno, “<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">pâté perdreaux</hi></foreign>.”  Doctor Gibbes, 
however, gave it a flavor of his own.  “Eat it,” said he, “it 
is good for you; rich and wholesome; healthy as cod-liver 
oil.”</p>
        <p>A queer thing happened.  At the post-office a man saw a 
small boy open with a key the box of the Governor and the 
Council, take the contents of the box and run for his life.  
Of course, this man called to the urchin to stop.  The urchin 
did not heed, but seeing himself pursued, began tearing up 
the letters and papers.  He was caught and the fragments 
were picked up.  Finding himself a prisoner, he pointed 
out the negro who gave him the key.  The negro was 
arrested.</p>
        <p>Governor Pickens called to see me to-day.  We began 
with Fort Sumter.  For an hour did we hammer at that 
fortress.  We took it, gun by gun.  He was very pleasant 
and friendly in his manner.</p>
        <p>James Chesnut has been so nice this winter; so reasonable 
and considerate—that is, for a man.  The night I
came from Madame Togno's, instead of making a row about
the lateness of the hour, he said he was  “so wide awake and 
so hungry.”  I put on my dressing-gown and scrambled 
<pb id="mches152" n="152"/>
some eggs, etc., there on our own fire.  And with our feet on 
the fender and the small supper-table between us, we 
enjoyed the supper and glorious gossip.  Rather a pleasant 
state of things when one's own husband is in good humor 
and cleverer than all the men outside.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, the <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">entente cordiale</hi></foreign> still subsisting, 
Maum Mary beckoned me out mysteriously, but Mr.  
Chesnut said: “Speak out, old woman; nobody here but 
myself.”  “Mars Nathum Davis wants to speak to her,” said 
she.  So I hurried off to the drawing-room, Maum Mary 
flapping her down-at-the-heels shoes in my wake. “He's 
gwine bekase somebody done stole his boots.  How could he 
stay bedout boots?”  So Nathan said good-by.  Then we met 
General Gist, Maum Mary still hovering near, and I 
congratulated him on being promoted.  He is now a 
brigadier.  This he received with modest complaisance. “I 
knowed he was a general,” said Maum Mary as he passed 
on, “he told me as soon as he got in his room befo' his boy 
put down his trunks.”  </p>
        <p>As Nathan, the unlucky, said good-by, he informed me 
that a Mr.  Reed from Montgomery was in the drawingroom 
and wanted to see me.  Mr.  Reed had traveled with our 
foreign envoy, Yancey.  I was keen for news from abroad.  
Mr.  Reed settled that summarily.  “Mr.  Yancey says we 
need not have one jot of hope.  He could bowstring Mallory 
for not buying arms in time.  The very best citizens wanted 
to depose the State government and take things into their own 
hands, the powers that be being inefficient.  Western men are 
hurrying to the front, bestirring themselves.  In two more 
months we shall be ready.”  What could I do but laugh? I do 
hope the enemy will be considerate and charitable enough to 
wait for us.</p>
        <p>Mr.  Reed's calm faith in the power of Mr.  Yancey's 
eloquence was beautiful to see.  He asked for Mr.  Chesnut.  
I went back to our rooms, swelling with news like a pouter 
pigeon.  Mr.  Chesnut said: “Well! four hours—a call 
<pb id="mches153" n="153"/>
from Nathan Davis of four hours!”  Men are too absurd! 
So I bear the honors of my forty years gallantly.  I can  but 
laugh.  “Mr.  Nathan Davis went by the five-o'clock  train,” 
I said;  “it is now about six or seven, maybe eight.  I have 
had so many visitors.  Mr.  Reed, of Alabama, is asking for 
you out there.”  He went without a word, but I doubt if he 
went to see Mr.  Reed, my laughing had made him so angry.</p>
        <p>At last Lincoln threatens us with a proclamation 
abolishing  slavery<ref targOrder="U" id="ref75" n="75" rend="sc" target="note75">1</ref>—here in the free Southern Confederacy; 
and they say McClellan is deposed.  They want more fighting 
-I mean the government, whose skins are safe, they want 
more fighting, and trust to luck for the skill of the new 
generals.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 28th</hi>.— I did leave with regret Maum Mary.  She 
was such a good, well-informed old thing.  My Molly, 
though perfection otherwise, does not receive the 
confidential communications of new-made generals at the 
earliest moment.  She is of very limited military information.  
Maum Mary was the comfort of my life.  She saved me 
from all trouble as far as she could.  Seventy, if she is a day, 
she is spry and active as a cat, of a curiosity that knows no 
bounds, black and clean; also, she knows a joke at first 
sight, and she is honest.  I fancy the negroes are ashamed to 
rob people as careless as James Chesnut and myself.</p>
        <p>One night, just before we left the Congaree House, Mr.  
Chesnut had forgotten to tell some all-important thing to
<note id="note75" n="75" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref75">1. The Emancipation proclamation was not actually issued until 
September 22, 1862, when it was a notice to the Confederates to return 
to the Union, emancipation being proclaimed as a result of their failure 
to do so.  The real proclamation, freeing the slaves, was delayed until 
January 1,1863, when it was put forth as a war measure.  Mrs.  Chesnut's 
reference is doubtless to President Lincoln's Message to Congress, 
March 6, 1862, in which he made recommendations regarding the 
abolition of slavery.</note>
<pb id="mches154" n="154"/>
Governor Gist, who was to leave on a public mission next 
day.  So at the dawn of day he put on his dressing-gown and 
went to the Governor's room.  He found the door unlocked 
and the Governor fast asleep.  He shook him.  Half-asleep, 
the Governor sprang up and threw his arms around Mr.  
Chesnut's neck and said: “Honey, is it you?”  The mistake 
was rapidly set right, and the bewildered plenipotentiary was 
given his instructions.  Mr.  Chesnut came into my room, 
threw himself on the sofa, and nearly laughed himself to 
extinction, imitating again and again the pathetic tone of the 
Governor's greeting.</p>
        <p>Mr.  Chesnut calls Lawrence “Adolphe,” but says he is 
simply perfect as a servant.  Mary Stevens said: “I thought 
Cousin James the laziest man alive until I knew his man, 
Lawrence.”  Lawrence will not move an inch or lift a finger 
for any one but his master.  Mrs.  Middleton politely sent 
him on an errand; Lawrence too, was very polite; hours after, 
she saw him sitting on the fence of the front yard.  “Didn't 
you go?”  she asked.  “No, ma'am.  I am waiting for Mars 
Jeems.”  Mrs.  Middleton calls him now, “Mr.  
Take-it-Easy.”</p>
        <p>My very last day's experience at the Congaree.  I was 
waiting for Mars Jeems in the drawing-room when a lady 
there declared herself to be the wife of an officer in 
Clingman's regiment.  A gentleman who seemed quite 
friendly with her, told her all Mr.  Chesnut said, thought, 
intended to do, wrote, and <hi rend="italics">felt</hi>.  I asked: “Are you certain of 
all these things you say of Colonel Chesnut?”  The man 
hardly deigned to notice this impertinent interruption from a 
stranger presuming to speak but who had not been 
introduced!  After he went out, the wife of Clingman's 
officer was seized with an intuitive curiosity.  “Madam, will 
you tell me your name?”  I gave it, adding,  “I dare say I 
showed myself an intelligent listener when my husband's 
affairs were under discussion.”  At first, I refused to give my 
name because it would have embarrassed her friend if
<pb id="mches155" n="155"/>
she had told him who I was.  The man was Mr.  Chesnut's 
secretary, but I had never seen him before.</p>
        <p>A letter from Kate says she had been up all night 
preparing David's things.  Little Serena sat up and helped 
her mother.  They did not know that they would ever see him 
again.  Upon reading it, I wept and James Chesnut cursed 
the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Gave the girls a quantity of flannel for soldiers' shirts; 
also a string of pearls to be raffled for at the Gunboat Fair.  
Mary Witherspoon has sent a silver tea-pot.  We do not 
spare our precious things now.  Our silver and gold, what are 
they?-when we give up to war our beloved.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 2d</hi>.—Dr.  Trezevant, attending Mr.  Chesnut, who 
was ill, came and found his patient gone; he could not stand 
the news of that last battle.  He got up and dressed, weak as 
he was, and went forth to hear what he could for himself.  
The doctor was angry with me for permitting this, and more 
angry with him for such folly.  I made him listen to the 
distinction between feminine folly and virulent vagaries and 
nonsense.  He said: “He will certainly be salivated after all 
that calomel out in this damp weather.”</p>
        <p>To-day, the ladies in their landaus were bitterly attacked 
by the morning paper for lolling back in their silks and

they should be.  Why not?</p>

Mr.  Chesnut said  “four.”  Trescott was very surly; calls 
himself ex-Secretary of State of the United States; now, 
nothing in particular of South Carolina or the Confederate 
States.  Then he yawned, “What a bore this war is.  I wish it 
was ended, one way or another.” He speaks of going across 
the border and taking service in Mexico.  “Rubbish, not 
much Mexico for you,” I answered.  Another patriot came 
then and averred,  “I will take my family back to town, that 
we may all surrender together.  I gave it up early in the 
spring.” Trescott made a face behind backs, and said: “

        <p>The enemy have flanked Beauregard at Nashville.  There

see what we have lost.  We were pushing them into the river 
when General Johnston was wounded.  Beauregard was lying 
in his tent, at the rear, in a green sickness- melancholy—but 
no matter what the name of the malady.  He was too slow to 
move, and lost all the advantage gained by our dead hero.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref76" n="76" rend="sc" target="note76">1</ref>

        <p>Gladden, the hero of the Palmettos in Mexico, is killed.  
Shiloh has been a dreadful blow to us.  Last winter Stephen, 
my brother, had it in his power to do such a nice thing for 
Colonel Gladden.  In the dark he heard his name, also that he 
had to walk twenty-five miles in Alabama mud or go on

1862.  The Federals were commanded by General Grant who, on the

commanded by Albert Sidney Johnston on the first day, when Johnston 
was killed, and on the second day by General Beauregard.</note>

Carolinian to Colonel Gladden, whom he knew only by 
reputation as colonel of the Palmetto regiment in the 
Mexican war.  And they drove him in his carriage 
comfortably to where he wanted to go—a night drive of fifty 
miles for Stephen, for he had the return trip, too.  I would 
rather live in Siberia, worse still, in Sahara, than live in a 
country surrendered to Yankees.</p>
        <p>The Carolinian says the conscription bill passed by  Congress 
is fatal to our liberties as a people.  Let us be a people “certain

Preston's,  <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">pâté de foie gras</hi></foreign> and partridge prepared for me 
as I like them.  I had been awfully depressed for days and 
could not sleep at night for anxiety, but I did not know that I 
was bodily ill.  Mrs.  Preston came home with me.  She said 
emphatically: “Molly, if your mistress is worse in the night 
send for me instantly.”  I thought it very odd.  I could not 
breathe if I attempted to lie down, and very soon I lost my 
voice.  Molly raced out and sent Lawrence for Doctor 
Trezevant.  She said I had the croup.  The doctor said,   
“congestion of the lungs.” </p>
        <p>So here I am, stranded, laid by the heels.  Battle after
battle has occurred, disaster after disaster.  Every, morning's
paper is enough to kill a well woman and age a strong

        <p>To-day, the waters of this stagnant pool were wildly

from this Slough of Despond, this Council whose counsel no 
one takes.  I wrote to Mr.  Davis, “With thanks, and begging 
your pardon, how I would like to go.”  Mrs.  Preston agrees 
with me, Mr.  Chesnut ought to go.  Through Mr.  Chesnut 
the President might hear many things to the advantage of our 
State, etc.</p>
        <p>Letter from Quinton Washington.  That was the best 
tonic yet.  He writes so cheerfully.  We have fifty thousand 
men on the Peninsula and McClellan eighty thousand.  We 
expect that much disparity of numbers.  We can stand that.</p>

opens on Trinity Church.  Nanna Shand married a Doctor 
Wilson.  Then, a beautiful bevy of girls rushed into my 
room.  Such a flutter and a chatter.  Well, thank Heaven for 
a wedding.  It is a charming relief from the dismal litany of 
our daily song.</p>
        <p>A letter to-day from our octogenarian at Mulberry.  His 
nephew, Jack Deas, had two horses shot under him; the old 
Colonel has his growl, “That's enough for glory, and no hurt 
after all.”  He ends, however, with his never-failing refrain: 
We can't fight all the world; two and two only make four; it 
can't make a thousand; numbers will not lie.  He says he has 
lost half a million already in railroad bonds, bank stock, 
Western notes of hand, not to speak of negroes to be freed, 
and lands to be confiscated, for he takes the gloomiest views 
of all things.</p>

boldly past the forts and destroyed the Confederate fleet, comprising 13 
gunboats and two ironclads.  On April 27th he took formal possession of

Confederacy.  That Mississippi ruins us if lost.  The 
Confederacy has been done to death by the politicians.  
What wonder we are lost.</p>
        <p>The soldiers have done their duty.  All honor to the army.  
Statesmen as busy as bees about their own places, or their 
personal honor, too busy to see the enemy at a distance.  
With a microscope they were examining their own interests, 
or their own wrongs, forgetting the interests of the people 
they represented.  They were concocting newspaper 
paragraphs to injure the government.  No matter how vital it 
may be, nothing can be kept from the enemy.  They must 
publish themselves, night and day, what they are doing, or 
the omniscient Buncombe will forget them.</p>
        <p>This fall of New Orleans means utter ruin to the private 
fortunes of the Prestons.  Mr.  Preston came from New 
Orleans so satisfied with Mansfield Lovell and the 
tremendous steam-rams he saw there.  While in New 
Orleans Burnside offered Mr.  Preston five hundred 
thousand dollars, a debt due to him from Burnside, and he 
refused to take it.  He said the money was safer in 
Burnside's hands than his.  And so it may prove, so ugly is 
the outlook now.  Burnside is wide awake; he is not a man to 
be caught napping.</p>
        <p>Mary Preston was saying she had asked the Hamptons 
how they relished the idea of being paupers.  If the country 
is saved none of us will care for that sort of thing.  
Philosophical and patriotic, Mr. Chesnut came in, saying:   
“Conrad has been telegraphed from New Orleans that the 
great iron-clad Louisiana went down at the first shot.”  Mr.  
Chesnut and Mary Preston walked off, first to the 
bulletin-board and then to the Prestons'.</p>
        <pb id="mches160" n="160"/>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 29th</hi>.—A grand smash, the news from New Orleans 
fatal to us.  Met Mr.  Weston.  He wanted to know where he 
could find a place of safety for two hundred negroes.  I 
looked into his face to see if he were in earnest; then to see if 
he were sane.  There was a certain set of two hundred 
negroes that had grown to be a nuisance.  Apparently all the 
white men of the family had felt bound to stay at home to 
take care of them.  There are people who still believe 
negroes property—like Noah's neighbors, who insisted that 
the Deluge would only be a little shower after all.</p>
        <p>These negroes, however, were Plowden Weston's, a 
totally different part of speech.  He gave field-rifles to one 
company and forty thousand dollars to another.  He is away 
with our army at Corinth.  So I said: “You may rely upon 
Mr.  Chesnut, who will assist you to his uttermost in finding 
a home for these people.  Nothing belonging to that patriotic 
gentleman shall come to grief if we have to take charge of 
them on our own place.”  Mr.  Chesnut did get a place for 
them, as I said he would.</p>
        <p>Had to go to the Governor's or they would think we had 
hoisted the black flag.  Heard there we are going to be beaten 
as Cortez beat the Mexicans—by superior arms.  Mexican 
bows and arrows made a poor showing in the face of 
Spanish accoutrements.  Our enemies have such superior 
weapons of war, we hardly any but what we capture from 
them in the fray.  The Saxons and the Normans were in the 
same plight.</p>
        <p>War seems a game of chess, but we have an unequal 
number of pawns to begin with.  We have knights, kings, 
queens, bishops, and castles enough.  But our skilful 
generals, whenever they can not arrange the board to suit 
them exactly, burn up everything and march away.  We want 
them to save the country.  They seem to think their whole 
duty is to destroy ships and save the army.</p>
        <p>Mr.  Robert Barnwell wrote that he had to hang his

head for South Carolina.  We had not furnished our quota of 
the new levy, five thousand men.  To-day Colonel Chesnut 
published his statement to show that we have sent thirteen 
thousand, instead of the mere number required of us; so Mr.  
Barnwell can hold up his head again.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 30th</hi>.—The last day of this month of calamities.  
Lovell left the women and children to be shelled, and took 
the army to a safe place.  I do not understand why we do not 
send the women and children to the safe place and let the 
army stay where the fighting is to be.  Armies are to save, 
not to be saved.  At least, to be saved is not their <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">raison

        <p>At the Prestons', where I am staying (because Mr.  
Chesnut has gone to see his crabbed old father, whom he

He tells us Wigfall is out on a warpath; wants them to strike 
for Maryland.  The President's opinion of the move is not

        <p>Mary Preston said all sisters quarreled.  No, we never 
quarrel, I and mine.  We keep all our bitter words for our 
enemies.  We are frank heathens; we hate our enemies and 
love our friends.  Some people (our kind) can never make up 
after a quarrel; hard words once only and all is over.  To us 
forgiveness is impossible.  Forgiveness means calm 
indifference; philosophy, while love lasts.  Forgiveness of 
love's wrongs is impossible.  Those dutiful wives who 
piously overlook—well, everything—do not care one fig for 
their husbands.  I settled that in my own mind years ago.  
Some people think it magnanimous to praise their enemies 
and to show their impartiality and justice by acknowledging 
the faults of their friends.  I am for the simple rule, the good 
old plan.  I praise whom I love and abuse whom I hate.</p>
        <p>Mary Preston has been translating Schiller aloud.  We 
are provided with Bulwer's translation, Mrs.  Austin's, 
Coleridge's, and Carlyle's, and we show how each renders 
the passage Mary is to convert into English.  In Wallenstein 
at one point of the Max and Thekla scene, I like Carlyle 
better than Coleridge, though they say Coleridge's 
Wallenstein is the only translation in the world half so good 
as the original.  Mrs.  Barstow repeated some beautiful 
scraps by Uhland, which I had never heard before.  She is to 
write them for us.  Peace, and a literary leisure for my old

which is the right phrase for fighting, to preserve slavery.  
They hate it as we do.”  “What are they fighting for?”    
“Southern rights—whatever that is.  And they do not want to be 
understrappers forever to the Yankees.  They talk well enough 
about it, but I forget what they say.”  Johnny Chesnut says: 
“No use to give a reason- a fellow could not stay away from 
the fight—not well.”  It takes four negroes to wait on Johnny 
satisfactorily.</p>

        <p>It is this giving up that kills me.  Norfolk they talk of 
now; why not Charleston next? I read in a Western letter,   
“Not Beauregard, but the soldiers who stopped to drink the

Cock Robin is as dead as he ever will be now; what matters 
it who killed him?</p>

        <p>Isaac Hayne said at dinner yesterday that both 
Beauregard  and the President had a great opinion of Mr.  
Chesnut's natural ability for strategy and military evolution.  
Hon.  Mr.  Barnwell concurred; that is, Mr.  Barnwell had 
been told so by the President.    “Then why did not the 
President  offer me something better than an aideship?”  “I 
heard he offered to make you a general last year, and you 
said you could not go over other men's shoulders until you 
had earned promotion.  You are too hard to please.”  “No, 
not exactly that, I was only offered a colonelcy, and Mr.  
Barnwell persuaded me to stick to the Senate; then he

        <p>My Molly will forget Lige and her babies, too.  I asked

very different words.  It amounts to this: “Not one foot of

We have one hundred and five thousand men in all, 
McClellan one hundred and ninety thousand.  We can stand 
that disparity.”</p>
        <p>What things I have been said to have said! Mr.——-  
heard me make scoffing remarks about the Governor and the 
Council—or he thinks he heard me.  James Chesnut wrote 
him a note that my name was to be kept out of it—indeed, 
that he was never to mention my name again under any 
possible circumstances.  It was all preposterous nonsense, 
but it annoyed my husband amazingly.  He said it was a 
scheme to use my chatter to his injury.  He was very kind 
about it.  He knows my real style so well that he can always 
tell my real impudence from what is fabricated for me.</p>
        <p>There is said to be an order from Butler<ref targOrder="U" id="ref80" n="80" rend="sc" target="note80">1</ref>  turning over
<note id="note80" n="80" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref80">1.  General Benjamin F.  Butler took command of New Orleans on 
May 2, 1862.  The author's reference is to his famous “Order No.  28,” 
which reads: “As the officers and soldiers of the United States have 
been subject to repeated insults from the women (calling themselves 
ladies) of New Orleans, in return for the most scrupulous 
non-interference and courtesy on our part, it is ordered that hereafter 
when any female shall by word, gesture, or  movement insult or show 
contempt for any officer or soldier of the United States she shall be 
regarded and held liable to be treated as a woman of the town plying her 
vocation.”  This and other acts of Butler in New Orleans led Jefferson 
Davis to issue a proclamation, declaring Butler to be a felon and an 
outlaw, and if captured that he should be instantly hanged.  In December 
Butler was superseded at New Orleans by General Banks.</note>
<pb id="mches165" n="165"/>
the women of New Orleans to his soldiers.  Thus is the 
measure of his iniquities filled.  We thought that generals 
always restrained, by shot or sword if need be, the brutality 
of soldiers.  This hideous, cross-eyed beast orders his men to 
treat the ladies of New Orleans as women of the town—to 
punish them, he says, for their insolence.</p>
        <p>Footprints on the boundaries of another world once more.  
Willie Taylor, before he left home for the army, fancied one 
day—<hi rend="italics">day</hi>, remember—that he saw Albert Rhett standing by 
his side.  He recoiled from the ghostly presence.  “You need 
not do that, Willie.  You will soon be as I am.”  Willie 
rushed into the next room to tell them what had happened, 
and fainted.  It had a very depressing effect upon him.  And 
now the other day he died in Virginia.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">May 24th</hi>.—The enemy are landing at Georgetown.  With 
a little more audacity where could they not land? But we 
have given them such a scare, they are cautious.  If it be 
true, I hope some cool-headed white men will make the 
negroes save the rice for us.  It is so much needed.  They say 
it might have been done at Port Royal with a little more 
energy.  South Carolinians have pluck enough, but they only 
work by fits and starts; there is no continuous effort; they 
can't be counted on for steady work.  They will stop to 
play—or enjoy life in some shape.</p>
        <p>Without let or hindrance Halleck is being reenforced.

        <p>My Hebrew friend, Mem Cohen, has a son in the war.  
He is in John Chesnut's company.  Cohen is a high name 
among the Jews: it means Aaron.  She has long fits of 
silence, and is absent-minded.  If she is suddenly roused, she 
is apt to say, with overflowing eyes and clasped hands, “If it 
please God to spare his life.”  Her daughter is the sweetest 
little thing.  The son is the mother's idol.  Mrs.  Cohen was 
Miriam de Leon.  I have known her intimately all my life.</p>
        <p>Mrs.  Bartow, the widow of Colonel Bartow, who was 
killed at Manassas, was Miss Berrien, daughter of Judge 
Berrien, of Georgia.  She is now in one of the departments 
here, cutting bonds—Confederate bonds—for five hundred 
Confederate dollars a year, a penniless woman.  Judge 
Carroll, her brother-in-law, has been urgent with her to come 
and live in his home.  He has a large family and she will not 
be an added burden to him.  In spite of all he can say, she 
will not forego her resolution.  She will be independent.  She 
is a resolute little woman, with the softest, silkiest voice and 
ways, and clever to the last point.</p>
        <p>Columbia is the place for good living, pleasant people, 
pleasant dinners, pleasant drives.  I feel that I have put the 
dinners in the wrong place.  They are the climax of the good 
things here.  This is the most hospitable place in the world, 
and the dinners are worthy of it.</p>
        <p>In Washington, there was an endless succession of state 
dinners.  I was kindly used.  I do not remember ever being 
condemned to two dull neighbors: on one side or the other 
was a clever man; so I liked Washington dinners.</p>
        <p>In Montgomery, there were a few dinners—Mrs.  
Pollard's, for instance, but the society was not smoothed 
down or in shape.  Such as it was it was given over to balls 
and suppers. In Charleston, Mr. Chesnut went to gentlemen's 
dinners all the time; no ladies present.  Flowers were sent to 
me, and I was taken to drive and asked to tea.  There could 
not have been nicer suppers, more perfect of their 
<pb id="mches167" n="167"/>
kind than were to be found at the winding up of those 
festivities.</p>
        <p>In Richmond, there were balls, which I did not attend- 
very few to which I was asked: the MacFarlands' and 
Lyons's, all I can remember.  James Chesnut dined out 
nearly every day.  But then the breakfasts—the Virginia 
breakfasts—where were always pleasant people.  Indeed, I 
have had a good time everywhere—always clever people, and 
people I liked, and everybody so good to me.</p>
        <p>Here in Columbia, family dinners are the specialty.  You 
call, or they pick you up and drive home with you.  “Oh, 
stay to dinner!” and you stay gladly.  They send for your 
husband, and he comes willingly.  Then comes a perfect 
dinner.  You do not see how it could be improved; and yet 
they have not had time to alter things or add because of the 
unexpected guests.  They have everything of the best—silver, 
glass, china, table linen, and damask, etc.  And then the 
planters live “within themselves,” as they call it.  From the 
plantations come mutton, beef, poultry, cream, butter, eggs, 
fruits, and vegetables.</p>
        <p>It is easy to live here, with a cook who has been sent for 
training to the best eating-house in Charleston.  Old Mrs.  
Chesnut's Romeo was apprenticed at Jones's.  I do not know 
where Mrs.  Preston's got his degree, but he deserves a 
medal.</p>
        <p>At the Prestons', James Chesnut induced Buck to declaim 
something about Joan of Arc, which she does in a manner to 
touch all hearts.  While she was speaking, my husband 
turned to a young gentleman who was listening to the chatter 
of several girls, and said: “Écoutez!”  The youth stared at 
him a moment in bewilderment; then, gravely rose and began 
turning down the gas.  Isabella said: “Écoutez, then, means 
put out the lights.”</p>
        <p>I recall a scene which took place during a ball given by 
Mrs.  Preston while her husband was in Louisiana.  Mrs.  
Preston was resplendent in diamonds, point lace, and velvet.
<pb id="mches168" n="168"/>
There is a gentle dignity about her which is very 
attractive; her voice is low and sweet, and her will is iron.  
She is exceedingly well informed, but very quiet, retiring, 
and reserved.  Indeed, her apparent gentleness almost 
amounts to timidity.  She has chiseled regularity of features, 
a majestic figure, perfectly molded.</p>
        <p>Governor Manning said to me: “Look at Sister Caroline.  
Does she look as if she had the pluck of a heroine?”  Then he 
related how a little while ago William, the butler, came to 
tell her that John, the footman, was drunk in the cellar—mad 
with drink; that he had a carving-knife which he was 
brandishing in drunken fury, and he was keeping everybody 
from their business, threatening to kill any one who dared to 
go into the basement.  They were like a flock of frightened 
sheep down there.  She did not speak to one of us, but 
followed William down to the basement, holding up her 
skirts.  She found the servants scurrying everywhere, 
screaming and shouting that John was crazy and going to kill 
them.  John was bellowing like a bull of Bashan, knife in 
hand, chasing them at his pleasure.</p>
        <p>Mrs.  Preston walked up to him.  “Give me that knife,” 
she demanded.  He handed it to her.  She laid it on the table. 
“Now come with me,” she said, putting her hand on his 
collar.  She led him away to the empty smoke-house, and 
there she locked him in and put the key in her pocket.  Then 
she returned to her guests, without a ripple on her placid 
face.  “She told me of it, smiling and serene as you see her 
now,”  the Governor concluded.</p>
        <p>Before the war shut him in, General Preston sent to the 
lakes for his salmon, to Mississippi for his venison, to the 
mountains for his mutton and grouse.  It is good enough, the 
best dish at all these houses, what the Spanish call “the
hearty welcome.”  Thackeray says at every American table 
he was first served with “grilled hostess.”  At the head of the 
table sat a person, fiery-faced, anxious, nervous, 
<pb id="mches169" n="169"/>
inwardly murmuring, like Falstaff, “Would it were night, 
Hal, and all were well.”</p>
        <p>At Mulberry the house is always filled to overflowing, 
and one day is curiously like another.  People are coming and 
going, carriages driving up or driving off.  It has the air of a 
watering-place, where one does not pay, and where there are 
no strangers.  At Christmas the china closet gives up its 
treasures.  The glass, china, silver, fine linen reserved for 
grand occasions come forth.  As for the dinner itself, it is 
only a matter of greater quantity—more turkey, more mutton, 
more partridges, more fish, etc., and more solemn stiffness.  
Usually a half-dozen persons unexpectedly dropping in make 
no difference.  The family let the housekeeper know; that is 
all.</p>
        <p>People are beginning to come here from Richmond.  One 
swallow does not make a summer, but it shows how the wind 
blows, these straws do—Mrs. “Constitution” Browne and Mrs.  
Wise.  The Gibsons are at Doctor Gibbes's It does look 
squally.  We are drifting on the breakers.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">May 29th</hi>.—Betsey, recalcitrant maid of the W.'s, has 
been sold to a telegraph man.  She is as handsome as a 
mulatto ever gets to be, and clever in every kind of work.  
My Molly thinks her mistress “very lucky in getting rid of 
her.”  She was “a dangerous inmate,” but she will be a good 
cook, a good chambermaid, a good dairymaid, a beautiful 
clear-starcher, and the most thoroughly good-for-nothing 
woman I know to her new owners, if she chooses.  Molly 
evidently hates her, but thinks it her duty “to stand by her 
color.”</p>
        <p>Mrs.  Gibson is a Philadelphia woman.  She is true to her 
husband and children, but she does not believe in us- the 
Confederacy, I mean.  She is despondent and hopeless; as 
wanting in faith of our ultimate success as is Sally Baxter 
Hampton.  I make allowances for those people.  If I had 
married North, they would have a heavy handful in me just 
now up there.</p>
        <pb id="mches170" n="170"/>
        <p>Mrs.  Chesnut, my mother-in-law, has been sixty 
years in the South, and she has not changed in feeling or in 
taste one iota.  She can not like hominy for breakfast, or 
rice for dinner, without a relish to give it some flavor.  She 
can not eat watermelons and sweet potatoes <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">sans discrétion</hi></foreign>, 
as we do.  She will not eat hot corn bread <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">à discrétion</hi></foreign>, and 
hot buttered biscuit without any.</p>
        <p>“Richmond is obliged to fall,” sighed Mrs. Gibson.  
“You would say so, too, if you had seen our poor soldiers.” 
“Poor soldiers?” said I. “Are you talking of Stonewall 
Jackson's men? Poor soldiers, indeed!”   She said her mind 
was fixed on one point, and had ever been, though she 
married and came South: she never would own slaves.  
“Who would that was not born to it?” I cried, more excited 
than ever.  She is very handsome, very clever, and has very 
agreeable manners.</p>
        <p>“Dear madam,” she says, with tears in her beautiful eyes, 
“they have three armies.”   “But Stonewall has routed one of 
them already.  Heath another.”  She only answered by an 
unbelieving moan.  “Nothing seemed to suit her,” I said, as 
we went away.  “You did not certainly,” said some one to 
me; “you contradicted every word she said, with a sort of 
indignant protest.”</p>
        <p>We met Mrs.  Hampton Gibbes at the door—another 
Virginia woman as good as gold.  They told us Mrs.  Davis 
was delightfully situated at Raleigh; North Carolinians so 
loyal, so hospitable; she had not been allowed to eat a meal 
at the hotel.  “How different from Columbia,” said Doctor 
Gibbes, looking at Mrs.  Gibson, who has no doubt been left 
to take all of her meals at his house.  “Oh, no!”   cried Mary, 
“you do Columbia injustice.  Mrs.  Chesnut used to tell us 
that she was never once turned over to the tender mercies of 
the Congaree cuisine, and at McMahan's it is fruit, flowers, 
invitations to dinner every day.”</p>
        <p>After we came away, “Why did you not back me up?”  I 
was asked.  “Why did you let them slander Columbia?”
<pb id="mches171" n="171"/>
“It was awfully awkward,” I said, “but you see it would 
have been worse to let Doctor Gibbes and Mrs.  Gibson see 
how different it was with other people.”</p>
        <p>Took a moonlight walk after tea at the Halcott Greens'.  
All the company did honor to the beautiful night by walking 
home with me.</p>
        <p>Uncle Hamilton Boykin is here, staying at the de 
Saussures'. He says, “Manassas was play to Williamsburg,” 
and he was at both battles.  He lead a part of Stuart's 
cavalry in the charge at Williamsburg, riding a hundred 
yards ahead of his company.</p>
        <p>Toombs is ready for another revolution, and curses freely 
everything Confederate from the President down to a horse 
boy.  He thinks there is a conspiracy against him in the 
army.  Why? Heavens and earth—why?</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 2d</hi>.—A battle<ref targOrder="U" id="ref81" n="81" rend="sc" target="note81">1</ref>  is said to be raging round Richmond.  
I am at the Prestons'.  James Chesnut has gone to Richmond 
suddenly on business of the Military Department.  It is 
always his luck to arrive in the nick of time and be present 
at a great battle.</p>
        <p>Wade Hampton shot in the foot, and Johnston Pettigrew 
killed.  A telegram says Lee and Davis were both on the 
field: the enemy being repulsed.  Telegraph operator said:    
“Madam, our men are fighting.”  “Of course they are.  What 
else is there for them to do now but fight?”  “But, madam, 
the news is encouraging.”  Each army is burying its dead: 
that looks like a drawn battle.  We haunt the bulletin-board.</p>
        <p>Back to McMahan's.  Mem Cohen is ill.  Her daughter, 
Isabel, warns me not to mention the battle raging around 
Richmond.  Young Cohen is in it.  Mrs.  Preston, anxious
<note id="note81" n="81" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref81">1. The Battle of Fair Oaks or Seven Pines, took place a few miles east of

McClellan and the Confederates by General Joseph E.  Johnston.</note>
	
<pb id="mches172" n="172"/>
and unhappy about her sons.  John is with General Huger at 
Richmond; Willie in the swamps on the coast with his 
company.  Mem tells me her cousin, Edwin de Leon, is sent 
by Mr.  Davis on a mission to England.</p>
        <p>Rev.  Robert Barnwell has returned to the hospital.  Oh, 
that we had given our thousand dollars to the hospital and 
not to the gunboat!   “Stonewall Jackson's movements,”  the 
Herald says, “do us no harm; it is bringing out volunteers in 
great numbers.” And a Philadelphia paper abused us so 
fervently I felt all the blood in me rush to my head with rage.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 3d</hi>.—Doctor John Cheves is making infernal 
machines in Charleston to blow the Yankees up; pretty name 
they have, those machines.  My horses, the overseer says, are 
too poor to send over.  There was corn enough on the place 
for two years, they said, in January; now, in June, they write 
that it will not last until the new crop comes in.  Somebody is 
having a good time on the plantation, if it be not my poor 
horses.</p>
        <p>Molly will tell me all when she comes back, and more.  
Mr.  Venable has been made an aide to General Robert E.  
Lee.  He is at Vicksburg, and writes, “When the fight is over 
here, I shall be glad to go to Virginia.”  He is in capital 
spirits.  I notice army men all are when they write.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Apropos</hi> of calling Major Venable “Mr.”  Let it be noted 
that in social intercourse we are not prone to give handles to 
the names of those we know well and of our nearest and 
dearest.  A general's wife thinks it bad form to call her 
husband anything but  “Mr.”  When she gives him his title, 
she simply “drops” into it by accident.  If I am “mixed” on 
titles in this diary, let no one blame me.</p>
        <p>Telegrams come from Richmond ordering troops from 
Charleston.  Can not be sent, for the Yankees are attacking 
Charleston, doubtless with the purpose to prevent Lee's 
receiving reenforcements from there.</p>
        <p>Sat down at my window in the beautiful moonlight, and
<pb id="mches173" n="173"/>
tried hard for pleasant thoughts.  A man began to play on 
the flute, with piano accompaniment, first,  “Ever of thee I 
am fondly dreaming,” and then, “The long, long, weary 
day.” At first, I found this but a complement to the beautiful 
scene, and it was soothing to my wrought-up nerves.  But 
Von Weber's “Last Waltz” was too much; I broke down.  
Heavens, what a bitter cry came forth, with such floods of 
tears! the wonder is there was any of me left.</p>
        <p>I learn that Richmond women go in their carriages 
for the wounded, carry them home and nurse them.  One 
saw a man too weak to hold his musket.  She took it from 
him, put it on her shoulder, and helped the poor fellow 
along.</p>
        <p>If ever there was a man who could control every 
expression of emotion, who could play stoic, or an Indian 
chief, it is James Chesnut.  But one day when he came in 
from the Council he had to own to a break-down.  He was 
awfully ashamed of his weakness.  There was a letter from 
Mrs.  Gaillard asking him to help her, and he tried to read it 
to the Council.  She wanted a permit to go on to her son, 
who lies wounded in Virginia.  Colonel Chesnut could not 
control his voice.  There was not a dry eye there, when 
suddenly one man called out, “God bless the woman.”</p>
        <p>Johnston Pettigrew's aide says he left his chief mortally 
wounded on the battle-field.  Just before Johnston Pettigrew 
went to Italy to take a hand in the war there for freedom, I 
met him one day at Mrs.  Frank Hampton's.  A number of 
people were present.  Some one spoke of the engagement of 
the beautiful Miss— to Hugh Rose.  Some one else asked: 
“How do you know they are engaged?”  “Well, I never 
heard it, but I saw it.  In London, a month or so ago, I 
entered Mrs.—'s drawing-room, and I saw these two 
young people seated on a sofa opposite the door.”  “Well, 
that amounted to nothing.” “No, not in itself.  But they 
looked so foolish and so happy.  I have noticed newly 
engaged people always look that way.”  And so on.  
Johnston Pettigrew was white and red in quick succession 
<pb id="mches174" n="174"/>
during this turn of the conversation; he was in a rage of 
indignation and disgust.  “I think this kind of talk is taking a 
liberty with the young lady's name,”  he exclaimed finally,     
“and that it is an impertinence in us.”  I fancy him left dying 
alone! I wonder what they feel—those who are left to die of 
their wounds—alone—on the battle-field.</p>
        <p>Free schools are not everything, as witness this spelling.  
Yankee epistles found in camp show how illiterate they can 
be, with all their boasted schools.  Fredericksburg is spelled 
“Fredrexbirg,” medicine,  “metison,” and we read,  “To my 
sweat brother,” etc.  For the first time in my life no books 
can interest me.  Life is so real, so utterly earnest, that 
fiction is flat.  Nothing but what is going on in this distracted 
world of ours can arrest my attention for ten minutes at a 
time.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 4th</hi>.—Battles occur near Richmond, with 
bombardment of Charleston.  Beauregard is said to be 
fighting his way out or in.</p>
        <p>Mrs.  Gibson is here, at Doctor Gibbes's.  Tears are 
always in her eyes.  Her eldest son is Willie Preston's 
lieutenant.  They are down on the coast.  She owns that she 
has no hope at all.  She was a Miss Ayer, of Philadelphia, 
and says, “We may look for Burnside now, our troops which 
held him down to his iron flotilla have been withdrawn.  
They are three to one against us now, and they have hardly 
begun to put out their strength—in numbers, I mean.  We 
have come to the end of our tether, except we wait for the 
yearly crop of boys as they grow up to the requisite age.” 
She would make despondent the most sanguine person alive. 
“As a general rule,” says Mrs.  Gibson, “government people 
are sanguine, but the son of one high functionary whispered 
to Mary G., as he handed her into the car, ‘Richmond is 
bound to go.’ ” The idea now is that we are to be starved 
out.  If they shut us in, prolong the agony, it can then have 
but one end.</p>
        <p>Mrs.  Preston and I speak in whispers, but Mrs. McCord
<pb id="mches175" n="175"/>
scorns whispers, and speaks out.  She says: “There are our 
soldiers.  Since the world began there never were better but 
God does not deign to send us a general worthy of them.  I 
do not mean drill-sergeants or military old maids, who will 
not fight until everything is just so.  The real ammunition of 
our war is faith in ourselves and enthusiasm in our cause.  
West Point sits down on enthusiasm, laughs it to scorn.  It 
wants discipline.  And now comes a new danger, these 
blockade-runners.  They are filling their pockets and they 
gibe and sneer at the fools who  fight.  Don't you see this 
Stonewall, how he fires the soldiers' hearts; he will be our 
leader, maybe after all.  They say he does not care how 
many are killed.  His business is to save the country, not the 
army.  He fights to win, God bless him, and he wins.  If they 
do not want to be killed, they can stay at home.  They say he 
leaves the sick and wounded to be cared for by those whose 
business it is to do so.  His business is war.  They say he 
wants to hoist the black flag, have a short, sharp, decisive 
war and end it.  He is a Christian soldier.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 5th</hi>.—Beauregard retreating and his rear-guard cut 
off.  If Beauregard's veterans will not stand, why should we 
expect our newly levied reserves to do it? The Yankee 
general who is besieging Savannah announces his orders are 
“to take Savannah in two weeks' time, and then proceed to 
erase Charleston from the face of the earth.”</p>
        <p>Albert Luryea was killed in the battle of June 1st.  Last 
summer when a bomb fell in the very thick of his company 
he picked it up and threw it into the water.  Think of that, 
those of ye who love life!  The company sent the bomb to 
his father.  Inscribed on it were the words, “Albert Luryea, 
bravest where all are brave.” Isaac Hayne did the same thing 
at Fort Moultrie.  This race has brains enough, but they are 
not active-minded like those old Revolutionary characters, 
the Middletons, Lowndeses, Rutledges, Marions, 
Summers.  They have come direct from active-minded 
forefathers, or they would not have been here; but, with two 
<pb id="mches176" n="176"/>
or three generations of gentlemen planters, how changed has 
the blood become! Of late, all the active-minded men who 
have sprung to the front in our government were immediate 
descendants of Scotch, or Scotch-Irish-Calhoun, 
McDuffie, Cheves, and Petigru, who Huguenotted his name, 
but could not tie up his Irish.  Our planters are nice fellows, 
but slow to move; impulsive but hard to keep moving.  They 
are wonderful for a spurt, but with all their strength, they 
like to rest.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 6th</hi>.—Paul Hayne, the poet, has taken rooms here.  
My husband came and offered to buy me a pair of horses.  
He says I need more exercise in the open air.  “Come, now, 
are you providing me with the means of a rapid retreat?” 
said I.  “I am pretty badly equipped for marching.”</p>
        <p>Mrs.  Rose Greenhow is in Richmond.  One-half of the 
ungrateful Confederates say Seward sent her.  My husband 
says the Confederacy owes her a debt it can never pay.  She 
warned them at Manassas, and so they got Joe Johnston and 
his Paladins to appear upon the stage in the very nick of 
time.  In Washington they said Lord Napier left her a legacy 
to the British Legation, which accepted the gift, unlike the 
British nation, who would not accept Emma Hamilton and 
her daughter, Horatia, though they were willed to the nation 
by Lord Nelson.</p>
        <p>Mem  Cohen,  fresh from the hospital where she went 
with a beautiful   Jewish friend.  Rachel, as we will call her  
(be it her name or no),  was put to feed a very weak patient.  
Mem noticed what a handsome  fellow he was and how quiet 
and clean.  She fancied by those   tokens that he was a 
gentleman.     In performance of her duties, the lovely young 
nurse leaned kindly over him and held the cup to his lips.  
When that ceremony was over and  she  had wiped his 
mouth, to her horror she    felt a pair of by no means weak 
arms around her neck and a kiss upon her lips, which she 
thought strong, indeed.  She did not say a word; she made                          
no complaint.   She slipped away from the   hospital, and 
<pb id="mches177" n="177"/>
hereafter in her hospital work will minister at long range, no 
matter how weak and weary, sick and sore, the patient may 
be.  “And,” said Mem, “I thought he was a gentleman.”       
“Well, a gentleman is a man, after all, and she ought not to 
have put those red lips of hers so near.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 7th</hi>.—Cheves McCord's battery on the coast has 
three guns and one hundred men.  If this battery should be 
captured John's Island and James Island would be open to 
the enemy, and so Charleston exposed utterly.</p>
        <p>Wade Hampton writes to his wife that Chickahominy was 
not as decided a victory as he could have wished.  Fort 
Pillow and Memphis<ref targOrder="U" id="ref82" n="82" rend="sc" target="note82">1</ref>  have been given up.  Next! and next!</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 9th</hi>.—When we read of the battles in India, in Italy, 
in the Crimea, what did we care? Only an interesting topic, 
like any other, to look for in the paper.  Now you hear of a 
battle with a thrill and a shudder.  It has come home to us; 
half the people that we know in the world are under the 
enemy's guns.  A telegram reaches you, and you leave it on 
your lap.  You are pale with fright.  You handle it, or you 
dread to touch it, as you would a rattlesnake; worse, worse, 
a snake could only strike you.  How many, many will this 
scrap of paper tell you have gone to their death?</p>
        <p>When you meet people, sad and sorrowful is the    
greeting; they press your hand; tears stand in their eyes or 
roll down their cheeks, as they happen to possess more or 
less self-control.  They have brother, father, or sons as    the 
case may be, in battle.  And now this   thing   seems never to 
stop.  We have no breathing time given us.   It can not be

erected by the Confederates, but was occupied by the Federals on June 
5, 1862, the Confederates having evacuated and partially destroyed 
it the day before.  On June 6, 1862, the Federal fleet defeated the 
Confederates near Memphis.  The city soon afterward was occupied 
by the Federals.</note>	
<pb id="mches178" n="178"/>	
so at the North, for the papers say gentlemen do not go into 
the ranks there, but are officers, or clerks of departments.  
Then we see so many members of foreign regiments among 
our prisoners—Germans, Irish, Scotch.  The proportion of 
trouble is awfully against us.  Every company on the field, 
rank and file, is filled with our nearest and dearest, who are 
common soldiers.</p>
        <p>Mem Cohen's story to-day.  A woman she knew heard 
her son was killed, and had hardly taken in the horror of it 
when they came to say it was all a mistake in the name.  She 
fell on her knees with a shout of joy.  “Praise the Lord, O my 
soul!”   she cried, in her wild delight.  The household was 
totally upset, the swing-back of the pendulum from the scene 
of weeping and wailing of a few moments before was very 
exciting.  In the midst of this hubbub the hearse drove up 
with the poor boy in his metallic coffin.  Does anybody 
wonder so many women die?  Grief and constant anxiety kill 
nearly as many women at home as men are killed on the 
battle-field.  Mem's friend is at the point of death with brain 
fever; the sudden changes from grief to joy and joy to grief 
were more than she could bear.</p>
        <p>A story from New Orleans.  As some Yankees passed 
two boys playing in the street, one of the boys threw a 
handful of burned cotton at them, saying, “I keep this for 
you.”  The other, not to be outdone, spit at the Yankees, and 
said,  “I keep this for you.”  The Yankees marked the house.  
Afterward, a corporal's guard came.  Madam was affably 
conversing with a friend, and in vain, the friend, who was a 
mere morning caller, protested he was not the master of the 
house; he was marched off to prison.</p>
        <p>Mr.  Moise got his money out of New Orleans.  He went 
to a station with his two sons, who were quite small boys.  
When he got there, the carriage that he expected was not to 
be seen.  He had brought no money with him, knowing he 
might be searched.  Some friend called out,   “I  will lend 
you my horse, but then you will be obliged to leave the 
<pb id="mches179" n="179"/>
children.”  This offer was accepted, and, as he rode off, one 
of the boys called out, “Papa, here is your tobacco, which 
you have forgotten.”  Mr.  Moise turned back and the boy 
handed up a roll of tobacco, which he had held openly in his 
hand all the time. Mr. Moise took it, and galloped off, 
waving his hat to them.  In that roll of tobacco was encased 
twenty-five thousand dollars.</p>
        <p>Now, the Mississippi is virtually open to the Yankees.  
Beauregard has evacuated Corinth.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref83" n="83" rend="sc" target="note83">1</ref></p>
        <p>Henry Nott was killed at Shiloh; Mrs.  Auzé wrote to tell 
us.  She had no hope.  To be conquered and ruined had 
always been her fate, strive as she might, and now she knew 
it would be through her country that she would be made to 
feel.  She had had more than most women to endure, and the 
battle of life she had tried to fight with courage, patience, 
faith.  Long years ago, when she was young, her lover died.  
Afterward, she married another.  Then her husband died, 
and next her only son.  When New Orleans fell, her only 
daughter was there and Mrs.  Auzé went to her.  Well may 
she say that she has bravely borne her burden till now.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref84" n="84" rend="sc" target="note84">2</ref></p>
        <p>Stonewall said, in his quaint way: “I like strong drink, so 
I never touch it.”  May heaven, who sent him to help us, 
save him from all harm!</p>
        <p>My husband traced Stonewall's triumphal career on the 
map.  He has defeated Frémont and taken all his cannon; 
now he is after Shields.  The language of the telegram is 
vague: “Stonewall has taken plenty of prisoners”—plenty, 
no doubt, and enough and to spare.  We can't feed our own 
soldiers, and how are we to feed prisoners?</p>

        <p>And now every man in Virginia, and the eastern part of 
South Carolina is in revolt, because old men and boys are

        <p><hi rend="italics">June 10th</hi>.—General Gregg writes that Chickahominy<ref targOrder="U" id="ref85" n="85" rend="sc" target="note85">1</ref> 
was a victory <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">manqué</hi></foreign>, because Joe Johnston received a 
disabling wound and G. W.  Smith was ill.  The subordinates 
in command had not been made acquainted with the plan of 
battle.</p>
        <p>A letter from John Chesnut, who says it must be all a 
mistake about Wade Hampton's wound, for he saw him in 
the field to the very last; that is, until late that night.  
Hampton writes to Mary McDuffie that the ball was 
extracted from his foot on the field, and that he was in the 
saddle all day, but that, when he tried to take his boot off at 
night his foot was so inflamed and swollen, the boot had to 
be cut away, and the wound became more troublesome than 
he had expected.</p>
        <p>Mrs.  Preston sent her carriage to take us to see Mrs.  
Herbemont, whom Mary Gibson calls her “Mrs.  Burgamot.” 
Miss Bay came down, ever-blooming, in a cap so 
formidable, I could but laugh.  It was covered with a 
bristling row of white satin spikes.  She coyly refused to 
enter Mrs.  Preston's carriage—“to put foot into it,”  to use 
her own words; but she allowed herself to be overpersuaded.</p>
        <p>I am so ill.  Mrs. Ben Taylor said to Doctor Trezevant,
“Surely, she is too ill to be going about; she ought to be in 
bed.”    “She is very feeble, very nervous, as you say, but 
then she is living on nervous excitement.  If you shut her

Campaign of the Chickahominy, up to and inclusive of that battle.</note>
<pb id="mches181" n="181"/>
up she would die at once.”    A queer weakness of the heart, 
I have.  Sometimes it beats so feebly I am sure it has 
stopped altogether.  Then they say I have fainted, but I never 
lose consciousness.</p>
        <p>Mrs.  Preston and I were talking of negroes and cows.  A 
negro, no matter how sensible he is on any other subject, can 
never be convinced that there is any necessity to feed a cow.  
“Turn 'em out, and let 'em grass.  Grass good nuff for cow.”</p>
        <p>Famous news comes from Richmond, but not so good 
from the coast.  Mrs.  Izard said, quoting I forget whom: “If 
West Point could give brains as well as training!”   Smith is 
under arrest for disobedience of orders—Pemberton's orders.  
This is the third general whom Pemberton has displaced 
within a few weeks—Ripley, Mercer, and now Smith.</p>
        <p>When I told my husband that Molly was full of airs since 
her late trip home, he made answer:   “Tell her to go to the 
devil—she or anybody else on the plantation who is 
dissatisfied; let them go.  It is bother enough to feed and 
clothe them now.”   When he went over to the plantation he 
returned charmed with their loyalty to him, their affection 
and their faithfulness.</p>
        <p>Sixteen more Yankee regiments have landed on James 
Island.  Eason writes, “They have twice the energy and 
enterprise of our people.”  I answered, “Wait a while.  Let 
them alone until climate and mosquitoes and sand-flies and 
dealing with negroes takes it all out of them.”   Stonewall is 
a regular brick, going all the time, winning his way wherever 
he goes.  Governor Pickens called to see me.  His wife is in 
great trouble, anxiety, uncertainty.  Her brother and her 
brother-in-law are either killed or taken prisoners.</p>
        <p>Tom Taylor says Wade Hampton did not leave the field 
on account of his wound.   “What heroism!”   said some 
one.  No, what luck! He is the luckiest man alive.  He'll 
<pb id="mches182" n="182"/>
never be killed.  He was shot in the temple, but that did not 
kill him.  His soldiers believe in his luck.</p>
        <p>General Scott, on Southern soldiers, says, we have <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">élan</hi></foreign>, 
courage, woodcraft, consummate horsemanship, endurance 
of pain equal to the Indians, but that we will not submit to 
discipline.  We will not take care of things, or husband our 
resources.  Where we are there is waste and destruction.  If it 
could all be done by one wild, desperate dash, we would do 
it.  But he does not think we can stand the long, blank 
months between the acts—the waiting!  We can bear pain 
without a murmur, but we will not submit to be bored, etc.</p>
        <p>Now, for the other side.  Men of the North can wait; they 
can bear discipline; they can endure forever.  Losses in 
battle are nothing to them.  Their resources in men and 
materials of war are inexhaustible, and if they see fit they 
will fight to the bitter end.  Here is a nice prospect for us- 
as comfortable as the old man's croak at Mulberry,  “Bad 
times, worse coming.”</p>
        <p>Mrs.  McCord says, “In the hospital the better born, that 
is, those born in the purple, the gentry, those who are 
accustomed to a life of luxury, are the better patients.  They 
endure in silence.  They are hardier, stronger, tougher, less 
liable to break down than the sons of the soil.”    “Why is 
that?”  I asked, and she answered, “Something in man that is 
more than the body.”</p>
        <p>I know how it feels to die.     I have felt it again and 
again.  For instance, some one calls out,  “Albert Sidney 
Johnston is killed.”  My heart stands still.  I feel no more.  I 
am, for so many seconds, so many minutes,  I know not how 
long,   utterly     without     sensation of any   kind—dead; and 
then, there is that  great throb, that keen agony of physical 
pain, and the works are wound up   again.   The ticking of 
the clock begins,  and I take up the burden of   life once 
more.  Some day it will stop too long, or my feeble  heart 
will be  too    worn out to make   that  awakening jar, and all 
will be over.  I do not think when the end comes that 
<pb id="mches183" n="183"/>
there will be any difference, except the miracle of the new 
wind-up throb. And now good news is just as exciting as 
bad. “Hurrah, Stonewall has saved us!” The pleasure is 
almost pain because of my way of feeling it.</p>
        <p>Miriam's Luryea and the coincidences of his life. He was 
born Moses, and is the hero of the bombshell. His mother 
was at a hotel in Charleston when kind-hearted Anna De 
Leon Moses went for her sister-in-law, and gave up her own 
chamber, that the child might be born in the comfort and 
privacy of a home. Only our people are given to such 
excessive hospitality. So little Luryea was born in Anna De 
Leon's chamber. After Chickahominy when he, now a man, 
lay mortally wounded, Anna Moses, who was living in 
Richmond, found him, and she brought him home, though 
her house was crowded to the door-steps. She gave up her 
chamber to him, and so, as he had been born in her room, in 
her room he died.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 12th</hi>.—New England's Butler, best known to us as 
“Beast” Butler, is famous or infamous now. His amazing 
order to his soldiers at New Orleans and comments on it are 
in everybody's mouth. We hardly expected from 
Massachusetts behavior to shame a Comanche.</p>
        <p>One happy moment has come into Mrs. Preston's life. I 
watched her face to-day as she read the morning papers. 
Willie's battery is lauded to the skies. Every paper gave him 
a paragraph of praise.</p>
        <p>South Carolina was at Beauregard's feet after Fort Sumter. 
Since Shiloh, she has gotten up, and looks askance rather 
when his name is mentioned. And without Price or 
Beauregard who takes charge of the Western forces?  “Can 
we hold out if England and France hold off?” cries Mem.   
“No, our time has come.”</p>
        <p>“For shame, faint heart! Our people are brave, our cause is 
just; our spirit and our patient endurance beyond reproach.”   
Here  came  in Mary Cantey's voice:  “I may not have any 
logic, any sense.   I give it up.     My woman's 
<pb id="mches184" n="184"/>	
instinct tells me, all the same, that slavery's time has come. 
If we don't end it, they will.”</p>
        <p>After all this, tried to read Uncle Tom, but could not; too 
sickening; think of a man sending his little son to beat a 
human being tied to a tree. It is as bad as Squeers beating 
Smike. Flesh and blood revolt; you must skip that; it is too 
bad.</p>
        <p>Mr. Preston told a story of Joe Johnston as a boy. A 
party of boys at Abingdon were out on a spree, more boys 
than horses; so Joe Johnston rode behind John Preston, who 
is his cousin. While going over the mountains they tried to 
change horses and got behind a servant who was in charge of 
them all. The servant's horse kicked up, threw Joe Johnston, 
and broke his leg; a bone showed itself.  “Hello, boys!  
come here and look: the confounded bone has come clear 
through,” called out Joe, coolly.</p>
        <p>They had to carry him on their shoulders, relieving guard. 
As one party grew tired, another took him up. They knew he 
must suffer fearfully, but he never said so. He was as cool 
and quiet after his hurt as before. He was pretty roughly 
handled, but they could not help it. His father was in a 
towering rage because his son's leg was to be set by a 
country doctor, and it might be crooked in the process. At 
Chickahominy, brave but unlucky Joe had already eleven 
wounds.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 13th</hi>.—Decca's wedding.   It took place last year. We 
were all lying on the bed or sofas taking it coolly as to 
undress. Mrs. Singleton had the floor. They were engaged 
before they went up to Charlottesville; Alexander was on 
Gregg's staff, and Gregg was not hard on him; Decca was 
the worst in love girl she ever saw.  “Letters came while we 
were at the hospital, from Alex, urging her to let him marry 
her at once. In war times human events, life especially, are 
very uncertain.</p>
        <p>“For several days consecutively she cried without 
ceasing, and then she consented. The rooms at the hospital 
<pb id="mches185" n="185"/>
were all crowded. Decca and I slept together in the same 
room. It was arranged by letter that the marriage should 
take place; a luncheon at her grandfather Minor's, and then 
she was to depart with Alex for a few days at Richmond. 
That was to be their brief slice of honeymoon.</p>
        <p>“The day came. The wedding-breakfast was ready, so 
was the bride in all her bridal array; but no Alex, no 
bridegroom.  Alas! such is the uncertainty of a soldier's life. 
The bride said nothing, but she wept like a water-nymph.  
At dinner she plucked up heart, and at my earnest request 
was about to join us. And then the cry, ‘The bridegroom 
cometh’  He brought his best man and other friends. We had 
a jolly dinner.  ‘Circumstances over which he had no 
control’  had kept him away.</p>
        <p>“His father sat next to Decca and talked to her all the 
time as if she had been already married. It was a piece of 
absent-mindedness on his part, pure and simple, but it was 
very trying, and the girl had had much to stand that 
morning, you can well understand. Immediately after dinner 
the belated bridegroom proposed a walk; so they went for a 
brief stroll up the mountain. Decca, upon her return, said to 
me: ‘Send for Robert Barnwell. I mean to be married 
to-day.’</p>
        <p>“ ‘Impossible. No spare room in the house. No getting 
away from here; the trains all gone. Don't you know this 
hospital place is crammed to the ceiling?’  ‘Alex says I 
promised to marry him to-day. It is not his fault; he could 
not come before.’ I shook my head. ‘I don't care,’ said the 
positive little thing,  ‘I promised Alex to marry him to-day 
and I will. Send for the Rev. Robert Barnwell.’  We found 
Robert after a world of trouble, and the bride, lovely in 
Swiss muslin, was married.</p>
        <p>“Then I proposed they should take another walk, and I 
went to one of my sister nurses and begged her to take me in 
for the night, as I wished to resign my room to the young 
couple.  At  daylight  next  day  they  took  the  train  for 
<pb id="mches186" n="186"/>
Richmond.” Such is the small allowance of honeymoon 
permitted in war time.</p>
        <p>Beauregard's telegram: he can not leave the army of the 
West. His health is bad. No doubt the sea breezes would 
restore him, but—he can not come now. Such a lovely 
name—-Gustave Tautant Beauregard. But Jackson and 
Johnston and Smith and Jones will do—and Lee, how short 
and sweet.</p>
        <p>“Every day,” says Mem, “they come here in shoals— 
men to say we can not hold Richmond, and we can not hold 
Charleston much longer. Wretches, beasts!  Why do you 
come here? Why don't you stay there and fight? Don't you 
see that you own yourselves cowards by coming away in the 
very face of a battle?  If you are not liars as to the danger, 
you are cowards to run away from it.”  Thus roars the 
practical Mem, growing more furious at each word. These 
Jeremiahs laugh. They think she means others, not the 
present company.</p>
        <p>Tom Huger resigned his place in the United States Navy 
and came to us. The Iroquois was his ship in the old navy. 
They say, as he stood in the rigging, after he was shot in the 
leg, when his ship was leading the attack upon the Iroquois, 
his old crew in the Iroquois cheered him, and when his body 
was borne in, the Federals took off their caps in respect for 
his gallant conduct. When he was dying, Meta Huger said to 
him: “An of officer wants to see you: he is one of the 
enemy.”   “Let him come in; I have no enemies now.”   But 
when he heard the man's name:</p>
        <p>“No, no. I do not want to see a Southern man who is 
now in Lincoln's navy.”  The officers of the United States 
Navy attended his funeral.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 14th</hi>.—All things are against us. Memphis gone. 
Mississippi fleet annihilated, and we hear it all as stolidly 
apathetic as if it were a story of the English war against 
China which happened a year or so ago.</p>
        <p>The sons of Mrs. John Julius Pringle have come. They 
<pb id="mches187" n="187"/>
were left at school in the North. A young Huger is with 
them. They seem to have had adventures enough. Walked, 
waded, rowed in boats, if boats they could find; swam rivers 
when boats there were none; brave lads are they. One can 
but admire their pluck and energy. Mrs. Fisher, of 
Philadelphia, <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">née</hi></foreign> Middleton, gave them money to make the 
attempt to get home.</p>
        <p>Stuart's cavalry have rushed through McClellan's lines 
and burned five of his transports. Jackson has been 
reenforced by 16,000 men, and they hope the enemy will be 
drawn from around Richmond, and the valley be the seat of 
war.</p>
        <p>John Chesnut is in Whiting's brigade, which has been 
sent to Stonewall. Mem's son is with the Boykin Rangers; 
Company A, No. 1, we call it. And she has persistently wept 
ever since she heard the news.  It is no child's play, she says, 
when you are with Stonewall. He doesn't play at soldiering. 
He doesn't take care of his men at all.  He only goes to kill 
the Yankees.</p>
        <p>Wade Hampton is here, shot in the foot, but he knows no 
more about France than he does of the man in the moon. 
Wet blanket he is just now. Johnston badly wounded. Lee is 
King of Spades. They are all once more digging for dear 
life. Unless we can reenforce Stonewall, the game is up. Our 
chiefs contrive to dampen and destroy the enthusiasm of all 
who go near them. So much entrenching and falling back 
destroys the <hi rend="italics">morale</hi> of any army. This everlasting retreating, 
it kills the hearts of the men. Then we are scant of powder.</p>
        <p>James Chesnut is awfully proud of Le Conte's powder 
manufactory here. Le Conte knows how to do it. James 
Chesnut provides him the means to carry out his plans.</p>
        <p>Colonel Venable doesn't mince matters: “If we do not 
deal a blow, a blow that will be felt, it will be soon all up 
with us. I he Southwest will be lost to us. We can not afford 
to shilly-shally much longer.”</p>
        <pb id="mches188" n="188"/>
        <p>Thousands are enlisting on the other side in New Orleans. 
Butler holds out inducements. To be sure, they are 
principally foreigners who want to escape starvation. 
Tennessee we may count on as gone, since we abandoned her 
at Corinth, Fort Pillow, and Memphis. A man must be sent 
there, or it is all gone now.</p>
        <p>“You call a spade by that name, it seems, and not an 
agricultural implement?”  “They   call Mars    Robert  ‘Old
Spade Lee.’  He keeps them digging so.”   “General Lee     is 
a noble Virginian. Respect something in this world. 
Cæsar—call him Old Spade Cæsar? As a soldier, he was as 
much above suspicion, as he required his wife to be, as 
Cæsar's wife, you know. If I remember Cæsar's 
Commentaries, he owns up to a lot of entrenching. You let 
Mars Robert alone. He knows what he is about.”</p>
        <p>“Tell us of the women folk at New Orleans; how did they take 
the fall of the city?”  “They are an excitable race,”  the man 
from that city said. As my informant was standing on the 
levee a daintily dressed lady picked her way, parasol in hand, 
toward him. She accosted him with great politeness, and her 
face was as placid and unmoved as in antebellum days. Her 
first question was: “Will you be so kind as to tell me what is 
the last general order?”   “No order that I know of, madam; 
General Disorder prevails now.”  “Ah! I see; and why are 
those persons flying and yelling so noisily and racing in the 
streets in that unseemly way?”  “They are looking for a 
shell to burst over their heads at any moment.” “Ah!” Then, 
with a courtesy of dignity and grace, she waved her parasol 
and departed, but stopped to arrange that parasol at a proper 
angle to protect her face from the sun. There was no vulgar 
haste in her movements. She tripped away as gracefully as 
she came. My informant had failed to discompose her by his 
fearful  rations. That was the one self-possessed soul then in 
New Orleans.</p>
        <pb id="mches189" n="189"/>
        <p>Another woman drew near, so overheated and out of 
breath, she had barely time to say she had run miles of 
squares in her crazy terror and bewilderment, when a 
sudden shower came up. In a second she was cool and calm. 
She forgot all the questions she came to ask.  “My bonnet, I 
must save it at any sacrifice,” she said, and so turned her 
dress over her head, and went off, forgetting her country's 
trouble and screaming for a cab.</p>
        <p>Went to see Mrs. Burroughs at the old de Saussure 
house. She has such a sweet face, such soft, kind, beautiful, 
dark-gray eyes. Such eyes are a poem. No wonder she had a 
long love-story. We sat in the piazza at twelve o'clock of a 
June day, the glorious Southern sun shining its very hottest. 
But we were in a dense shade—magnolias in full bloom, ivy, 
vines of I know not what, and roses in profusion closed us 
in. It was a living wall of everything beautiful and sweet. In 
all this flower-garden of a Columbia, that is the most 
delicious corner I have been in yet.</p>
        <p>Got from the Prestons' French library, Fanny, with a 
brilliant preface by Jules Janier. Now, then, I have come to 
the worst. There can be no worse book than Fanny. The 
lover is jealous of the husband. The woman is for the 
polyandry rule of life. She cheats both and refuses to break 
with either. But to criticize it one must be as shameless as 
the book itself. Of course, it is clever to the last degree, or it 
would be kicked into the gutter. It is not nastier or coarser 
than Mrs. Stowe, but then it is not written in the interests of 
philanthropy.</p>
        <p>We  had an unexpected dinner-party to-day. First,  
Wade Hampton came and his wife. Then Mr. and Mrs. 
Rose. I  remember that  the late Colonel Hampton once 
said to me, a thing I thought odd at the time, “Mrs. James 
Rose” (and I forget now who was the other) “are the only 
two people on this side of  the water who know how to give 
a state dinner.” Mr. and Mrs. James Rose: if anybody
<pb id="mches190" n="190"/>
body wishes to describe old Carolina at its best, let them try 
their hands at painting these two people.</p>
        <p>Wade Hampton still limps a little, but he is rapidly 
recovering. Here is what he said, and he has fought so well 
that he is listened to: “If we mean to play at war, as we play 
a game of chess, West Point tactics prevailing, we are sure 
to lose the game. They have every advantage. They can lose 
pawns <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">ad infinitum</hi></foreign>, to the end of time and never feel it. We 
will be throwing away all that we had hoped so much 
from—Southern hot-headed dash, reckless gallantry, spirit of 
adventure, readiness to lead forlorn hopes.”</p>
        <p>Mrs. Rose is Miss Sarah Parker's aunt. Somehow it came 
out when I was not in the room, but those girls tell me 
everything. It seems Miss Sarah said: “The reason I can not 
bear Mrs. Chesnut is that she laughs at everything and at 
everybody.”  If she saw me now she would give me credit 
for some pretty hearty crying as well as laughing. It was a 
mortifying thing to hear about one's self, all the same.</p>
        <p>General Preston came in and announced that Mr. Chesnut 
was in town. He had just seen Mr. Alfred Huger, who came 
up on the Charleston train with him. Then Mrs. McCord 
came and offered to take me back to Mrs. McMahan's to 
look him up. I found my room locked up. Lawrence said his 
master had gone to look for me at the Prestons'.</p>
        <p>Mrs. McCord proposed we should further seek for my errant 
husband.  At the door, we met Governor Pickens, who 
showed us telegrams from the President of the most 
important nature. The Governor added, “And I have one 
from Jeems Chesnut, but I hear he has followed it so closely, 
coming on its heels, as it were, that I need not show you that 
one.”</p>
        <p>“You don't look interested at the sound of your 
husband's name?”  said he. “Is that his name?”  asked I.    
“I supposed it was James.”   “My advice to you is to find
<pb id="mches191" n="191"/>
him, for Mrs. Pickens says he was last seen in the company 
of two very handsome women, and now you may call him 
any name you please.”</p>
        <p>We soon met. The two beautiful dames Governor 
Pickens threw in my teeth were some ladies from Rafton 
Creek, almost neighbors, who live near Camden.</p>
        <p>By way of pleasant remark to Wade Hampton: “Oh, 
General! The next battle will give you a chance to be 
major-general.”  “I was very foolish to give up my Legion,” 
he answered gloomily.  “Promotion don't really annoy many 
people.” Mary Gibson says her father writes to them, that 
they may go back. He thinks now that the Confederates can 
hold Richmond. <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">Gloria in excelsis</hi></foreign>!</p>
        <p>Another personal defeat. Little Kate said: “Oh, Cousin 
Mary, why don't you cultivate heart? They say at Kirkwood 
that you had better let your brains alone a while and 
cultivate heart.”  She had evidently caught up a phrase and 
repeated it again and again for my benefit. So that is the 
way they talk of me! The only good of loving any one with 
your whole heart is to give that person the power to hurt 
you.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 24th</hi>.—Mr. Chesnut, having missed the 
Secessionville<ref targOrder="U" id="ref86" n="86" rend="sc" target="note86">1</ref>  fight by half a day, was determined to see the 
one around Richmond. He went off with General Cooper 
and Wade Hampton. Blanton Duncan sent them for a 
luncheon on board the cars,—ice, wine, and every manner of 
good thing.</p>
        <p>In all this death and destruction, the women are the 
same—chatter, patter, clatter. “Oh, the Charleston refugees 
are so  full  of  airs;  there is no sympathy for them here!”       
“Oh, indeed!  That  is  queer.  They are not half as

some one had blundered.”   “Volleyed and thundered rhymes 
but is out of place.”</p>
        <p>The worst of all airs came from a democratic landlady, 
who was asked by Mrs. President Davis to have a carpet 
shaken, and shook herself with rage as she answered, “You 
know, madam, you need not stay here if my carpet or 
anything else does not suit you.”</p>
        <p>John Chesnut gives us a spirited account of their ride 
around McClellan. I sent the letter to his grandfather. The 
women ran out screaming with joyful welcome as soon as 
they caught sight of our soldiers' gray uniforms; ran to them 
bringing handfuls and armfuls of, food. One gray-headed 
man, after preparing a hasty meal for them, knelt and prayed 
as they snatched it, as you may say. They were in the saddle 
from Friday until Sunday. They were used up; so were their 
horses. Johnny writes for clothes and more horses. Miss S. 
C. says: “No need to send any more of his fine horses to be 
killed or captured by the Yankees; wait and see how the 
siege of Richmond ends.”  The horses will go all the same, 
as Johnny wants them.</p>
        <p>June 25th.—I forgot to tell of Mrs. Pickens's reception for 
General Hampton. My Mem dear, described it all. “The 
Governess ” (“Tut, Mem! that is not the right name for 
her—she is not a teacher.”  “Never mind, it is the easier to 
say than the Governor's wife.”  “<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">Madame la Gouvernante</hi></foreign> ” 
was suggested.  “Why? That is worse than the other!”)      
“met him at the door, took his crutch away, putting his hand 
upon her shoulder instead.  “That is the way to greet 
heroes,” she said. Her blue eyes were aflame, and in 
response poor Wade smiled, and smiled until his face 
hardened into a fixed grin of embarrassment and annoyance. 
He is a simple-mannered man, you know, and does not want 
to be made much of by women.</p>
        <p>The butler was not in plain clothes, but wore, as the 
<pb id="mches193" n="193"/>
other servants did, magnificent livery brought from the 
Court of St. Petersburg, one mass of gold embroidery, etc. 
They had champagne and Russian tea, the latter from a 
samovar made in Russia. Little Moses was there. Now for 
us they have never put their servants into Russian livery, nor 
paraded Little Moses under our noses, but I must confess 
the Russian tea and champagne set before us left nothing to 
be desired.    “How did General Hampton bear his honors?” 
“Well, to the last he looked as if he wished they would let 
him alone.”</p>
        <p>Met Mr. Ashmore fresh from Richmond. He says 
Stonewall is coming up behind McClellan. And here comes 
the tug of war. He thinks we have so many spies in 
Richmond, they may have found out our strategic 
movements and so may circumvent them.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bartow's story of a clever Miss Toombs. So many 
men were in love with her, and the courtship, while it lasted, 
of each one was as exciting and bewildering as a fox-chase. 
She liked the fun of the run, but she wanted something more 
than to know a man was in mad pursuit of her; that he 
should love her, she agreed, but she must love him, too. 
How was she to tell? Yet she must be certain of it before 
she said “Yes.”  So, as they sat by the lamp she would look 
at him and inwardly ask herself, “Would I be willing to 
spend the long winter evenings forever after sitting here 
darning your old stockings?”  Never, echo answered. No, 
no, a thousand times no. So, each had to make way for 
another.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 27th</hi>.—We went in a body (half a dozen ladies, with 
no man on escort duty, for they are all in the army) to a 
concert. Mrs. Pickens came in. She was joined soon by 
Secretary Moses and Mr. Follen. Doctor Berrien came to 
our relief. Nothing could be more execrable than the 
singing. Financially the thing was a great success, for 
though the audience was altogether feminine, it was a very 
large one.</p>
        <pb id="mches194" n="194"/>
        <p>Telegram from Mr. Chesnut, “Safe in Richmond”; that 
is, if Richmond be safe, with all the power of the United 
States of America battering at her gates. Strange not a word 
from Stonewall Jackson, after all! Doctor Gibson telegraphs 
his wife, “Stay where you are; terrible battle<ref targOrder="U" id="ref87" n="87" rend="sc" target="note87">1</ref> looked for 
here.”</p>
        <p>Decca is dead. That poor little darling!  Immediately after 
her baby was born, she took it into her head that Alex was 
killed. He was wounded, but those around had not told her of 
it. She surprised them by asking, “Does any one know how 
the battle has gone since Alex was killed?”  She could not 
read for a day or so before she died. Her head was 
bewildered, but she would not let any one else touch her 
letters; so she died with several unopened ones in her bosom. 
Mrs. Singleton, Decca's mother, fainted dead away, but she 
shed no tears. We went to the house and saw Alex's mother, 
a daughter of Langdon Cheves.  Annie was with us. She 
said: “This is the saddest thing for Alex.”  “No,” said his 
mother, “death is never the saddest thing. If he were not a 
good man, that would be a far worse thing.”  Annie, in utter 
amazement, whimpered, “But Alex is  so  good  already.”    
“Yes, seven years ago the death of one of his sisters that he 
dearly loved made him a Christian. That death in our family 
was worth a thousand lives.”</p>
        <p>One  needs a hard heart now. Even old Mr. Shand shed 
tears. Mary Barnwell sat as still as a statue, as white and 
stony.  “Grief which can relieve  itself  by  tears is a thing to 
pray for,” said the Rev. Mr. Shand. Then came a telegram 
from  Hampton, “All well; so far we are successful.”  
Robert Barnwell had been telegraphed for.  His answer 
came,   “Can't leave here;  Gregg is fighting across the

Chickahominy.” Said Alex's mother: “My son, Alex, may 
never hear this sad news,” and her lip settled rigidly. “Go 
on; what else does Hampton say?” asked she. “Lee has one 
wing of the army, Stonewall the other.”</p>
        <p>Annie Hampton came to tell us the latest news—that we 
have abandoned James Island and are fortifying Morris 
Island. “And now,” she says, “if the enemy will be so kind 
as to wait, we will be ready for them in two months.”</p>
        <p>Rev. Mr. Shand and that pious Christian woman, Alex's 
mother (who looks into your very soul with those large and 
lustrous blue eyes of hers) agreed that the Yankees, even if 
they took Charleston, would not destroy it. I think they will, 
sinner that I am. Mr. Shand remarked to her, “Madam, you 
have two sons in the army.”  Alex's mother replied, “I have 
had six sons in the army; I now have five.”</p>
        <p>There are people here too small to conceive of any  larger 
business than quarreling in the newspapers. One laughs at 
squibs in the papers now, in such times as these, with the 
wolf at our doors. Men safe in their closets writing fiery 
articles, denouncing those who are at work, are beneath 
contempt. Only critics with muskets on their shoulders have 
the right to speak now, as Trenholm said the other night.</p>
        <p>In a pouring rain we went to that poor child's funeral -to 
Decca's. They buried her in the little white frock she wore 
when she engaged herself to Alex, and which she again put 
on for her bridal about a year ago. She lies now in the 
churchyard, in sight of my window. Is she to be pitied? She 
said she had had “months of perfect happiness.”  How 
many people can say that?  So many of us live their long, 
dreary lives and then happiness never comes to meet them at 
all. It seems so near, and yet it eludes them forever.</p>

now;<ref targOrder="U" id="ref88" n="88" rend="sc" target="note88">1</ref> one reads it on the bulletin-board. It is the anniversary 
of the battle of Fort Moultrie. The enemy went off so 
quickly, I wonder if it was not a trap laid for us, to lead us 
away from Richmond, to some place where they can manage 
to do us more harm. And now comes the list of killed and 
wounded. Victory does not seem to soothe sore hearts. Mrs. 
Haskell has five sons before the enemy's illimitable cannon. 
Mrs. Preston two. McClellan is routed and we have twelve 
thousand prisoners. Prisoners! My God! and what are we to 
do with them?  We can't feed our own people.</p>
        <p>For the first time since Joe Johnston was wounded at
Seven Pines, we may breathe freely; we were so afraid of 
another general, or a new one. Stonewall can not be 
everywhere, though he comes near it.</p>
        <p>Magruder did splendidly at Big Bethel. It was a 
wonderful thing how he played his ten thousand before 
McClellan like fireflies and utterly deluded him. It was 
partly due to the Manassas scare that we gave them; they 
will never be foolhardy again. Now we are throwing up our 
caps for R. E. Lee. We hope from the Lees what the first 
sprightly running (at Manassas) could not give. We do hope 
there will be no “ifs.”   “Ifs” have ruined us. Shiloh was a 
victory if Albert Sidney Johnston had not been killed; Seven 
Pines if Joe Johnston had not been wounded.  The “ifs”  
bristle like porcupines. That victory at Manassas did nothing 
but send us off in a fool's paradise of conceit, and it roused 
the manhood of the Northern people. For very shame they 
had to move up.</p>
        <p>A French man-of-war lies at the wharf at Charleston to take 
off French subjects when the bombardment begins.

          </opener>
          <salute>MY DEAR MARY:</salute>
          <p>For the last three days I have been a witness of the most 
stirring events of modern times. On my arrival here, I found 
the government so absorbed in the great battle pending, that I 
found it useless to talk of the special business that brought 
me to this place. As soon as it is over, which will probably 
be to-morrow, I think that I can easily accomplish all that I 
was sent for. I have no doubt that we can procure another 
general and more forces, etc.</p>
          <p>The President and General Lee are inclined to listen to 
me, and to do all they can for us. General Lee is vindicating 
the high opinion I have ever expressed of him, and his plans 
and executions of the last great fight will place him high in 
the roll of really great commanders.</p>
          <p>The fight on Friday was the largest and fiercest of the 
whole war. Some 60,000 or 70,000, with great 
preponderance on the side of the enemy. Ground, numbers, 
armament, etc., were all in favor of the enemy. But our men 
and generals were superior. The higher officers and men 
behaved with a resolution and dashing heroism that have 
never been surpassed in any country or in any age.</p>
          <p>Our line was three times repulsed by superior numbers 
and superior artillery impregnably posted. Then Lee, 
assembling all his generals to the front, told them that 
victory depended on carrying the batteries and defeating the 
army before them, ere night should fall. Should night come 
without victory all was lost, and the work must be done by 
the bayonet. Our men then made a rapid and irresistible 
charge, without powder, and carried everything. The enemy
<pb id="mches198" n="198"/>
melted before them, and ran with the utmost speed, though 
of the regulars of the Federal army. The fight between the 
artillery of the opposing forces was terrific and sublime. The 
field became one dense cloud of smoke, so that nothing 
could be seen, but the incessant flash of fire. They were 
within sixteen hundred yards of each other and it rained 
storms of grape and canister. We took twenty-three pieces of 
their artillery, many small arms, and small ammunition. 
They burned most of their stores, wagons, etc.</p>
          <p>The victory of the second day was full and complete. 
Yesterday there was little or no fighting, but some splendid 
maneuvering, which has placed us completely around them. I 
think the end must be decisive in our favor. We have lost 
many men and many officers; I hear Alex Haskell and young 
McMahan are among them, as well as a son of Dr. 
Trezevant. Very sad, indeed. We are fighting again today; 
will let you know the result as soon as possible. Will be at 
home some time next week. No letter from you yet.</p>

          <p>A telegram from my husband of June 29th from 
Richmond: “Was on the field, saw it all. Things satisfying 
so far. Can hear nothing of John Chesnut. He is in Stuart's 
command. Saw Jack Preston; safe so far. No reason why we 
should not bag McClellan's army or cut it to pieces. From 
four to six thousand prisoners already.” Doctor Gibbes 
rushed in like a whirlwind to say we were driving McClellan 
into the river.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">June 30th</hi>.—First came Dr. Trezevant, who announced Burnet 
Rhett's death. “No, no; I have just seen the bulletin-board. It 
was Grimke Rhett's.” When the doctor went out it was 
added: “Howell Trezevant's death is there, too. The doctor 
will see it as soon as he goes down to the board.” The girls 
went to see Lucy Trezevant. The doctor was lying still as 
death on a sofa with his face covered.</p>
          <pb id="mches199" n="199"/>
          <p><hi rend="italics">July 1st</hi>.—No more news. It has settled down into this. 
The general battle, the decisive battle, has to be fought yet. 
Edward Cheves, only son of John Cheves, killed. His sister 
kept crying, “Oh, mother, what shall we do; Edward is 
killed,”  but the mother sat dead still, white as a sheet, never 
uttering a word or shedding a tear. Are our women losing 
the capacity to weep?  The father came to-day, Mr. John 
Cheves. He has been making infernal machines in 
Charleston to blow up Yankee ships.</p>
          <p>While Mrs. McCord was telling me of this terrible 
trouble in her brother's family, some one said: “Decca's 
husband died of grief.”  Stuff and nonsense; silly sentiment, 
folly! If he is not wounded, he is alive. His brother, John, 
may die of that shattered arm in this hot weather. Alex will 
never die of a broken heart. Take my word for it.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">July 3d</hi>.—Mem says she feels like sitting down, as an 
Irishwoman does at a wake, and howling night and day. Why 
did Huger let McClellan slip through his fingers? Arrived at 
Mrs. McMahan's at the wrong moment. Mrs. Bartow was 
reading to the stricken mother an account of the death of her 
son. The letter was written by a man who was standing by 
him when he was shot through the head. “My God!” he 
said; that was all, and he fell dead. James Taylor was 
color-bearer. He was shot three times before he gave in. 
Then he said, as he handed the colors to the man next him,   
“You see I can't stand it any longer,” and dropped stone 
dead. He was only seventeen years old.</p>
          <p>If anything can reconcile me to the idea of  a 
horrid failure after all efforts to  make good our 
independence of Yankees,  it  is  Lincoln's  proclamation  
freeing the  negroes.  Especially  yours,  Messieurs,  who  
write insults to your Governor and Council, dated  
from  Clarendon. Three  hundred of Mr. Walter  
Blake's negroes have gone to the Yankees. Remember,   
that recalcitrant patriot's property on two legs
<pb id="mches200" n="200"/>
may walk off without an order from the Council to work on 
fortifications.</p>
          <p>Have been reading The Potiphar Papers by Curtis. Can 
this be a picture of New York socially? If it were not for this 
horrid war, how nice it would be here. We might lead such a 
pleasant life. This is the most perfectly appointed 
establishment—such beautiful grounds, lowers, and fruits; 
indeed, all that heart could wish; such delightful dinners, 
such pleasant drives, such jolly talks, such charming people; 
but this horrid war poisons everything.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">July 5th</hi>.—Drove out with Mrs. “Constitution” Browne, 
who told us the story of Ben McCulloch's devotion to Lucy 
Gwynn. Poor Ben McCulloch—another dead hero. Called at 
the Tognos' and saw no one; no wonder. They say Ascelie 
Togno was to have been married to Grimke Rhett in August, 
and he is dead on the battle-field. I had not heard of the 
engagement before I went there.</p>
          <p>July 8th.—Gunboat captured on the Santee. So much the 
worse for us. We do not want any more prisoners, and next 
time they will send a fleet of boats, if one will not do. The 
Governor sent me Mr. Chesnut's telegram with a note 
saying, “I regret the telegram does not come up to what we 
had hoped might be as to the entire destruction of 
McClellan's army. I think, however, the strength of the  war 
with its ferocity may now be considered as broken.”</p>
          <p>Table-talk  to-day:    This war was undertaken by us to          
shake  off the yoke of  foreign invaders.    So we consider our 
cause righteous. The   Yankees, since the   war has begun, have 
discovered  it  is to free the slaves that they are fighting. So 
their cause is  noble.  They  also  expect  to  make  the  war 
pay.  Yankees do not undertake anything that does not pay. 
They think  we  belong  to  them.  We  have  been  good  milk  
cows—milked by the     tariff, or skimmed. We let them have   
all of our hard earnings.  We bear the ban of   slavery;   they 
get the money.  Cotton  pays  everybody  who  handles it, sells 
it,  manufactures  it,  but  rarely  pays  the  man  who 
<pb id="mches201" n="201"/>
grows it. Second hand the Yankees received the wages of 
slavery. They grew rich. We grew poor. The receiver is as 
bad as the thief. That applies to us, too, for we received the 
savages they stole from Africa and brought to us in their 
slave-ships. As with the Egyptians, so it shall be with us: if 
they let us go, it must be across a Red Sea—but one made 
red by blood.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">July 10th</hi>.—My husband has come. He believes from what 
he heard in Richmond that we are to be recognized as a 
nation by the crowned heads across the water, at last. Mr. 
Davis was very kind; he asked him to stay at his house, 
which he did, and went every day with General Lee and Mr. 
Davis to the battle-field as a sort of amateur aide to the 
President. Likewise they admitted him to the informal 
Cabinet meetings at the President's house. He is so hopeful 
now that it is pleasant to hear him, and I had not the heart to 
stick the small pins of Yeadon and Pickens in him yet a 
while.</p>
          <p>Public opinion is hot against Huger and Magruder for 
McClellan's escape. Doctor Gibbes gave me some letters 
picked up on the battle-field. One signed “Laura,” tells her 
lover to fight in such a manner that no Southerner can ever 
taunt Yankees again with cowardice. She speaks of a man at 
home whom she knows, “who is still talking of his intention 
to seek the bubble reputation at the cannon's mouth.”           
“Miserable coward!” she writes, “I will never speak to him 
again.”  It was a relief to find one silly young person filling 
three pages with a description of her new bonnet and the 
bonnet still worn by her rival. Those fiery Joan of Arc 
damsels who goad on their sweethearts bode us no good.</p>
          <p>Rachel Lyons was in Richmond, hand in glove with Mrs. 
Greenhow. Why not? “So handsome, so clever, so 
angelically kind,” says Rachel of the Greenhow, “and she 
offers to matronize me.”</p>
          <p>Mrs. Philips, another beautiful and clever Jewess, has
<pb id="mches202" n="202"/>
been put into prison again by “Beast” Butler because she 
happened to be laughing as a Yankee funeral procession 
went by.</p>
          <p>Captain B. told of John Chesnut's pranks. Johnny was 
riding a powerful horse, captured from the Yankees. The 
horse dashed with him right into the Yankee ranks. A dozen 
Confederates galloped after him, shouting,  “Stuart!  Stuart!” 
The Yankees, mistaking this mad charge for Stuart's cavalry, 
broke ranks and fled. Daredevil Camden boys ride like 
Arabs!</p>
          <p>Mr. Chesnut says he was riding with the President when 
Colonel Browne, his aide, was along. The General 
commanding rode up and, bowing politely, said: “Mr. 
President, am I in command here?”  “Yes.” “Then I forbid 
you to stand here under the enemy's guns. Any exposure of a 
life like yours is wrong, and this is useless exposure. You 
must go back.”  Mr. Davis answered: “Certainly, I will set 
an example of obedience to orders. Discipline must be 
maintained.”  But he did not go back.</p>
          <p>Mr. Chesnut met the Haynes, who had gone on to nurse 
their wounded son and found him dead. They were standing 
in the corridor of the Spotswood. Although Mr. Chesnut was 
staying at the President's, he retained his room at the hotel. 
So he gave his room to them. Next day, when he went back 
to his room he found that Mrs. Hayne had thrown herself 
across the foot of the bed and never moved. No other part of 
the bed had been touched. She got up and went back to the 
cars, or was led back. He says these heartbroken mothers 
are hard to face.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">July 12th</hi>.—At McMahan's our small colonel, Paul 
Hayne's son, came into my room. To amuse the child I gave 
him a photograph album to look over. “You have Lincoln in 
your book!” said he. “I am astonished at you. I hate him!” 
And he placed the book on the floor and struck Old Abe in 
the face with his fist.</p>
          <p>An Englishman told me Lincoln has said that had he 
<pb id="mches203" n="203"/>
known such a war would follow his election he never would 
have set foot in Washington, nor have been inaugurated. He 
had never dreamed of this awful fratricidal bloodshed. That 
does not seem like the true John Brown spirit. I was very 
glad to hear it—to hear something from the President of the 
United States which was not merely a vulgar joke, and 
usually a joke so vulgar that you were ashamed to laugh, 
funny though it was. They say Seward has gone to England 
and his wily tongue will turn all hearts against us.</p>
          <p>Browne told us there was a son of the Duke of Somerset 
in Richmond. He laughed his fill at our ragged, dirty 
soldiers, but he stopped his laughing when he saw them 
under fire. Our men strip the Yankee dead of their shoes, but 
will not touch the shoes of a comrade. Poor fellows, they are 
nearly barefoot.</p>
          <p>Alex has come. I saw him ride up about dusk and go 
into the graveyard. I shut up my windows on that side. Poor 
fellow!</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">July 13th</hi>.—Halcott Green came to see us. Bragg is a 
stern disciplinarian, according to Halcott. He did not in the 
least understand citizen soldiers. In the retreat from Shiloh 
he ordered that not a gun should be fired. A soldier shot a 
chicken, and then the soldier was shot.  “For a chicken!” 
said Halcott.  “A Confederate soldier for a chicken!”</p>
          <p>Mrs. McCord says a nurse, who is also a beauty, had 
better leave her beauty with her cloak and hat at the door. 
One lovely lady nurse said to a rough old soldier, whose 
wound could not have been dangerous, “Well, my good 
soul, what can I do for you?”  “Kiss me!” said he.  Mrs. 
McCord's fury was “at the woman's telling it,”  for it 
brought her hospital into disrepute, and very properly. She 
knew there were women who would boast of an insult if it 
ministered to their vanity. She wanted nurses to come 
dressed as nurses, as Sisters of Charity, and not as fine 
ladies. Then there would be no trouble. When she saw them
	
<pb id="mches204" n="204"/>
coming in angel sleeves, displaying all their white arms and 
in their muslin, showing all their beautiful white shoulders 
and throats, she felt disposed to order them off the premises. 
That was no proper costume for a nurse. Mrs. Bartow goes 
in her widow's weeds, which is after Mrs. McCord's own 
heart. But Mrs. Bartow has her stories, too. A surgeon said 
to her, “I give you no detailed instructions: a mother 
necessarily is a nurse.”  She then passed on quietly, “as 
smilingly acquiescent, my dear, as if I had ever been a 
mother.”</p>
          <p>Mrs. Greenhow has enlightened Rachel Lyons as to Mr. 
Chesnut's character in Washington. He was “one of the very 
few men of whom there was not a word of scandal spoken. I 
do not believe, my dear, that he ever spoke to a woman 
there.”  He did know Mrs. John R. Thompson, however.</p>
          <p>Walked up and down the college campus with Mrs. 
McCord. The buildings all lit up with gas, the soldiers seated 
under the elms in every direction, and in every stage of 
convalescence. Through the open windows, could see the 
nurses flitting about. It was a strange, weird scene. Walked 
home with Mrs. Bartow. We stopped at Judge Carroll's. Mrs. 
Carroll gave us a cup of tea. When we got home, found the

General Magruder.</p>
          <p>Last night the Edgefield Band serenaded Governor 
Pickens. Mrs. Harris stepped on the porch and sang the 
Marseillaise for them. It has been more than twenty years 
since I first heard her voice; it was a very fine one then, but 
there is nothing which the tooth of time lacerates more 
cruelly than the singing voice of women. There is an 
incongruous metaphor for you.</p>
          <p>The negroes on the coast received the Rutledge's Mounted 
Rifles apparently with great rejoicings. The troops were 
gratified-to find the negroes in such a friendly state of mind. 
One servant whispered to his master, “Don't you mind
<pb id="mches205" n="205"/>
'em, don't trust 'em”—meaning the negroes. The master
then dressed himself as a Federal officer and went down to
a negro quarter. The very first greeting was, “Ki! massa,
you come fuh ketch rebels? We kin show you way you
kin ketch thirty to-night.” They took him to the Confederate
camp, or pointed it out, and then added for his edification,	
“We kin ketch officer fuh you whenever you want
'em.”</p>

soldiers' canteens to make them mad with ferocity in the

lack it; we do not need to be fired by drink to be brave.

addressing the South Carolina Medical Association, Charleston, in
1873: “On the route from the army to the general hospital, wounds
are dressed and soldiers refreshed at wayside homes; and here be it
said with justice and pride that the credit of originating this system
is due to the women of South Carolina. In a small room in the capital
of this State, the first Wayside Home was founded; and during the
war, some seventy-five thousand soldiers were relieved by having their
wounds dressed, their ailments attended, and very frequently by being
clothed through the patriotic services and good offices of a few untiring
ladies in Columbia. From this little nucleus, spread that grand system 
of wayside hospitals which was established during our own and the  
late European wars.”</note>
<pb id="mches206" n="206"/>
Columbia Station, where all the railroads meet. All honor to 
Mrs. Fisher and the other women who work there so 
faithfully! The young girls of Columbia started this hospital. 
In the first winter of the war, moneyless soldiers, sick and 
wounded, suffered greatly when they had to lie over here 
because of faulty connections between trains. Rev. Mr. 
Martin, whose habit it was to meet trains and offer his aid to 
these unfortunates, suggested to the Young Ladies' Hospital 
Association their opportunity; straightway the blessed 
maidens provided a room where our poor fellows might have 
their wounds bound up and be refreshed. And now, the         
“Soldiers' Rest” has grown into the Wayside Hospital, and 
older heads and hands relieve younger ones of the grimmer 
work and graver responsibilities. I am ready to help in every 
way, by subscription and otherwise, but too feeble in health 
to go there much.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Browne heard a man say at the Congaree House,     
“We are breaking our heads against a stone wall. We are 
bound to be conquered. We can not keep it up much longer 
against so powerful a nation as the United States. Crowds of 
Irish, Dutch, and Scotch are pouring in to swell their armies. 
They are promised our lands, and they believe they will get 
them. Even if we are successful we can not live without 
Yankees.”  “Now,” says Mrs. Browne, “I call that man a 
Yankee spy.”   To which I reply, “If he were a spy, he 
would not dare show his hand so plainly.”</p>
          <p>“To think,” says Mrs. Browne, “that he is not taken up. 
Seward's little bell would tinkle, a guard would come, and 
the Grand Inquisition of America would order that man put 
under arrest in the twinkling of an eye, if he had ventured to 
speak against Yankees in Yankee land.”</p>
          <p>General Preston said he had “the right to take up any
<pb id="mches207" n="207"/>
one who was not in his right place and send him where he 
belonged.”  “Then do take up my husband instantly. He is 
sadly out of his right place in this little Governor's Council.” 
The general stared at me and slowly uttered in his most 
tragic tones, “If I could put him where I think he ought to 
be!”  This I immediately hailed as a high compliment and 
was duly ready with my thanks. Upon reflection, it is borne 
in upon me, that he might have been more explicit. He left 
too much to the imagination.</p>
          <p>Then Mrs. Browne described the Prince of Wales, whose 
manners, it seems, differ from those of Mrs.—, who 
arraigned us from morn to dewy eve, and upbraided us with 
our ill-bred manners and customs. The Prince, when he was 
here, conformed at once to whatever he saw was the way of 
those who entertained him. He closely imitated President 
Buchanan's way of doing things. He took off his gloves at 
once when he saw that the President wore none. He began by 
bowing to the people who were presented to him, but when 
he saw Mr. Buchanan shaking hands, he shook hands, too. 
When smoking affably with Browne on the White House 
piazza, he expressed his content with the fine cigars Browne 
had given him. The President said: “I was keeping some 
excellent ones for you, but Browne has got ahead of me.” 
Long after Mr. Buchanan had gone to bed, the Prince ran 
into his room in a jolly, boyish way, and said: “Mr. 
Buchanan, I have come for the fine cigars you have for me.”</p>
          <p>As I walked up to the Prestons', along a beautiful shaded 
back street, a carriage passed with Governor Means in it. As 
soon as he saw me he threw himself half out and kissed both 
hands to me again and again. It was a whole-souled greeting, 
as the saying is, and I returned it with my whole heart, too.  
“Good-by,” he cried, and I responded “Good-by.” I may 
never see him again. I am not sure that I did not shed a few 
tears.</p>
          <p>General Preston and Mr. Chesnut were seated on the 
<pb id="mches208" n="208"/>
piazza of the Hampton house as I walked in. I opened my 
batteries upon them in this scornful style: “You cold, 
formal, solemn, overly-polite creatures, weighed down by 
your own dignity. You will never know the rapture of such a 
sad farewell as John Means and I have just interchanged. He 
was in a hack,”  I proceeded to relate, “and I was on the 
sidewalk. He was on his way to the war, poor fellow. The 
hackman drove steadily along in the middle of the street; but 
for our gray hairs I do not know what he might have thought 
of us. John Means did not suppress his feelings at an 
unexpected meeting with an old friend, and a good cry did 
me good. It is a life of terror and foreboding we lead. My 
heart is in my mouth half the time. But you two, under no 
possible circumstances could you forget your manners.”</p>
          <p>Read Russell's India all day. Saintly folks those English 
when their blood is up. Sepoys and blacks we do not expect 
anything better from, but what an example of Christian 
patience and humanity the white “angels” from the West set 
them.</p>
          <p>The beautiful Jewess, Rachel Lyons, was here to-day. 
She flattered Paul Hayne audaciously, and he threw back the 
ball.</p>
          <p>To-day I saw the Rowena to this Rebecca, when Mrs. 
Edward Barnwell called. She is the purest type of 
Anglo-Saxon—exquisitely beautiful, cold, quiet, calm, 
lady-like, fair as a lily, with the blackest and longest 
eyelashes, and her eyes so light in color some one said “they 
were the hue of cologne and water.”  At any rate, she has a 
patent right to them; there are no more like them to be had. 
The effect is startling, but lovely beyond words.</p>
          <p>Blanton Duncan told us a story of Morgan in Kentucky. 
Morgan walked into a court where they were trying some 
Secessionists. The Judge was about to pronounce sentence, 
but Morgan rose, and begged that he might be allowed to 
call some witnesses.  The  Judge  asked  who  were  his 
<pb id="mches209" n="209"/>
witnesses.  “My name is John Morgan, and my witnesses 
are 1,400 Confederate soldiers.”</p>
          <p>Mrs. Izard witnessed two instances of patriotism in the 
caste called “Sandhill lackeys.”  One forlorn, chill, and 
fever-freckled creature, yellow, dirty, and dry as a nut, was 
selling peaches at ten cents a dozen. Soldiers collected 
around her cart. She took the cover off and cried, “Eat 
away. Eat your fill. I never charge our soldiers anything.” 
They tried to make her take pay, but when she steadily 
refused it, they cheered her madly and said: “Sleep in peace. 
Now we will fight for you and keep off the Yankees.” 
Another poor Sandhill man refused to sell his cows, and 
gave them to the hospital.</p>

        <p>FLAT ROCK, N. C., <hi rend="italics">August 1,1862</hi>.—Being ill I left 
Mrs. McMahan's for Flat Rock.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref91" n="91" rend="sc" target="note91">1</ref> It was very hot and 
disagreeable for an invalid in a boarding-house in that 
climate. The La Bordes and the McCord girls came part of 
the way with me.</p>
        <p>The cars were crowded and a lame soldier had to stand, 
leaning on his crutches in the thoroughfare that runs between 
the seats. One of us gave him our seat. You may depend 
upon it there was no trouble in finding a seat for our party 
after that. Dr. La Borde quoted a classic anecdote. In some 
Greek assembly an old man was left standing. A Spartan 
gave him his seat. The Athenians cheered madly, though 
they had kept their seats. The comment was, 
“Lacedemonians practice virtue; Athenians know how to 
admire it.”</p>
        <p>Nathan Davis happened accidentally to be at the station 
at Greenville. He took immediate charge of Molly and 
myself, for my party had dwindled to us two. He went with 
us to the hotel, sent for the landlord, told him who I was, 
secured good rooms for us and saw that we were made

low countries of the South before the war. Many attractive houses had 
been built there. It lies in the region which has since become famous 
as the Asheville region, and in which stands Biltmore.</note>
<pb id="mches211" n="211"/>
comfortable in every way. At dinner I entered that immense 
dining-room alone, but I saw friends and acquaintances on 
every side. My first exploit was to repeat to Mrs. Ives Mrs. 
Pickens's blunder in taking a suspicious attitude toward men 
born at the North, and calling upon General Cooper to 
agree with her. Martha Levy explained the grave faces of 
my auditors by saying that Colonel Ives was a New Yorker. 
My distress was dire.</p>
        <p>Louisa Hamilton was there. She told me that Captain 
George Cuthbert, with his arm in a sling from a wound by 
no means healed, was going to risk the shaking of a 
stagecoach; he was on his way to his cousin, William 
Cuthbert's, at Flat Rock. Now George Cuthbert is a type of 
the finest kind of Southern soldier. We can not make them 
any better than he is. Before the war I knew him; he traveled 
in Europe with my sister, Kate, and Mary Withers. At once 
I offered him a seat in the comfortable hack Nathan Davis 
had engaged for me.</p>
        <p>Molly sat opposite to me, and often when I was tired 
held my feet in her lap. Captain Cuthbert's man sat with the 
driver. We had ample room. We were a dilapidated 
company. I was so ill I could barely sit up, and Captain 
Cuthbert could not use his right hand or arm at all. I had to 
draw his match, light his cigar, etc. He was very quiet, 
grateful, gentle, and, I was going to say, docile. He is a fiery 
soldier, one of those whose whole face becomes transfigured 
in battle, so one of his men told me, describing his way with 
his company. He does not blow his own trumpet, but I made 
him tell me the story of his duel with the Mercury's reporter. 
He seemed awfully ashamed of wasting time in such a 
scrape.</p>
        <p>That night we stopped at a country house half-way 
toward our journey's end. There we met Mr. Charles 
Lowndes. Rawlins Lowndes, his son, is with Wade 
Hampton.</p>
        <p>First we drove, by mistake, into Judge King's yard, our
<pb id="mches212" n="212"/>
hackman mistaking the place for the hotel. Then we made 
Farmer's Hotel (as the seafaring men say).</p>
        <p>Burnet Rhett, with his steed, was at the door; horse and 
man were caparisoned with as much red and gold artillery 
uniform as they could bear. He held his horse. The stirrups 
were Mexican, I believe; they looked like little sidesaddles. 
Seeing his friend and crony, George Cuthbert, alight and 
leave a veiled lady in the carriage, this handsome and 
undismayed young artillerist walked round and round the 
carriage, talked with the driver, looked in at the doors, and 
at the front. Suddenly I bethought me to raise my veil and 
satisfy his curiosity. Our eyes met, and I smiled. It was 
impossible to resist the comic disappointment on his face 
when a woman old enough to be George Cuthbert's mother, 
with the ravages of a year of gastric fever, almost fainting 
with fatigue, greeted his vision. He instantly mounted his 
gallant steed and pranced away to his <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">fiancée</hi></foreign>. He is to 
marry the greatest heiress in the State, Miss Aiken. Then 
Captain Cuthbert told me his name.</p>
        <p>At Kate's, I found Sally Rutledge, and then for weeks life 
was a blank; I remember nothing. The illness which had 
been creeping on for so long a time took me by the throat. At 
Greenville I had met many friends. I witnessed the wooing 
of Barny Heyward, once the husband of the lovely Lucy 
Izard, now a widower and a <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">bon parti</hi></foreign>. He was there nursing 
Joe, his brother. So was the beautiful Henrietta Magruder 
Heyward, now a widow, for poor Joe died. There is 
something magnetic in Tatty Clinch's large and lustrous 
black eyes. No man has ever resisted their influence. She 
says her virgin heart has never beat one throb the faster for 
any mortal here below—until now, when it surrenders to 
Barny. Well, as I said, Joseph Heyward died, and rapidly 
did the bereaved beauty shake the dust of this poor 
Confederacy from her feet and plume her wings for flight 
across the water.</p>
        <pb id="mches213" n="213"/>
        <p>[Let me insert here now, much later, all I know of that 
brave spirit, George Cuthbert. While I was living in the 
winter of 1863 at the corner of Clay and Twelfth Streets in 
Richmond, he came to see me. Never did man enjoy life 
more. The Preston girls were staying at my house then, and 
it was very gay for the young soldiers who ran down from 
the army for a day or so. We had heard of him, as usual, 
gallantly facing odds at Sharpsburg.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref92" n="92" rend="sc" target="note92">1</ref> And he asked if he 
should chance to be wounded would I have him brought to 
Clay Street.</p>
        <p>He was shot at Chancellorsville,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref93" n="93" rend="sc" target="note93">2</ref> leading his men. The 
surgeon did not think him mortally wounded. He sent me a 
message that “he was coming at once to our house.” He 
knew he would soon get well there. Also that  “I need not be 
alarmed; those Yankees could not kill me.”  He asked one of 
his friends to write a letter to his mother. Afterward he said 
he had another letter to write, but that he wished to sleep 
first, he felt so exhausted. At his request they then turned his 
face away from the light and left him. When they came 
again to look at him, they found him dead. He had been 
dead for a long time. It was bitter cold; wounded men lost 
much blood and were weakened in  that way; they lacked 
warm blankets and all comforts. Many died who might have 
been saved by one good hot drink or a few mouthfuls of 
nourishing food.</p>
        <p>One of the generals said to me: “Fire and reckless courage 
like Captain Cuthbert's are contagious; such men in an

war, was fought in western Maryland, a few miles north of Harper's Ferry,

Confederates under Lee.</note>
<note id="note93" n="93" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref93">2.  The battle of Chancellorsville, where the losses on each side were more

under Hooker. In this battle Stonewall Jackson was killed.</note>

        <p><hi rend="italics">August 8th</hi>.—Mr. Daniel Blake drove down to my sister's 
in his heavy, substantial English phaeton, with stout and 
strong horses to match. I went back with him and spent two 
delightful days at his hospitable mansion. I met there, as a 
sort of chaplain, the Rev. Mr.—. He dealt unfairly by me. 
We had a long argument, and when we knelt down for 
evening prayers, he introduced an extemporaneous prayer 
and prayed <hi rend="italics">for me</hi> most palpably. There was I down on my 
knees, red-hot with rage and fury. David W. said it was a 
clear case of hitting a fellow when he was down. Afterward 
the fun of it all struck me, and I found it difficult to keep 
from shaking with laughter. It was not an edifying religious 
exercise, to say the least, as far as I was concerned.</p>
        <p>Before Chancellorsville, was fatal Sharpsburg.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref94" n="94" rend="sc" target="note94">1</ref> My 
friend, Colonel Means, killed on the battle-field; his only 
son, Stark, wounded and a prisoner. His wife had not 
recovered from the death of her other child, Emma, who had 
died of consumption early in the war. She was lying on a 
bed when they told her of her husband's death, and then they 
tried to keep Stark's condition from her. They think now that 
she misunderstood and believed him dead, too. She threw 
something over her face. She did not utter one word. She 
remained quiet so long, some one removed the light shawl 
which she had thrown over her head and found

she was dead. Miss Mary Stark, her sister, said afterward,   
“No wonder! How was she to face life without her husband 
and children? That was all she had ever lived for.”  These 
are sad, unfortunate memories. Let us run away from them.</p>
        <p>What has not my husband been doing this year, 1862, 
when all our South Carolina troops are in Virginia? Here we 
were without soldiers or arms. He raised an army, so to 
speak, and imported arms, through the Trenholm firm. He 
had arms to sell to the Confederacy. He laid the foundation 
of a niter-bed; and the Confederacy sent to Columbia to 
learn of Professor Le Conte how to begin theirs. He bought 
up all the old arms and had them altered and repaired. He 
built ships. He imported clothes and shoes for our soldiers, 
for which things they had long stood sorely in need. He 
imported cotton cards and set all idle hands carding and 
weaving. All the world was set to spinning cotton. He tried 
to stop the sale of whisky, and alas, he called for 
reserves—that is, men over age, and he committed the 
unforgivable offense of sending the sacred negro property to 
work on fortifications away from their owners' plantations.</p>

home on the plantation near here—where I have come to see 
her. But to go back first to my trip home from Flat Rock to 
Camden. At the station, I saw men sitting on a row of 
coffins smoking, talking, and laughing, with their feet 
drawn up tailor-fashion to keep them out of the wet. Thus 
does war harden people's hearts.</p>
        <p>Met James Chesnut at Wilmington. He only crossed the 
river with me and then went back to Richmond. He was 
violently opposed to sending our troops into Pennsylvania: 
wanted all we could spare sent West to make an end there of 
our enemies. He kept dark about Vallandigham.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref95" n="95" rend="sc" target="note95">1</ref> I am sure 
we could not trust him to do us any good, or to do the 
Yankees any harm. The Coriolanus business is played out.</p>
        <p>As we came to Camden, Molly sat by me in the cars. 
She touched me, and, with her nose in the air, said: “Look, 
Missis.”  There was the inevitable bride and groom—at least 
so  I thought—and the irrepressible kissing and lolling 
against each other which I had seen so often before. I was 
rather astonished at Molly's prudery. but there was a touch

the extreme wing of Northern sympathizers with the South. He was arrested 
by United States troops in May, 1863, court-martialed and banished to the 
Confederacy. Not being well received in the South, he went to Canada, but 
after the war returned to Ohio.</note>
<pb id="mches217" n="217"/>
in this scene which was new. The man required for his peace 
of mind that the girl should brush his cheek with those 
beautiful long eyelashes of hers. Molly became so outraged 
in her blue-black modesty that she kept her head out of the 
window not to see! When we were detained at a little 
wayside station, this woman made an awful row about her 
room. She seemed to know me and appealed to me; said her 
brother-in-law was adjutant to Colonel K— , etc.</p>
        <p>Molly observed, “You had better go yonder, ma'am, 
where your husband is calling you.” The woman drew 
herself up proudly, and, with a toss, exclaimed: “Husband, 
indeed! I'm a widow. That is my cousin. I loved my dear 
husband too well to marry again, ever, ever!” Absolutely 
tears came into her eyes. Molly, loaded as she was with 
shawls and bundles, stood motionless, and said: “After all 
that gwine-on in the kyars! O, Lord, I should a let it go 
'twas my husband and me! nigger as I am.”</p>
        <p>Here I was at home, on a soft bed, with every physical 
comfort; but life is one long catechism there, due to the 
curiosity of stay-at-home people in a narrow world.</p>
        <p>In Richmond, Molly and Lawrence quarreled. He 
declared he could not put up with her tantrums. 
Unfortunately I asked him, in the interests of peace and a 
quiet house, to bear with her temper; I did, said I, but she 
was so good and useful. He was shabby enough to tell her 
what I had said at their next quarrel. The awful reproaches 
she overwhelmed me with then!  She said she “was 
mortified that I had humbled her before  Lawrence.”</p>
        <p>But the day of her revenge came. At negro balls in 
Richmond, guests were required to carry “passes,” and, in 
changing his coat Lawrence forgot his pass. Next day 
Lawrence was missing, and Molly came to me laughing to 
tears. “Come and look,” said she. “Here is the fine 
gentleman tied between two black niggers and marched off 
to jail.” She laughed and jeered so she could not stand 
without holding on to the window. Lawrence disregarded her 
<pb id="mches218" n="218"/>
and called to me at the top of his voice: “Please, ma'am, 
ask Mars Jeems to come take me out of this. I ain't done  
nothin'.”</p>
        <p>As soon as Mr. Chesnut came home I told him of 
Lawrence's sad fall, and he went at once to his rescue. There 
had been a fight and a disturbance at the ball. The police 
had been called in, and when every negro was required to 
show his “pass,” Lawrence had been taken up as having 
none. He was terribly chopfallen when he came home 
walking behind Mr. Chesnut. He is always so respectable 
and well-behaved and stands on his dignity.</p>
        <p>I went over to Mrs. Preston's at Columbia. Camden had 
become simply intolerable to me. There the telegram found 
me, saying I must go to my mother, who was ill at her home 
here in Alabama. Colonel Goodwyn, his wife, and two 
daughters were going, and so I joined the party. I 
telegraphed Mr. Chesnut for Lawrence, and he replied, 
forbidding me to go at all; it was so hot, the cars so 
disagreeable, fever would be the inevitable result. Miss Kate 
Hampton, in her soft voice, said: “The only trouble in life is 
when one can't decide in which way duty leads. Once know 
your duty, then all is easy.”</p>
        <p>I do not know whether she thought it my duty to obey my 
husband. But I thought it my duty to go to my mother, as I 
risked nothing but myself.</p>
        <p>We had two days of an exciting drama under our very 
noses, before our eyes. A party had come to Columbia who 
said they had run the blockade, had come in by flag of truce, 
etc. Colonel Goodwyn asked me to look around and see if I 
could pick out the suspected crew. It was easily done. We 
were all in a sadly molting condition. We had come to the 
end of our good clothes in three years, and now our only 
resource was to turn them upside down, or inside out, and in 
mending, darning, patching, etc.</p>
        <p>Near me on the train to Alabama sat a young woman in 
a traveling dress of bright yellow; she wore a profusion 
<pb id="mches219" n="219"/>
of curls, had pink cheeks, was delightfully airy and easy in 
her manner, and was absorbed in a flirtation with a 
Confederate major, who, in spite of his nice, new gray 
uniform and two stars, had a very Yankee face, fresh, 
clean-cut, sharp, utterly unsunburned, florid, wholesome, 
handsome. What more in compliment can one say of one's 
enemies? Two other women faced this man and woman, and 
we knew them to be newcomers by their good clothes. One 
of these women was a German. She it was who had betrayed 
them. I found that out afterward.</p>
        <p>The handsomest of the three women had a hard, Northern 
face, but all were in splendid array as to feathers, flowers, 
lace, and jewelry. If they were spies why were they so 
foolish as to brag of New York, and compare us 
unfavorably with the other side all the time, and in loud, 
shrill accents?  Surely that was not the way to pass 
unnoticed in the Confederacy.</p>
        <p>A man came in, stood up, and read from a paper, “The 
surrender of Vicksburg.”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref96" n="96" rend="sc" target="note96">1</ref>   I felt as if I had been struck a 
hard blow on the top of my head, and my heart took one of 
its queer turns. I was utterly unconscious: not long, I dare 
say. The first thing I heard was exclamations of joy and 
exultation from the overdressed party. My rage and 
humiliation were great. A man within earshot of this party 
had slept through everything. He had a greyhound face, 
eager and inquisitive when awake, but now he was as one of 
the seven sleepers.</p>
        <p>Colonel Goodwyn wrote on a blank page of my book 
(one of De Quincey's—the note is there now), that the sleeper 
was a Richmond detective.</p>
        <note id="note96" n="96" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref96">1. Vicksburg surrendered on July 4, 1863. Since the close of 1862, it 
had again and again been assaulted by Grant and Sherman. It was commanded 
by Johnston and Pemberton, Pemberton being in command at the time of the 
surrender. John C. Pemberton was a native of Philadelphia, a graduate of 
West Point, and had served in the Mexican War.</note>
        <pb id="mches220" n="220"/>
        <p>Finally, hot and tired out, we arrived at West Point, on 
the Chattahoochee River. The dusty cars were quite still, 
except for the giggling flirtation of the yellow gown and her 
major. Two Confederate officers walked in. I felt mischief in 
the air. One touched the smart major, who was whispering 
to Yellow Gown. The major turned quickly. Instantly, every 
drop of blood left his face; a spasm seized his throat; it was 
a piteous sight. And at once I was awfully sorry for him. He 
was marched out of the car. Poor Yellow Gown's color was 
fast, but the whites of her eyes were lurid. Of the three 
women spies we never heard again. They never do anything 
worse to women, the high-minded Confederates, than send 
them out of the country. But when we read soon afterward 
of the execution of a male spy, we thought of the “major.”</p>
        <p>At Montgomery the boat waited for us, and in my haste I 
tumbled out of the omnibus with Dr. Robert Johnson's 
assistance, but nearly broke my neck. The thermometer was 
high up in the nineties, and they gave me a stateroom over 
the boiler. I paid out my Confederate rags of money freely 
to the maid in order to get out of that oven. Surely, go where 
we may hereafter, an Alabama steamer in August lying 
under the bluff with the sun looking down, will give one a 
foretaste, almost an adequate idea, of what's to come, as far 
as heat goes. The planks of the floor burned one's feet under 
the bluff at Selma, where we stayed nearly all day—I do not 
know why.</p>
        <p>Met James Boykin, who had lost 1,200 bales of cotton at 
Vicksburg, and charged it all to Jeff Davis in his wrath, 
which did not seem exactly reasonable to me. At Portland 
there was a horse for James Boykin, and he rode away, 
promising to have a carriage sent for me at once. But he had 
to go seven miles on horseback before he reached my sister 
Sally's, and then Sally was to send back. On that lonely 
riverside  Molly and I remained with dismal swamps on 
every side, and immense plantations, the white people 
<pb id="mches221" n="221"/>
few or none. In my heart I knew my husband was right 
when he forbade me to undertake this journey.</p>
        <p>There was one living thing at this little riverside inn- a 
white man who had a store opposite, and oh, how drunk he 
was! Hot as it was, Molly kept up a fire of pine knots. 
There was neither lamp nor candle in that deserted house. 
The drunken man reeled over now and then, lantern in hand; 
he would stand with his idiotic, drunken glare, or go 
solemnly staggering round us, but always bowing in his 
politeness. He nearly fell over us, but I sprang out of his 
way as he asked, “Well, madam, what can I do for you?”</p>
        <p>Shall I ever forget the headache of that night and the 
fright, My temples throbbed with dumb misery. I sat upon a 
chair, Molly on the floor, with her head resting against my 
chair. She was as near as she could get to me, and I kept my 
hand on her. “Missis,” said she, “now I do believe you are 
scared, scared of that poor, drunken thing. If he was sober I 
could whip him in a fair fight, and drunk as he is I kin throw 
him over the banister, ef he so much as teches you. I don't 
value him a button!”</p>
        <p>Taking heart from such brave words I laughed. It seemed 
an eternity, but the carriage came by ten o'clock, and then, 
with the coachman as our sole protector, we poor women 
drove eight miles or more over a carriage road, through long 
lanes, swamps of pitchy darkness, with plantations on every 
side.</p>
        <p>The house, as we drew near, looked like a graveyard in a 
nightmare, so vague and phantom-like were its outlines.</p>
        <p>I found my mother ill in bed, feeble still, but better than I 
hoped to see her. “I knew you would come,” was her 
greeting, with outstretched hands. Then I went to bed in that 
silent house, a house of the dead it seemed. I supposed I was 
not to see my sister until the next day. But she came in 
some time after I had gone to bed. She kissed me quietly, 
without a tear. She was thin and pale, but her voice was 
calm and kind.</p>
        <pb id="mches222" n="222"/>
        <p>As she lifted the candle over her head, to show me 
something on the wall, I saw that her pretty brown hair was 
white. It was awfully hard not to burst out into violent 
weeping. She looked so sweet, and yet so utterly 
brokenhearted. But as she was without emotion, apparently, 
it would not become me to upset her by my tears.</p>
        <p>Next day, at noon, Hetty, mother's old maid, brought my 
breakfast to my bedside. Such a breakfast it was! 
Delmonico could do no better. “It is ever so late, I know,”  to 
which Hetty replied: “Yes, we would not let Molly wake 
you.”  “What a splendid cook you have here.”  “My 
daughter, Tenah, is Miss Sally's cook. She's well enough as 
times go, but when our Miss Mary comes to see us I does it 
myself,” and she courtesied down to the floor. “Bless your 
old soul,”  I cried, and she rushed over and gave me a good 
hug.</p>
        <p>She is my mother's factotum; has been her maid since 
she was six years old, when she was bought from a Virginia 
speculator along with her own mother and all her brothers 
and sisters. She has been pampered until she is a rare old 
tyrant at times. She can do everything better than any one 
else, and my mother leans on her heavily. Hetty is Dick's 
wife; Dick is the butler. They have over a dozen children 
and take life very easily.</p>
        <p>Sally came in before I was out of bed, and began at once 
in the same stony way, pale and cold as ice, to tell me of the 
death of her children. It had happened not two weeks before. 
Her eyes were utterly without life; no expression whatever, 
and in a composed and sad sort of manner she told the tale 
as if it were something she had read and wanted me to 
hear:</p>
        <p>“My eldest daughter, Mary, had grown up to be a lovely 
girl. She  was between thirteen and fourteen, you know. 
Baby Kate  had my sister's gray eyes; she was evidently to 
be the beauty of the family. Strange it is that here was one 
of my children who has lived and has gone and you
<pb id="mches223" n="223"/>
have never seen her at all. She died first, and I would not go 
to the funeral. I thought it would kill me to see her put under 
the ground. I was lying down, stupid with grief when Aunt 
Charlotte came to me after the funeral with this news:          
‘Mary has that awful disease, too.’  There was nothing to 
say. I got up and dressed instantly and went to Mary. I did 
not leave her side again in that long struggle between life 
and death. I did everything for her with my own hands. I 
even prepared my darling for the grave. I went to her 
funeral, and I came home and walked straight to my mother 
and I begged her to be comforted; I would bear it all without 
one word if God would only spare me  the one child left me 
now.”</p>
        <p>Sally has never shed a tear, but has grown twenty years 
older, cold, hard, careworn. With the same rigidity of 
manner, she began to go over all the details of Mary's 
illness. “I had not given up hope, no, not at all. As I sat by 
her side, she said: ‘Mamma, put your hand on my knees; 
they are so cold.’  I put my hand on her knee; the cold struck 
to my heart. I knew it was the coldness of death.”  Sally put 
out her hand on me, and it seemed to recall the feeling. She 
fell forward in an agony of weeping that lasted for hours. 
The doctor said this reaction was a blessing; without it she 
must have died or gone mad.</p>
        <p>While the mother was so bitterly weeping, the little girl, 
the last of them, a bright child of three or four, crawled into 
my bed. “Now, Auntie,” she whispered, “I want to tell you 
all about Mamie and Katie, but they watch me so. They say 
I must never talk about them. Katie died because she ate 
blackberries, I know that, and then Aunt Charlotte read 
Mamie a letter and that made her die, too. Maum Hetty says 
they have gone to God, but I know the people saved a place 
between them in the ground for me.”</p>
        <p>Uncle William was in despair at the low ebb of 
patriotism out here. “West of the Savannah River,” said he,
<pb id="mches224" n="224"/>
“it is property first, life next, honor last.” He gave me an 
excellent pair of shoes. What a gift! For more than a year I 
have had none but some dreadful things Armstead makes for 
me, and they hurt my feet so. These do not fit, but that is 
nothing; they are large enough and do not pinch anywhere. I 
have absolutely a respectable pair of shoes!!</p>
        <p>Uncle William says the men who went into the war to 
save their negroes are abjectly wretched. Neither side now 
cares a fig for these beloved negroes, and would send them 
all to heaven in a hand-basket, as Custis Lee says, to win in 
the fight.</p>
        <p>General Lee and Mr. Davis want the negroes put into the 
army. Mr. Chesnut and Major Venable discussed the subject 
one night, but would they fight on our side or desert to the 
enemy? They don't go to the enemy, because they are 
comfortable as they are, and expect to be free anyway.</p>
        <p>When we were children our nurses used to give us tea 
out in the open air on little pine tables scrubbed as clean as 
milk-pails. Sometimes, as Dick would pass us, with his slow 
and consequential step, we would call out, “Do, Dick, come 
and wait on us.”  “No, little missies, I never wait on pine 
tables. Wait till you get big enough to put your legs under 
your pa's mahogany.”</p>
        <p>I taught him to read as soon as I could read myself, 
perched on his knife-board. He won't look at me now; but 
looks over my head, scenting freedom in the air. He was 
always very ambitious. I do not think he ever troubled 
himself much about books. But then, as my father said, 
Dick, standing in front of his sideboard, has heard all 
subjects in earth or heaven discussed, and by the best heads 
in our world. He is proud, too, in his way. Hetty, his wife, 
complained that the other men servants looked finer in their 
livery. “Nonsense, old woman, a butler never demeans 
himself to wear livery. He is always in plain clothes.” 
Somewhere he had picked that up.</p>
        <pb id="mches225" n="225"/>
        <p>He is the first negro in whom I have felt a change. 
Others go about in their black masks, not a ripple or an 
emotion showing, and yet on all other subjects except the 
war they are the most excitable of all races. Now Dick 
might make a very respectable Egyptian Sphinx, so 
inscrutably silent is he. He did deign to inquire about 
General Richard Anderson. “He was my young master 
once,”  said he. “I always will like him better than anybody 
else.”</p>
        <p>When Dick married Hetty, the Anderson house was next 
door. The two families agreed to sell either Dick or Hetty, 
whichever consented to be sold. Hetty refused outright, and 
the Andersons sold Dick that he might be with his wife. This 
was magnanimous on the Andersons' part, for Hetty was 
only a lady's-maid and Dick was a trained butler, on whom 
Mrs. Anderson had spent no end of pains in his dining-room 
education, and, of course, if they had refused to sell Dick, 
Hetty would have had to go to them. Mrs. Anderson was 
very much disgusted with Dick's ingratitude when she found 
he was willing to leave them. As a butler he is a treasure; he 
is overwhelmed with dignity, but that does not interfere with 
his work at all.</p>
        <p>My father had a body-servant, Simon, who could imitate 
his master's voice perfectly. He would sometimes call out 
from the yard after my father had mounted his horse: “Dick, 
bring me my overcoat. I see you there, sir, hurry up.”  
When Dick hastened out, overcoat in hand, and only Simon 
was visible, after several obsequious “Yes, marster; just as 
marster pleases,” my mother had always to step out and 
prevent a fight. Dick never forgave her laughing.</p>
        <p>Once in Sumter, when my father was very busy 
preparing a law case, the mob in the street annoyed him, and 
he grumbled about it as Simon was making up his fire. 
Suddenly he heard, as it were, himself speaking, “the Hon. 
S. D. Miller—Lawyer Miller,” as the colored gentleman 
announced himself in the dark—appeal to the gentlemen 
<pb id="mches226" n="226"/>
outside to go away and leave a lawyer in peace to prepare 
his case for the next day. My father said he could have 
sworn the sound was that of his own voice. The crowd 
dispersed, but some noisy negroes came along, and upon 
them Simon rushed with the sulky whip, slashing around in 
the dark, calling himself “Lawyer Miller,” who was 
determined to have peace.</p>
        <p>Simon returned, complaining that “them niggers run so 
he never got in a hundred yards of one of them.”</p>
        <p>At Portland, we met a man who said: “Is it not strange 
that in this poor, devoted land of ours, there are some men 
who are making money by blockade-running, cheating our 
embarrassed government, and skulking the fight?”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Montgomery, July 30th</hi>.—Coming on here from Portland 
there was no stateroom for me. My mother alone had one. 
My aunt and I sat nodding in armchairs, for the doors and 
sofas were covered with sleepers, too. On the floor that 
night, so hot that even a little covering of clothes could not 
be borne, lay a motley crew. Black, white, and yellow 
disported themselves in promiscuous array. Children and 
their nurses, bared to the view, were wrapped in the 
profoundest slumber. No caste prejudices were here. Neither 
Garrison, John Brown, nor Gerrit Smith ever dreamed of 
equality more untrammeled. A crow-black, enormously fat 
negro man waddled in every now and then to look after the 
lamps. The atmosphere of that cabin was stifling, and the 
sight of those figures on the floor did not make it more 
tolerable. So we soon escaped and sat out near the guards.</p>
        <p>The next day was the very hottest I have ever known. 
One supreme consolation was the watermelons, the very 
finest, and the ice. A very handsome woman, whom I did not 
know, rehearsed all our disasters in the field. And then, as if 
she held me responsible, she faced me furiously,  “And 
where are our big men?”   “Whom do you mean?”   “I 
<pb id="mches227" n="227"/>
mean our leaders, the men we have a right to look to to save 
us. They got us into this scrape. Let them get us out of it. 
Where are our big men?” I sympathized with her and 
understood her, but I answered lightly, “I do not know the 
exact size you want them.”</p>
        <p>Here in Montgomery, we have been so hospitably 
received.  Ye gods! how those women talked! and all at the 
same time! They put me under the care of General Dick 
Taylor's brother-in-law, a Mr. Gordon, who married one of 
the Beranges. A very pleasant arrangement it was for me. 
He was kind and attentive and vastly agreeable with his 
New Orleans anecdotes. On the first of last January all his 
servants left him but four. To these faithful few he gave free 
papers at once, that they might lose naught by loyalty 
should the Confederates come into authority once more. He 
paid high wages and things worked smoothly for some 
weeks. One day his wife saw some Yankee officers' cards on 
a table, and said to her maid, “I did not know any of these 
people had called?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, Missis!” the maid replied, “they come to see me, 
and I have been waiting to tell you. It is too hard! I can not 
do it! I can not dance with those nice gentlemen at night at 
our Union Balls and then come here and be your servant 
the next day. I can't!”  “So,” said Mr. Gordon, “freedom 
must be followed by fraternity and equality.”  One by one 
the faithful few slipped away and the family were left to 
their own devices. Why not?</p>
        <p>When General Dick Taylor's place was sacked his 
negroes moved down to Algiers, a village near New Orleans. 
An old woman came to Mr. Gordon to say that these 
negroes wanted him to get word to “Mars Dick” that they 
were dying of disease and starvation; thirty had died that 
day. Dick Taylor's help being out of the question, Mr. 
Gordon applied to a Federal officer. He found this one not a 
philanthropist, but a cynic, who said: “All right; it is 
working out as I expected. Improve negroes and Indians 
<pb id="mches228" n="228"/>
off the continent. Their strong men we put in the army. The 
rest will disappear.”</p>
        <p>Joe Johnston can sulk. As he is sent West, he says,         
“They may give Lee the army Joe Johnston trained.”   Lee 
is reaping where he sowed, he thinks, but then he was 
backing straight through Richmond when they stopped his 
retreating.</p>

        <p>RICHMOND, Va.,  <hi rend="italics">August 10, 1863</hi>.—To-day I had
letter from my sister, who wrote to inquire about her old 
playmate, friend, and lover, Boykin McCaa. It is nearly 
twenty years since each was married; each now has children 
nearly grown. “To tell the truth,” she writes “in these last 
dreadful years, with David in Florida, where I can not often 
hear from him, and everything dismal, anxious, and 
disquieting, I had almost forgotten Boykin's existence, but 
he came here last night; he stood by my bedside and spoke to 
me kindly and affectionately, as if we had just parted. I said, 
holding out my hand, ‘Boykin, you are very pale’  He 
answered, ‘I have come to tell you good by,’ and then seized 
both my hands. His own hands were as cold and hard as ice; 
they froze the marrow of my bones. I screamed again and 
again until my whole household came rushing in, and then 
came the negroes from the yard, all wakened by my piercing 
shrieks. This may have been a dream, but it haunts me.</p>
        <p>“Some one sent me an old paper with an account of his 
wounds and his recovery, but I know he is dead.”  “Stop!” 
said my husband at this point, and then he read from that 
day's Examiner these words: “Captain Burwell Boykin 
McCaa found dead upon the battle-field leading a cavalry 
charge at the head of his company. He was shot through the 
head.”</p>
        <p>The famous colonel of the Fourth Texas, by name John
<pb id="mches230" n="230"/>
Bell Hood,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref97" n="97" rend="sc" target="note97">1</ref> is here—him we call Sam, because his 
classmates at West Point did so—for what cause is not 
known. John Darby asked if he might bring his hero to us; 
bragged of him extensively; said he had won his three 
stars, etc., under Stonewall's eye, and that he was 
promoted by Stonewall's request. When Hood came with 
his sad Quixote face, the face of an old Crusader, who 
believed in his cause, his cross, and his crown, we were 
not prepared for such a man as a beau-ideal of the wild 
Texans. He is tall, thin, and shy; has blue eyes and light 
hair; a tawny beard, and a vast amount of it, covering the 
lower part of his face, the whole appearance that of 
awkward strength. Some one said that his great reserve of 
manner he carried only into the society of ladies. Major 
Venable added that he had often heard of the light of 
battle shining in a man's eyes. He had seen it once—when 
he carried to Hood orders from Lee, and found in the 
hottest of the fight that the man was transfigured. The 
fierce light of Hood's eyes I can never forget.</p>
        <p>Hood came to ask us to a picnic next day at Drury's 
Bluff.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref98" n="98" rend="sc" target="note98">2</ref> The naval heroes were to receive us and then we were 
to drive out to the Texan camp. We accused John Darby of 
having instigated this unlooked-for festivity. We were to 
have bands of music and dances, with turkeys, chickens, and 
buffalo tongues to eat. Next morning, just as my foot was on 
the carriage-step, the girls standing behind ready to follow 
me with Johnny and the Infant Samuel (Captain Shannon by 
proper name), up rode John Darby in red-hot haste, threw 
his bridle to one of the men who was holding the horses, and 
came toward us rapidly, clanking his cavalry spurs with a 
despairing sound as he

cried: “Stop! it's all up. We are ordered  back to the 
Rappahannock. The brigade is marching through Richmond 
now.” So we unpacked and unloaded, dismissed the hacks 
and sat down with a sigh.</p>
        <p>“Suppose we go and see them pass the turnpike,” some 
one said. The suggestion was hailed with delight, and off we 
marched. Johnny and the Infant were in citizens' clothes, and 
the Straggler—as Hood calls John Darby, since the Prestons 
have been in Richmond—was all plaided and plumed in his 
surgeon's array. He never bated an inch of bullion or a 
feather; he was courting and he stalked ahead with Mary 
Preston, Buck, and Johnny. The Infant and myself, both 
stout and scant of breath, lagged last. They called back to 
us, as the Infant came toddling along, “Hurry up or we will 
leave you.”</p>
        <p>At the turnpike we stood on the sidewalk and saw ten 
thousand men march by. We had seen nothing like this 
before. Hitherto we had seen only regiments marching spick 
and span in their fresh, smart clothes, just from home and 
on their way to the army. Such rags and tags as we saw 
now. Nothing was like anything else. Most garments and 
arms were such as had been taken from the enemy. Such 
shoes as they had on. “Oh, our brave boys!” moaned Buck. 
Such tin pans and pots as were tied to their waists, with 
bread or bacon stuck on the ends of their bayonets. 
Anything that could be spiked was bayoneted and held aloft.</p>
        <p>They did not seem to mind their shabby condition; they 
laughed, shouted, and cheered as they marched by. Not a 
disrespectful or light word was spoken, but they went for the 
men who were huddled behind us, and who seemed to be 
trying to make themselves as small as possible in order to 
escape observation.</p>
        <p>Hood and his staff finally came galloping up, dismounted, 
and joined us. Mary Preston gave him a bouquet. Thereupon 
he unwrapped a Bible, which he carried  in his 
<pb id="mches232" n="232"/>
pocket. He said his mother had given it to him. He pressed a 
flower in it. Mary Preston suggested that he had not worn or 
used it at all, being fresh, new, and beautifully kept. Every 
word of this the Texans heard as they marched by, almost 
touching us. They laughed and joked and made their own 
rough comments.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">September 7th</hi>.—Major Edward Johnston did not get into 
the Confederacy until after the first battle of Manassas. For 
some cause, before he could evade that potentate, Seward 
rang his little bell and sent him to a prison in the harbor of 
New York. I forget whether he was exchanged or escaped of 
his own motion. The next thing I heard of my antebellum 
friend he had defeated Milroy in Western Virginia. There 
were so many Johnstons that for this victory they named 
him Alleghany Johnston.</p>
        <p>He had an odd habit of falling into a state of incessant 
winking as soon as he became the least startled or agitated. 
In such times he seemed persistently to be winking one eye 
at you. He meant nothing by it, and in point of fact did not 
know himself that he was doing it. In Mexico he had been 
wounded in the eye, and the nerve vibrates independently of 
his will. During the winter of 1862 and 1863 he was on 
crutches. After a while he hobbled down Franklin Street 
with us, we proud to accommodate our pace to that of the 
wounded general. His ankle continued stiff; so when he sat 
down another chair had to be put before him. On this he 
stretched out his stiff leg, straight as a ramrod. At that time 
he was our only wounded knight, and the girls waited on 
him and made life pleasant for him.</p>
        <p>One night I listened to two love-tales at once, in a 
distracted state of mind between the two. William Porcher 
Miles, in a perfectly modulated voice, in cadenced accents 
and low tones, was narrating the happy end of his affair. He 
had been engaged to sweet little Bettie Bierne, and I gave 
him my congratulations with all my heart. It was a capital 
match, suitable in every way, good for her, and
<pb id="mches233" n="233"/>
good for him. I was deeply interested in Mr. Miles's story, 
but there was din and discord on the other hand; old 
Edward, our pet general, sat diagonally across the room 
with one leg straight out like a poker, wrapped in red carpet 
leggings, as red as a turkey-cock in the face. His head is 
strangely shaped, like a cone or an old-fashioned beehive; 
or, as Buck said, there are three tiers of it; it is like a pope's 
tiara.</p>
        <p>There he sat, with a loud voice and a thousand winks, 
making love to Mary P.  I make no excuse for listening. It 
was impossible not to hear him. I tried not to lose a word of 
Mr. Miles's idyl as the despair of the veteran was thundered 
into my other ear. I lent an ear to each conversationalist. 
Mary can not altogether control her voice, and her shrill 
screams of negation, “No, no, never,” etc., utterly failed to 
suppress her wounded lover's obstreperous asseverations of 
his undying affection for her.</p>
        <p>Buck said afterward: “We heard every word of it on 
our side of the room, even when Mamie shrieked to him 
that he was talking too loud. Now, Mamie,” said we 
afterward, “do you think it was kind to tell him he was 
forty if he was a day?”</p>
        <p>Strange to say, the pet general, Edward, rehabilitated 
his love in a day; at least two days after he was heard to 
say that he was “paying attentions now to his cousin, John 
Preston's second daughter; her name, Sally, but they called 
her Buck—Sally Buchanan Campbell Preston, a lovely 
girl.”  And with her he now drove, rode, and hobbled on his 
crutches, sent her his photograph, and in due time 
cannonaded her, from the same spot where he had courted 
Mary, with proposals to marry him. </p>
        <p>Buck was never so decided in her “Nos” as Mary.        
(“Not so loud, at least”—thus in amendment, says Buck, 
who always reads what I have written, and makes 
comments of assent or dissent.) So again he began to 
thunder in a woman's ears his tender passion. As they rode 
down
<pb id="mches234" n="234"/>
Franklin Street, Buck says she knows the people on the 
sidewalk heard snatches of the conversation, though she 
rode as rapidly as she could, and she begged him not to talk 
so loud. Finally, they dashed up to our door as if they had 
been running a race. Unfortunate in love, but fortunate in 
war, our general is now winning new laurels with Ewell in 
the Valley or with the Army of the Potomac.</p>
        <p>I think I have told how Miles, still “so gently o'er me 
leaning,” told of his successful love while General Edward 
Johnston roared unto anguish and disappointment over his 
failures. Mr. Miles spoke of sweet little Bettie Bierne as if 
she had been a French girl, just from a convent, kept far 
from the haunts of men wholly for him. One would think to 
hear him that Bettie had never cast those innocent blue eyes 
of hers on a man until he came along.</p>
        <p>Now, since I first knew Miss Bierne in 1857, when Pat 
Calhoun was to the fore, she has been followed by a tale of 
men as long as a Highland chief's. Every summer at the 
Springs, their father appeared in the ballroom a little before 
twelve and chased the three beautiful Biernes home before 
him in spite of all entreaties, and he was said to frown 
away their too numerous admirers at all hours of the day.</p>
        <p>This new engagement was confided to me as a profound 
secret. Of course, I did not mention it, even to my own 
household. Next day little Alston, Morgan's adjutant, and 
George Deas called. As Colonel Deas removed his gloves, 
he said: “Oh! the Miles and Bierne sensation—have you 
heard of it,”  “No, what is the row about?”  “They are 
engaged to be married; that's all.”  “Who told you?”  
“Miles himself, as we walked down Franklin Street, this 
afternoon.”  “And did he not beg you not to mention it, as 
Bettie did not wish it spoken of?”  “God bless my soul, so 
he did. And I forgot that part entirely.”</p>
        <p>Colonel Alston begged the stout Carolinian not to take 
<pb id="mches235" n="235"/>
his inadvertent breach of faith too much to heart. Miss 
Bettie's engagement had caused him a dreadful night. A 
young man, who was his intimate friend, came to his room 
in the depths of despair and handed him a letter from Miss 
Bierne, which was the cause of all his woe. Not knowing 
that she was already betrothed to Miles, he had proposed to 
her in an eloquent letter. In her reply, she positively stated 
that she was engaged to Mr. Miles, and instead of thanking 
her for putting him at once out of his misery, he considered 
the reason she gave as trebly aggravating the agony of the 
love-letter and the refusal. “Too late!” he yelled, “by 
Jingo!”  So much for a secret.</p>
        <p>Miss Bierne and I became fast friends. Our friendship 
was based on a mutual admiration for the honorable 
member from South Carolina. Colonel and Mrs. Myers and 
Colonel and Mrs. Chesnut were the only friends of Mr. 
Miles who were invited to the wedding. At the church door 
the sexton demanded our credentials. No one but those 
whose names he held in his hand were allowed to enter. Not 
twenty people were present—a mere handful grouped about 
the altar in that large church.</p>
        <p>We were among the first to arrive. Then came a faint 
flutter and Mrs. Parkman (the bride's sister, swathed in 
weeds for her young husband, who had been killed within a 
year of her marriage) came rapidly up the aisle alone. She 
dropped upon her knees in the front pew, and there 
remained, motionless, during the whole ceremony, a mass of 
black crepe, and a dead weight on my heart. She has had 
experience of war. A cannonade around Richmond 
interrupted her marriage service—a sinister omen—and in a 
year thereafter her bridegroom was stiff and stark—dead 
upon the field of battle.</p>
        <p>While the wedding-march turned our thoughts from her 
and thrilled us with sympathy, the bride advanced in white 
satin and point d'Alençon. Mrs. Myers whispered that it was 
Mrs. Parkman's wedding-dress that the bride had on.
		
<pb id="mches236" n="236"/>
She remembered the exquisite lace, and she shuddered with 
superstitious forebodings.</p>
        <p>All had been going on delightfully in-doors, but a sharp 
shower cleared the church porch of the curious; and, as the 
water splashed, we wondered how we were to assemble 
ourselves at Mrs. McFarland's.  All the horses in Richmond 
had been impressed for some sudden cavalry necessity a few 
days before. I ran between Mr. McFarland and Senator 
Semmes with my pretty Paris rose-colored silk turned over 
my head to save it, and when we arrived at the hospitable 
mansion of the McFarlands, Mr. McFarland took me 
straight into the drawing-room, man-like, forgetting that my 
ruffled plumes needed a good smoothing and preening.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Lee sent for me. She was staying at Mrs. Caskie's. 
I was taken directly to her room, where she was lying on the 
bed. She said, before I had taken my seat:  “You know there 
is a fight going on now at Brandy Station?”<ref targOrder="U" id="ref99" n="99" rend="sc" target="note99">1</ref>   “Yes, we are 
anxious. John Chesnut's company is there, too.”  She spoke 
sadly, but quietly. “My son, Roony, is wounded; his 
brother has gone for him. They will soon be here and we 
shall know all about it unless Roony's wife takes him to her 
grandfather. Poor lame mother, I am useless to my 
children.”  Mrs. Caskie said: “You need not be alarmed. 
The General said in his telegram that it was not a severe 
wound. You know even Yankees believe General Lee.”</p>
        <p>That day, Mrs. Lee gave me a likeness of the General in 
a photograph taken soon after the Mexican War. She likes it 
so much better than the later ones. He certainly was a 
handsome  man then, handsomer even than now. I shall 
prize it for Mrs. Lee's sake, too. She said old Mrs. Chesnut 
and her aunt,  Nellie Custis (Mrs. Lewis) were very intimate 
during Washington's Administration in Philadelphia. I told 
her Mrs. Chesnut, senior, was the historical member
<note id="note99" n="99" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref99">1. The battle of Brandy Station, Va., occurred June 9, 1863.</note>
<pb id="mches237" n="237"/>
of our family; she had so much to tell of Revolutionary 
times. She was one of the “white-robed choir” of little 
maidens who scattered flowers before Washington at 
Trenton Bridge, which everybody who writes a life of 
Washington asks her to give an account of.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ould and Mrs. Davis came home with me. 
Lawrence had a basket of delicious cherries. “If there were 
only some ice,” said I. Respectfully Lawrence answered, 
and also firmly: “Give me money and you shall have ice.” 
By the underground telegraph he had heard of an ice-house 
over the river, though its fame was suppressed by certain 
Sybarites, as they wanted it all. In a wonderfully short time 
we had mint-juleps and sherry-cobblers.</p>
        <p>Altogether it has been a pleasant day, and as I sat alone 
I was laughing lightly now and then at the memory of some 
funny story. Suddenly, a violent ring; and a regular sheaf 
of telegrams were handed me. I could not have drawn away 
in more consternation if the sheets had been a nest of 
rattlesnakes. First, Frank Hampton was killed at Brandy 
Station. Wade Hampton telegraphed Mr. Chesnut to see 
Robert Barnwell, and make the necessary arrangements to 
recover the body. Mr. Chesnut is still at Wilmington. I sent 
for Preston Johnston, and my neighbor, Colonel Patton, 
offered to see that everything proper was done. That 
afternoon I walked out alone. Willie Mountford had shown 
me where the body, all that was left of Frank Hampton, 
was to be laid in the Capitol. Mrs. Petticola joined me after 
a while, and then Mrs. Singleton.</p>
        <p>Preston Hampton and Peter Trezevant, with myself and 
Mrs. Singleton, formed the sad procession which followed the 
coffin. There was a company of soldiers drawn up in front of the 
State House porch. Mrs. Singleton said we had better go in and 
look at him before the coffin was finally closed. How I wish I 
had not looked. I remember him so well in all the 
pride of his magnificent manhood. He died of a saber-cut 
across the face and head, and was utterly 
<pb id="mches238" n="238"/>
disfigured. Mrs. Singleton seemed convulsed with grief. In 
all my life I had never seen such bitter weeping. She had 
her own troubles, but I did not know of them. We sat for a 
long time on the great steps of the State House. Everybody 
had gone and we were alone.</p>
        <p>We talked of it all—how we had gone to Charleston to 
see Rachel in Adrienne Lecouvreur, and how, as I stood 
waiting in the passage near the drawing-room, I had met 
Frank Hampton bringing his beautiful bride from the 
steamer. They had just landed. Afterward at Mrs. 
Singleton's place in the country we had all spent a 
delightful week together. And now, only a few years have 
passed, but nearly all that pleasant company are dead, and 
our world, the only world we cared for, literally kicked to 
pieces. And she cried, “We are two lone women, stranded 
here.”  Rev. Robert Barnwell was in a desperate condition, 
and Mary Barnwell, her daughter, was expecting her 
confinement every day.</p>
        <p>Here now, later, let me add that it was not until I got 
back to Carolina that I heard of Robert Barnwell's death, 
with scarcely a day's interval between it and that of Mary 
and her new-born baby. Husband, wife, and child were 
buried at the same time in the same grave in Columbia. 
And now, Mrs. Singleton has three orphan grandchildren. 
What a woful year it has been to her.</p>
        <p>Robert Barnwell had insisted upon being sent to the 
hospital at Staunton. On account of his wife's situation the 
doctor also had advised it. He was carried off on a 
mattress. His brave wife tried to prevent it, and said: “It is 
only fever.”  And she nursed him to the last. She tried to 
say good-by cheerfully, and called after him: “As soon as 
my trouble is over I will come to you at Staunton.” At the 
hospital they said it was typhoid fever. He died the second 
day after he got there. Poor Mary fainted when she heard 
the ambulance drive away with him. Then she crept into a 
low trundle-bed kept for the children in her mother's room. 
<pb id="mches239" n="239"/>
She never left that bed again. When the message came from 
Staunton that fever was the matter with Robert and nothing 
more, Mrs. Singleton says she will never forget the 
expression in Mary's eyes as she turned and looked at her. 
“Robert will get well,” she said, “it is all right.”  Her face 
was radiant, blazing with light. That night the baby was 
born, and Mrs. Singleton got a telegram that Robert was 
dead. She did not tell Mary, standing, as she did, at the 
window while she read it. She was at the same time looking 
for Robert's body, which might come any moment. As for 
Mary's life being in danger, she had never thought of such a 
thing. She was thinking only of Robert. Then a servant 
touched her and said: “Look at Mrs. Barnwell.”  She ran to 
the bedside, and the doctor, who had come in, said, “It is all 
over; she is dead.” Not in anger, not in wrath, came the 
angel of death that day. He came to set Mary free from a 
world grown too hard to bear.</p>

        <p>During Stoneman's raid<ref targOrder="U" id="ref100" n="100" rend="sc" target="note100">1</ref> I burned some personal papers. 
Molly constantly said to me, “Missis, listen to de guns. 
Burn up everything. Mrs. Lyons says they are sure to come, 
and they'll put in their newspapers whatever you write here, 
every day.”  The guns did sound very near, and when Mrs. 
Davis rode up and told me that if Mr. Davis left Richmond I 
must go with her, I confess I lost my head. So I burned a 
part of my journal but rewrote it afterward from 
memory—my implacable enemy that lets me forget none of 
the things I would. I am weak with dates. I do not always 
worry to look at the calendar and write them down. Besides 
I have not always a calendar at hand.</p>

        <p>CAMDEN, S. C., <hi rend="italics">September 10,1863</hi>.-It is a comfort to turn from 
small political jealousies to our grand battles—to Lee and Kirby 
Smith after Council and Convention squabbles. Lee has proved to 
be all that my husband prophesied of him when he was so unpopular 
and when Joe Johnston was the great god of war. The very sound of 
the word convention or council is wearisome. Not that I am quite 
ready for Richmond yet. We must look after home and 
plantation affairs, which we have sadly neglected. Heaven 
help my husband through the deep waters.</p>
        <p>The wedding of Miss Aiken, daughter of Governor 
Aiken, the largest slave-owner in South Carolina; Julia 
Rutledge, one of the bridesmaids; the place Flat Rock. We 
could not for a while imagine what Julia would do for a 
dress. My sister Kate remembered some muslin she had in 
the house for curtains, bought before the war, and laid aside 
as not needed now. The stuff was white and thin, a little 
coarse, but then we covered it with no end of beautiful lace. 
It made a charming dress, and how altogether lovely Julia 
looked in it! The night of the wedding it stormed as if the 
world were coming to an end—wind, rain, thunder, and 
lightning in an unlimited supply around the mountain 
cottage.</p>
        <p>The bride had a <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">duchesse</hi></foreign> dressing-table, muslin and 
lace; not one of the shifts of honest, war-driven poverty, 
<pb id="mches241" n="241"/>
but a millionaire's attempt at appearing economical, in the 
idea that that style was in better taste as placing the family 
more on the same plane with their less comfortable 
compatriots. A candle was left too near this light drapery 
and it took fire. Outside was lightning enough to fire the 
world; inside, the bridal chamber was ablaze, and there was 
wind enough to blow the house down the mountainside.</p>
        <p>The English maid behaved heroically, and, with the aid 
of Mrs. Aiken's and Mrs. Mat Singleton's servants, put the 
fire out without disturbing the marriage ceremony, then 
being performed below. Everything in the bridal chamber 
was burned up except the bed, and that was a mass of 
cinders, soot, and flakes of charred and blackened wood.</p>
        <p>At Kingsville I caught a glimpse of our army. 
Longstreet's corps was going West. God bless the gallant 
fellows! Not one man was intoxicated; not one rude word 
did I hear. It was a strange sight—one part of it. There were 
miles, apparently, of platform cars, soldiers rolled in their 
blankets, lying in rows, heads all covered, fast asleep. In 
their gray blankets, packed in regular order, they looked like 
swathed mummies. One man near where I sat was writing on 
his knee. He used his cap for a desk and he was seated on a 
rail. I watched him, wondering to whom that letter was to 
go—home, no doubt. Sore hearts for him there.</p>
        <p>A feeling of awful depression laid hold of me. All these 
fine fellows were going to kill or be killed. Why? And a 
phrase got to beating about my head like an old song, “The 
Unreturning Brave.” When a knot of boyish, laughing, 
young creatures passed me, a queer thrill of sympathy shook 
me. Ah, I know how your home-folks feel, poor children! 
Once, last winter, persons came to us in Camden with such 
strange stories of Captain— , Morgan's man; stories of his 
father, too; turf tales and murder, or, at least, how he killed 
people. He had been a tremendous favorite with my 
husband, who brought him in once, leading him
<pb id="mches242" n="242"/>
by the hand. Afterward he said to me, “With these girls in 
the house we must be more cautious.” I agreed to be coldly 
polite to—.  “After all,” I said, “I barely know him.”</p>
        <p>When he called afterward in Richmond I was very glad 
to see him, utterly forgetting that he was under a ban. We 
had a long, confidential talk. He told me of his wife and 
children; of his army career, and told Morgan stories. He 
grew more and more cordial and so did I. He thanked me for 
the kind reception given him in that house; told me I was a 
true friend of his, and related to me a scrape he was in 
which, if divulged, would ruin him, although he was 
innocent; but time would clear all things. He begged me not 
to repeat anything he had told me of his affairs, not even to 
Colonel Chesnut; which I promised promptly, and then he 
went away. I sat poking the fire thinking what a curiously 
interesting creature he was, this famous Captain—, when 
the folding-doors slowly opened and Colonel Chesnut 
appeared. He had come home two hours ago from the War 
Office with a headache, and had been lying on the sofa 
behind that folding-door listening for mortal hours.</p>
        <p>“So, this is your style of being  ‘coldly polite,’ ” he said. 
Fancy my feelings. “Indeed, I had forgotten all about what 
they had said of him. The lies they told of him never once 
crossed my mind. He is a great deal cleverer, and, I dare 
say, just as good as those who malign him.”</p>
        <p>Mattie Reedy (I knew her as a handsome girl in 
Washington several years ago) got tired of hearing Federals 
abusing John Morgan. One day they were worse than ever in 
their abuse and she grew restive. By way of putting a mark 
against the name of so rude a girl, the Yankee officer said,   
“What is your name?”   “Write ‘Mattie Reedy’ now, but 
by the grace of God one day I hope to call myself the wife of 
John Morgan.”  She did not know Morgan, but Morgan 
eventually heard the story; a good joke it was 
<pb id="mches243" n="243"/>
said to be. But he made it a point to find her out; and, as she 
was as pretty as she was patriotic, by the grace of God, she 
is now Mrs. Morgan! These timid Southern women under 
the guns can be brave enough.</p>
        <p>Aunt Charlotte has told a story of my dear mother. They 
were up at Shelby, Ala., a white man's country, where 
negroes are not wanted. The ladies had with them several 
negroes belonging to my uncle at whose house they were 
staying in the owner's absence. One negro man who had 
married and dwelt in a cabin was for some cause 
particularly obnoxious to the neighborhood. My aunt and 
my mother, old-fashioned ladies, shrinking from everything 
outside their own door, knew nothing of all this. They 
occupied rooms on opposite sides of an open passage-way. 
Underneath, the house was open and unfinished. Suddenly, 
one night, my aunt heard a terrible noise—apparently as of a 
man running for his life, pursued by men and dogs, 
shouting, hallowing, barking. She had only time to lock 
herself in. Utterly cut off from her sister, she sat down, 
dumb with terror, when there began loud knocking at the 
door, with men swearing, dogs tearing round, sniffing, 
racing in and out of the passage and barking underneath the 
house like mad. Aunt Charlotte was sure she heard the 
panting of a negro as he ran into the house a few minutes 
before. What could have become of him? Where could he 
have hidden? The men shook the doors and windows, loudly 
threatening vengeance. My aunt pitied her feeble sister, cut 
off in the room across the passage. This fright might kill 
her!</p>
        <p>The cursing and shouting continued unabated. A man's 
voice, in harshest accents, made itself heard above all:         
“Leave my house, you rascals!” said the voice. “If you are 
not gone in two seconds, I'll shoot!”  There was a dead 
silence except for the noise of the dogs. Quickly the men 
slipped away. Once out of gunshot, they began to call  their 
dogs. After it was all over my aunt crept across the 
<pb id="mches244" n="244"/>
passage. “Sister, what man was it scared them away?”  My 
mother laughed aloud in her triumph. “I am the man,” she 
said.</p>
        <p>“But where is John?” Out crept John from a corner of 
the room, where my mother had thrown some rubbish over 
him.  “Lawd bless you, Miss Mary opened de do' for me 
and dey was right behind runnin' me—” Aunt says mother 
was awfully proud of her prowess. And she showed some 
moral courage, too!</p>
        <p>At the President's in Richmond once, General Lee was 
there, and Constance and Hetty Cary came in; also Miss 
Sanders and others. Constance Cary<ref targOrder="U" id="ref101" n="101" rend="sc" target="note101">1</ref>  was telling some war 
anecdotes, among them, one of an attempt to get up a supper 
the night before at some high and mighty F. F. V.'s house, 
and of how several gentlefolks went into the kitchen to 
prepare something to eat by the light of one forlorn candle. 
One of the men in the party, not being of a useful 
temperament, turned up a tub and sat down upon it. Custis 
Lee, wishing also to rest, found nothing upon which to sit 
but a gridiron.</p>
        <p>One remembrance I kept of the evening at the 
President's: General Lee bowing over the beautiful Miss 
Cary's hands in the passage outside. Miss — rose to have 
her part in the picture, and asked Mr. Davis to walk with her 
into the adjoining drawing-room. He seemed surprised, but 
rose stiffly, and, with a scowling brow, was led off. As they 
passed where Mrs. Davis sat, Miss—, with all sail set, 
looked back and said: “Don't be jealous, Mrs. Davis; I have 
an important communication to make to the President.”  
Mrs. Davis's amusement resulted in a significant  “Now! 
Did you ever?”</p>

Randolph's pew. The battle of Chancellorsville was also 
raging. The rattling of ammunition wagons, the tramp of 
soldiers, the everlasting slamming of those iron gates of the 
Capitol Square just opposite the church, made it hard to 
attend to the service.</p>
        <p>Then began a scene calculated to make the stoutest heart 
quail. The sexton would walk quietly up the aisle to deliver 
messages to worshipers whose relatives had been brought in 
wounded, dying, or dead. Pale-faced people would then 
follow him out. Finally, the Rev. Mr. Minnegerode bent 
across the chancel-rail to the sexton for a few minutes, 
whispered with the sexton, and then disappeared. The 
assistant clergyman resumed the communion which Mr. 
Minnegerode had been administering. At the church door 
stood Mrs. Minnegerode, as tragically wretched and as 
wild-looking as ever Mrs. Siddons was. She managed to say 
to her husband, “Your son is at the station, dead!”  When 
these agonized parents reached the station, however, it 
proved to be some one else's son who was dead—but a son 
all the same. Pale and wan came Mr. Minnegerode back to 
his place within the altar rails. After the sacred communion 
was over, some one asked him what it all meant, and he 
said: “Oh, it was not my son who was killed, but it came so 
near it aches me yet!”</p>
        <p>At home I found L. Q. Washington, who stayed to 
dinner. I saw that he and my husband were intently 
preoccupied by some event which they did not see fit to 
communicate to me. Immediately after dinner my husband 
lent Mr. Washington one of his horses and they rode off 
together. I betook myself to my kind neighbors, the Pattons, 
for information. There I found Colonel Patton had gone, too. 
Mrs. Patton, however, knew all about the trouble. She said 
there was a raiding party within forty miles of us and no 
troops were in Richmond! They asked me to stay to 
tea—those kind ladies—and in some way we might learn what 
was going on. After tea we went out to the Capitol 
<pb id="mches246" n="246"/>
Square, Lawrence and three men-servants going along to 
protect us. They seemed to be mustering in citizens by the 
thousands. Company after company was being formed; then 
battalions, and then regiments. It was a wonderful sight to 
us, peering through the iron railing, watching them fall into 
ranks.</p>
        <p>Then we went to the President's, finding the family at 
supper. We sat on the white marble steps, and General 
Elzey told me exactly how things stood and of our 
immediate danger. Pickets were coming in. Men were 
spurring to and from the door as fast as they could ride, 
bringing and carrying messages and orders. Calmly General 
Elzey discoursed upon our present weakness and our 
chances for aid. After a while Mrs. Davis came out and 
embraced me silently.</p>
        <p>“It is dreadful,” I said. “The enemy is within forty 
miles of us—only forty!”  “Who told you that tale?” said 
she.      “They are within three miles of Richmond!”  I went 
down on my knees like a stone. “You had better be quiet,”  
she said. “The President is ill. Women and children must 
not add to the trouble.”  She asked me to stay all night, 
which I was thankful to do.</p>
        <p>We sat up. Officers were coming and going; and we gave 
them what refreshment we could from a side table, kept 
constantly replenished. Finally, in the excitement, the 
constant state of activity and change of persons, we forgot 
the danger. Officers told us jolly stories and seemed in fine 
spirits, so we gradually took heart. There was not a 
moment's rest for any one. Mrs. Davis said something more 
amusing than ever: “We look like frightened women and 
children, don't we?”</p>
        <p>Early next morning the President came down. He was 
still feeble and pale from  illness. Custis Lee and my 
husband loaded their pistols, and the President drove off in 
Dr. Garnett's carriage, my husband and Custis Lee on 
horseback alongside him. By eight o'clock the troops from
<pb id="mches247" n="247"/>
Petersburg came in, and the danger was over. The 
authorities will never strip Richmond of troops again. We 
had a narrow squeeze for it, but we escaped. It was a 
terrible night, although we made the best of it.</p>
        <p>I was walking on Franklin Street when I met my 
husband. “Come with me to the War Office for a few 
minutes,” said he, “and then I will go home with you.” 
What could I do but go?  He took me up a dark stairway, 
and then down a long, dark corridor, and he left me sitting 
in a window, saying he “would not be gone a second”; he 
was obliged to go into the Secretary of War's room. There I 
sat mortal hours. Men came to light the gas. From the first I 
put down my veil so that nobody might know me. Numbers 
of persons passed that I knew, but I scarcely felt respectable 
seated up there in that odd way, so I said not a word but 
looked out of the window. Judge Campbell slowly walked 
up and down with his hands behind his back—the saddest 
face I ever saw. He had jumped down in his patriotism from 
Judge of the Supreme Court, U. S. A., to be under-secretary 
of something or other—I do not know what—C. S. A.  No 
wonder he was out of spirits that night!</p>
        <p>Finally Judge Ould came; him I called, and he joined me 
at once, in no little amazement to find me there, and stayed 
with me until James Chesnut appeared. In point of fact, I 
sent him to look up that stray member of my family.</p>
        <p>When my husband came he said: “Oh, Mr. Seddon and I 
got into an argument, and time slipped away! The truth is, I 
utterly forgot you were here.”  When we were once more out 
in the street, he began: “Now, don't scold me, for there is 
bad news. Pemberton has been fighting the Yankees by 
brigades, and he has been beaten every time; and now 
Vicksburg must go!”  I suppose that was his side of the 
argument with Seddon.</p>
        <p>Once again I visited the War Office. I went with Mrs.
<pb id="mches248" n="248"/>
Ould to see her husband at his office. We wanted to arrange 
a party on the river on the flag-of-truce boat, and to visit 
those beautiful places, Claremont and Brandon. My 
husband got into one of his “too careful” fits; said there 
was risk in it; and so he upset all our plans. Then I was to 
go up to John Rutherford's by the canal-boat. That, too, he 
vetoed “too risky,” as if anybody was going to trouble us!</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">October 24th</hi>.—James Chesnut is at home on his way 
back to Richmond; had been sent by the President to make 
the rounds of the Western armies; says Polk is a splendid 
old fellow. They accuse him of having been asleep in his 
tent at seven o'clock when he was ordered to attack at 
daylight, but he has too good a conscience to sleep so 
soundly.</p>
        <p>The battle did not begin until eleven at Chickamauga<ref targOrder="U" id="ref102" n="102" rend="sc" target="note102">1</ref> 
when Bragg had ordered the advance at daylight. Bragg and 
his generals do not agree. I think a general worthless whose 
subalterns quarrel with him. Something is wrong about the 
man. Good generals are adored by their soldiers. See 
Napoleon, Cæsar, Stonewall, Lee.</p>
        <p>Old Sam (Hood) received his orders to hold a certain 
bridge against the enemy, and he had already driven the 
enemy several miles beyond it, when the slow generals were 
still asleep. Hood has won a victory, though he has only 
one leg to stand on.</p>
        <p>Mr. Chesnut was with the President when he reviewed 
our army under the enemy's guns before Chattanooga. He 
told Mr. Davis that every honest man he saw out West 
thought well of Joe Johnston. He knows that the President 
detests Joe Johnston for all the trouble he has given him,
<note id="note102" n="102" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref102">1. The battle of Chickamauga was fought on the river of the same name, 
near Chattanooga, September 19 and 20, 1863. The Confederates were 
commanded by Bragg and the Federals by Rosecrans. It was one of the 
bloodiest battles of the war; the loss on each side, including killed, 
wounded, and prisoners, was over 15,000.</note>
<pb id="mches249" n="249"/>
and General Joe returns the compliment with compound 
interest. His hatred of Jeff Davis amounts to a religion With 
him it colors all things.</p>
        <p>Joe Johnston advancing, or retreating, I may say with 
more truth, is magnetic. He does draw the good-will of 
those by whom he is surrounded. Being such a good hater, 
it is a pity he had not elected to hate somebody else than the 
President of our country. He hates not wisely but too well. 
Our friend Breckinridge<ref targOrder="U" id="ref103" n="103" rend="sc" target="note103">1</ref>  received Mr. Chesnut with open 
arms. There is nothing narrow, nothing self-seeking, about 
Breckinridge. He has not mounted a pair of green spectacles 
made of prejudices so that he sees no good except in his 
own red-hot partizans.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">October 27th</hi>.—Young Wade Hampton has been here for a 
few days, a guest of our nearest neighbor and cousin, Phil 
Stockton. Wade, without being the beauty or the athlete that 
his brother Preston is, is such a nice boy. We lent him 
horses, and ended by giving him a small party. What was 
lacking in company was made up for by the excellence of 
old Colonel Chesnut's ancient Madeira and champagne. If 
everything in the Confederacy were only as truly good as the 
old Colonel's wine-cellars! Then we had a salad and a jelly 
cake.</p>
        <p>General Joe Johnston is so careful of his aides that Wade 
has never yet seen a battle. Says he has always happened to 
be sent afar off when the fighting came. He does not seem 
too grateful for this, and means to be transferred to his 
father's command. He says, “No man   exposes himself 
more recklessly to danger than General  Johnston, and no 
one strives harder to keep others out of it.”   But the 
business of this war is to save the country, and a     
commander must risk his men's lives to do it. There is a 
French saying

that you can't make an omelet unless you are willing to 
break eggs.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">November 5th</hi>.—For a week we have had such a tranquil, 
happy time here. Both my husband and Johnny are here still. 
James Chesnut spent his time sauntering around with his 
father, or stretched on the rug before my fire reading 
Vanity Fair and Pendennis. By good luck he had not read 
them before. We have kept Esmond for the last. He owns 
that he is having a good time. Johnny is happy, too. He does 
not care for books. He will read a novel now and then, if the 
girls continue to talk of it before him. Nothing else whatever 
in the way of literature does he touch. He comes pulling his 
long blond mustache irresolutely as if he hoped to be 
advised not to read it— “Aunt Mary, shall I like this thing?” 
 I do not think he has an idea what we are fighting about, 
and he does not want to know. He says, “My company,”  
“My men,” with a pride, a faith, and an affection which are 
sublime. He came into his inheritance at twenty-one (just as 
the war began), and it was a goodly one, fine old houses and 
an estate to match.</p>
        <p>Yesterday, Johnny went to his plantation for the first 
time since the war began. John Witherspoon went with him, 
and reports in this way: “How do you do, Marster! How 
you come on?”—thus from every side rang the noisiest 
welcome from the darkies. Johnny was silently shaking 
black hands right and left as he rode into the crowd.</p>
        <p>As the noise subsided, to the overseer he said: “Send 
down more corn and fodder for my horses.” And to the 
driver, “Have you any peas?”  “Plenty, sir.”  “Send a 
wagon-load down for the cows at Bloomsbury while I stay 
there. They have not milk and butter enough there for me. 
Any eggs? Send down all you can collect. How about my 
turkeys and ducks? Send them down two at a time. How 
about the mutton?  Fat?  That's good; send down two a 
week.”</p>
        <pb id="mches251" n="251"/>
        <p>As they rode home, John Witherspoon remarked, “I was 
surprised that you did not go into the fields to see your 
crops.”  “What was the use?”  “And the negroes; you had 
so little talk with them.”</p>
        <p>“No use to talk to them before the overseer. They are 
coming down to Bloomsbury, day and night, by platoons 
and they talk me dead. Besides, William and Parish go up 
there every night, and God knows they tell me enough 
plantation scandal—overseer feathering his nest; negroes 
ditto at my expense. Between the two fires I mean to get 
something to eat while I am here.”</p>
        <p>For him we got up a charming picnic at Mulberry. 
Everything was propitious—the most perfect of days and the 
old place in great beauty. Those large rooms were delightful 
for dancing; we had as good a dinner as mortal appetite 
could crave; the best fish, fowl, and game; wine from a 
cellar that can not be excelled. In spite of blockade Mulberry 
does the honors nobly yet. Mrs. Edward Stockton drove 
down with me. She helped me with her taste and tact in 
arranging things. We had no trouble, however. All of the old 
servants who have not been moved to Bloomsbury scented 
the prey from afar, and they literally flocked in and made 
themselves useful.</p>

        <p>RICHMOND, Va., <hi rend="italics">November 28, 1863</hi>.—Our 
pleasant home sojourn was soon broken up. Johnny had to 
go back to Company A, and my husband was ordered by 
the President to make a second visit to Bragg's Army.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref104" n="104" rend="sc" target="note104">1</ref></p>
        <p>So we came on here where the Prestons had taken 
apartments for me. Molly was with me. Adam Team, the 
overseer, with Isaac McLaughlin's help, came with us to 
take charge of the eight huge boxes of provisions I brought 
from home. Isaac, Molly's husband, is a servant of ours, the 
only one my husband ever bought in his life. Isaac's wife 
belonged to Rev. Thomas Davis, and Isaac to somebody 
else. The owner of Isaac was about to go West, and Isaac 
was distracted. They asked one thousand dollars for him. He 
is a huge creature, really a magnificent specimen of a 
colored gentleman. His occupation had been that of a stage-
driver. Now, he is a carpenter, or will be some day. He is 
awfully grateful to us for buying him; is really devoted to 
his wife and children, though he has a strange way of 
showing it, for he has a mistress, <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">en titre</hi></foreign>, as the French say, 
which fact Molly never failed to grumble about as soon as 
his back was turned. “Great big good-for-nothing thing come 
a-whimpering to marster to buy him for his wife's

sake, and all the time he an—”  “Oh, Molly, stop that!” 
said I.</p>
        <p>Mr. Davis visited Charleston and had an enthusiastic 
reception. He described it all to General Preston. Governor 
Aiken's perfect old Carolina style of living delighted him. 
Those old gray-haired darkies and their noiseless, automatic 
service, the result of finished training-one does miss that 
sort of thing when away from home, where your own 
servants think for you; they know your ways and your 
wants; they save you all responsibility even in matters of 
your own ease and well doing. The butler at Mulberry 
would be miserable and feel himself a ridiculous failure 
were I ever forced to ask him for anything. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">November 30th</hi>.-I must describe an adventure I had in 
Kingsville. Of course, I know nothing of children: in point 
of fact, am awfully afraid of them.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Edward Barnwell came with us from Camden. She 
had a magnificent boy two years old. Now don't expect me 
to reduce that adjective, for this little creature is a wonder of 
childlike beauty, health, and strength. Why not? If like 
produces like, and with such a handsome pair to claim as 
father and mother! The boy's eyes alone would make any 
girl's fortune.</p>
        <p>At first he made himself very agreeable, repeating nursery 
rhymes and singing. Then something went wrong. 
Suddenly he changed to a little fiend, fought and kicked and 
scratched like a tiger. He did everything that was naughty, 
and he did it with a will as if he liked it, while his lovely 
mamma, with flushed cheeks and streaming eyes, was 
imploring him to be a good boy.</p>
        <p>When we stopped at Kingsville, I got out first, then Mrs. 
Barnwell's nurse, who put the little man down by me.          
“Look after him a moment, please, ma'am,” she said. “I 
must help Mrs. Barnwell with the bundles,” etc.  She 
stepped hastily back and the cars moved off.  They ran 
down a half mile to turn. I trembled in my shoes. This
<pb id="mches254" n="254"/>
child!  No man could ever frighten me so. If he should 
choose to be bad again!   It seemed an eternity while I 
waited for   that train to turn and come back again.  My 
little charge took things quietly. For me he had a perfect 
contempt, no fear whatever. And I was his abject slave for 
the nonce.</p>
        <p>He stretched himself out lazily at full length. Then he 
pointed downward. “Those are great legs,” said he solemnly, 
looking at his own. I immediately joined him in admiring 
them enthusiastically. Near him he spied a bundle. “Pussy 
cat tied up in that bundle.” He was up in a second and 
pounced upon it. If we were to be taken up as thieves, no 
matter, I dared not meddle with that child.  I had seen what 
he could do.    There were several cooked sweet potatoes 
tied up in an old handkerchief—belonging to some negro 
probably. He squared himself off comfortably, broke one in 
half and began to eat. Evidently he had found what he was 
fond of. In this posture Mrs. Barnwell discovered us. She 
came with comic dismay in every feature, not knowing what 
our relations might be, and whether or not we had 
undertaken to fight it out alone as best we might. The old 
nurse cried, “Lawsy me!” with both hands uplifted. 
Without a word I fled. In another moment the Wilmington 
train would have left me. She was going to Columbia.</p>
        <p>We broke down only once between Kingsville and 
Wilmington, but between Wilmington and Weldon we 
contrived to do the thing so effectually as to have to remain 
twelve hours at that forlorn station.</p>
        <p>The one room that I saw was crowded with soldiers. 
Adam Team  succeeded in securing two chairs   for me, 
upon one of which I sat and put my feet on the other. Molly 
sat flat on the floor, resting her head against my chair. I 
woke cold and cramped. An officer, who did not give his 
name, but said he was from Louisiana, came up and urged 
me to go near the fire. He gave me his seat by the fire, 
<pb id="mches255" n="255"/>
where I found an old lady and two young ones, with two 
men in the uniform of common soldiers.</p>
        <p>We talked as easily to each other all night as if we had 
known one another all our lives. We discussed the war, the 
army, the news of the day. No questions were asked, no 
names given, no personal discourse whatever, and yet if 
these men and women were not gentry, and of the best sort, 
I do not know ladies and gentlemen when I see them.</p>
        <p>Being a little surprised at the want of interest Mr. Team 
and Isaac showed in my well-doing, I walked out to see, and 
I found them working like beavers. They had been at it all 
night. In the break-down my boxes were smashed. They had 
first gathered up the contents and were trying to hammer 
up the boxes so as to make them once more available. </p>
        <p>At Petersburg a smartly dressed woman came in, looked 
around in the crowd, then asked for the seat by me. Now 
Molly's seat was paid for the same as mine, but she got up 
at once, gave the lady her seat and stood behind me. I am 
sure Molly believes herself my body-guard as well as my 
servant.</p>
        <p>The lady then having arranged herself comfortably in 
Molly's seat began in plaintive accents to tell her melancholy 
tale. She was a widow. She lost her husband in the battles 
around Richmond. Soon some one went out and a man 
offered her the vacant seat. Straight as an arrow she went in 
for a flirtation with the polite gentleman. Another person, a 
perfect stranger, said to me, “Well, look yonder. As soon as 
she began whining about her dead beau I knew she was after 
another one.” “Beau, indeed!” cried another listener,  “she 
said it was her husband.” “Husband or lover, all the same. 
She won't lose any time. It won't be her fault if she doesn't 
have another one soon.”</p>
        <p>But the grand scene was the night before: the cars 
crowded with soldiers, of course; not a human being that I 
knew. An Irish woman, so announced by her brogue, came 
<pb id="mches256" n="256"/>
in. She marched up and down the car, loudly lamenting the 
want of gallantry in the men who would not make way for 
her. Two men got up and gave her their seats, saying it did 
not matter, they were going to get out at the next 
stopping-place.</p>
        <p>She was gifted with the most pronounced brogue I ever 
heard, and she gave us a taste of it. She continued to say 
that the men ought all to get out of that; that car was “shuteable” 
only for ladies. She placed on the vacant seat 
next to her a large looking-glass. She continued to harangue 
until she fell asleep.</p>
        <p>A tired soldier coming in, seeing what he supposed to be 
an empty seat, quietly slipped into it. Crash went the glass. 
The soldier groaned, the Irish woman shrieked. The man 
was badly cut by the broken glass. She was simply a mad 
woman. She shook her fist in his face; said she was a lone 
woman and he had got into that seat for no good purpose. 
How did he dare to?—etc. I do not think the man uttered a 
word. The conductor took him into another car to have the 
pieces of glass picked out of his clothes, and she continued 
to rave. Mr. Team shouted aloud, and laughed as if he were 
in the Hermitage Swamp. The woman's unreasonable wrath 
and absurd accusations were comic, no doubt.</p>
        <p>Soon the car was silent and I fell into a comfortable 
doze. I felt Molly give me a gentle shake. “Listen, Missis, 
how loud Mars Adam Team is talking, and all about ole 
marster and our business, and to strangers. It's a shame.”   
“Is he saying any harm of us?”  “No, ma'am, not that. He is 
bragging for dear life 'bout how ole ole marster is and how 
rich he is, an' all that. I gwine tell him stop.”  Up started 
Molly. “Mars Adam, Missis say please don't talk so loud. 
When people travel they don't do that a way.”</p>
        <p>Mr. Preston's man, Hal, was waiting at the depot with a 
carriage to take me to my Richmond house. Mary Preston 
had rented these apartments for me.</p>
        <pb id="mches257" n="257"/>
        <p>I found my dear girls there with a nice fire. Everything 
looked so pleasant and inviting to the weary traveler. Mrs. 
Grundy, who occupies the lower floor, sent me such a real 
Virginia tea, hot cakes, and rolls. Think of living in the 
house with Mrs. Grundy, and having no fear of  “what Mrs. 
Grundy will say.”</p>
        <p>My husband has come; he likes the house, Grundy's, and 
everything. Already he has bought Grundy's horses for 
sixteen hundred Confederate dollars cash. He is nearer to 
being contented and happy than I ever saw him. He has not 
established a grievance yet, but I am on the lookout daily. 
He will soon find out whatever there is wrong about Cary 
Street.</p>
        <p>I gave a party; Mrs. Davis very witty; Preston girls very 
handsome; Isabella's fun fast and furious. No party could 
have gone off more successfully, but my husband decides 
we are to have no more festivities. This is not the time or the 
place for such gaieties.</p>
        <p>Maria Freeland is perfectly delightful on the subject of 
her wedding. She is ready to the last piece of lace, but her 
hard-hearted father says “No.” She adores John Lewis. That 
goes without saying. She does not pretend, however, to be as 
much in love as Mary Preston. In point of fact, she never 
saw any one before who was. But she is as much in love as 
she can be with a man who, though he is not very handsome, 
is as eligible a match as a girl could make. He is all that 
heart could wish, and he comes of such a handsome family. 
His mother, Esther Maria Coxe, was the beauty of a 
century, and his father was a nephew of General 
Washington. For all that, he is far better looking than John 
Darby or Mr. Miles. She always intended to marry better 
than Mary Preston or Bettie Bierne.</p>
        <p>Lucy Haxall is positively engaged to Captain Coffey, an 
Englishman. She is convinced that she will marry him. He 
is her first fancy.</p>
        <p>Mr. Venable, of Lee's staff, was at our party, so out of

spirits. He knows everything that is going on. His depression 
bodes us no good. To-day, General Hampton sent 
James Chesnut a fine saddle that he had captured from the 
Yankees in battle array.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Scotch Allan (Edgar Allan Poe's patron's wife) sent 
me ice-cream and lady-cheek apples from her farm. John R. 
Thompson,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref105" n="105" rend="sc" target="note105">1</ref> the sole literary fellow I know in Richmond, sent 
me Leisure Hours in Town, by A Country Parson.</p>
        <p>My husband says he hopes I will be contented because 
he came here this winter to please me. If I could have been 
satisfied at home he would have resigned his 
aide-de-campship and gone into some service in South 
Carolina. I am a good excuse, if good for nothing else.</p>
        <p>Old tempestuous Keitt breakfasted with us yesterday. I 
wish I could remember half the brilliant things he said. My 
husband has now gone with him to the War Office. Colonel 
Keitt thinks it is time he was promoted. He wants to be a 
brigadier.</p>
        <p>Now, Charleston is bombarded night and day. It fairly 
makes me dizzy to think of that everlasting racket they are 
beating about people's ears down there. Bragg defeated, and 
separated from Longstreet. It is a long street that knows no 
turning, and Rosecrans is not taken after all.</p>

command. The army will be relieved to get rid of him. He 
has a winning way of earning everybody's detestation. 
Heavens, how they hate him! The rapid flight of his army 
terminated at Ringgold. Hardie declines even a temporary 
command of the Western army. Preston Johnston has been 
sent out post-haste at a moment's warning. He was not even 
allowed time to go home and tell his wife good-by or, as 
Browne, the Englishman, said, “to put a clean shirt into his 
traveling bag.” Lee and Meade are facing each other 
gallantly.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref107" n="107" rend="sc" target="note107">1</ref></p>
        <p>The first of December we went with a party of Mrs. 
Ould's getting up, to see a French frigate which lay at 
anchor down the river. The French officers came on board 
our boat. The Lees were aboard. The French officers were 
not in the least attractive either in manners or appearance, 
but our ladies were most attentive and some showered bad 
French upon them with a lavish hand, always accompanied 
by queer grimaces to eke out the scanty supply of French 
words, the sentences ending usually in a nervous shriek.      
“Are they deaf?” asked Mrs. Randolph.</p>
        <note id="note107" n="107" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref107">1.  Following the battle of Gettysburg on July 1st, 2d, and 3d, of 
this year, there had occurred in Virginia between Lee and Made engagements 
at Bristoe's Station, Kelly's Ford, and Rappahannock Station, the latter 
engagement taking place on November 7th. The author doubtless refers here 
to the positions of Lee and Meade at Mine Run, December 1st. December 2d 
Meade abandoned his, because (as he is reported to have said) it would have 
cost him 30,000 men to carry Lee's breastworks, and he shrank from ordering 
such slaughter.</note>
        <pb id="mches260" n="260"/>
        <p>The French frigate was a dirty little thing. Doctor 
Garnett was so buoyed up with hope that the French were 
coming to our rescue, that he would not let me say “an 
English man-of-war is the cleanest thing known in the 
world.” Captain— said to Mary Lee, with a foreign 
contortion of countenance, that went for a smile, “I's 
bashlor.”  Judge Ould said, as we went to dinner on our own 
steamer, “They will not drink our President's health. They 
do not acknowledge us to be a nation. Mind, none of you say           
‘Emperor,’  not once.”  Doctor Garnett interpreted the laws 
of politeness otherwise, and stepped forward, his mouth 
fairly distended with so much French, and said: “<foreign lang="fr"><hi>Vieff l'Emperor.</hi></foreign>”  Young Gibson seconded him quietly, “<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">À la 
santé de l'Empereur.</hi></foreign>”  But silence prevailed. Preston 
Hampton was the handsomest man on board—“the figure of 
Hercules, the face of Apollo,” cried an enthusiastic girl. 
Preston was as lazy and as sleepy as ever. He said of the 
Frenchmen: “They can't help not being good-looking, but 
with all the world open to them, to wear such shabby 
clothes!”</p>
        <p>The lieutenant's name was Rousseau. On the French 
frigate, lying on one of the tables was a volume of Jean 
Jacques Rousseau's works, side by side, strange to say, with 
a map of South Carolina. This lieutenant was courteously 
asked by Mary Lee to select some lady to whom she might 
introduce him. He answered: “I shuse you,” with a bow that 
was a benediction and a prayer.</p>
        <p>And now I am in a fine condition for Hetty Cary's 
starvation party, where they will give thirty dollars for the 
music and not a cent for a morsel to eat. Preston said 
contentedly, “I hate dancing, and I hate cold water; so I will 
eschew the festivity to-night.”</p>
        <p>Found John R. Thompson at our house when I got home 
so tired to-night. He brought me the last number of the 
Cornhill. He knew how much I was interested in Trollope's 
story, Framley Parsonage.</p>
        <pb id="mches261" n="261"/>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 4th</hi>.—My husband bought yesterday at the 
Commissary's one barrel of flour, one bushel of potatoes, 
one peck of rice, five pounds of salt beef, and one peck of 
salt—all for sixty dollars. In the street a barrel of flour 
sells for one hundred and fifteen dollars.</p>
        <p>December 5th.—Wigfall was here last night. He began 
by wanting to hang Jeff Davis. My husband managed him 
beautifully. He soon ceased to talk virulent nonsense, and 
calmed down to his usual strong common sense. I knew it 
was as quite late, but I had no idea of the hour. My 
husband beckoned me out. “It is all your fault,” said he.     
“What?”  “Why will you persist in looking so interested 
in all Wigfall is saying?  Don't let him catch your eye. 
Look into the fire. Did you not hear it strike two?”</p>
        <p>This attack was so sudden, so violent, so unlooked for, 
I could only laugh hysterically. However, as an obedient 
wife, I went back, gravely took my seat and looked into 
the fire. I did not even dare raise my eyes to see what my 
husband was doing—if he, too, looked into the fire. Wigfall 
soon tired of so tame an audience and took his departure.</p>
        <p>General Lawton was here. He was one of Stonewall's 
generals. So I listened with all my ears when he said:            
“Stonewall could not sleep. So, every two or three nights 
you were waked up by orders to have your brigade in 
marching order before daylight and report in person to the 
Commander. Then you were marched a few miles out and 
then a few miles in again. All this was to make us ready, 
ever on the alert. And the end of it was this: Jackson's men 
would go half a day's march before Peter Longstreet waked 
and breakfasted. I think there is a popular delusion about the 
amount of praying he did. He certainly preferred a fight on 
Sunday to a sermon. Failing to manage a fight, he loved best 
a long Presbyterian sermon, Calvinistic to the core.</p>
        <p>”He had shown small sympathy with human infirmity. 
He was a one-idea-ed man. He looked upon broken-down 
<pb id="mches262" n="262"/>
men and stragglers as the same thing. He classed all who 
were weak and weary, who fainted by the wayside, as 
men wanting in patriotism. If a man's face was as white 
as cotton and his pulse so low you scarce could feel it, he 
looked upon him merely as an inefficient soldier and rode 
off impatiently. He was the true type of all great soldiers. 
Like the successful warriors of the world, he did not 
value human life where he had an object to accomplish. 
He could order men to their death as a matter of course. 
His soldiers obeyed him to the death. Faith they had in 
him stronger than death. Their respect he commanded. I 
doubt if he had so much of their love as is talked about 
while he was alive. Now, that they see a few more years 
of Stonewall would have freed them from the Yankees, 
they deify him. Any man is proud to have been one of the 
famous Stonewall brigade. But, be sure, it was bitter hard 
work to keep up with him as all know who ever served 
under him. He gave his orders rapidly and distinctly and 
rode away, never allowing answer or remonstrance. It 
was, ‘Look there—see that place—take it!’ When you 
failed you were apt to be put under arrest. When you 
reported the place taken, he only said, ‘Good!’ ”</p>
        <p>Spent seventy-five dollars to-day for a little tea and
sugar, and have five hundred left. My husband's pay never 
has paid for the rent of our lodgings. He came in with 
dreadful news just now. I have wept so often for things that 
never happened, I will withhold my tears now for a 
certainty. To-day, a poor woman threw herself on her dead 
husband's coffin and kissed it. She was weeping bitterly. So 
did I in sympathy.</p>
        <p>My husband, as I told him to-day, could see me and 
everything that he loved hanged, drawn, and quartered 
without moving a muscle, if a crowd were looking on; he 
could have the same gentle operation performed on 
himself and make no sign. To all of which violent 
insinuation he answered in unmoved tones: “So would 
any civilized man. 
<pb id="mches263" n="263"/>
Savages, however—Indians, at least—are more dignified in 
that particular than we are. Noisy, fidgety grief never 
moves me at all; it annoys me. Self-control is what we all 
need. You are a miracle of sensibility; self-control is what 
you need.” “So you are civilized!” I said. “Some day I 
mean to be.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 9th</hi>.—“Come here, Mrs. Chesnut,” said Mary 
Preston to-day, “they are lifting General Hood out of his 
carriage, here, at your door.”  Mrs. Grundy promptly had 
him borne into her drawing-room, which was on the first 
floor. Mary Preston and I ran down and greeted him as 
cheerfully and as cordially as if nothing had happened since 
we saw him standing before us a year ago. How he was 
waited upon! Some cut-up oranges were brought him. “How 
kind people are,” said he. “Not once since I was wounded 
have I ever been left without fruit, hard as it is to get now.”  
“The money value of friendship is easily  counted now,” 
said some one, “oranges are five dollars apiece.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 10th</hi>.—Mrs. Davis and Mrs. Lyons came. 
We had luncheon brought in for them, and then a lucid 
explanation of the <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">chronique scandaleuse</hi></foreign>, of which Beck 
J. is the heroine. We walked home with Mrs. Davis and 
met the President riding alone. Surely that is wrong. It 
must be unsafe for him when there are so many traitors, 
not to speak of bribed negroes. Burton Harrison<ref targOrder="U" id="ref108" n="108" rend="sc" target="note108">1</ref>  says Mr. 
Davis prefers to go alone, and there is none to gainsay 
him.</p>
        <p>My husband laid the law down last night. I felt it to be 
the last drop in my full cup. “No more feasting in this 
house,” said he. “This is no time for junketing and 
merrymaking.” “And you said you brought me here to 
enjoy the winter before you took me home and turned my 
face to

a dead wall.” He is the master of the house; to hear is to 
obey.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 14th</hi>.—Drove out with Mrs. Davis. She had a 
watch in her hand which some poor dead soldier wanted to 
have sent to his family. First, we went to her mantua-maker, 
then we drove to the Fair Grounds where the band was 
playing. Suddenly, she missed the watch. She remembered 
having it when we came out of the mantua-maker's. We 
drove beck instantly, and there the watch was lying near the 
steps of the little porch in front of the house. No one had 
passed in, apparently; in any case, no one had seen it. </p>
        <p>Preston Hampton went with me to see Conny Cary. The 
talk was frantically literary, which Preston thought hard on 
him. I had just brought the St. Denis number of Les 
Miserables.</p>
        <p>Sunday, Christopher Hampton walked to church with 
me. Coming out, General Lee was seen slowly making his 
way down the aisle, bowing royally to right and left. I 
pointed him out to Christopher Hampton when General Lee 
happened to look our way. He bowed low, giving me a 
charming smile of recognition. I was ashamed of being so 
pleased. I blushed like a schoolgirl.</p>
        <p>We went to the White House. They gave us tea. The 
President said he had been on the way to our house, coming 
with all the Davis family, to see me, but the children became 
so troublesome they turned back. Just then, little Joe rushed 
in and insisted on saying his prayers at his father's knee, 
then and there. He was in his night-clothes.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 19th</hi>.—A box has come from home for me. 
Taking  advantage of this good fortune and a full larder, 
have asked  Mrs. Davis to dine with me. Wade Hampton 
sent me a basket  of game. We had Mrs. Davis and Mr. and 
Mrs. Preston. After  dinner we walked to the church to see 
the Freeland-Lewis wedding. Mr. Preston had Mrs. Davis 
on his arm. My husband and Mrs. Preston, and Burton

Harrison and myself brought up the rear. Willie Allan joined 
us, and we had the pleasure of waiting one good hour. Then 
the beautiful Maria, loveliest of brides, sailed in on her 
father's arm, and Major John Coxe Lewis followed with 
Mrs. Freeland. After the ceremony such a kissing was there 
up and down the aisle. The happy bridegroom kissed wildly, 
and several girls complained, but he said: “How am I to 
know Maria's kin whom I was to kiss? It is better to show 
too much affection for one's new relations than too little.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 21st</hi>.—Joe Johnston has been 
made Commander-in-chief of the Army of 
the West. General Lee had this done, `tis 
said. Miss Agnes Lee and “little Robert”  
(as they fondly call General Lee's youngest 
son in this hero-worshiping community) 
called. They told us the President, General 
Lee, and General Elzey had gone out to look 
at the fortifications around Richmond. My 
husband came home saying he had been with 
them, and lent General Lee his gray horse.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Howell, Mrs. Davis's mother, says a year ago on 
the cars a man said, “We want a Dictator.” She replied, “Jeff 
Davis will never consent to be a Dictator.” The man turned 
sharply toward her  “And, pray, who asks him? Joe 
Johnston will be made Dictator by the Army of the West.”  
“Imperator” was suggested. Of late the Army of the West 
has not been in a condition to dictate to friend or foe. 
Certainly Jeff Davis did hate to put Joe Johnston at the head 
of what is left of it. Detached from General Lee, what a 
horrible failure is Longstreet!  Oh, for a day of Albert 
Sidney Johnston out West!  And Stonewall, could he come 
back to us here!</p>
        <p>General Hood, the wounded knight, came for me to drive. 
I felt that I would soon find myself chaperoning some girls, 
but I asked no questions. He improved the time between 
Franklin and Cary Streets by saying, “I do like your 
husband so much.” “So do I,” I replied simply.
<pb id="mches266" n="266"/>
Buck was ill in bed, so William said at the door, but she 
recovered her health and came down for the drive in 
black velvet and ermine, looking queenly. And then, with 
the top of the landau thrown back, wrapped in furs and 
rugs, we had a long drive that bitter cold day.</p>
        <p>One day as we were hieing us home from the Fair 
Grounds, Sam, the wounded knight, asked Brewster 
what are the symptoms of a man's being in love. Sam (Hood is 
called Sam entirely, but why I do not know) said for his 
part he did not know; at seventeen he had fancied himself 
in love, but that was “a long time ago.” Brewster spoke 
on the symptoms of love: “When you see her, your breath 
is apt to come short. If it amounts to mild strangulation, 
you have got it bad. You are stupidly jealous, glowering 
with jealousy, and have a gloomy fixed conviction  that 
she likes every fool you meet better than she does you,  
especially people that you know she has a thorough 
contempt for; that is, you knew it before you lost your 
head,  I mean, before you fell in love. The last stages of 
unmitigated spooniness, I will spare you,” said Brewster, 
with a giggle and a wave of the hand. “Well,” said Sam, 
drawing a breath of relief,  “I have felt none of these 
things so far, and yet they say I am engaged to four 
young ladies, a liberal allowance, you will admit, for a 
man who can not walk without help.”</p>
        <p>Another day (the Sabbath) we called on our way from 
church to see Mrs. Wigfall. She was ill, but Mr. Wigfall 
insisted upon taking me into the drawing-room to rest a 
while. He said Louly was there; so she was, and so was 
Sam Hood, the wounded knight, stretched at full length on 
a sofa and a rug thrown over him. Louis Wigfall said to 
me:   “Do you know General Hood?”  “Yes,” said I, and 
the General laughed with his eyes as I looked at him; but 
he did not say a word. I felt it a curious commentary upon 
the reports he had spoken of the day before. Louly Wigfall 
is a very handsome girl.</p>
        <pb id="mches267" n="267"/>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 24th</hi>.—As we walked, Brewster reported a row 
he had had with General Hood. Brewster had told those six 
young ladies at the Prestons' that “old Sam” was in the 
habit of saying he would not marry if he could any silly, 
sentimental girl, who would throw herself away upon a 
maimed creature such as he was. When Brewster went 
home he took pleasure in telling Sam how the ladies had 
complimented his good sense, whereupon the General rose 
in his wrath and threatened to break his crutch over 
Brewster's head. To think he could be such a fool—to go 
about repeating to everybody his whimperings.</p>
        <p>I was taking my seat at the head of the table when the 
door opened and Brewster walked in unannounced. He took 
his stand in front of the open door, with his hands in his 
pockets and his small hat pushed back as far as it could get 
from his forehead.</p>
        <p>“What!”  said he,  “you are not ready yet? The generals 
are below. Did you get my note?”  I begged my husband to excuse me 
and rushed off to put on my bonnet and furs. I met the girls 
coming up with a strange man. The flurry of two major-generals had 
been too much for me and I forgot to ask the new one's name. They 
went up to dine in my place with my husband, who sat eating his 
dinner, with Lawrence's undivided attention given to him, amid this 
whirling and eddying in and out of the world militant. Mary 
Preston and I then went to drive with the generals. The new 
one proved to be Bruckner,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref109" n="109" rend="sc" target="note109">1</ref> who is also a Kentuckian. The 
two men told us they had slept together the night before 
Chickamauga. It is useless to try: legs can't any longer be 
kept out of the conversation. So General Buckner said:          
“Once before I slept with a man and he lost his leg next 
day.”  He had made a vow never to do so

again.  “When Sam and I parted that morning, we said:       
‘You or I may be killed, but the cause will be safe all the 
same.’ ”</p>
        <p>After the drive everybody came in to tea, my husband in 
famous good humor, we had an unusually gay evening. It 
was very nice of my husband to take no notice of my 
conduct at dinner, which had been open to criticism. All the 
comfort of my life depends upon his being in good humor.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Christmas Day, 1863</hi>.—Yesterday dined with the 
Prestons. Wore one of my handsomest Paris dresses (from 
Paris before the war). Three magnificent Kentucky generals 
were present, with Senator Orr from South Carolina, and 
Mr. Miles. General Buckner repeated a speech of Hood's to 
him to show how friendly they were. “I prefer a ride with 
you to the company of any woman in the world,” Buckner 
had answered. “I prefer your company to that of any man, 
certainly,” was Hood's reply. This became the standing joke 
of the dinner; it flashed up in every form. Poor Sam got out 
of it so badly, if he got out of it at all. General Buckner said 
patronizingly, “Lame excuses, all. Hood never gets out of 
any scrape—that is, unless he can fight out.”  Others dropped 
in after dinner; some without arms, some without legs; von 
Borcke, who can not speak because of a wound in his throat. 
Isabella said: “We have all kinds now, but a blind one.” 
Poor fellows, they laugh at wounds. “And they yet can 
show many a scar.”</p>
        <p>We had for dinner oyster soup, besides roast mutton, 
ham, boned turkey, wild duck, partridge, plum pudding, 
sauterne, burgundy, sherry, and Madeira. There is life in the 
old land yet!</p>
        <p>At my house to-day after dinner, and while Alex Haskell 
and  my  husband  sat  over  the wine, Hood gave me an 
account of his discomfiture last night. He said he could not 
sleep  after it; it was the hardest battle he had ever fought in 
his life,   “and I was routed, as it were; she told me there 
was no hope; that ends it. You know at 
<pb id="mches269" n="269"/>
Petersburg on my way to the Western army she 
half-promised me to think of it. She would not say ‘Yes,’ 
but she did not say ‘No’—that is, not exactly. At any rate, I 
went off saying, ‘I am engaged to you,’ and she said, ‘I am 
not engaged to you.’  After I was so fearfully wounded I 
gave it up. But, then, since I came,” etc.</p>
        <p>“Do you mean to say,” said I, “that you had proposed 
to her before that conversation in the carriage, when you 
asked Brewster the symptoms of love?  I like your 
audacity.”  “Oh, she understood, but it is all up now, for 
she says, ‘No!’ ”</p>
        <p>My husband says I am extravagant. “No, my friend, not 
that,” said I. “I had fifteen hundred dollars and I have spent 
every cent of it in my housekeeping. Not one cent for 
myself, not one cent for dress nor any personal want 
whatever.”  He calls me “hospitality run mad.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 1, 1864</hi>.—General Hood's an awful flatterer— I 
mean an awkward flatterer. I told him to praise my husband 
to some one else, not to me. He ought to praise me to 
somebody who would tell my husband, and then praise my 
husband to another person who would tell me. Man and wife 
are too much one person—to wave a compliment straight in 
the face of one about the other is not graceful.</p>
        <p>One more year of Stonewall would have saved us. 
Chickamauga is the only battle we have gained since 
Stonewall died, and no results follow as usual. Stonewall 
was not so much as killed by a Yankee: he was shot by his 
own men; that is hard. General Lee can do no more than 
keep back Meade.  “One of Meade's armies, you mean,” said 
I, “for they have only to double on him when Lee whips one 
of them.”</p>
        <p>General Edward Johnston says he got Grant a place— 
<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">esprit de corps</hi></foreign>, you know. He could not bear to see an old 
army man driving a wagon; that was when he found him out 
West, put out of the army for habitual drunkenness. He is 
their right man, a bull-headed Suwarrow. He don't 
<pb id="mches270" n="270"/>
care a snap if men fall like the leaves fall; he fights to win, 
that chap does. He is not distracted by a thousand side 
issues; he does not see them. He is narrow and sure—sees 
only in a straight line. Like Louis Napoleon, from a battle in 
the gutter, he goes straight up. Yes, as with Lincoln, they 
have ceased to carp at him as a rough clown, no gentleman, 
etc. You never hear now of Lincoln's nasty fun; only of his 
wisdom. Doesn't take much soap and water to wash the 
hands that the rod of empire sway. They talked of Lincoln's 
drunkenness, too. Now, since Vicksburg they have not a 
word to say against Grant's habits. He has the disagreeable 
habit of not retreating before irresistible veterans. General 
Lee and Albert Sidney Johnston show blood and breeding. 
They are of the Bayard and Philip Sidney order of soldiers. 
Listen: if General Lee had had Grant's resources he would 
have bagged the last Yankee, or have had them all safe back 
in Massachusetts. “You mean if he had not the weight of 
the negro question upon him?”  “No, I mean if he had 
Grant's unlimited allowance of the powers of war—men, 
money, ammunition, arms.”</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ould says Mrs. Lincoln found the gardener of the 
White House so nice, she would make him a major-general. 
Lincoln remarked to the secretary: “Well, the little woman 
must have her way sometimes.”</p>
        <p>A word of the last night of the old year. “Gloria Mundi” 
sent me a cup of strong, good coffee. I drank two cups and 
so I did not sleep a wink. Like a fool I passed my whole life 
in review, and bitter memories maddened me quite. Then 
came a happy thought. I mapped out a story of the war. The 
plot came to hand, for it was true. Johnny is the hero, a light 
dragoon and heavy swell. I will call it F. F.'s, for it is the F. 
F.'s both of South Carolina and Virginia. It is to be a war 
story, and the filling out of the skeleton was the best way to 
put myself to sleep.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 4th</hi>.—Mrs. Ives wants us to translate a French 
play. A genuine French captain came in from his ship on
<pb id="mches271" n="271"/>
the James River and gave us good advice as to how to make 
the selection. General Hampton sent another basket of 
partridges, and all goes merry as a marriage bell.</p>
        <p>My husband came in and nearly killed us. He brought 
this piece of news: “North Carolina wants to offer terms of 
peace!”  We needed only a break of that kind to finish us. I 
really shivered nervously, as one does when the first handful 
of earth comes rattling down on the coffin in the grave of 
one we cared for more than all who are left.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 5th</hi>.—At Mrs. Preston's, met the Light Brigade 
in battle array, ready to sally forth, conquering and to 
conquer. They would stand no nonsense from me about 
staying at home to translate a French play. Indeed, the plays 
that have been sent us are so indecent I scarcely know where 
a play is to be found that would do at all.</p>
        <p>While at dinner the President's carriage drove up with 
only General Hood. He sent up to ask in Maggie Howell's 
name would I go with them? I tied up two partridges 
between plates with a serviette, for Buck, who is ill, and 
then went down. We picked up Mary Preston. It was 
Maggie's drive; as the soldiers say, I was only on “escort 
duty.” At the Prestons', Major Venable met us at the door 
and took in the partridges to Buck. As we drove off Maggie 
said: “Major Venable is a Carolinian, I see.”  “No; 
Virginian to the core.”  “But, then, he was a professor in 
the South Carolina College before the war.” Mary Preston 
said: “She is taking a fling at your weakness for all South 
Carolina.”</p>
        <p>Came home and found my husband in a bitter mood. It 
has all gone wrong with our world. The loss of our private 
fortune the smallest part. He intimates, “with so much 
human misery filling the air, we might stay at home and 
think.” “And go mad?” said I. “Catch me at it!  A yawning 
grave, with piles of red earth thrown on one side; that is the 
only future I ever see. You remember Emma Stockton?  She 
and I were as blithe as birds that day at 
<pb id="mches272" n="272"/>	
Mulberry. I came here the next day, and when I arrived a 
telegram said: ‘Emma Stockton found dead in her bed.’  
It is awfully near, that thought. No, no. I will not stop 
and think of death always.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 8th</hi>.—Snow of the deepest. Nobody can come 
to-day, I thought. But they did! My girls, first; then 
Constance Cary tripped in—the clever Conny. Hetty is the 
beauty, so called, though she is clever enough, too; but 
Constance is actually clever and has a classically perfect 
outline. Next came the four Kentuckians and Preston 
Hampton. He is as tall as the Kentuckians and ever so 
much better looking. Then we had egg-nog.</p>
        <p>I was to take Miss Cary to the Semmes's. My husband 
inquired the price of a carriage. It was twenty-five dollars  
an hour!  He cursed by all his gods at such extravagance. 
The play was not worth the candle, or carriage, in this 
instance. In Confederate money it sounds so much worse 
than it is. I did not dream of asking him to go with me after 
that lively overture.  “I did intend to go with you,” he said, 
“but you do not ask me.”    “And I have been asking you for 
twenty years to go with me, in vain. Think of that!”  I said, 
tragically. We could not wait for him to dress, so I sent the 
twenty-five-dollar-an-hour carriage back for him. We were 
behind time, as it was. When he came, the beautiful Hetty 
Cary and her friend, Captain Tucker, were with him. Major 
von Borcke and Preston Hampton were at the Cary's, in the 
drawing-room when we called for Constance, who was 
dressing. I challenge the world to produce finer specimens of 
humanity than these three: the Prussian von Borcke, Preston 
Hampton, and Hetty Cary.</p>
        <p>We spoke to the Prussian about the vote of thanks 
passed by Congress yesterday—“thanks of the country 
to Major von Borcke.”  The poor man was as modest as a  
girl—in spite of his huge proportions. “That is a 
compliment, indeed!”  said Hetty. “Yes.  I saw it.  And 
the 
<pb id="mches273" n="273"/>
happiest, the proudest day of my life as I read it. It was at 
the hotel breakfast-table. I try to hide my face with the 
newspaper, I feel it grow so red. But my friend he has his 
newspaper, too, and he sees the same thing. So he looks my 
way—he says, pointing to me—‘Why does he grow so red? 
He has got something there!’  and he laughs. Then I try to 
read aloud the so kind compliments of the Congress 
—but—he—you—I can not—”  He puts his hand to his throat. 
His broken English and the difficulty of his enunciation with 
that wound in his windpipe makes it all very touching—and 
very hard to understand.</p>
        <p>The Semmes charade party was a perfect success. The 
play was charming. Sweet little Mrs. Lawson Clay had a 
seat for me banked up among women. The female part of 
the congregation, strictly segregated from the male, were 
placed all together in rows. They formed a gay parterre, 
edged by the men in their black coats and gray uniforms. 
Toward the back part of the room, the mass of black and 
gray was solid. Captain Tucker bewailed his fate. He was 
stranded out there with those forlorn men, but could see us 
laughing, and fancied what we were saying was worth a 
thousand charades. He preferred talking to a clever woman 
to any known way of passing a pleasant hour. “So do I,” 
somebody said.</p>
        <p>On a sofa of    state  in  front  of  all sat the 
President and  Mrs.  Davis. Little Maggie  Davis  was 
one of the child  actresses.  Her  parents had a right 
to be proud of her;  with  her flashing  black eyes, she 
was a marked figure on the stage. She is a handsome creature 
and she acted her part admirably.  The shrine was beautiful 
beyond words. The Semmes  and Ives families are Roman 
Catholics, and understand  getting up that sort of thing. 
First came the “Palmers Gray,” then Mrs. Ives, a solitary 
figure, the loveliest of penitent women. The Eastern 
pilgrims were  delightfully costumed; we could not 
understand how  so  much  Christian piety could come 
clothed in such odalisque robes. Mrs. 
<pb id="mches274" n="274"/>
Ould, as a queen, was as handsome and regal as heart 
could wish for. She was accompanied by a very 
satisfactory king, whose name, if I ever knew, I have 
forgotten. There was a resplendent knight of St. John, 
and then an American Indian. After their orisons they all 
knelt and laid something on the altar as a votive gift.</p>
        <p>Burton Harrison, the President's handsome young 
secretary, was gotten up as a big brave in a dress 
presented to Mr. Davis by Indians for some kindness he 
showed them years ago. It was a complete warrior's outfit, 
scant as that is. The feathers stuck in the back of Mr. 
Harrison's head had a charmingly comic effect. He had to 
shave himself as clean as a baby or he could not act the 
beardless chief, Spotted Tail, Billy Bowlegs, Big Thunder, 
or whatever his character was. So he folded up his loved 
and lost mustache, the Christianized red Indian, and laid it 
on the altar, the most sacred treasure of his life, the 
witness of his most heroic sacrifice, on the shrine.</p>
        <p>Senator Hill, of Georgia, took me in to supper, 
where were ices, chicken salad, oysters, and champagne. The
President came in alone, I suppose, for while we were 
talking after supper and your humble servant was 
standing between Mrs. Randolph and Mrs. Stanard, he 
approached, offered me his arm and we walked off, 
oblivious of Mr. Senator Hill. Remember this, ladies, 
and forgive me for recording it, but Mrs. Stanard and 
Mrs. Randolph are the handsomest women in Richmond; 
I am no older than they are, or younger, either, sad to 
say. Now, the President walked with me slowly up and 
down that long room, and our conversation was of the 
saddest. Nobody knows so well as he the difficulties 
which beset this hard-driven Confederacy. He has a 
voice which is perfectly modulated, a comfort in this 
loud and rough soldier world. I think there is a 
melancholy cadence in his voice at times, of which he is 
unconscious when he talks of things as they are now.</p>
        <p>My husband was so intensely charmed with Hetty Cary 
<pb id="mches275" n="275"/>
that he declined at the first call to accompany his wife 
home in the twenty-five-dollar-an-hour carriage. He 
ordered it to return. When it came, his wife (a good 
manager) packed the Carys and him in with herself, leaving 
the other two men who came with the party, when it was 
divided into “trips,” to make their way home in the cold. 
At our door, near daylight of that bitter cold morning, I had 
the pleasure to see my husband, like a man, stand and pay 
for that carriage! To-day he is pleased with himself, with 
me, and with all the world; says if there was no such word 
as “fascinating” you would have to invent one to 
describe Hetty Cary.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 9th</hi>.—Met Mrs. Wigfall. She wants me to take 
Halsey to Mrs. Randolph's theatricals.  I am to get him up 
as Sir Walter Raleigh. Now, General Breckinridge has

here.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref110" n="110" rend="sc" target="note110">1</ref> These huge Kentuckians fill the town. Isabella says,    
“They hold Morgan accountable for the loss of

to tell why I like him so well.  Last night General Buckner 
came for her to go with him and rehearse at the Carys' for 
Mrs. Randolph's charades.</p>
        <p>The President's man, Jim, that he believed in as we all 
believe in our own servants,  “our own people,” as we call 
them, and Betsy, Mrs. Davis's maid, decamped last night. It 
is miraculous that they had the fortitude to resist the 
temptation so long. At Mrs. Davis's the hired servants all 
have been birds of passage. First they were seen with gold 
galore, and then they would fly to the Yankees, and I am 
sure they had nothing to tell. It is Yankee money wasted.

but he escaped and once more joined the Confederate army. In September, 
1864, he was killed in battle near Greenville, Tenn.</note>
<pb id="mches276" n="276"/>
I do not think it had ever crossed Mrs. Davis's brain that 
these two could leave her. She knew, however, that Betsy 
had eighty dollars in gold and two thousand four hundred 
dollars in Confederate notes. </p>
        <p>Everybody who comes in brings a little bad news—not 
much, in itself, but by cumulative process the effect is 
depressing, indeed.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 12th</hi>.—To-night there will be a great gathering 
of Kentuckians. Morgan gives them a dinner. The city of 
Richmond entertains John Morgan. He is at free quarters. 
The girls dined here. Conny Cary came back for more white 
feathers. Isabella had appropriated two sets and obstinately 
refused Constance Cary a single feather from her pile. She 
said, sternly: “I have never been on the stage before, and I 
have a presentiment when my father hears of this, I will 
never go again. I am to appear before the footlights as an 
English dowager duchess, and I mean to rustle in every 
feather, to wear all the lace and diamonds these two houses 
can compass”—(mine and Mrs. Preston's). She was jolly 
but firm, and Constance departed without any additional 
plumage for her Lady Teazle.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 14th</hi>.—Gave Mrs. White twenty-three dollars 
for a turkey. Came home wondering all the way why she did 
not ask twenty-five; two more dollars could not have made 
me balk at the bargain, and twenty-three sounds odd.</p>
        <p>January 15th.—What a day the Kentuckians have had! Mrs. 
Webb gave them a breakfast; from there they proceeded en 
masse to General Lawton's dinner, and then came straight 
here, all of which seems equal to one of Stonewall's forced 
marches. General Lawton took me in to supper. In spite of 
his dinner he had misgivings. “My heart is heavy,” said he, 
“even here. All seems too light, too careless, for such 
terrible times.  It seems out of place here in battle-scarred 
Richmond.”  “I have heard something of that kind at home,” 
I replied.  “Hope and fear are both gone, and it is 
distraction or death with us. I do not see
		
<pb id="mches277" n="277"/>
how sadness and despondency would help us. If it would do 
any good, we would be sad enough.”</p>
        <p>We laughed at General Hood. General Lawton thought 
him better fitted for gallantry on the battle-field than playing 
a lute in my lady's chamber. When Miss Giles was 
electrifying the audience as the Fair Penitent, some one said: 
“Oh, that is so pretty!”  Hood cried out with stern 
reproachfulness: “That is not pretty; it is elegant.”</p>
        <p>Not only had my house been rifled for theatrical 
properties, but as the play went on they came for my black 
velvet cloak. When it was over, I thought I should never get 
away, my cloak was so hard to find. But it gave me an 
opportunity to witness many things behind the scenes—that 
cloak hunt did. Behind the scenes! I know a little what that 
means now.</p>
        <p>General Jeb Stuart was at Mrs. Randolph's in his 
cavalry jacket and high boots. He was devoted to Hetty 
Cary. Constance Cary said to me, pointing to his stars,      
“Hetty likes them that way, you know—gilt-edged and with 
stars.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 16th</hi>—A visit from the President's handsome and 
accomplished secretary, Burton Harrison. I lent him 
Country Clergyman in Town and Elective Affinities. He is 
to bring me Mrs. Norton's Lost and Saved.</p>
        <p>At Mrs. Randolph's, my husband complimented one of 
the ladies, who had amply earned his praise by her splendid 
acting. She pointed to a young man, saying, “You see that 
wretch; he has not said one word to me!” My husband asked 
innocently, “Why should he? And why is he a wretch?”  
“Oh, you know!” Going home I explained this riddle to him; 
he is always a year behindhand in gossip.      “They said 
those two were engaged last winter, and now there seems to 
be a screw loose; but that sort of thing always comes right.”  
The Carys prefer James Chesnut to his wife. I don't mind. 
Indeed, I like it. I do, too.</p>
        <p>Every Sunday Mr. Minnegerode cried aloud in anguish 
his litany, “from pestilence and famine, battle, murder, 
<pb id="mches278" n="278"/>
and sudden death,” and we wailed on our knees, “Good 
Lord deliver us,” and on Monday, and all the week long, we 
go on as before, hearing of nothing but battle, murder, and 
sudden death, which are daily events. Now I have a new 
book; that is the unlooked-for thing, a pleasing incident in 
this life of monotonous misery. We live in a huge barrack. 
We are shut in, guarded from light without.</p>
        <p>At breakfast to-day came a card, and without an instant's 
interlude, perhaps the neatest, most fastidious man in South 
Carolina walked in. I was uncombed, unkempt, tattered, and 
torn, in my most comfortable, worst worn, wadded green 
silk dressing-gown, with a white woolen shawl over my head 
to keep off draughts. He has not been in the war yet, and 
now he wants to be captain of an engineer corps. I wish he 
may get it! He has always been my friend; so he shall lack 
no aid that I can give. If he can stand the shock of my 
appearance to-day, we may reasonably expect to continue 
friends until death. Of all men, the fastidious Barny 
Heywood to come in. He faced the situation gallantly. </p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 18th</hi>.—Invited to Dr. Haxall's last night to meet

        <p>Lamar was asked to dinner here yesterday; so he came 
to-day. We had our wild turkey cooked for him yesterday, 
and I dressed myself within an inch of my life with the best 
of my four-year-old finery. Two of us, my husband and I, 
did not damage the wild turkey seriously. So Lamar enjoyed 
the <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">réchauffé</hi></foreign>, and commended the art with which Molly 
had hid the slight loss we had inflicted upon its mighty 
breast. She had piled fried oysters over the turkey so 
skilfully, that unless we had told about it, no one would 
ever have known that the huge bird was making his second 
appearance on the board.</p>
        <p>Lamar was more absent-minded and distrait than ever. 
My husband behaved like a trump — a well-bred man, with 
all his wits about him; so things went off smoothly enough. 
Lamar had just read Romola. Across the water he said it 
was the rage. I am sure it is not as good as Adam Bede or 
Silas Marner. It is not worthy of the woman who was to     
“rival all but Shakespeare's name below.”  “What is the 
matter with Romola?”  he asked. “Tito is so mean, and he is 
mean in such a very mean way, and the end is so repulsive. 
Petting the husband's illegitimate children and left-handed 
wives may be magnanimity, but human nature revolts at it.”  
“Woman's nature, you mean!”  “Yes, and now another test. 
Two weeks ago I read this thing with intense interest, and 
already her Savonarola has faded from my mind. I have 
forgotten her way of showing Savonarola as completely as I 
always do forget Bulwer's Rienzi.”</p>
        <p>“Oh, I understand you now!  It is like Milton's devil—he 
has obliterated all other devils. You can't fix your mind upon 
any other. The devil always must be of Miltonic proportions 
or you do not believe in him; Goethe's Mephistopheles 
disputes the crown of the causeway with Lucifer. But soon 
you begin to feel that Mephistopheles to be a lesser devil, an 
emissary of the devil only. Is there any Cardinal Wolsey but 
Shakespeare's? any Mirabeau
<pb id="mches280" n="280"/>
but Carlyle's Mirabeau?  But the list is too long of those 
who have been stamped into your brain by genius. The 
saintly preacher, the woman who stands by Hetty and 
saves her soul; those heavenly minded sermons preached 
by the author of Adam Bede, bear them well in mind while 
I tell you how this writer, who so well imagines and depicts 
female purity and piety, was a governess, or something of 
that sort, and perhaps wrote for a living; at any rate, she 
had an elective affinity, which was responded to, by 
George Lewes, and so she lives with Lewes. I do not know 
that she caused the separation between Lewes and his legal 
wife. They are living in a villa on some Swiss lake, and 
Mrs. Lewes, of the hour, is a charitable, estimable, 
agreeable, sympathetic woman of genius.”</p>
        <p>Lamar seemed without prejudices on the subject; at 
least, he expressed neither surprise nor disapprobation. He 
said something of “genius being above law,” but I was not 
very clear as to what he said on that point. As for me I said 
nothing for fear of saying too much. “You know that 
Lewes is a writer,” said he. “Some people say the man she 
lives with is a noble man.”  “They say she is kind and 
good if—a fallen woman.” Here the conversation ended.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 20th</hi>.—And now comes a grand announcement 
made by the Yankee Congress. They vote one million of men 
to be sent down here to free the prisoners whom they will 
not take in exchange. I actually thought they left all these 
Yankees here on our hands as part of their plan to starve us 
out. All Congressmen under fifty years of age  are to leave 
politics and report for military duty or be conscripted. What 
enthusiasm there is in their councils! Confusion, rather, it 
seems to me! Mrs. Ould says “the men who frequent her 
house are more despondent now than ever since this thing 
began.”</p>
        <p>Our Congress is so demoralized, so confused, so 
depressed. They have asked the President, whom they have 
<pb id="mches281" n="281"/>
so hated, so insulted, so crossed and opposed and thwarted 
in every way, to speak to them, and advise them what to do.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 21st</hi>.—Both of us were too ill to attend Mrs. 
Davis's reception. It proved a very sensational one. First, a 
fire in the house, then a robbery—said to be an arranged 
plan of the usual bribed servants there and some escaped 
Yankee prisoners. To-day the Examiner is lost in wonder at 
the stupidity of the fire and arson contingent. If they had 
only waited a few hours until everybody was asleep; after a 
reception the household would be so tired and so sound 
asleep. Thanks to the editor's kind counsel maybe the arson 
contingent will wait and do better next time.</p>
        <p>Letters from home carried Mr. Chesnut off to-day. 
Thackeray is dead. I stumbled upon Vanity Fair for myself. 
I had never heard of Thackeray before. I think it was in 
1850. I know I had been ill at the New York Hotel,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref112" n="112" rend="sc" target="note112">1</ref> and 
when left alone, I slipped down-stairs and into a bookstore 
that I had noticed under the hotel, for something to read. 
They gave me the first half of Pendennis. I can recall now 
the very kind of paper it was printed on, and the 
illustrations, as they took effect upon me. And yet when I 
raved over it, and was wild for the other half, there were 
people who said it was slow; that Thackeray was evidently 
a coarse, dull, sneering writer; that he stripped human 
nature  bare, and made it repulsive, etc.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 22d</hi>.—At Mrs. Lyons's met another beautiful 
woman, Mrs. Penn, the wife of Colonel Penn, who is making 
shoes in a Yankee prison. She had a little son with her, 
barely two years old, a mere infant. She said to him,           
“ <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">Faites comme</hi></foreign> Butler.” The child crossed his eyes and 
made himself hideous, then laughed and rioted around as if 
he enjoyed the joke hugely.</p>

        <pb id="mches282" n="282"/>
        <p>Went to Mrs. Davis's. It was sad enough. Fancy having 
to be always ready to have your servants set your house on 
fire, being bribed to do it. Such constant robberies, such 
servants coming and going daily to the Yankees, carrying 
one's silver, one's other possessions, does not conduce to 
home happiness.</p>
        <p>Saw Hood on his legs once more. He rode off on a fine 
horse, and managed it well, though he is disabled in one 
hand, too. After all, as the woman said, “He has body 
enough left to hold his soul.”  “How plucky of him to ride 
a gay horse like that.”  “Oh, a Kentuckian prides himself 
upon being half horse and half man!”  “And the girl who 
rode beside him. Did you ever see a more brilliant beauty?
Three cheers for South Carolina!!”</p>
        <p>I imparted a plan of mine to Brewster. I would have a 
breakfast, a luncheon, a matinee, call it what you please, 
but I would try and return some of the hospitalities of this 
most hospitable people.  Just think of the dinners, suppers,
 breakfasts we have been to. People have no variety in war 
times, but they make up for that lack in exquisite cooking.</p>
        <p>“Variety?” said he. “You are hard to please, with 
terrapin stew, gumbo, fish, oysters in every shape, game, 
and wine—as good as wine ever is. I do not mention juleps,
claret cup, apple toddy, whisky punches and all that. I tell 
you it is good enough for me. Variety would spoil it. Such 
hams as these Virginia people cure; such home-made 
bread—there is no such bread in the world. Call yours a   
‘cold collation.’ ”  “Yes, I have eggs, butter, hams, game, 
everything from home; no stint just now; even fruit.”</p>
        <p>“You ought to do your best. They are so generous and 
hospitable and so unconscious of any merit, or exceptional 
credit, in the matter of hospitality.”   “They are no better 
than the Columbia people always were to us.”  So I fired 
up for my own country.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 23d</hi>.—My luncheon was a female affair 
exclusively. Mrs. Davis came early and found Annie and Tudie
<pb id="mches283" n="283"/>
making the chocolate. Lawrence had gone South with my 
husband; so we had only Molly for cook and parlor-maid. 
After the company assembled we waited and waited. Those 
girls were making the final arrangements. I made my way to 
the door, and as I leaned against it ready to turn the knob, 
Mrs. Stanard held me like Coleridge's Ancient Mariner, and 
told how she had been prevented by a violent attack of 
cramps from running the blockade, and how providential it 
all was. All this floated by my ear, for I heard Mary 
Preston's voice raised in high protest on the other side of the 
door. “Stop!” said she. “Do you mean to take away the 
whole dish?” “If you eat many more of those fried oysters 
they will be missed. Heavens! She is running away with a 
plug, a palpable plug, out of that jelly cake!”</p>
        <p>Later in the afternoon, when it was over and I was safe, 
for all had gone well and Molly had not disgraced herself 
before the mistresses of those wonderful Virginia cooks, 
Mrs. Davis and I went out for a walk. Barny Heyward and 
Dr. Garnett joined us, the latter bringing the welcome news 
that “Muscoe Russell's wife had come.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 25th</hi>.—The President walked home with me from 
church (I was to dine with Mrs. Davis). He walked so fast I 
had no breath to talk; so I was a good listener for once. The 
truth is I am too much afraid of him to say very much in his 
presence. We had such a nice dinner. After dinner Hood 
came for a ride with the President.</p>
        <p>Mr. Hunter, of Virginia, walked home with me. He made 
himself utterly agreeable by dwelling on his friendship and 
admiration of my husband. He said it was high time Mr. 
Davis should promote him, and that he had told Mr. Davis 
his opinion on that subject to-day.</p>
        <p>Tuesday, Barny Heyward went with me to the President's 
reception, and from there to a ball at the McFarlands'. 
Breckinridge alone of the generals  went  with us.  The 
others went to a supper given by Mr. Clay, of Alabama.
	
<pb id="mches284" n="284"/>
I had a long talk with Mr. Ould,  Mr. Benjamin, and Mr. 
Hunter. These men speak out their thoughts plainly 
enough. What they said means “We are rattling down hill, 
and nobody to put on the brakes.” I wore my black velvet, 
diamonds, and point lace. They are borrowed for all            
“theatricals,” but I wear them whenever they are at home.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 1st</hi>.—Mrs. Davis gave her “Luncheon  to 
Ladies Only” on Saturday. Many more persons there than 
at any of these luncheons which we have gone to before. 
Gumbo, ducks and olives, chickens in jelly, oysters, lettuce 
salad, chocolate cream, jelly cake, claret, champagne, etc., 
were the good things set before us.</p>
        <p>To-day, for a pair of forlorn shoes I have paid $85. 
Colonel Ives drew my husband's pay for me. I sent 
Lawrence for it (Mr. Chesnut ordered him back to us; we 
needed a man servant here). Colonel Ives wrote that he was 
amazed I should be willing to trust a darky with that great 
bundle of money, but it came safely. Mr. Petigru says you 
take your money to market in the market basket, and bring 
home what you buy in your pocket-book.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 5th</hi>.—When Lawrence handed me my 
husband's money (six hundred dollars it was) I said: “Now 
I am pretty sure you do not mean to go to the Yankees, for 
with that pile of money in your hands you must have 
known there was your chance.” He grinned, but said 
nothing.</p>
        <p>At the President's reception Hood had a perfect ovation. 
General Preston navigated him through the crowd, handling 
him as tenderly, on his crutches, as if he were the Princess 
of Wales's new-born baby that I read of to-day. It is bad 
for the head of an army to be so helpless. But old Blücher 
went to Waterloo in a carriage, wearing a bonnet on his 
head to shade his inflamed eyes—a heroic figure, truly; an 
old, red-eyed, bonneted woman, apparently, back in a 
landau. And yet, “Blücher to the rescue!”</p>
        <p>Afterward at the Prestons', for we left the President's
<pb id="mches285" n="285"/>
at an early hour. Major von Borcke was trying to teach 
them his way of pronouncing his own name, and reciting 
numerous travesties of it in this country, when Charles 
threw open the door, saying, “A gentleman has called for 
Major Bandbox.” The Prussian major acknowledged this to 
be the worst he had heard yet.</p>
        <p>Off to the Ives's theatricals.   I walked with General 
Breckinridge. Mrs. Clay's Mrs. Malaprop was beyond our 
wildest hopes. And she was in such bitter earnest when she 
pinched Conny Cary's (Lydia Languish's) shoulder and 
called her “an antricate little huzzy,” that Lydia showed she 
felt it, and next day the shoulder was black and blue. It was 
not that the actress had a grudge against Conny, but that she 
was intense.</p>
        <p>Even the back of Mrs. Clay's head was eloquent as she 
walked away. “But,” said General Breckinridge,  “watch 
Hood; he has not seen the play before and Bob Acres 
amazes him.” When he caught my eye, General Hood 
nodded to me and said, “I believe that fellow Acres is a 
coward.” “That's better than the play,” whispered 
Breckinridge,  “but it is all good from Sir Anthony down to 
Fag.”</p>
        <p>Between the acts Mrs. Clay sent us word to applaud. She 
wanted encouragement; the audience was too cold. General 
Breckinridge responded like a man. After that she was fired 
by thunders of applause, following his lead. Those mighty 
Kentuckians turned claqueurs,  were a host in themselves. 
Constance Cary not only acted well, but looked perfectly 
beautiful.</p>
        <p>During the farce Mrs. Clay came in with all her feathers, 
diamonds, and fallals,  and took her seat by me. Said 
General Breckinridge,  “What a splendid head of hair you 
have.” “And all my own,” said she. Afterward she said, 
they could not get false hair enough, so they put a pair of 
black satin boots on top of her head and piled hair over 
them.</p>
        <pb id="mches286" n="286"/>
        <p>We adjourned from Mrs. Ives's to Mrs. Ould's, where we 
had the usual excellent Richmond supper. We did not get 
home until three. It was a clear moonlight night—almost as 
light as day. As we walked along I said to General 
Breckinridge,  “You have spent a jolly evening.” “I do not 
know,” he answered. “I have asked myself more than once 
to-night, ‘Are you the same man who stood gazing down on 
the faces of the dead on that awful battle-field, The soldiers 
lying there stare at you with their eyes wide open. Is this the 
same world? Here and there?’ ”</p>
        <p>Last night, the great Kentucky contingent came in a 
body. Hood brought Buck in his carriage. She said she “did 
not like General Hood,” and spoke with a wild excitement in 
those soft blue eyes of hers—or, are they gray or brown?  
She then gave her reasons in the lowest voice, but loud and 
distinct enough for him to hear: “Why? He spoke so harshly 
to Cy,  his body-servant, as we got out of the carriage. I saw 
how he hurt Cy's feelings, and I tried to soothe Cy's 
mortification.” </p>
        <p>“You see, Cy nearly caused me to fall by his 
awkwardness, and I stormed at him,” said the General, 
vastly amused. “I hate a man who speaks roughly to those 
who dare not resent it,” said she. The General did own 
himself charmed with her sentiments, but seemed to think his 
wrong-doing all a good joke. He and Cy understand each 
other.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 9th</hi>.—This party for Johnny was the very nicest 
I have ever had, and I mean it to be my last. I sent word to 
the Carys to bring their own men. They came alone, saying, 
“they did not care for men.”  “That means a raid on ours,” 
growled Isabella. Mr. Lamar was devoted to Constance 
Cary.   He is a free lance; so that created no heart-burning.</p>
        <p>Afterward, when the whole thing was over, and a success, 
the lights put out, etc., here trooped in the four girls, who 
stayed all night with me. In dressing-gowns they 
<pb id="mches287" n="287"/>
stirred up a hot fire, relit the gas, and went in for their 
supper; <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">réchauffé</hi></foreign> was the word, oysters, hot coffee, etc. 
They kept it up till daylight.</p>
        <p>Of course, we slept very late. As they came in to 
breakfast, I remarked, “The church-bells have been going 
on like mad. I take it as a rebuke to our breaking the 
Sabbath. You know Sunday began at twelve o'clock last 
night.” “It sounds to me like fire-bells,” somebody said.</p>
        <p>Soon the Infant dashed in, done up in soldier's clothes:    
“The Yankees are upon us!” said he. “Don't you hear the 
alarm-bells? They have been ringing day and night!”  Alex 
Haskell came; he and Johnny went off to report to Custis 
Lee and to be enrolled among his “locals,” who are always 
detailed for the defense of the city. But this time the attack 
on Richmond has proved a false alarm.</p>
        <p>A new trouble at the President's house: their trusty man, 
Robert, broken out with the smallpox.</p>
        <p>We went to the Webb ball, and such a pleasant time we 
had. After a while the P. M. G. (Pet Major-General) took 
his seat in the comfortable chair next to mine, and declared 
his determination to hold that position. Mr. Hunter and Mr. 
Benjamin essayed to dislodge him. Mrs. Stanard said: 
“Take him in the flirtation room; there he will soon be 
captured and led away,” but I did not know where that 
room was situated. Besides, my bold Texan made a most 
unexpected sally: “I will not go, and I will prevent her from 
going with any of you.”  Supper was near at hand, and Mr. 
Mallory said: “Ask him if the varioloid is not at his house. I 
know it is.”  I started as if I were shot, and I took Mr. Clay's 
arm and went in to supper, leaving the P. M. G. to the girls. 
Venison and everything nice.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 12th</hi>.—John Chesnut had a basket of 
champagne carried to my house, oysters, partridges, and 
other good things, for a supper after the reception. He is 
going back to the army to-morrow.</p>
        <p>James Chesnut arrived on Wednesday. He has been 
<pb id="mches288" n="288"/>
giving Buck his opinion of one of her performances last 
night. She was here, and the General's carriage drove up, 
bringing some of our girls. They told her he could not come 
up and he begged she would go down there for a moment. 
She flew down, and stood ten minutes in that snow, Cy 
holding the carriage-door open.  “But, Colonel Chesnut, 
there was no harm. I was not there ten minutes. I could not 
get in the carriage because I did not mean to stay one 
minute. He did not hold my hands—that is, not half the 
time—Oh, you saw!—well, he did kiss my hands. Where is 
the harm of that?”  All men worship Buck. How can they 
help it, she is so lovely.</p>
        <p>Lawrence has gone back ignominiously to South 
Carolina. At breakfast already in some inscrutable way he 
had become intoxicated; he was told to move a chair, and he 
raised it high over his head, smashing Mrs. Grundy's 
chandelier. My husband said : “Mary, do tell Lawrence to 
go home; I am too angry to speak to him.” So Lawrence 
went without another word. He will soon be back, and when 
he comes will say, “Shoo!! I knew Mars Jeems could not do 
without me.” And indeed he can not.</p>
        <p>Buck, reading my journal, opened her beautiful eyes in 
amazement and said: “So little do people know themselves! 
See what you say of me!” I replied: “The girls heard him 
say to you, ‘Oh, you are so childish and so sweet!’  Now, 
Buck, you know you are not childish. You have an 
abundance of strong common sense. Don't let men adore you 
so—if you can help it. You are so unhappy about men who 
care for you, when they are killed.”</p>
        <p>Isabella says that war leads to love-making. She says 
these soldiers do more courting here in a day  than they 
would do at home, without a war, in ten years.</p>
        <p>In the pauses of conversation, we hear, “She is the noblest 
woman God ever made!”  “Goodness!” exclaims Isabella. 
“Which one?” The amount of courting we hear in these 
small rooms. Men have to go to the front, and they 
<pb id="mches289" n="289"/>
say their say desperately. I am beginning to know all 
about it. The girls tell me. And I overhear—I can not help 
it. But this style is unique, is it not? “Since I saw you—last 
year—standing by the turnpike gate, you know- my 
battle-cry has been: ‘God, my country, and you!’ ” So 
many are lame. Major Venable says: “It is not  ‘the devil 
on two sticks,’ now; the farce is ‘Cupid on Crutches.’ ”</p>
        <p>General Breckinridge's voice broke in: “They are my 
cousins. So I determined to kiss them good-by. Good-by 
nowadays is the very devil, it means forever, in all 
probability, you know; all the odds against us. So I 
advanced to the charge soberly, discreetly, and in the fear 
of the Lord. The girls stood in a row—four of the very 
prettiest I ever saw.”  Sam, with his eyes glued to the 
floor, cried: “You were afraid—you backed out.” “But I 
did nothing of the kind. I kissed every one of them 
honestly, heartily.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 13th</hi>.—My husband is writing out some 
resolutions for the Congress. He is very busy, too, trying to 
get some poor fellows reprieved. He says they are good 
soldiers but got into a scrape. Buck came in. She had on 
her last winter's English hat, with the pheasant's wing. Just 
then Hood entered most unexpectedly. Said the blunt 
soldier to the girl: “You look mighty pretty in that hat; you 
wore it at the turnpike gate, where I surrendered at first 
sight.” She nodded and smiled, and flew down the steps 
after Mr. Chesnut, looking back to say that she meant to 
walk with him as far as the Executive Office.</p>
        <p>The General walked to the window and watched until the 
flutter of her garment was gone. He said: “The President 
was finding fault with some of his officers in command, and 
I said: ‘Mr. President, why don't you come and lead us 
yourself; I would follow you to the death.’ ”  “Actually, if you 
stay here in Richmond much longer you will grow to be a 
courtier. And you came a rough Texan.”</p>
        <pb id="mches290" n="290"/>
        <p>Mrs. Davis and General McQueen came. He tells me 
Muscoe Garnett is dead. Then the best and the cleverest 
Virginian I know is gone. He was the most scholarly man 
they had, and his character was higher than his 
requirements.</p>
        <p>To-day a terrible onslaught was made upon the 
President for nepotism. Burton Harrison's and John Taylor 
Wood's letters denying the charge that the President's cotton 
was unburned, or that he left it to be bought by the 
Yankees, have enraged the opposition. How much these 
people in the President's family have to bear! I have never 
felt so indignant.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 16th</hi>.—Saw in Mrs. Howell's room the little 
negro Mrs. Davis rescued yesterday from his brutal negro 
guardian. The child is an orphan. He was dressed up in 
little Joe's clothes and happy as a lord. He was very anxious 
to show me his wounds and bruises, but I fled. There are 
some things in life too sickening, and cruelty is one of them.</p>
        <p>Somebody said: “People who knew General Hood 
before the war said there was nothing in him. As for losing 
his property by the war, some say he never had any, and 
that West Point is a pauper's school, after all. He has only 
military glory, and that he has gained since the war began.”</p>
        <p>“Now,” said Burton Harrison, “only military glory! I like 
that! The glory and the fame he has gained during the 
war—that is Hood. What was Napoleon before Toulon?  
Hood has the impassive dignity of an Indian chief. He has 
always a little court around him of devoted friends. Wigfall, 
himself, has said he could not get within Hood's lines.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 17th</hi>.—Found everything in Main Street 
twenty per cent dearer. They say it is due to the new 
currency bill.</p>
        <p>I asked my husband: “Is General Johnston ordered to 
reenforce Polk, They said he did not understand the 
order.”
<pb id="mches291" n="291"/>
“After five days' delay,” he replied. “They say Sherman is 
marching to Mobile.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref113" n="113" rend="sc" target="note113">1</ref> When they once get inside of our 
armies what is to molest them, unless it be women with 
broomsticks?”  General Johnston writes that “the Governor 
of Georgia refuses him provisions and the use of his roads.” 
The Governor of Georgia writes: “The roads are open to 
him and in capital condition. I have furnished him 
abundantly with provisions from time to time, as he desired 
them.”  I suppose both of these letters are placed away side 
by side in our archives.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 20th</hi>.—Mrs. Preston was offended by the story 
of Buck's performance at the Ive's. General Breckinridge 
told her “it was the most beautifully unconscious act he 
ever saw.”  The General was leaning against the wall, 
Buck standing guard by him “on her two feet.”  The crowd 
surged that way, and she held out her arm to protect him 
from the rush. After they had all passed she handed him his 
crutches, and they, too, moved slowly away. Mrs. Davis 
said: “Any woman in Richmond would have done the same 
joyfully, but few could do it so gracefully. Buck is made so 
conspicuous by her beauty, whatever she does can not fail 
to attract attention.”</p>
        <p>Johnny stayed at home only one day; then went to his 
plantation, got several thousand Confederate dollars, and in 
the afternoon drove out with Mrs. K—. At the Bee Store 
he spent a thousand of his money; bought us gloves and 
linen. Well, one can do without gloves, but linen is next to 
life itself.</p>
        <p>Yesterday the President walked home from church with 
me. He said he was so glad to see my husband at church; 
had never seen him there before remarked on how well he
<note id="note113" n="113" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref113">1. General Polk, commanding about 24,000 men scattered throughout 
Mississippi and Alabama, found it impossible to check the advance of 
Sherman at the head of some 40,000, and moved from Meridian south to 
protect Mobile. February 16, 1864, Sherman took possession of Meridian.</note>
<pb id="mches292" n="292"/>
looked, etc. I replied that he looked so well “because you 
have never before seen him in the part of ‘the right man in 
the right place.’ ” My husband has no fancy for being 
planted in pews, but he is utterly Christian in his creed.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 23d</hi>.—At the President's, where General Lee 
breakfasted, a man named Phelan told General Lee all he 
ought to do; planned a campaign for him. General Lee 
smiled blandly the while, though he did permit himself a 
mild sneer at the wise civilians in Congress who refrained 
from trying the battle-field in person, but from afar dictated 
the movements of armies. My husband said that, to his 
amazement, General Lee came into his room at the 
Executive Office to “pay his respects and have a talk.”  
“Dear me! Goodness gracious!” said I. “That was a 
compliment from the head of the army, the very first man in 
the world, we Confederates think.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 24th</hi>.—Friends came to make taffy and stayed 
the livelong day. They played cards. One man, a soldier, had 
only two teeth left in front and they lapped across each 
other. On account of the condition of his mouth, he had 
maintained a dignified sobriety of aspect, though he told 
some funny stories. Finally a story was too much for him, 
and he grinned from ear to ear. Maggie gazed, and then 
called out as the negro fiddlers call out dancing figures, 
 “Forward two and cross over!” Fancy our faces. The hero of 
the two teeth, relapsing into a decorous arrangement of 
mouth, said: “Cavalry are the eyes of an army; they 
bring the news; the artillery are the boys to make a noise; 
but the infantry do the fighting, and a general or so gets all 
the glory.”</p>
        <p>February 26th.—We went to see Mrs. Breckinridge, who 
is here with her husband. Then we paid our respects to Mrs. 
Lee. Her room was like an industrial school: everybody so 
busy. Her daughters were all there plying their needles, with 
several other ladies. Mrs. Lee showed us a beautiful sword, 
recently sent to the General by some Marylanders,
<pb id="mches293" n="293"/>
now in Paris. On the blade was engraved, “<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">Aide toi et 
Dieu t'aidera</hi></foreign>.”  When we came out someone said, “Did 
you see how the Lees spend their time? What a rebuke to 
the taffy parties!”</p>
        <p>Another maimed hero is engaged to be married. Sally
Hampton has accepted John Haskell. There is a story that
he reported for duty after his arm was shot off; suppose in
the fury of the battle he did not feel the pain.</p>
        <p>General Breckinridge once asked, “What's the name 
of the fellow who has gone to Europe for Hood's leg?”  
“Dr. Darby.”  “Suppose it is shipwrecked?”  “No 
matter; half a dozen are ordered.”  Mrs. Preston raised 
her hands: “No wonder the General says they talk of him as if he 
were a centipede; his leg is in everybody's mouth.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 3d</hi>.—Hetty, the handsome, and Constance, the 
witty, came; the former too prudish to read Lost and 
Saved, by Mrs. Norton, after she had heard the plot. 
Conny was making a bonnet for me. Just as she was leaving the 
house, her friendly labors over, my husband entered, and 
quickly ordered his horse. “It is so near dinner,” I began. 
“But I am going with the President. I am on duty. He 
goes to inspect the fortifications. The enemy, once more, 
are within a few miles of Richmond.” Then we prepared 
a luncheon for him. Constance Cary remained with me.</p>
        <p>After she left I sat down to Romola, and I was 
absorbed in  it.  How  hardened  we grow to war and 
war's alarms! The enemy's cannon or our own are 
thundering in my ears, and I was dreadfully afraid some 
infatuated and frightened friend  would  come in to cheer, 
to comfort, and interrupt me.  Am I  the  same  poor  soul  
who  fell  on  her  knees and prayed, and wept, and 
fainted, as the first gun boomed from  Fort  Sumter?   
Once more we have repulsed the enemy.  But  it  is  
humiliating,  indeed, that he can come and  threaten  us  at 
our very gates whenever he so pleases. If  a  forlorn  
negro  had not led them astray (and they hanged him for 
it) on Tuesday night, unmolested, they 
<pb id="mches294" n="294"/>
would have walked into Richmond. Surely there is horrid 
neglect or mismanagement somewhere.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 4th</hi>.—The enemy has been reenforced and is on us 
again. Met Wade Hampton, who told me my husband was 
to join him with some volunteer troops; so I hurried home. 
Such a cavalcade rode up to luncheon!  Captain Smith Lee 
and Preston Hampton, the handsomest, the oldest and the 
youngest of the party. This was at the Prestons'. Smith Lee 
walked home with me; alarm-bells ringing; horsemen 
galloping; wagons rattling. Dr. H. stopped us to say  
“Beast”  Butler was on us with sixteen thousand men. How 
scared the Doctor looked! And, after all, it was only a notice 
to the militia to turn out and drill.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 5th</hi>.—Tom Fergurson walked home with me. He 
told me of Colonel Dahlgren's<ref targOrder="U" id="ref114" n="114" rend="sc" target="note114">1</ref>  death and the horrid 
memoranda found in his pocket. He came with secret orders 
to destroy this devoted city, hang the President and his 
Cabinet, and burn the town! Fitzhugh Lee was proud that 
the Ninth Virginia captured him.</p>
        <p>Found Mrs. Semmes covering her lettuces and radishes 
as calmly as if Yankee raiders were a myth. While “Beast” 
Butler holds Fortress Monroe he will  make things lively 
for us. On the alert must we be now.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 7th</hi>.—Shopping,  and paid  $30 for a pair of gloves;  $50 
for a pair of slippers;  $24 for six spools of thread;  $32 for 
five miserable, shabby little pocket handkerchiefs. When I 
came home found Mrs. Webb. At her hospital there was a 
man who had been taken prisoner by Dahlgren's party. He 
saw the negro hanged who had misled
<note id="note114" n="114" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref114">1.  Colonel Ulric Dahlgren was a son of the noted Admiral, John H. 
Dahlgren, who, in July, 1863, had been placed in command of the South 
Atlantic Blockading Squadron and conducted the naval operations against 
Charleston, between July 10 and September 7, 1863. Colonel Dahlgren 
distinguished himself at Fredericksburg, Chancellorsville and Gettysburg. 
The raid in which he lost his life on March 4, 1864, was planned by 
himself and General Kilpatrick.</note>

led them, unintentionally, in all probability. He saw 
Dahlgren give a part of his bridle to hang him. Details are 
melancholy, as Emerson says. This Dahlgren had also lost 
a leg.</p>
        <p>Constance Cary, in words too fine for the occasion, 
described the homely scene at my house; how I prepared 
sandwiches for my husband; and broke, with trembling 
hand, the last bottle of anything to drink in the house, a 
bottle I destined to go with the sandwiches. She called it a 
Hector and Andromache performance.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 8th</hi>.—Mrs. Preston's story. As we walked home, 
she told me she had just been to see a lady she had known 
more than twenty years before. She had met her in this wise: 
One of the chambermaids of the St. Charles Hotel (New 
Orleans) told Mrs. Preston's nurse it was when Mary 
Preston was a baby—that up among the servants in the 
garret there was a sick lady and her children. The maid was 
sure she was a lady, and thought she was hiding from 
somebody. Mrs. Preston went up, knew the lady, had her 
brought down into comfortable rooms, and nursed her until 
she recovered from her delirium and fever. She had run 
away, indeed, and was hiding herself and her children from 
a worthless husband. Now, she has one son in a Yankee 
prison, one mortally wounded, and the last of them dying 
there under her eyes of consumption. This last had married 
here in Richmond, not wisely, and too soon, for he was a 
mere boy; his pay as a private was eleven dollars a month, 
and his wife's family charged him three hundred dollars a 
month for her board; so he had to work double tides, do odd 
jobs by night and by day, and it killed him by exposure to 
cold in this bitter climate to which his constitution was 
unadapted.</p>
        <p>They had been in Vicksburg during the siege, and during 
the bombardment sought refuge in a cave. The roar of the 
cannon ceasing, they came out gladly for a breath of fresh 
air. At the moment when they emerged, a bomb burst
<pb id="mches296" n="296"/>
there, among them, so to speak, struck the son already 
wounded, and smashed off the arm of a beautiful little 
grandchild not three years old. There was this poor little girl 
with her touchingly lovely face, and her arm gone. This 
mutilated little martyr, Mrs. Preston said, was really to her 
the crowning touch of the woman's affliction. Mrs. Preston 
put up her hand, “Her baby face haunts me.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 11th</hi>.—Letters from home, including one from my 
husband's father, now over ninety, written with his own 
hand, and certainly his own mind still. I quote: “Bad times; 
worse coming. Starvation stares me in the face. Neither 
John's nor James's overseer will sell me any corn.”  Now, 
what has the government to do with the fact that on all his 
plantations he made corn enough to last for the whole year, 
and by the end of January his negroes had stolen it all, Poor 
old man, he has fallen on evil days, after a long life of ease 
and prosperity.</p>
        <p>To-day, I read The Blithedale Romance. Blithedale 
leaves such an unpleasant impression. I like pleasant, kindly 
stories, now that we are so harrowed by real life. Tragedy is 
for our hours of ease.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 12th</hi>.—An active campaign has begun 
everywhere. Kilpatrick still threatens us. Bragg has 
organized his fifteen hundred of cavalry to protect 
Richmond. Why can't my husband be made colonel of that? 
It is a new regiment. No; he must be made a general!</p>
        <p>“Now,” says Mary Preston, “Doctor Darby is at the mercy 
of both Yankees and the rolling sea, and I am anxious 
enough; but, instead of taking my bed and worrying 
mamma, I am taking stock of our worldly goods and trying 
to arrange the wedding paraphernalia for two girls.”</p>
        <p>There is love-making and love-making in this world. 
What a time the sweethearts of that wretch, young 
Shakespeare,   must  have  had.  What  experiences of  
life's delights  must  have  been  his  before  he 
evolved the  Romeo and Juliet business from his own 
internal consciousness; also that delicious
<pb id="mches297" n="297"/>
Beatrice and Rosalind. The poor creature that he left his 
second best bedstead to came in second best all the time, no 
doubt; and she hardly deserved more. Fancy people 
wondering that Shakespeare and his kind leave no progeny 
like themselves! Shakespeare's children would have been 
half his only; the other half only the second best bedstead's. 
What would you expect of that commingling of materials? 
Goethe used his lady-loves as school-books are used: he 
studied them from cover to cover, got all that could be got 
of self-culture and knowledge of human nature from the 
study of them, and then threw them aside as if of no further 
account in his life.</p>
        <p>Byron never could forget Lord Byron, poet and peer, 
and <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">mauvais sujet</hi></foreign>, and he must have been a trying lover; 
like talking to a man looking in the glass at himself. Lady 
Byron was just as much taken up with herself. So, they 
struck each other, and bounded apart.</p>
        <p>[Since I wrote this, Mrs. Stowe has taken Byron in hand. 
But I know a story which might have annoyed my lord more 
than her and Lady Byron's imagination of wickedness—for 
he posed a fiend, but was tender and kind. A clerk in a 
country store asked my sister to lend him a book, he  
“wanted something to read; the days were so long.” “What 
style of book would you prefer?” she said. “Poetry.” “Any 
particular poet?” “<hi rend="italics">Brown</hi>. I hear him much spoken of.” 
“Brown<hi rend="italics">ing</hi>?” “No; Brown—short—that is what they call 
him.”  “Byron, you mean.” “No, I mean the poet, Brown.”]</p>
        <p>“Oh, you wish you had lived in the time of the 
Shakespeare creature!”  He knew all the forms and phases 
of true love. Straight to one's heart he goes in tragedy or 
comedy. He never misses fire. He has been there, in slang 
phrase. No doubt the man's bare presence gave pleasure to 
the female world; he saw women at their best, and he 
effaced himself. He told no tales of his own life. Compare 
with him old, sad, solemn, sublime, sneering, snarling, 
<pb id="mches298" n="298"/>
fault-finding Milton, a man whose family doubtless found    
“<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">les absences délicieuses</hi></foreign>.”  That phrase describes a type 
of man at a touch; it took a Frenchwoman to do it.</p>
        <p>“But there is an Italian picture of Milton, taken in his 
youth, and he was as beautiful as an angel.” “No doubt. But 
love flies before everlasting posing and preaching—the 
deadly requirement of a man always to be looked up to-a 
domestic tyrant, grim, formal, and awfully learned. Milton 
was only a mere man, for he could not do without women. 
When he tired out the first poor thing, who did not fall 
down, worship, and obey him, and see God in him, and she 
ran away, he immediately arranged his creed so that he 
could take another wife; for wife he must have, a la 
Mohammedan creed. The deer-stealer never once thought of 
justifying theft simply because he loved venison and could 
not come by it lawfully. Shakespeare was a better man, or, 
may I say, a purer soul, than self-upholding, Calvinistic, 
Puritanic, king-killing Milton. There is no muddling of right 
and wrong in Shakespeare, and no pharisaical stuff of any 
sort.”</p>
        <p>Then George Deas joined us, fresh from Mobile, where 
he left peace and plenty. He went to sixteen weddings and 
twenty-seven tea-parties. For breakfast he had everything 
nice. Lily told of what she had seen the day before at the 
Spottswood.. She was in the small parlor, waiting for 
someone, and in the large drawing-room sat Hood, solitary, 
sad, with crutches by his chair. He could not see them. Mrs. 
Buckner came in and her little girl who, when she spied 
Hood, bounded into the next room, and sprang into his lap. 
Hood smoothed her little dress down and held her close to 
him. She clung around his neck for a while, and then, seizing 
him by the beard, kissed him to an illimitable extent.             
“Prettiest picture I ever saw,” said Lily. “The soldier and 
the child.”</p>
        <p>John R. Thompson sent me a New York Herald only 
three days old. It is down on Kilpatrick for his miserable 
<pb id="mches299" n="299"/>
failure before Richmond. Also it acknowledges a defeat 
before Charleston and a victory for us in Florida.</p>
        <p>General Grant is charmed with Sherman's successful 
movements; says he has destroyed millions upon millions of 
our property in Mississippi. I hope that may not be true, 
and that Sherman may fail as Kilpatrick did. Now, if we 
still had Stonewall or Albert Sidney Johnston where Joe 
Johnston and Polk are, I would not give a fig for Sherman's 
chances. The Yankees say that at last they have scared up a 
man who succeeds, and they expect him to remedy all that 
has gone wrong. So they have made their brutal Suwarrow, 
Grant, lieutenant-general.</p>
        <p>Doctor— at the Prestons' proposed to show me a man who 
was not an F. F. V. Until we came here, we had never heard 
of our social position. We do not know how to be rude to 
people who call. To talk of social position seems vulgar. 
Down our way, that sort of thing was settled one way or 
another beyond a peradventure, like the earth and the sky. 
We never gave it a thought. We talked to whom, we pleased, 
and if they were not <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">comme il faut</hi></foreign>, we were ever so much 
more polite to the poor things. No reflection on Virginia. 
Everybody comes to Richmond.</p>
        <p>Somebody counted fourteen generals in church to-day, 
and suggested that less piety and more drilling of 
commands would suit the times better. There were Lee, 
Longstreet, Morgan, Hoke, Clingman, Whiting, Pegram, 
Elzey, Gordon, and Bragg. Now, since Dahlgren failed to 
carry out his orders, the Yankees disown them, disavowing 
all. He was not sent here to murder us all, to hang the 
President, and burn the town. There is the note-book, 
however, at the Executive Office, with orders to hang and 
burn.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 15th</hi>.—Old Mrs. Chesnut is dead. A saint is gone 
and James Chesnut is broken-hearted. He adored his mother. 
I gave $375 for my mourning, which consists of a black 
alpaca dress and a crepe veil. With bonnet, gloves, and all
		
<pb id="mches300" n="300"/>
it came to $500. Before the blockade such things as I have 
would not have been thought fit for a chamber-maid.</p>
        <p>Everybody is in trouble. Mrs. Davis says paper money 
has depreciated so much in value that they can not live 
within their income; so they are going to dispense with their 
carriage and horses.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 18th</hi>.—Went out to sell some of my colored 
dresses. What a scene it was—such piles of rubbish, and 
mixed up with it, such splendid Parisian silks and satins. A 
mulatto woman kept the shop under a roof in an out-of-
the-way old house. The <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">ci-devant</hi></foreign> rich white women sell to, 
and the negroes buy of, this woman.</p>
        <p>After some whispering among us Buck said: “Sally is 
going to marry a man who has lost an arm, and she is proud 
of it. The cause glorifies such wounds.”  Annie said meekly, 
“I fear it will be my fate to marry one who has lost his 
head.”  “Tudy has her eyes on one who has lost an eye. 
What a glorious assortment of noble martyrs and heroes!”   
“The bitterness of this kind of talk is appalling.”</p>
        <p>General Lee had tears in his eyes when he spoke of his 
daughter-in-law just dead—that lovely little Charlotte 
Wickham, Mrs. Roony Lee. Roony Lee says “Beast” 
Butler was very kind to him while he was a prisoner. The  
“Beast” has sent him back his war-horse. The Lees are men 
enough to speak the truth of friend or enemy, fearing not the 
consequences.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 19th</hi>.—A new experience: Molly and Lawrence 
have both gone home, and I am to be left for the first time in 
my life wholly at the mercy of hired servants. Mr. Chesnut, 
being in such deep mourning for his mother, we see no 
company. I have a maid of all work.</p>
        <p>Tudy came with an account of yesterday's trip to 
Petersburg. Constance Cary raved of the golden ripples in 
Tudy's hair. Tudy vanished in a halo of glory, and 
Constance Cary gave me an account of a wedding, as it was 
given to her by Major von Borcke. The bridesmaids were 
<pb id="mches301" n="301"/>
dressed in black, the bride in Confederate gray, homespun. 
She had worn the dress all winter, but it had been washed 
and turned for the wedding. The female critics pronounced it 
“flabby-dabby.” They also said her collar was only       
“net,” and she wore a cameo breastpin. Her bonnet was 
self-made.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 24th</hi>.—Yesterday, we went to the Capitol grounds 
to see our returned prisoners. We walked slowly up and 
down until Jeff Davis was called upon to speak. There I 
stood, almost touching the bayonets when he left me. I 
looked straight into the prisoners' faces, poor fellows. They 
cheered with all their might, and I wept for sympathy, and 
enthusiasm. I was very deeply moved. These men were so 
forlorn, so dried up, and shrunken, with such a strange look 
in some of their eyes; others so restless and wild-looking; 
others again placidly vacant, as if they had been dead to the 
world for years. A poor woman was too much for me. She 
was searching for her son. He had been expected back. She 
said he was taken prisoner at Gettysburg. She kept going in 
and out among them with a basket of provisions she had 
brought for him to eat. It was too pitiful. She was utterly 
unconscious of the crowd. The anxious dread, expectation, 
hurry, and hope which led her on showed in her face.</p>
        <p>A sister of Mrs. Lincoln is here. She brings the freshest 
scandals from Yankeeland. She says she rode with Lovejoy. 
A friend of hers commands a black regiment. Two Southern 
horrors—a black regiment and Lovejoy.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 31st</hi>.—Met Preston Hampton. Constance Cary was 
with me. She showed her regard for him by taking his 
overcoat and leaving him in a drenching rain. What boyish 
nonsense he talked; said he was in love with Miss Dabney 
now, that his love was so hot within him that he was 
waterproof, the rain sizzed and smoked off. It did not so 
much as dampen his ardor or his clothes.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 1st</hi>.—Mrs. Davis is utterly depressed. She said 
<pb id="mches302" n="302"/>
the fall of Richmond must come; she would send her 
children to me and Mrs. Preston. We begged her to come to 
us also. My husband is as depressed as I ever knew him to 
be. He has felt the death of that angel mother of his keenly, 
and now he takes his country's woes to heart.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 11th</hi>.—Drove with Mrs. Davis and all her infant 
family; wonderfully clever and precocious children, with 
unbroken wills. At one time there was a sudden uprising of 
the nursery contingent. They laughed, fought, and screamed. 
Bedlam broke loose. Mrs. Davis scolded, laughed, and 
cried. She asked me if my husband would speak to the 
President about the plan in South Carolina, which 
everybody said suited him. “No, Mrs. Davis,” said I. “That 
is what I told Mr. Davis,” said she. “Colonel Chesnut rides 
so high a horse. Now Browne is so much more practical. He 
goes forth to be general of conscripts in Georgia. His wife 
will stay at the Cobbs's.”</p>
        <p>Mrs. Ould gave me a luncheon on Saturday. I felt that 
this was my last sad farewell to Richmond and the people 
there I love so well. Mrs. Davis sent her carriage for me, 
and we went to the Oulds' together. Such good things were 
served—oranges, guava jelly, etc. The Examiner says Mr. 
Ould, when he goes to Fortress Monroe, replenishes his 
larder; why not? The Examiner has taken another fling at the 
President, as, “haughty and austere with his friends, affable, 
kind, subservient to his enemies.” I wonder if the Yankees 
would indorse that certificate. Both sides abuse him. He can 
not please anybody, it seems. No doubt he is right.</p>
        <p>My husband is now brigadier-general and is sent to 
South Carolina to organize and take command of the reserve 
troops. C. C. Clay and L. Q. C. Lamar are both spoken of to 
fill the vacancy made among Mr. Davis's aides by this 
promotion.</p>
        <p>To-day, Captain Smith Lee spent the morning here and gave 
a review of past Washington gossip. I am having 
<pb id="mches303" n="303"/>
such a busy, happy life, with so many friends, and my 
friends are so clever, so charming. But the change to that 
weary, dreary Camden! Mary Preston said: “I do think 
Mrs. Chesnut deserves to be canonized; she agrees to go 
back to Camden.” The Prestons gave me a farewell dinner; 
my twenty-fourth wedding day, and the very pleasantest day 
I have spent in Richmond.</p>
        <p>Maria Lewis was sitting with us on Mrs. Huger's steps, 
and Smith Lee was lauding Virginia people as usual. As Lee 
would say, there “hove in sight” Frank Parker, riding one 
of the finest of General Bragg's horses; by his side Buck on 
Fairfax, the most beautiful horse in Richmond, his brown 
coat looking like satin, his proud neck arched, moving 
slowly, gracefully, calmly, no fidgets, aristocratic in his 
bearing to the tips of his bridle-reins. There sat Buck tall 
and fair, managing her horse with infinite ease, her English 
riding-habit showing plainly the exquisite proportions of her 
figure. “Supremely lovely,” said Smith Lee. “Look at them 
both,” said I proudly; “can you match those two in 
Virginia?” “Three cheers for South Carolina!” was the 
answer of Lee, the gallant Virginia sailor.</p>

        <head>XVII. CAMDEN, S. C.</head>
        <head><hi rend="italics">May</hi> 8,1864—<hi rend="italics">June</hi> 1,1864</head>
        <p>CAMDEN, S. C., <hi rend="italics">May 8, 1864</hi>.—My friends crowded around me so 
in those last days in Richmond, I forgot the affairs of this 
nation utterly; though I did show faith in my Confederate country 
by buying poor Bones's (my English maid's) Confederate bonds. I 
gave her gold thimbles, bracelets; whatever was gold and would 
sell in New York or London, I gave.</p>
        <p>My friends in Richmond grieved that I had to leave 
them—not half so much, however, as I did that I must come 
away. Those last weeks were so pleasant. No battle, no 
murder, no sudden death, all went merry as a marriage bell. 
Clever, cordial, kind, brave friends rallied around me.</p>
        <p>Maggie Howell and I went down the river to see an 
exchange of prisoners. Our party were the Lees, Mallorys, 
Mrs. Buck Allan, Mrs. Ould. We picked up Judge Ould and 
Buck Allan at Curl's Neck. I had seen no genuine Yankees 
before; prisoners, well or wounded, had been German, 
Scotch, or Irish. Among our men coming ashore was an 
officer, who had charge of some letters for a friend of mine 
whose  <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">fiancé</hi></foreign> had  died;  I  gave  him her address. One 
other man showed me some wonderfully ingenious things he 
had made while a prisoner. One said they gave him rations 
for a week; he always devoured them in three days, he could 
not help it; and then he had to bear the inevitable agony of 
those four remaining days! Many were wounded, 
<pb id="mches305" n="305"/>
some were maimed for life. They were very cheerful. We 
had supper—or some nondescript meal—with ice-cream on 
board. The band played Home, Sweet Home.</p>
        <p>One man tapped another on the shoulder: “Well, how do 
you feel, old fellow?” “Never was so near crying in my 
life—for very comfort.”</p>
        <p>Governor Cummings, a Georgian, late Governor of Utah, 
was among the returned prisoners. He had been in prison 
two years. His wife was with him. He was a 
striking-looking person, huge in size, and with snow-white 
hair, fat as a prize ox, with no sign of Yankee barbarity or 
starvation about him.</p>
        <p>That evening, as we walked up to Mrs. Davis's carriage, 
which was waiting for us at the landing, Dr. Garnett with 
Maggie Howell, Major Hall with me, suddenly I heard her 
scream, and some one stepped back in the dark and said in a 
whisper. “Little Joe! he has killed himself!” I felt reeling, 
faint, bewildered. A chattering woman clutched my arm:    
“Mrs. Davis's son?  Impossible. Whom did you say? Was he 
an interesting child? How old was he?” The shock was 
terrible, and unnerved as I was I cried, “For God's sake take 
her away!”</p>
        <p>Then Maggie and I drove two long miles in silence except 
for Maggie's hysterical sobs. She was wild with terror. The 
news was broken to her in that abrupt way at the carriage 
door so that at first she thought it had all happened there, 
and that poor little Joe was in the carriage.</p>
        <p>Mr. Burton Harrison met us at the door of the Executive 
Mansion. Mrs. Semmes and Mrs. Barksdale were  there,  
too.  Every  window  and  door  of  the  house seemed  wide  
open,  and the wind was blowing the curtains. It was lighted, 
even in the third story. As I sat in the drawing-room,  I  
could  hear  the  tramp  of Mr. Davis's step as he walked up 
and down the room above. Not  another  sound.  The  whole  
house as silent as death. It  was  then  twelve  o'clock;  so  I  
went  home  and  waked General Chesnut, who had gone
<pb id="mches306" n="306"/>
to bed.  We  went immediately back to the President's, 
found Mrs. Semmes still there, but saw no one but her. We 
thought some friends of the family ought to be in the house.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Semmes said when she got there that little Jeff was 
kneeling down by his brother, and he called out to her in 
great distress: “Mrs. Semmes, I have said all the prayers I 
know how, but God will not wake Joe.”</p>
        <p>Poor little Joe, the good child of the family, was so gentle 
and affectionate. He used to run in to say his prayers at his 
father's knee. Now he was laid out somewhere above us, 
crushed and killed. Mrs. Semmes, describing the accident, 
said he fell from the high north piazza upon a brick 
pavement. Before I left the house I saw him lying there, 
white and beautiful as an angel, covered with flowers; 
Catherine, his nurse, flat on the floor by his side, was 
weeping and wailing as only an Irishwoman can.</p>
        <p>Immense crowds came to the funeral, everybody 
sympathetic, but some shoving and pushing rudely. There 
were thousands of children, and each child had a green 
bough or a bunch of flowers to throw on little Joe's grave, 
which was already a mass of white flowers, crosses, and 
evergreens. The morning I came away from Mrs. Davis's, 
early as it was, I met a little child with a handful of snow 
drops. “Put these on little Joe,” she said; “I knew him so 
well,” and then she turned and fled without another word. I 
did not know who she was then or now.</p>
        <p>As I walked home I met Mr. Reagan, then Wade 
Hampton. But I could see nothing but little Joe and his 
brokenhearted mother. And Mr. Davis's step still sounded in 
my ears as he walked that floor the livelong night.</p>
        <p>General Lee was to have a grand review the very day we 
left Richmond. Great numbers of people were to go up by 
rail to see it. Miss Turner McFarland writes: “They did go, 
but they came back faster than they went. They found the 
army drawn up in battle array.” Many of the brave 
<pb id="mches307" n="307"/>
and gay spirits that we saw so lately have taken flight, the 
only flight they know, and their bodies are left dead upon 
the battle-field. Poor old Edward Johnston is wounded 
again, and a prisoner. Jones's brigade broke first; he was 
wounded the day before.</p>
        <p>At Wilmington we met General Whiting. He sent us to 
the station in his carriage, and bestowed upon us a bottle of 
brandy, which had run the blockade. They say Beauregard 
has taken his sword from Whiting. Never! I will not believe 
it. At the capture of Fort Sumter they said Whiting was the 
brains, Beauregard only the hand. Lucifer, son of the 
morning! How art thou fallen! That they should even say 
such a thing!</p>
        <p>My husband and Mr. Covey got out at Florence to 
procure for Mrs. Miles a cup of coffee. They were slow 
about it and they got left. I did not mind this so very much, 
for I remembered that we were to remain all day at 
Kingsville, and that my husband could overtake me there by 
the next train. My maid belonged to the Prestons. She was 
only traveling home with me, and would go straight on to 
Columbia. So without fear I stepped off at Kingsville. My 
old Confederate silk, like most Confederate dresses, had 
seen better days, and I noticed that, like Oliver Wendell 
Holmes's famous “one-hoss stray,” it had gone to pieces 
suddenly, and all over. It was literally in strips. I became 
painfully aware of my forlorn aspect when I asked the 
telegraph man the way to the hotel, and he was by no means 
respectful to me. I was, indeed, alone—an old and not too 
respectable-looking woman. It was my first appearance in 
the character, and I laughed aloud.</p>
        <p>A very haughty and highly painted dame greeted me at 
the hotel. “No room,” said she.  “Who are you?” I gave my 
name. “Try something else,” said she. “Mrs. Chesnut don't 
travel round by herself with no servants and no nothing.” I 
looked down. There I was, dirty, tired, tattered, and torn.  
“Where do you come from?” said she.
<pb id="mches308" n="308"/>
“My home is in Camden.” “Come, now, I know everybody 
in Camden.” I sat down meekly on a bench in the piazza, 
that was free to all wayfarers.</p>
        <p>“Which Mrs. Chesnut?” said she (sharply). “I know 
both.”  “I am now the only one. And now what is the 
matter with you? Do you take me for a spy? I know you 
perfectly well. I went to school with you at Miss Henrietta 
de Leon's, and my name was Mary Miller.”  “The Lord

me! Heaven sakes, woman, but you are broke!”  “And 
tore,” I added, holding up my dress. “But I had had no idea 
it was so difficult to effect an entry into a railroad wayside 
hotel.”  I picked up a long strip of my old black dress, torn 
off by a man's spur as I passed him getting off the train.</p>
        <p>It is sad enough at Mulberry without old Mrs. 
Chesnut, who was the good genius of the place. It is so 
lovely here in spring. The giants of the forest—the primeval 
oaks, water-oaks, live-oaks, willow-oaks, such as I have not 
seen since I left here-with opopanax, violets, roses, and 
yellow jessamine, the air is laden with perfume. Araby the 
Blest was never sweeter.</p>
        <p>Inside, are creature comforts of all kinds—green peas, 
strawberries, asparagus, spring lamb, spring chicken, fresh 
eggs, rich, yellow butter, clean white linen for one's beds, 
dazzling white damask for one's table. It is such a contrast 
to Richmond, where I wish I were.</p>
        <p>Fighting is going on. Hampton is frantic, for his laggard 
new regiments fall in slowly; no fault of the soldiers; they 
are as disgusted as he is. Bragg, Bragg, the head of the War 
Office, can not organize in time.</p>
        <p>John Boykin has died in a Yankee prison. He had on a 
heavy flannel shirt when lying in an open platform car on 
the way to a cold prison on the lakes. A Federal soldier 
wanted John's shirt. Prisoners have no rights; so John had to 
strip off and hand his shirt to him. That caused 
<pb id="mches309" n="309"/>
his death. In two days he was dead of pneumonia—may be 
frozen to death. One man said: “They are taking us there to 
freeze.”  But then their men will find our hot sun in August 
and July as deadly as our men find their cold Decembers. 
Their snow and ice finish our prisoners at a rapid rate, they 
say. Napoleon's soldiers found out all that in the Russian 
campaign.</p>
        <p>Have brought my houseless, homeless friends, refugees 
here, to luxuriate in Mulberry's plenty. I can but remember 
the lavish kindness of the Virginia people when I was there 
and in a similar condition. The Virginia people do the rarest 
acts of hospitality and never seem to know it is not in the 
ordinary course of events.</p>
        <p>The President's man, Stephen, bringing his master's 
Arabian to Mulberry for safe-keeping, said: “Why, Missis, 
your niggers down here are well off. I call this Mulberry 
place heaven, with plenty to eat, little to do, warm house to 
sleep in, a good church.”</p>
        <p>John L. Miller, my cousin, has been killed at the head of 
his regiment. The blows now fall so fast on our heads they 
are bewildering. The Secretary of War authorizes General 
Chesnut to reorganize the men who have been hitherto 
detailed for special duty, and also those who have been 
exempt. He says General Chesnut originated the plan and 
organized the corps of clerks which saved Richmond in the 
Dahlgren raid.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">May 27th</hi>.—In all this beautiful sunshine, in the stillness 
and shade of these long hours on this piazza, all comes back 
to me about little Joe; it haunts me—that scene in Richmond 
where all seemed confusion, madness, a bad dream! Here I 
see that funeral procession as it wound among those tall 
white monuments, up that hillside, the James River tumbling 
about below over rocks and around islands; the dominant 
figure, that poor, old, gray-haired man, standing 
bareheaded, straight as an arrow, clear against the sky by 
the open grave of his son. She, the bereft
<pb id="mches310" n="310"/>
mother, stood back, in her heavy black wrappings, and her 
tall figure drooped. The flowers, the children, the procession 
as it moved, comes and goes, but those two dark, 
sorrow-stricken figures stand; they are before me now!</p>
        <p>That night, with no sound but the heavy tramp of his feet 
overhead, the curtains flapping in the wind, the gas flaring, I 
was numb, stupid, half-dead with grief and terror. Then 
came Catherine's Irish howl. Cheap, was that. Where was 
she when it all happened? Her place was to have been with 
the child. Who saw him fall? Whom will they kill next of 
that devoted household?</p>
        <p>Read to-day the list of killed and wounded.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref115" n="115" rend="sc" target="note115">1</ref> One long 
column was not enough for South Carolina's dead. I see Mr. 
Federal Secretary Stanton says he can reenforce Suwarrow 
Grant at his leisure whenever he calls for more. He has just 
sent him 25,000 veterans. Old Lincoln says, in his quaint 
backwoods way, “Keep a-peggin'.” Now we can only peg 
out. What have we left of men, etc., to meet these                 
“reenforcements as often as reenforcements are called for?” 
Our fighting men have all gone to the front; only old men 
and little boys are at home now.</p>
        <p>It is impossible to sleep here, because it is so solemn and 
still. The moonlight shines in my window sad and white, and 
the soft south wind, literally comes over a bank of violets, 
lilacs, roses, with orange-blossoms and magnolia flowers.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Chesnut was only a year younger than her husband. 
He is ninety-two or  three.  She  was  deaf;  but he retains 
his senses wonderfully for his great age. I have always been 
an early riser. Formerly I often saw him sauntering slowly

the spring he was apt to be in shirt-sleeves, with suspenders 
hanging down his back. He had always a large hair-brush 
in his hand.</p>
        <p>He would take his stand on the rug before the fire in her 
room, brushing scant locks which were fleecy white. Her 
maid would be doing hers, which were dead-leaf brown, not 
a white hair in her head. He had the voice of a stentor, and 
there he stood roaring his morning compliments. The people 
who occupied the room above said he fairly shook the 
window glasses. This pleasant morning greeting ceremony 
was never omitted.</p>
        <p>Her voice was “soft and low” (the oft-quoted). 
Philadelphia seems to have lost the art of sending forth such 
voices now. Mrs. Binney, old Mrs. Chesnut's sister, came 
among us with the same softly modulated, womanly, 
musical voice. Her clever and beautiful daughters were 
<hi rend="italics">criard. </hi>Judge Han said: “Philadelphia women scream like 
macaws.”  This morning as I passed Mrs. Chesnut's room, 
the door stood wide open, and I heard a pitiful sound. The 
old man was kneeling by her empty bedside sobbing bitterly. 
I fled down the middle walk, anywhere out of reach of what 
was never meant for me to hear.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 1st</hi>.—We have been to Bloomsbury again and hear 
that William Kirkland has been wounded. A scene occurred 
then, Mary weeping bitterly and Aunt B. frantic as to 
Tanny's danger. I proposed to make arrangements for Mary 
to go on at once. The Judge took me aside, frowning angrily. 
“You are unwise to talk in that way. She can neither take 
her infant nor leave it. The cars are closed by order of the 
government to all but soldiers.”</p>
        <p>I told him of the woman who, when the conductor said 
she could not go, cried at the top of her voice, “Soldiers, I 
want to go to Richmond to nurse my wounded husband.”   In 
a moment twenty men made themselves her body-guard, and 
she went on unmolested. The Judge said I talked nonsense. I 
said I would go on in my carriage if 
<pb id="mches312" n="312"/>
	
need be. Besides, there would be no difficulty in getting 
Mary a “permit.”</p>
        <p>He answered hotly that in no case would he let her go, 
and that I had better <hi rend="italics">not</hi> go back into the house. We were on 
the piazza and my carriage at the door. I took it and crossed 
over to see Mary Boykin. She was weeping, too, so washed 
away with tears one would hardly know her. “So many 
killed. My son and my husband—I do not hear a word from 
them.”</p>

        <p>COLUMBIA, S. C., <hi rend="italics">July 6, 1864</hi>.—At the 
Prestons' Mary was laughing at Mrs. Lyons's 
complaint—the person from whom we rented rooms in 
Richmond. She spoke of Molly and Lawrence's 
deceitfulness. They went about the house quiet as mice 
while we were at home; or Lawrence sat at the door and 
sprang to his feet whenever we passed. But when we were 
out, they sang, laughed, shouted, and danced. If any of the 
Lyons family passed him. Lawrence kept his seat, with his 
hat on, too. Mrs. Chesnut had said: “Oh!” so meekly to 
the whole tirade, and added, “I will see about it.”</p>
        <p>Colonel Urquhart and Edmund Rhett dined here; 
charming men both—no brag, no detraction. Talk is never 
pleasant where there is either. Our noble Georgian dined 
here. He says Hampton was the hero of the Yankee rout at 
Stony Creek.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref116" n="116" rend="sc" target="note116">1</ref> He claims that citizens, militia, and lame 
soldiers kept the bridge at Staunton and gallantly repulsed

        <p>At Mrs. S.'s  last  night.  She  came  up,  saying,  “In 
New Orleans four people never met together without 
dancing.”  Edmund Rhett turned to me: “You shall be 
pressed into service.” “No, I belong to the reserve corps-

too old to volunteer or to be drafted as a conscript.”  But I 
had to go.</p>
        <p>My partner in the dance showed his English descent; he 
took his pleasure sadly. “Oh, Mr. Rhett, at his pleasure, 
can be a most agreeable companion!” said someone. “I 
never happened to meet him,” said I, “when he pleased to 
be otherwise.”  With a hot, draggled, old alpaca dress, and 
those clod-hopping shoes, to tumble slowly and gracefully 
through the mazes of a July dance was too much for me.      
“What depresses you so?” he anxiously inquired. “Our 
carnival of death.” What a blunder to bring us all together 
here!-a reunion of consumptives to dance and sing until 
one can almost hear the death-rattle!</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 25th</hi>.—Now we are in a cottage rented from Doctor 
Chisolm. Hood is a full general. Johnston<ref targOrder="U" id="ref117" n="117" rend="sc" target="note117">1</ref>  has been

City. Semmes, of whom we have been so proud, risked the

Tennessee, with headquarters at Dalton, Georgia. He was to oppose the 
advance of Sherman's army toward Atlanta. In May, 1864, he fought 
unsuccessful battles at Resaca and elsewhere, and in July was compelled 
to retreat across the Chattahoochee River. Fault was found with him 
because of his continual retreating. There were tremendous odds against 
him. On July 17th he was superseded by Hood.</note>
<note id="note118" n="118" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref118">2.  Raphael Semmes was a native of Maryland and had served in the Mexican 
War. The Alabama was built for the Confederate States at Birkenhead, 
England, and with an English crew and English equipment was commanded by 
Semmes. In 1863 and 1864 the Alabama destroyed much Federal shipping. On 
June 19, 1864, she was sunk by the Federal ship Kearsarge in a battle off 
Cherbourg. Claims against England for damages were made by the United 
States, and as a result the Geneva Arbitration Court was created. Claims 
amounting to $15,500,000 were finally awarded. This case has much importance
in the history of international law.</note>

July. My husband was telegraphed to go to Charleston. 
General Jones sent for him. A part of his command is on 
the coast.</p>
        <p>The girls were at my house. Everything was in the 
utmost confusion. We were lying on a pile of mattresses in 
one of the front rooms while the servants were reducing 
things to order in the rear. All the papers are down on the 
President for this change of commanders except the 
Georgia papers. Indeed, Governor Brown's constant 
complaints, I dare say, caused it—these and the rage of the 
Georgia people as Johnston backed down on them.</p>
        <p>Isabella soon came. She said she saw the Preston sisters 
pass her house, and as they turned the corner there was a 
loud and bitter cry. It seemed to come from the Hampton 
house. Both girls began to run at full speed. “What is the 
master?” asked Mrs. Martin. “Mother, listen; that 
sounded like the cry of a broken heart,” said Isabella;          
“something has gone terribly wrong at the Prestons'.”</p>
        <p>Mrs. Martin is deaf, however, so she heard nothing and 
thought Isabella fanciful. Isabella hurried over there, and 
learned that they had come to tell Mrs. Preston that Willie 
was killed—Willie! his mother's darling. No country ever 
had a braver soldier, a truer gentleman, to lay down his life 
in her cause.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 26th</hi>.—Isabella went with me to the bulletin-board. Mrs. 
D. (with the white linen as usual pasted on her chin) asked 
me to read aloud what was there written. As I slowly read 
on, I heard a suppressed giggle from Isabella. I know her 
way of laughing at everything, and tried to enunciate more 
distinctly—to read more slowly, and louder, with more 
precision.  As I finished and turned round, I found myself 
closely   packed in by a crowd of Confederate soldiers eager 
to hear the news. They took off their caps, thanked me for 
reading all that was on the boards, and made way for me, 
cap in hand, as I hastily returned to the carriage, which was 
waiting for us. Isabella proposed, “Call out to
<pb id="mches316" n="316"/>
them to give three cheers for Jeff Davis and his generals.”    
“You forget, my child, that we are on our way to a 
funeral.”</p>
        <p>Found my new house already open hospitably to all 
comers. My husband had arrived. He was seated at a pine 
table, on which someone had put a coarse, red 
table-cover, and by the light of one tallow candle was 
affably entertaining Edward Barnwell, Isaac Hayne, and 
Uncle Hamilton. He had given them no tea, however. After I 
had remedied that oversight, we adjourned to the 
moonlighted piazza. By tallow-candle-light and the light of 
the moon, we made out that wonderful smile of Teddy's, 
which identifies him as Gerald Grey.</p>
        <p>We have laughed so at broken hearts—the broken hearts 
of the foolish love stories. But Buck, now, is breaking her 
heart for her brother Willie. Hearts do break in silence, 
without a word or a sigh. Mrs. Means and Mary Barnwell 
made no moan—simply turned their faces to the wall and 
died. How many more that we know nothing of!</p>
        <p>When I remember all the true-hearted, the light-hearted 
the gay and gallant boys who have come laughing, singing 
and dancing in my way in the three years now past; how I 
have looked into their brave young eyes and helped then as I 
could in every way and then saw them no more forever how 
they lie stark and cold, dead upon the battle-field, or 
moldering away in hospitals or prisons, which is worse-I 
think if I consider the long array of those bright youth and 
loyal men who have gone to their death almost before my 
very eyes, my heart might break, too. Is anything worth 
it—this fearful sacrifice, this awful penalty we pay for war?</p>
        <p>Allen G. says Johnston was a failure. Now he will wait and 
see what Hood can do before he pronounces judgment on 
him. He liked his address to his army. It was grand and 
inspiring, but every one knows a general has not time to 
write these things himself. Mr. Kelly, from New Orleans,
<pb id="mches317" n="317"/>
says Dick Taylor and Kirby Smith have quarreled. One 
would think we had a big enough quarrel on hand for one 
while already. The Yankees are enough and to spare. 
General Lovell says, “Joe Brown, with his Georgians at his 
back, who importuned our government to remove Joe 
Johnston, they are scared now, and wish they had not.”</p>
        <p>In our democratic Republic, if one rises to be its head, 
whomever he displeases takes a Turkish revenge and defiles 
the tombs of his father and mother; hints that his father was 
a horse-thief and his mother no better than she should be; 
his sisters barmaids and worse, his brothers Yankee 
turncoats and traitors. All this is hurled at Lincoln or Jeff 
Davis indiscriminately.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 2d</hi>.—Sherman again. Artillery parked and a line 
of battle formed before Atlanta. When we asked Brewster 
what Sam meant to do at Atlanta he answered, “Oh—oh, 
like the man who went, he says he means to stay there!” 
Hope he may, that's all.</p>
        <p>Spent to-day with Mrs. McCord at her hospital. She is 
dedicating her grief for her son, sanctifying it, one might 
say, by giving up her soul and body, her days and nights, to 
the wounded soldiers at her hospital. Every moment of her 
time is surrendered to their needs.</p>
        <p>To-day General Taliaferro dined with us. He served with 
Hood at the second battle of Manassas and at 
Fredericksburg, where Hood won his major-general's spurs. 
On the battle-field, Hood, he said, “has military 
inspiration.” We were thankful for that word. All now 
depends on that army at Atlanta. If that fails us, the game is 
up.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 3d</hi>.—Yesterday was such a lucky day for my 
housekeeping in our hired house. Oh, ye kind Columbia 
folk! Mrs. Alex Taylor, <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">née</hi></foreign> Hayne, sent me a huge bowl of 
yellow butter and a basket to match of every vegetable in 
season. Mrs. Preston's man came with mushrooms freshly 
cut and Mrs. Tom Taylor's with fine melons.</p>
        <p>Sent Smith and Johnson (my house servant and a 
<pb id="mches318" n="318"/>
carpenter from home, respectively) to the Commissary's 
with our wagon for supplies. They made a mistake, so they 
said, and went to the depot instead, and stayed there all day. 
I needed a servant sadly in many ways all day long, but I 
hope Smith and Johnson had a good time. I did not lose 
patience until Harriet came in an omnibus because I had 
neither servants nor horse to send to the station for her.</p>
        <p>Stephen Elliott is wounded, and his wife and father have 
gone to him. Six hundred of his men were destroyed in a 
mine; and part of his brigade taken prisoners: Stoneman and 
his raiders have been captured. This last fact gives a slightly 
different hue to our horizon of unmitigated misery.</p>
        <p>General L— told us of an unpleasant scene at the 
President's last winter. He called there to see Mrs. McLean.  
Mrs. Davis was in the room and he did not speak to her. He 
did not intend to be rude; it was merely an oversight. And so 
he called again and tried to apologize, to remedy his blunder, 
but the President was inexorable, and would not receive his 
overtures of peace and good-will. General L— is a New 
York man. Talk of the savagery of slavery, heavens! How 
perfect are our men's manners down here, how suave, how 
polished are they. Fancy one of them forgetting to speak to 
Mrs. Davis in her own drawing-room.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 6th</hi>.—Archer came, a classmate of my husband's 
at Princeton; they called him Sally Archer then, he was so 
girlish and pretty. No trace of feminine beauty about this 
grim soldier now. He has a hard face, black-bearded and 
sallow, with the saddest black eyes. His hands are small, 
white, and well-shaped; his manners quiet. He is abstracted 
and weary-looking, his mind and body having been deadened 
by long imprisonment. He seemed glad to be here, and 
James Chesnut was charmed. “Dear Sally Archer,” he calls 
him cheerily, and the other responds in a far-off, faded kind 
of way.</p>
        <pb id="mches319" n="319"/>
        <p>Hood and Archer were given the two Texas regiments at 
the beginning of the war. They were colonels and Wigfall 
was their general. Archer's comments on Hood are: “He 
does not compare intellectually with General Johnston, who 
is decidedly a man of culture and literary attainments, with 
much experience in military matters. Hood, however, has 
youth and energy to help counterbalance all this. He has a 
simple-minded directness of purpose always. He is awfully 
shy, and he has suffered terribly, but then he has had 
consolations—such a rapid rise in his profession, and then 
his luck to be engaged to the beautiful Miss — .”</p>
        <p>They tried Archer again and again on the heated 
controversy of the day, but he stuck to his text. Joe Johnston 
is a fine military critic, a capital writer, an accomplished 
soldier, as brave as Cæsar in his own person, but cautious 
to a fault in manipulating an army. Hood has all the dash 
end fire of a reckless young soldier, and his Texans would 
follow him to the death. Too much caution might be 
followed easily by too much headlong rush. That is where 
the swing-back of the pendulum might ruin us.</p>

Wade Hampton, of Joe Johnston's staff, says Hood lost 
12,000 men in the battles of the 22d<ref targOrder="U" id="ref120" n="120" rend="sc" target="note120">1</ref>  and 24th, but 
Brewster, of Hood's staff, says not three thousand at the 
utmost. Now here are two people strictly truthful, who tell 
things so differently. In this war people see the same things 
so oddly one does not know what to believe.</p>
        <p>Brewster says when he was in Richmond Mr. Davis 
said Johnston would have to be removed and Sherman 
blocked. He could not make Hardee full general because, 
when he had command of an army he was always 
importuning the War Department for a general-in-chief to 
be sent there over him. Polk would not do, brave soldier and 
patriot as he was. He was a good soldier, and would do his 
best for his country, and do his duty under whomever was 
put over him by those in authority. Mr. Davis did not once 
intimate to him who it was that he intended to promote to 
the head of the Western Army.</p>
        <p>Brewster said to-day that this “blow at Joe Johnston, 
cutting off his head, ruins the schemes of the enemies of the 
government. Wigfall asked me to go at once, and get Hood 
to decline to take this command, for it will destroy him if he 
accepts it. He will have to fight under Jeff Davis's orders; no 
one can do that now and not lose caste in the Western Army. 
Joe Johnston does not exactly say that Jeff Davis betrays his 
plans to the enemy, but he says he dares not let the President 
know his plans, as there is a spy in the War Office who 
invariably warns the Yankees in time. Consulting the 
government on military movements is played out. That's 
Wigfall's way of talking. Now,” added Brewster, “I blame 
the President for keeping a man at the head of his armies 
who treats the government with open scorn and contumely, 
no matter how the people at large rate this disrespectful 
general.”</p>

        <p><hi rend="italics">August  19th</hi>.—Began my regular attendance on the 
Wayside Hospital. To-day we gave wounded men, as they 
stopped for an hour at the station, their breakfast. Those 
who are able to come to the table do so. The badly 
wounded remain in wards prepared for them, where their 
wounds are dressed by nurses and surgeons, and we take 
bread and butter, beef, ham, and hot coffee to them.</p>
        <p>One man had hair as long as a woman's, the result of a 
vow, he said. He had pledged himself not to cut his hair 
until peace was declared and our Southern country free. 
Four made this vow together. All were dead but himself. 
One was killed in Missouri, one in Virginia, and he left one 
at Kennesaw Mountain. This poor creature had had one arm 
taken off at the socket. When I remarked that he was utterly 
disabled and ought not to remain in the army, he answered 
quietly, “I am of the First Texas. If old Hood can go with 
one foot, I can go with one arm, eh?”</p>
        <p>How they quarreled and wrangled among themselves- 
Alabama and Mississippi, all were loud for Joe Johnston, 
save and except the long-haired, one-armed hero, who cried 
at the top of his voice: “Oh! you all want to be kept in 
trenches and to go on retreating, eh?” “Oh, if we had had 
a leader, such as Stonewall, this war would have been over 
long ago! What we want is a leader!” shouted a cripple. </p>
        <p>They were awfully smashed-up, objects of misery, 
wounded, maimed, diseased. I was really upset, and came 
home ill. This kind of thing unnerves me quite.</p>
        <p>Letters from the army. Grant's dogged stay about Richmond 
is very disgusting, and depressing to the spirits. Wade 
Hampton has been put in command of the Southern 
cavalry.</p>
        <p>A Wayside incident. A pine box, covered with flowers, 
was carefully put upon the train by some gentlemen. 
Isabella asked whose remains were in the box. Dr. Gibbes 
replied:     “In that box lies the body of a young man whose
<pb id="mches322" n="322"/>
family antedates the Bourbons of France. He was the last 
Count de Choiseul, and he has died for the South.” Let his 
memory be held in perpetual remembrance by all who love 
the South! </p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 22d</hi>.—Hope I may never know a raid except 
from hearsay. Mrs. Huger describes the one at Athens. The 
proudest and most timid of women were running madly in 
the streets, corsets in one hand, stockings in the other- 
<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">déshabillé</hi></foreign> as far as it will go, Mobile is half taken. The

        <p>Notes from a letter written by a young lady who is riding 
a high horse. Her <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">fiancé</hi></foreign>, a maimed hero, has been abused.  
“You say to me with a sneer, ‘So you love that man.’ Yes, I 
do, and I thank God that I love better than all the world the 
man who is to be my husband.  ‘Proud of him, are you?’ 
Yes, I am, in exact proportion to my love. You say, ‘ I am 
selfish.’ Yes, I am selfish. He is my second self, so utterly 
absorbed am I in him. There is not a moment, day or night, 
that I do not think of him. In point of fact, I do not think of 
anything else.” No reply was deemed necessary by the 
astounded recipient of this outburst of indignation, who 
showed me the letter and continued to observe: “Did you 
ever? She seems so shy, so timid, so cold.”</p>
        <p>Sunday Isabella took us to a chapel, Methodist, of 
course; her father had a hand in building it. It was not clean, 
but it was crowded, hot, and stuffy. An eloquent man 
preached with a delightful voice and wonderful fluency; 
nearly eloquent, and at times nearly ridiculous. He described 
a scene during one of his sermons when “beautiful young 
faces were turned up to me, radiant faces though bathed in 
tears, moral rainbows of emotion playing over them,” etc.</p>
        <p>He then described his own conversion, and stripped 
himself naked morally. All that is very revolting to one's 
innate sense of decency. He tackled the patriarchs. Adam, 
<pb id="mches323" n="323"/>
Noah, and so on down to Joseph, who was “a man whose 
modesty and purity were so transcendent they enabled 
him to resist the greatest temptation to which fallen man 
is exposed.”  “Fiddlesticks! that is played out!” my 
neighbor whispered. “Everybody gives up now that old 
Mrs. Pharaoh was forty.” “Mrs. Potiphar, you goose, 
and she was fifty!” “That solves the riddle.” “Sh-sh!!” 
from the devout Isabella.</p>
        <p>At home met General Preston on the piazza. He was 
vastly entertaining. Gave us Darwin, Herodotus, and 
Livy. We understood him and were delighted, but we did 
not know enough to be sure when it was his own wisdom 
or when wise saws and cheering words came from the 
authors of whom he spoke.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 23d</hi>.—All in a muddle, and yet the news, 
confused as it is, seems good from all quarters. There is a 
row in New Orleans. Memphis<ref targOrder="U" id="ref121" n="121" target="note121">1</ref> has been retaken; 2,000 
prisoners have been captured at Petersburg, and a Yankee 
raid on Macon has come to grief.</p>
        <p>At Mrs. Izard's met a clever Mrs. Calhoun. Mrs. 
Calhoun is a violent partizan of Dick Taylor; says Taylor 
does the work and Kirby Smith gets the credit for it. Mrs.
Calhoun described the behavior of some acquaintance of
theirs at Shreveport, one of that kind whose faith removes 
mountains. Her love for and confidence in the Confederate 
army were supreme. Why not! She knew so many of the 
men who composed that dauntless band. When her 
husband told her New Orleans had surrendered to a foe 
whom she despised, she did not believe a word of it. He 
told her to “pack up his traps, as it was time for him 
to leave Shreveport.” She then determined to run down to 
the levee and see for herself, only to find the Yankee 
gunboats having it all their own way. She made a painful 
exhibition of herself. First. she fell on her knees and 
prayed; then
<note id="note121" n="121" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref121">1.  General Forrest made his raid on Memphis in August of this year.</note>
<pb id="mches324" n="324"/>
she got up and danced with rage; then she raved and dashed 
herself on the ground in a fit. There was patriotism run mad 
for you! As I did not know the poor soul, Mrs. Calhoun's 
fine acting was somewhat lost on me, but the others 
enjoyed it.</p>
        <p>Old Edward Johnston has been sent to Atlanta against 
his will, and Archer has been made major-general and, 
contrary to his earnest request, ordered not to his beloved 
Texans but to the Army of the Potomac.</p>
        <p>Mr. C. F. Hampton deplores the untimely end of 
McPherson.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref122" n="122" target="note122">1</ref> He was so kind to Mr. Hampton at Vicksburg 
last winter, and drank General Hampton's health then and 
there. Mr. Hampton has asked Brewster, if the report of his 
death prove a mistake, and General McPherson is a 
prisoner, that every kindness and attention be shown to him. 
General McPherson said at his own table at Vicksburg that 
General Hampton was the ablest general on our side.</p>
        <p>Grant can hold his own as well as Sherman. Lee has a 
heavy handful in the new Suwarrow. He has worse odds 
than any one else, for when Grant has ten thousand slain, he 
has only to order another ten thousand, and they are there, 
ready to step out to the front. They are like the leaves of 
Vallambrosa.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">August 29th</hi>.—I take my hospital duty in the morning. 
Most persons prefer afternoon, but I dislike to give up my 
pleasant evenings. So I get up at five o'clock and go down in 
my carriage all laden with provisions. Mrs. Fisher and old 
Mr. Bryan generally go with me.  Provisions are commonly 
sent by people to Mrs. Fisher's. I am so glad to be a 
hospital nurse once more. I had excuses enough, but at heart 
I felt a coward and a skulker. I think I know how men feel 
who hire a substitute and shirk the fight. There

must be no dodging of duty. It will not do now to send 
provisions and pay for nurses. Something inside of me 
kept calling out, “Go, you shabby creature; you can't 
bear to see what those fine fellows have to bear.”</p>
        <p>Mrs. Izard was staying with me last night, and as I 
slipped away I begged Molly to keep everything dead still 
and not let Mrs. Izard be disturbed until I got home. About 
ten I drove up and there was a row to wake the dead. 
Molly's eldest daughter, who nurses her baby sister, let the 
baby fall, and, regardless of Mrs. Izard, as I was away, 
Molly was giving the nurse a switching in the yard, 
accompanied by howls and yells worthy of a Comanche! 
The small nurse welcomed my advent, no doubt, for in two 
seconds  peace was restored. Mrs. Izard said she 
sympathized  with the baby's mother; so I forgave the 
uproar.</p>
        <p>I have excellent servants; no matter for their short
comings behind my back. They save me all thought as to
household matters, and they are so kind, attentive, and
quiet. They must know what is at hand if Sherman is not
hindered from coming here—“Freedom! my masters!”
But these sphinxes give no sign, unless it be increased 
diligence and absolute silence, as certain in their action 
and as noiseless as a law of nature, at any rate when we 
are in the house.</p>
        <p>That  fearful hospital haunts me all day long, and is 
worse at night. So much suffering, such loathsome 
wounds, such distortion, with stumps of limbs not half 
cured, exhibited to all. Then, when I was so tired 
yesterday, Molly was looking more like an   enraged 
lioness than anything else, roaring that her baby's  neck 
was broken,  and howling cries of vengeance. The poor  
little careless nurse's   dark face had an ashen tinge of 
gray terror.    She was crouching near the ground like 
an animal trying to hide, and her mother striking at her 
as she rolled away.   All this was my welcome as I 
entered the gate. It takes these  half-Africans but a 
moment to go back to their naked savage animal nature. 
<pb id="mches326" n="326"/>
Mrs. Izard is a charming person. She tried so to make me 
forget it all and rest.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">September 2d</hi>.—The battle has been raging at Atlanta,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref123" n="123" rend="sc" target="note123">1</ref> 
and our fate hanging in the balance. Atlanta, indeed, is 
gone. Well, that agony is over. Like David, when the child 
was dead, I will get up from my knees, will wash my face 
and comb my hair. No hope; we will try to have no fear.</p>
        <p>At the Prestons' I found them drawn up in line of battle 
every moment looking for the Doctor on his way to 
Richmond. Now, to drown thought, for our day is done, 
read Dumas's <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fr">Maîtres d 'Armes</foreign></hi>. Russia ought to sympathize 
with us. We are not as barbarous as this, even if Mrs. 
Stowe's word be taken. Brutal men with unlimited power are 
the same all over the world. See Russell's India—Bull Run 
Russell's. They say General Morgan has been killed. We are 
hard as stones; we sit unmoved and hear any bad news 
chance may bring. Are we stupefied?</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">September 19th</hi>.—My pink silk dress I have sold for 
$600, to be paid for in instalments, two hundred a month for 
three months. And I sell my eggs and butter from home for

Confederate money. <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">Hélas</hi></foreign>!</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">September 21st</hi>.—Went with Mrs. Rhett to hear Dr. Palmer. I 
did not know before how utterly hopeless was our situation. 
This man is so eloquent, it was hard to listen and not give 
way. Despair was his word, and martyrdom. He offered us 
nothing more in this world than the martyr's crown. He is 
not for slavery, he says; he is for freedom, and the freedom 
to govern our own country as we see fit. He is against 
foreign interference in our State matters. That is what Mr. 
Palmer went to war for, it appears. Every day

shows that slavery is doomed the world over; for that he 
thanked God. He spoke of our agony, and then came the 
cry, “Help us, O God! Vain is the help of man.” And 
so we came away shaken to the depths.</p>
        <p>The end has come. No doubt of the fact. Our army has so 
moved as to uncover Macon and Augusta. We are going to be 
wiped off the face of the earth. What is there to prevent 
Sherman taking General Lee in the rear?  We have  but two 
armies, and Sherman is between them now.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref124" n="124" rend="sc" target="note124">1</ref></p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">September 24th</hi>.-These stories of our defeats in the valley 
fall like blows upon a dead body. Since Atlanta fell I 
have felt as if all were dead within me forever. Captain 
Ogden, of General Chesnut's staff, dined here to-day. Had 
ever brigadier, with little or no brigade, so magnificent a 
staff?  The reserves, as somebody said, have been secured 
only by robbing the cradle and the grave-the men too old, 
the boys too young. Isaac Hayne, Edward Barnwell, Bacon, 
Ogden, Richardson, Miles are the picked men of the 
agreeable world.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">October 1st</hi>.-Mary Cantey Preston's wedding day has 
come and gone and Mary is Mrs. John Darby now. Maggie 
Howell dressed the bride's hair beautifully, they said, but it 
was  all covered  by her veil, which was of blond-lace, and 
the dress tulle and   blond-lace, with diamonds and pearls. 
The bride walked up the aisle on her father's arm, Mrs. Preston 
on Dr. Darby's. I think it was  the handsomest wedding party 
I ever saw.  John Darby<ref targOrder="U" id="ref125" n="125" rend="sc" target="note125">2</ref> had brought his wedding

uniform home with him from England, and it did all honor 
to his perfect figure. I forget the name of his London

would be hard for any man to live up to those clothes.”</p>
        <p>And now, to the amazement of us all, Captain Chesnut 
(Johnny) who knows everything, has rushed into a 
flirtation with Buck such as never was. He drives her 
every day, and those wild, runaway, sorrel colts terrify my 
soul as they go tearing, pitching, and darting from side to 
side of the street. And my lady enjoys it. When he leaves 
her, he kisses her hand, bowing so low to do it unseen that 
we see it all.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Saturday</hi>.—The President will be with us here in 
Columbia next Tuesday, so Colonel McLean brings us 
word. I have begun at once to prepare to receive him in my 
small house. His apartments have been decorated as well 
as Confederate stringency would permit. The possibilities 
were not great, but I did what I could for our honored 
chief; besides I like the man—he has been so kind to me, 
and his wife is one of the few to whom I can never be 
grateful enough for her generous appreciation and 
attention.</p>
        <p>I went out to the gate to greet the President, who met 
me most cordially; kissed me, in fact. Custis Lee and 
Governor Lubbock were at his back.</p>
        <p>Immediately after breakfast (the Presidential party arrived a 
little before daylight) General Chesnut drove off with the 
President's aides, and Mr. Davis sat out on our piazza. 
There was nobody with him but myself. Some little boys 
strolling by called out, “Come here and look; there is a man 
on Mrs. Chesnut's porch who looks just like Jeff Davis on 
postage-stamps.” People began to gather at once on the 
street. Mr. Davis then went in. </p>
        <p>Mrs. McCord sent a magnificent bouquet—I thought, of
<pb id="mches329" n="329"/>
course, for the President; but she gave me such a scolding 
afterward. She did not know he was there; I, in my mistake 
about the bouquet, thought she knew, and so did not send 
her word.</p>
        <p>The President was watching me prepare a mint julep for 
Custis Lee when Colonel McLean came to inform us that a 
great crowd had gathered and that they were coming to ask 
the President to speak to them at one o'clock. An immense 
crowd it was—men, women, and children. The crowd 
overflowed the house, the President's hand was nearly 
shaken off. I went to the rear, my head intent on the dinner 
to be prepared for him, with only a Confederate 
commissariat.. But the patriotic public had come to the 
rescue. I had been gathering what I could of eatables for a 
month, and now I found that nearly everybody in Columbia 
was sending me whatever they had that they thought nice 
enough for the President's dinner. We had the sixty-year-old 
Madeira from Mulberry, and the beautiful old china, etc. 
Mrs. Preston sent a boned turkey stuffed with truffles, 
stuffed tomatoes, and stuffed peppers. Each made a dish as 
pretty as it was appetizing.</p>
        <p>A mob of small boys only came to pay their respects 
to the President. He seemed to know how to meet that odd 
delegation. </p>
        <p>Then the President's party had to go, and we bade them 
an affectionate farewell. Custis Lee and I had spent much 
time gossiping on the back porch. While I was concocting 
dainties for the dessert, he sat on the banister with a cigar in 
his mouth. He spoke very candidly, telling me many a hard 
truth for the Confederacy, and about the bad time which was 
at hand.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">October 18th</hi>.—Ten pleasant days I owe to my sister. 
Kate has descended upon me unexpectedly from the mountains 
of Flat Rock. We are true sisters; she understands me
without words, and she is the cleverest, sweetest woman I 
know, so graceful and gracious in manner, so good and 
<pb id="mches330" n="330"/>
unselfish in character, but, best of all, she is so agreeable. 
Any time or place would be charming with Kate for a 
companion. General Chesnut was in Camden; but I could 
not wait. I gave the beautiful bride, Mrs. Darby, a dinner, 
which was simply perfection. I was satisfied for once in 
my life with my own table, and I know pleasanter guests 
were never seated around any table whatsoever.</p>
        <p>My house is always crowded. After all, what a 
number of pleasant people we have been thrown in with 
by war's catastrophes. I call such society glorious. It is 
the windup, but the old life as it begins to die will die 
royally. General Chesnut came back disheartened. He 
complains that such a life as I lead gives him no time to 
think.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">October 28th</hi>.-Burton Harrison writes to General 
Preston that supreme anxiety reigns in Richmond.</p>
        <p>Oh, for one single port! If the Alabama had had in the 
whole wide world a port to take her prizes to and where
she could be refitted, I believe she would have borne us
through. Oh, for one single port by which we could get at 
the outside world and refit our whole Confederacy! If we 
could have hired regiments from Europe, or even have 
imported ammunition and food for our soldiers!</p>
        <p>“Some days must be dark and dreary.” At the    
mantua-maker's, however, I saw an instance of faith in 
our future: a bride's paraphernalia, and the radiant bride 
herself, the bridegroom expectant and elect now within 
twenty miles of Chattanooga and outward bound to face 
the foe.</p>
        <p>Saw at the Laurens's not only Lizzie Hamilton, a perfect
little beauty, but the very table the first Declaration of 
Independence was written upon. These Laurenses are 
grandchildren of Henry Laurens, of the first Revolution. 
Alas! we have yet to make good our second declaration of 
independence-Southern independence-from Yankee 
meddling and Yankee rule. Hood has written to ask them 
to send General Chesnut out to command one of his 
brigades.  In whose place?</p>
        <pb id="mches331" n="331"/>
        <p>If Albert Sidney Johnston had lived! Poor old General 
Lee has no backing. Stonewall would have saved us from 
Antietam.  Sherman will now catch General Lee by the 
rear, while Grant holds him by the head, and while Hood 
and Thomas are performing an Indian war-dance on the 
frontier. Hood means to cut his way to Lee; see if he doesn't 
The “Yanks” have had a struggle for it. More than once 
we seemed to have been too much for them. We have been 
so near to success it aches one to think of it. So runs the 
table-talk.</p>
        <p>Next to our house, which Isabella calls “Tillytudlem,” 
since Mr. Davis's visit, is a common of green grass and 
very level, beyond which comes a belt of pine-trees. On this 
open space, within forty paces of us, a regiment of foreign 
deserters has camped. They have taken the oath of 
allegiance to our government, and are now being drilled and 
disciplined into form before being sent to our army. They 
are mostly Germans, with some Irish, however. Their close 
proximity keeps me miserable. Traitors once, traitors 
forever.</p>
        <p>Jordan has always been held responsible for all the 
foolish proclamations, and, indeed, for whatever Beauregard 
reported or proclaimed. Now he has left that mighty chief, 
and, lo, here comes from Beauregard the silliest and most 
boastful of his military bulletins. He brags of Shiloh; that 
was not the way the story was told to us.</p>
        <p>A letter from Mrs. Davis, who says: “Thank you, a 
thousand times, my dear friend, for your more than maternal 
kindness to my dear child.”  That is what she calls her sister, 
Maggie Howell.  “As to Mr. Davis, he thinks the best ham, 
the best Madeira, the best coffee, the best hostess in the 
world, rendered Columbia delightful to him when he passed 
through. We are in a sad and anxious state here just now. 
The dead come in; but the living do not go out so fast. 
However, we hope all things and trust in God as the only 
one able to resolve the opposite state of feeling into

a triumphant, happy whole. I had a surprise of an unusually 
gratifying nature a few days since. I found I could not keep 
my horses, so I sold them. The next day they were returned 
to me with a handsome anonymous note to the effect that 
they had been bought by a few friends for me. But I fear I 
can not feed them. Strictly between us, things look very 
anxious here.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">November 6th</hi>.-Sally Hampton went to Richmond with 
the Rev. Mr. Martin. She arrived there on Wednesday. On 
Thursday her father, Wade Hampton, fought a great battle, but 
just did not win it-a victory narrowly missed. Darkness 
supervened and impenetrable woods prevented that longed-for 
consummation. Preston Hampton rode recklessly into the 
hottest fire. His father sent his brother, Wade, to bring him 
back. Wade saw him reel in the saddle and galloped up to him, 
General Hampton following. As young Wade reached him, 
Preston fell from his horse, and the one brother, stooping to 
raise the other, was himself shot down. Preston recognized his 
father, but died without speaking a word. Young Wade, though 
wounded, held his brother's head up. Tom Taylor and others 
hurried up. The General took his dead son in his arms, kissed 
him, and handed his body to Tom Taylor and his friends, bade 
them take care of Wade, and then rode back to his post. At the 
head of his troops in the thickest of the fray he directed the 
fight for the rest of the day. Until night he did not know young 
Wade's fate; that boy might be dead, too! Now, he says, no son 
of his must be in his command. When Wade recovers, he must 
join some other division. The agony of such a day, and the 
anxiety and the duties of the battle-field-it is all more than a 
mere man can bear.</p>
        <p>Another letter from Mrs. Davis. She says: “I was 
dreadfully shocked at Preston Hampton's fate-his untimely 
fate. I know nothing more touching in history than General 
Hampton's situation at the supremest moment of his misery, 
when he sent one son to save the other and saw 
<pb id="mches333" n="333"/>
both fall; and could not know for some moments whether 
both were not killed.”</p>
        <p>A thousand dollars have slipped through my fingers 
already this week. At the Commissary's I spent five hundred 
to-day for candles, sugar, and a lamp, etc. Tallow candles 
are bad enough, but of them there seems to be an end, too. 
Now we are restricted to smoky, terrabine lamps- 
terrabine is a preparation of turpentine. When the chimney 
of the lamp cracks, as crack it will, we plaster up the place 
with paper, thick old letter-paper, preferring the highly 
glazed kind. In the hunt for paper queer old letters come to 
light.</p>
        <p>Sherman, in Atlanta, has left Thomas to take care of 
Hood. Hood has thirty thousand men, Thomas forty 
thousand, and as many more to be had as he wants; he has 
only to ring the bell and call for them. Grant can get all that 
he wants, both for himself and for Thomas. All the world is

sea, and our boat has sprung a leak.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">November 17th</hi>.—Although Sherman<ref targOrder="U" id="ref126" n="126" rend="sc" target="note126">1</ref>  took Atlanta, he 
does not mean to stay there, be it heaven or hell. Fire and the 
sword are for us here; that is the word. And now I must 
begin my Columbia life anew and alone. It will be a short 
shrift.</p>
        <p>Captain Ogden came to dinner on Sunday and in the 
afternoon asked me to go with him to the Presbyterian 
Church and hear Mr. Palmer. We went, and I felt very
<note id="note126" n="126" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref126">1. General Sherman had started from Chattanooga for his march
across Georgia on May 6, 1864. He had won the battles of Dalton, 
Resaca, and New Hope Church in May, the battle of Kennesaw Mountain 
in June, the battles of Peach Tree Creek and Atlanta in July, and 
had formally occupied Atlanta on September 2d. On November 16th, he 
started on his march from Atlanta to the sea and entered Savannah on 
December 23d.  Early in 1865 he moved his army northward through 
the Carolinas, and on April 26th received the surrender of General 
Joseph E. Johnston.</note>
<pb id="mches334" n="334"/>
youthful, as the country people say; like a girl and her beau. 
Ogden took me into a pew and my husband sat afar off. 
What a sermon! The preacher stirred my blood. My very 
flesh crept and tingled. A red-hot glow of patriotism passed 
through me. Such a sermon must strengthen the hearts and 
the hands of many people. There was more exhortation to 
fight and die, <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">à la</hi></foreign> Joshua, than meek Christianity.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">November 25th</hi>.—Sherman is thundering at Augusta's 
very doors. My General was on the wing, somber, and full 
of care. The girls are merry enough; the staff, who fairly 
live here, no better. Cassandra, with a black shawl over her 
head, is chased by the gay crew from sofa to sofa, for she 
avoids them, being full of miserable anxiety. There is 
nothing but distraction and confusion. All things tend to the 
preparation for the departure of the troops. It rains all the 
time, such rains as I never saw before; incessant torrents. 
These men come in and out in the red mud and slush of 
Columbia streets. Things seem dismal and wretched to me 
to the last degree, but the staff, the girls, and the youngsters 
do not see it.</p>
        <p>Mrs. S. (born in Connecticut) came, and she was radiant. 
She did not come to see me, but my nieces. She says 
exultingly that  “Sherman will open a way out at last, and I 
will go at once to Europe or go North to my relatives there.” 
How she derided our misery and “mocked when our fear 
cometh.” I dare say she takes me for a fool. I sat there 
dumb, although she was in my own house. I have heard of a 
woman so enraged that she struck some one over the head 
with a shovel. To-day, for the first time in my life, I know 
how that mad woman felt. I could have given Mrs. S. the 
benefit of shovel and tongs both.</p>
        <p>That splendid fellow, Preston Hampton; “home they 
brought their warrior, dead,” and wrapped in that very 
Legion flag he had borne so often in battle with his own 
hands.</p>
        <pb id="mches335" n="335"/>
        <p>A letter from Mrs. Davis to-day, under date of 
Richmond, Va., November 20, 1864. She says: “Affairs 
West are looking so critical now that, before you receive 
this, you and I will be in the depths or else triumphant. I 
confess I do not sniff success in every passing breeze, but I 
am so tired, hoping, fearing, and being disappointed, that I 
have made up my mind not to be disconsolate, even though 
thieves break through and steal. Some people expect another 
attack upon Richmond shortly, but I think the avalanche 
will not slide until the spring breaks up its winter quarters. I 
have a blind kind of prognostics of victory for us, but 
somehow I am not cheered. The temper of Congress is less 
vicious, but more concerted in its hostile action.”  Mrs. 
Davis is a woman that my heart aches for in the troubles 
ahead.</p>
        <p>My journal, a quire of Confederate paper, lies wide open 
on my desk in the corner of my drawing-room. Everybody 
reads it who chooses. Buck comes regularly to see what I 
have written last, and makes faces when it does not suit her. 
Isabella still calls me Cassandra, and puts her hands to her 
ears when I begin to wail. Well, Cassandra only records 
what she hears; she does not vouch for it. For really, one 
nowadays never feels certain of anything.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">November 28th</hi>.—We dined at Mrs. McCord's. She is as 
strong a cordial for broken spirits and failing heart as one 
could wish. How her strength contrasts with our weakness. 
Like Doctor Palmer, she strings one up to bear bravely the 
worst. She has the intellect of a man and the perseverance 
and endurance of a woman.</p>
        <p>We have lost nearly all of our men, and we have no 
money, and it looks as if we had taught the Yankees how to 
fight since Manassas. Our best and bravest are under the 
sod; we shall have to wait till another generation grows up. 
Here we stand, despair in our hearts (“Oh, Cassandra, 
don't!”  shouts Isabella), with our houses burning or about 
to be, over our heads.</p>
        <pb id="mches336" n="336"/>
        <p>The North have just got things ship-shape; a splendid army, 
perfectly disciplined, with new levies coming in day and 
night. Their gentry do not go into the ranks. They hardly 
know there is a war up there.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 1st</hi>.—At Coosawhatchie Yankees are landing 
in great force. Our troops down there are raw militia, old 
men and boys never under fire before; some college cadets, 
in all a mere handful. The cradle and the grave have been 
robbed by us, they say. Sherman goes to Savannah and not 
to Augusta.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 2d</hi>.—Isabella and I put on bonnets and shawls 
and went deliberately out for news. We determined to seek 
until we found. Met a man who was so ugly, I could not 
forget him or his sobriquet; he was awfully in love with me 
once. He did not know me, but blushed hotly when Isabella 
told him who I was. He had forgotten me, I hope, or else I 
am changed by age and care past all recognition. He gave us 
the encouraging information that Grahamville had been 
burned to the ground.</p>
        <p>When the call for horses was made, Mrs. McCord sent in 
her fine bays. She comes now with a pair of mules, and 
looks too long and significantly at my ponies. If I were not 
so much afraid of her, I would hint that those mules would 
be of far more use in camp than my ponies. But they will 
seize the ponies, no doubt.</p>
        <p>In all my life before, the stables were far off from the 
house and I had nothing to do with them.  Now my ponies are  
kept  under  an open shed next to the back piazza. Here I  sit  
with  my  work, or my desk, or my book, basking in our Southern 
sun, and I watch Nat feed, curry, and rub down the horses, 
and then he cleans their stables as thoroughly  as  Smith 
does my drawing-room. I see their beds  of  straw  comfortably  
laid.  Nat  says,  “Ow,   Missis,  ain't  lady's  business  to 
look so much in de stables.”   I  care  nothing for his grumbling, 
and I have never had horses in better condition. Poor ponies, 
you deserve every attention, and enough to 
<pb id="mches337" n="337"/>
eat. Grass does not grow under your feet. By night and day 
you are on the trot.</p>
        <p>To-day General Chesnut was in Charleston on his way 
from Augusta to Savannah by rail. The telegraph is still 
working between Charleston and Savannah. Grahamville 
certainly is burned. There was fighting down there to-day. I 
came home with enough to think about, Heaven knows! 
And then all day long we compounded a pound cake in 
honor of Mrs. Cuthbert,  who has things so nice at home. 
The cake was a success, but was it worth all that trouble?</p>
        <p>As my party were driving off to the concert, an omnibus 
rattled up. Enter Captain Leland, of General Chesnut's staff, 
of as imposing a presence as a field-marshal, handsome and 
gray-haired. He was here on some military errand and 
brought me a letter. He said the Yankees had been repulsed, 
and that down in those swamps we could give a good 
account of ourselves if our government would send men 
enough. With a sufficient army to meet them down there, 
they could be annihilated. “Where are the men to come 
from?” asked Mamie, wildly. “General Hood has gone off 
to Tennessee. Even if he does defeat Thomas there, what 
difference would that make here?”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 3d</hi>.—We drank tea at Mrs. McCord's; she had 
her troubles, too. The night before a country cousin claimed 
her hospitality, one who fain would take the train at five this 
morning. A little after midnight Mrs. McCord was startled 
out of her first sleep by loud ringing of bells; an alarm at 
night may mean so much just now. In an instant she was on 
her feet.    She found her guest, who thought it was daylight, 
and wanted  to  go.  Mrs. McCord forcibly demonstrated 
how foolish it was to get up five hours too soon. Mrs. 
McCord, once more in her own warm bed, had fallen 
happily to sleep. She was waked by feeling two ice-cold 
hands pass cautiously over her face and person. It was pitch 
dark. Even Mrs. McCord gave a scream in her fright. She 
found it was only the irrepressible guest up 
<pb id="mches338" n="338"/>
and at her again. So, though it was only three o'clock, in 
order to quiet this perturbed spirit she rose and at five drove 
her to the station, where she had to wait some hours. But 
Mrs. McCord said, “anything for peace at home.” The 
restless people who will not let others rest!</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 5th</hi>.—Miss Olivia Middleton and Mr. 
Frederick Blake are to be married. We Confederates have 
invented the sit-up-all-night for the wedding night; Isabella 
calls it the wake, not the wedding, of the parties married. 
The ceremony will be performed early in the evening; the 
whole company will then sit up until five o'clock, at which 
hour the bridal couple take the train for Combahee. Hope 
Sherman will not be so inconsiderate as to cut short the 
honeymoon.</p>
        <p>In tripped Brewster, with his hat on his head, both hands 
extended, and his greeting, “Well, here we are!” He was 
travel-stained, disheveled, grimy with dirt. The prophet 
would have to send him many times to bathe in Jordan 
before he could be pronounced clean.</p>
        <p>Hood will not turn and pursue Sherman. Thomas is at 
his heels with forty thousand men, and can have as many 
more as he wants for the asking. Between Thomas and 
Sherman Hood would be crushed. So he was pushing—I do 
not remember where or what. I know there was no comfort 
in anything he said.</p>
        <p>Serena's account of money spent: Paper and envelopes, 
$12.00; tickets to concert, $10.00; tooth-brush, $10.00; 
total, $32.00.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 14th</hi>.—And now the young ones are in bed and 
I am wide awake. It is an odd thing; in all my life how many 
persons have I seen in love? Not a half-dozen. And I am a 
tolerably close observer, a faithful watcher have I been from 
my youth upward of men and manners. Society has been for 
me only an enlarged field for character study.</p>
        <p>Flirtation is the business of society; that is, playing at 
<pb id="mches339" n="339"/>
love-making. It begins in vanity, it ends in vanity. It is 
spurred on by idleness and a want of any other 
excitement. Flattery, battledore and shuttlecock, how in 
this game flattery is dashed backward and forward. It is 
so soothing to self-conceit. If it begins and ends in 
vanity, vexation of spirit supervenes sometimes. They do 
occasionally burn their fingers awfully, playing with 
fire, but there are no hearts broken. Each party in a 
flirtation has secured a sympathetic listener, to whom he 
or she can talk of himself or herself—somebody who, for 
the time, admires one exclusively, and, as the French 
say, <hi rend="italics">excessivement</hi>. It is a pleasant, but very foolish 
game, and so to bed.</p>
        <p>Hood and Thomas have had a fearful fight, with 
carnage and loss of generals excessive in proportion to 
numbers. That means they were leading and urging their 
men up to the enemy. I know how Bartow and Barnard 
Bee were killed bringing up their men. One of Mr. 
Chesnut's sins thrown in his teeth by the Legislature of 
South Carolina was that he procured the promotion of 
Gist, “State Rights” Gist, by his influence in Richmond. 
What have these comfortable, stay-at-home patriots to 
say of General Gist now? “And how could man die 
better than facing fearful odds,” etc.</p>
        <p>So Fort McAlister has fallen! Good-by, Savannah! 
Our Governor announces himself a follower of Joe 
Brown, of Georgia. Another famous Joe.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 19th</hi>.—The deep waters are closing over us 
and we are in this house, like the outsiders at the time of the 
flood. We care for none of these things. We eat, drink,  
laugh, dance, in lightness of heart.</p>
        <p>Doctor Trezevant came to tell me the dismal news. How 
he  piled  on the agony! Desolation, mismanagement, despair. 
General Young, with the flower of Hampton's cavalry, is in 
Columbia. Horses can not be found to mount them. Neither the

it may prove like most of their victories, brag and bluster. 
Can't say why, maybe I am benumbed,  but I do not feel so 
intensely miserable.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">December 27th</hi>.—Oh,  why did we go to Camden? The 
very dismalest Christmas overtook us there. Miss Rhett 
went with us—a brilliant woman and very agreeable. “The 
world, you know, is composed,” said she, “of men, women, 
and Rhetts” (see Lady Montagu). Now, we feel that if we 
are to lose our negroes,  we would as soon see Sherman free 
them as the Confederate Government; freeing negroes is the 
last Confederate Government craze. We are a little too slow 
about it; that is all.</p>
        <p>Sold fifteen bales of cotton and took a sad farewell look 
at Mulberry. It is a magnificent old country-seat, with old 
oaks, green lawns and all. So I took that last farewell of 
Mulberry, once so hated, now so beloved.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 7th</hi>.—Sherman is at Hardieville and Hood in 
Tennessee, the last of his men not gone, as Louis Wigfall so 
cheerfully prophesied.</p>
        <p>Serena went for a half-hour to-day to the dentist. Her teeth 
are of the whitest and most regular, simply perfection. She 
fancied it was better to have a dentist look in her mouth 
before returning to the mountains. For that look she paid 
three hundred and fifty dollars in Confederate money.   
“Why, has this money any value at all?” she asked. Little 
enough in all truth, sad to say.</p>
        <p>Brewster  was  here and stayed till midnight. Said he 
must see General Chesnut. He had business with him. His  
“me and General Hood” is no longer comic. He described 
Sherman's march of destruction and desolation. “Sherman 
leaves a track fifty miles wide, upon which there

departed.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 10th</hi>.—You do the Anabasis business when you 
want to get out of the enemy's country, and the 
Thermopylae business when they want to get into your 
country. But we retreated in our own country and we gave 
up our mountain passes without a blow. But never mind the 
Greeks; if we had only our own Game Cock, Sumter, our 
own Swamp Fox, Marion. Marion's men or Sumter's, or 
the equivalent of them, now lie under the sod, in Virginia 
or Tennessee.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 14th</hi>.—Yesterday I broke down—gave way to 
abject terror under the news of Sherman's advance with no 
news of my husband. To-day, while wrapped up on the sofa, 
too dismal even for moaning, there was a loud knock. 
Shawls on and all, just as I was, I rushed to the door to find 
a telegram from my husband: “All well; be at home 
Tuesday.” It was dated from Adam's Run. I felt as 
lighthearted as if the war were over. Then I looked at the 
date and the place—Adam's Run. It ends as it began—in a 
run -Bull's Run, from which their first sprightly running 
astounded the world, and now Adam's Run. But if we must 
run, who are left to run? From Bull Run they ran 
full-handed. But we have fought until maimed soldiers, 
women, and children are all that remain to run.</p>
        <p>To-day Kershaw's brigade, or what is left of it, passed 
through. What shouts greeted it and what bold shouts of 
thanks it returned! It was all a very encouraging noise, 
absolutely comforting. Some true men are left, after all.</p>
        <p>January 16th.—My husband is at home once more—for 
how long, I do not know. His aides fill the house, and a 
group of hopelessly wounded haunt the place. The drilling 
and the marching go on outside. It rains a flood, with freshet 
after freshet. The forces of nature are befriending us, for our 
enemies have to make their way through swamps.</p>
        <p>A month ago my husband wrote me a letter which I 
promptly suppressed after showing it to Mrs. McCord. He 
<pb id="mches342" n="342"/>
warned us to make ready, for the end had come. Our 
resources were exhausted, and the means of resistance could 
not be found. We could not bring ourselves to believe it, and 
now, he thinks, with the railroad all blown up, the swamps 
made impassable by the freshets,  which have no time to 
subside, so constant is the rain, and the negroes utterly 
apathetic (would they be so if they saw us triumphant?), if 
we had but an army to seize the opportunity we might do 
something; but there are no troops; that is the real trouble.</p>
        <p>To-day Mrs. McCord exchanged $16,000 in Confederate bills 
for $300 in gold—sixteen thousand for three hundred.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">January 17th</hi>.—The Bazaar for the benefit of the 
hospitals opens now. Sherman marches constantly. All the 
railroads are smashed, and if I laugh at any mortal thing it is 
that I may not weep. Generals are as plenty as blackberries, 
but none are in command.</p>
        <p>The Peace Commissioner, Blair, came. They say he gave 
Mr. Davis the kiss of peace. And we send Stephens, 
Campbell, all who have believed in this thing, to negotiate 
for peace. No hope, no good. Who dares hope?</p>
        <p>Repressed excitement in church. A great railroad character 
was called out. He soon returned and whispered something 
to Joe Johnston and they went out together. Somehow the 
whisper moved around to us that Sherman was at 
Branchville.  “Grant us patience, good Lord,” was prayed 
aloud. “Not Ulysses Grant, good Lord,” murmured Teddy, 
profanely. Hood came yesterday. He is staying at the 
Prestons' with Jack. They sent for us. What a heartfelt 
greeting he gave us. He can stand well enough without his 
crutch, but he does very slow walking. How plainly he spoke 
out dreadful words about “my defeat and discomfiture; my 
army destroyed, my losses,” etc., etc. He said he had 
nobody to blame but himself. A telegram from Beauregard 
to-day to my husband. He does not know whether Sherman 
intends to advance on Branchville,  Charleston, or Columbia.</p>
        <pb id="mches343" n="343"/>
        <p>Isabella said: “Maybe you attempted the impossible,” 
and began one of her merriest stories. Jack Preston touched 
me on the arm and we slipped out. “He did not hear a word 
she was saying. He has forgotten us all. Did you notice 
how he stared in the fire? And the lurid spots which came 
out in his face and the drops of perspiration that stood on 
his forehead?” “Yes. He is going over some bitter scene; 
he sees Willie Preston with his heart shot away. He sees the 
panic at Nashville and the dead on the battlefield at 
Franklin.” “That agony on his face comes again and 
again,” said tender-hearted Jack. “I can't keep him out of 
those absent fits.”</p>
        <p>Governor McGrath and General Winder talk of 
preparations for a defense of Columbia. If Beauregard 
can't stop Sherman down there, what have we got here to 
do it with? Can we cheek or impede his march? Can any 
one?</p>
        <p>Last night General Hampton came in. I am sure he 
would do something to save us if he were put in supreme 
command here. Hampton says Joe Johnston is equal, if not 
superior, to Lee as a commanding officer.</p>
        <p>My silver is in a box and has been delivered for safe 
keeping to Isaac McLaughlin, who is really my beau-ideal 
of a grateful negro. I mean to trust him. My husband cares 
for none of these things now, and lets me do as I please.</p>
        <p>Tom Archer died almost as soon as he got to Richmond. 
Prison takes the life out of men. He was only half-alive 
when here. He had a strange, pallid look and such a vacant 
stare until you roused him. Poor pretty Sally Archer: that is

        <head><hi rend="italics">February</hi> 16,1865—<hi rend="italics">March</hi> 15,1865</head>
        <p>Lincolnton, N.C., <hi rend="italics">February 16, 1865</hi>.—A change
has come o'er the spirit of my dream.  Dear old
quire of yellow, coarse, Confederate home-made paper,
here you are again.  An age of anxiety and suffering
has passed over my head since last I wrote and wept over
your forlorn pages.</p>
        <p>My ideas of those last days are confused.  The Martins
left Columbia the Friday before I did, and Mammy, the
negro woman, who had nursed them, refused to go with
them.  That daunted me.  Then Mrs. McCord, who was to
send her girls with me, changed her mind.  She sent them
up-stairs in her house and actually took away the staircase;
that was her plan.</p>
        <p>Then I met Mr. Christopher Hampton, arranging to
take off his sisters.  They were flitting, but were to go only
as far as Yorkville.  He said it was time to move on.  
Sherman was at Orangeburg, barely a day's journey from Columbia,
and had left a track as bare and blackened as a fire leaves
on the prairies.</p>
        <p>So my time had come, too.  My husband urged me to go
home.  He said Camden would be safe enough.  They had
no spite against that old town, as they have against 
Charleston and Columbia.  Molly, weeping and wailing, came in
while we were at table.  Wiping her red-hot face with the
cook's grimy apron, she said I ought to go among our own
black people on the plantation; they would take care of me
better than any one else.  So I agreed to go to Mulberry or 
<pb id="mches345" n="345"/>
the Hermitage plantation, and sent Lawrence down with a 
wagon-load of my valuables. </p>
        <p>Then a Miss Patterson called—a refugee from Tennessee. 
She had been in a country overrun by Yankee invaders, and 
she described so graphically all the horrors to be endured by 
those subjected to fire and sword, rapine and plunder, that I 
was fairly scared, and determined to come here. This is a 
thoroughly out-of-all-routes place. And yet I can go to 
Charlotte, am half-way to Kate at Flat Rock, and there is no 
Federal army between me and Richmond.</p>
        <p>As soon as my mind was finally made up, we 
telegraphed to Lawrence, who had barely got to Camden in 
the wagon when the telegram was handed to him; so he took 
the train and came back. Mr. Chesnut sent him with us to 
take care of the party.</p>
        <p>We thought that if the negroes were ever so loyal to us, 
they could not protect me from an army bent upon sweeping 
us from the face of the earth, and if they tried to do so so 
much the worse would it be for the poor things with their 
Yankee friends. I then left them to shift for themselves, as 
they are accustomed to do, and I took the same liberty. My 
husband does not care a fig for the property question, and 
never did. Perhaps, if he had ever known poverty, it would 
be different. He talked beautifully about it, as he always 
does about everything. I have told him often that, if at 
heaven's gate St. Peter would listen to him a while, and let 
him tell his own story, he would get in, and the angels might 
give him a crown extra.</p>
        <p>Now he says he has only one care—that I should be safe, 
and not so harassed with dread; and then there is his blind 
old father. “A man,” said he, “can always die like a patriot 
and a gentleman, with no fuss, and take it coolly. It is hard 
not to envy those who are out of all this, their difficulties 
ended—those who have met death gloriously on the 
battle-field, their doubts all solved. One can but do his best 
and leave the result to a higher power.”</p>
        <pb id="mches346" n="346"/>
        <p>After New Orleans, those vain, passionate, impatient 
little Creoles were forever committing suicide, driven to it 
by despair and “Beast” Butler. As we read these things, 
Mrs. Davis said: “If they want to die, why not first kill  
‘Beast’ Butler, rid the world of their foe and be saved the 
trouble of murdering themselves?” That practical way of 
removing their intolerable burden did not occur to them. I 
repeated this suggestive anecdote to our corps of generals 
without troops, here in this house, as they spread out their 
maps on my table where lay this quire of paper from which 
I write. Every man Jack of them had a safe plan to stop 
Sherman, if—</p>
        <p>Even Beauregard and Lee were expected, but Grant had 
double-teamed on Lee. Lee could not save his own—how 
could he come to save us?  Read the list of the dead in

        <p>I took French leave of Columbia—slipped away without 
a word to anybody. Isaac Hayne and Mr. Chesnut came 
down to the Charlotte depot with me. Ellen, my maid, left 
her husband and only child, but she was willing to come, 
and, indeed, was very cheerful in her way of looking at it.</p>

Molly goin' all de time.”</p>
        <p>A woman, fifty years old at least, and uglier than she was 
old, sharply rebuked my husband for standing at the car 
window for a last few words with me. She said rudely:         
“Stand aside, sir! I want air!”  With his hat off, and his 
grand air, my husband bowed politely, and said: “In one 
moment, madam; I have something important to say to my 
wife.”</p>
        <p>She talked aloud and introduced herself to every man,

claiming his protection. She had never traveled alone before 
in all her life. Old age and ugliness are protective in some 
cases. She was ardently patriotic for a while. Then she was 
joined by her friend, a man as crazy as herself to get out of 
this. From their talk I gleaned she had been for years in the 
Treasury Department. They were about to cross the lines. 
The whole idea was to get away from the trouble to come 
down here. They were Yankees, but were they not spies?</p>
        <p>Here I am broken-hearted and an exile. And in such a 
place!  We have bare floors, and for a feather-bed, pine 
table, and two chairs I pay $30 a day. Such sheets! But 
fortunately I have some of my own.  At the door, before I 
was well out of the hack, the woman of the house packed 
Lawrence back, neck and heels: she would not have him at 
any price. She treated him as Mr. F.'s aunt did Clenman in 
Little Dorrit. She said his clothes were too fine for a nigger. 
“His airs, indeed.” Poor Lawrence was humble and silent. 
He said at last, “Miss Mary, send me back to Mars Jeems.”  
I began to look for a pencil to write a note to my husband, 
but in the flurry could not find one. “Here is one,” said 
Lawrence, producing one with a gold case. “Go away,” she 
shouted, “I want no niggers here with gold pencils and 
airs.” So Lawrence fled before the storm, but not before he 
had begged me to go back. He said, “if Mars Jeems knew 
how you was treated he'd never be willing for you to stay 
here.”</p>
        <p>The Martins had seen my, to them, well-known traveling 
case as the hack trotted up Main Street, and they arrived at 
this juncture out of breath. We embraced and wept. I kept 
my room.</p>
        <p>The Fants are refugees here, too; they are Virginians, 
and have been in exile since the second battle of Manassas. 
Poor things; they seem to have been everywhere, and seen and 
suffered everything. They even tried to go back to their own 
house, but found one chimney only standing
<pb id="mches348" n="348"/>
alone; even that had been taken possession of by a Yankee 
who had written his name upon it. </p>
        <p>The day I left home I had packed a box of flour, sugar 
rice, and coffee, but my husband would not let me bring it. 
He said I was coming to a land of plenty—unexplored North 
Carolina, where the foot of the Yankee marauder was 
unknown, and in Columbia they would need food. Now I 
have written for that box and many other things to be sent 
me by Lawrence, or I shall starve.</p>
        <p>The Middletons have come. How joyously I sprang to 
my feet to greet them. Mrs. Ben Rutledge described the 
hubbub in Columbia. Everybody was flying in every 
direction like a flock of swallows. She heard the enemy's 
guns booming in the distance. The train no longer run, from 
Charlotte to Columbia. Miss Middleton possesses her soul 
in peace. She is as cool, clever, rational, and entertaining as 
ever, and we talked for hours. Mrs. Reed was in a state of 
despair. I can well understand that sinking of mind and body 
during the first days as the abject misery of it all closes in 
upon you. I remember my suicidal tendencies when I first 
came here.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 18th</hi>. — Here I am, thank God, settled at the 
McLean's, in a clean, comfortable room, airy and cozy. 
With a grateful heart I stir up my own bright wood fire My 
bill for four days at this splendid hotel here was $240 with 
$25 additional for fire. But once more my lines have fallen 
in pleasant places.</p>
        <p>As  we came up on the train from Charlotte a soldier took out 
of his pocket a filthy rag. If it had lain in the gutter for 
months it could not have looked worse. He unwrapped the 
thing carefully and took out two biscuits of the species 
known as “hard tack.” Then he gallantly handed me one and 
with an ingratiating smile asked me “to take some.”  Then 
he explained, saying, “Please take these two; swap with me; 
give me something softer that I can eat; I am very weak 
still.”  Immediately, for his benefit, my basket of
<pb id="mches349" n="349"/>
luncheon was emptied, but as for his biscuit, I would not 
choose any.  Isabella asked, “But what did you say to 
him when he poked them under your nose?” and I 
replied, “I held up both hands, saying, ‘I would not take 
from you anything that is yours—far from it! I would not 
touch them for worlds.’ ”</p>
        <p>A tremendous day's work and I helped with a will; our
window glass was all to be washed. Then the brass andirons
were to be polished. After we rubbed them bright how
pretty they were.</p>
        <p>Presently Ellen would have none of me. She was 
scrubbing the floor. “You go—dat's a good missis—an' 
stay to Miss Isabella's till de flo' dry.”  I am very docile 
now, and I obeyed orders.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 19th</hi>.—The Fants say all the trouble at the 
hotel came from our servants' bragging. They represented 
us as millionaires, and the Middleton men servants 
smoked cigars. Mrs. Reed's averred that he had never 
done anything in his life but stand behind his master at 
table with a silver waiter in his hand. We were charged 
accordingly, but perhaps the landlady did not get the best 
of us after all, for we paid her in Confederate money. 
Now that they won't take Confederate money in the shops 
here how are we to live? Miss Middleton says 
quartermasters' families are all clad in good gray cloth, 
but the soldiers go naked. Well, we are like the families of 
whom the novels always say they are poor but honest. 
Poor? Well-nigh beggars are we, for I do not know where 
my next meal is to come from.</p>
        <p>Called on Mrs. Ben Rutledge to-day. She is lovely, 
exquisitely refined. Her mother, Mrs. Middleton, came in.    
“You are not looking well, dear? Anything the matter?”    
“No—but, mamma, I have not eaten a mouthful to-day. 
The children can eat mush; I can't. I drank my tea, 
however.”  She does not understand taking favors, and, 
blushing violently, refused to let me have Ellen make her 
some biscuit. I went home and sent her some biscuit all 
the same. </p>
        <pb id="mches350" n="350"/>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 22d</hi>.—Isabella has been reading my diaries. 
How we laugh because my sage divinations all come to 
naught. My famous “insight into character” is utter folly. 
The diaries were lying on the hearth ready to be burned, but 
she told me to hold on to them; think of them a while and 
don't be rash. Afterward when Isabella and I  were taking a 
walk, General Joseph E. Johnston joined us. He explained to 
us all of Lee's and Stonewall Jackson's mistakes. We had 
nothing to say—how could we say anything? He said he was 
very angry when he was ordered to take command again. He 
might well have been in a genuine rage. This on and off 
procedure would be enough to bewilder the coolest head. 
Mrs. Johnston knows how to be a partizan of Joe Johnston 
and still not make his enemies uncomfortable. She can be 
pleasant and agreeable, as she was to my face.</p>
        <p>A letter from my husband who is at Charlotte. He came 
near being taken a prisoner in Columbia, for he was asleep 
the morning of the 17th, when the Yankees blew up the 
railroad depot. That woke him, of course, and he found 
everybody had left Columbia, and the town was 
surrendered by the mayor, Colonel Goodwyn. Hampton 
and his command had been gone several hours. Isaac 
Hayne came away with General Chesnut. There was no 
fire in the town when they left. They overtook Hampton's 
command at Meek's Mill. That night, from the hills where 
they encamped, they saw the fire, and knew the Yankees 
were burning the town, as we had every reason to expect 
they would. Molly was left in charge of everything of 
mine, including Mrs. Preston's cow, which I was keeping, 
and Sally Goodwyn's furniture.</p>
        <p>Charleston and Wilmington have surrendered. I have no 
further use for a newspaper. I never want to see another 
one as long as I live. Wade Hampton has been made a 
lieutenant-general, too late. If he had been made one and 
given command in South Carolina six months ago I believe 
he would have saved us. Shame, disgrace, beggary, all 
<pb id="mches350a" n="350a"/>

have come at once, and are hard to bear—the grand 
smash! Rain, rain, outside, and naught but drowning 
floods of tears inside. I could not bear it; so I rushed 
down in that rainstorm to the Martins'. Rev. Mr. Martin 
met me at the door. “Madam,” said he, “Columbia 
is burned to the ground.” I bowed my head and sobbed 
aloud. “Stop that!” he said, trying to speak cheerfully.  
“Come here, wife,” said he to Mrs. Martin. “This woman 
cries with her whole heart, just as she laughs.” But in 
spite of his words, his voice broke down, and he was 
hardly calmer than myself.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 23d</hi>.—I want to get to Kate, I am so utterly 
heart-broken. I hope John Chesnut and General Chesnut 
may at least get into the same army. We seem scattered 
over the face of the earth. Isabella sits there calmly 
reading. I have quieted down after the day's rampage. 
May our heavenly Father look down on us and have pity.</p>
        <p>They say I was the last refugee from Columbia who was 
allowed to enter by the door of the cars. The government 
took possession then and women could only be smuggled in 
by the windows. Stout ones stuck and had to be pushed, 
pulled, and hauled in by main force. Dear Mrs. Izard,  with 
all her dignity, was subjected to this rough treatment. She 
was found almost too much for the size of the car windows.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 25th</hi>.—The Pfeifers, who live opposite us 
here, are descendants of those Pfeifers who came South 
with Mr. Chesnut's ancestors after the Fort Duquesne 
disaster. They have now, therefore, been driven out of 
their Eden, the valley of Virginia, a second time. The 
present Pfeifer is the great man, the rich man <hi rend="italics">par 
excellence</hi> of Lincolnton. They say that with something 
very near to tears in his eyes he heard of our latest 
defeats. “It is only a question of time with us now,” he 
said. “The raiders will come, you know.”</p>
        <p>In Washington, before I knew any of them. except by 
<pb id="mches352" n="352"/>
sight, Mrs. Davis, Mrs. Emory, and Mrs. Johnston were 
always together, inseparable friends, and the trio were 
pointed out to me as the cleverest women in the United 
States. Now that I do know them all well, I think the world 
was right in its estimate of them.</p>
        <p>Met a Mr. Ancrum of serenely cheerful aspect, happy 
and hopeful. “All right now,” said he. “Sherman sure to be 
thrashed. Joe Johnston is in command.” Dr. Darby says, 
when the oft-mentioned Joseph, the malcontent, gave up his 
command to Hood, he remarked with a smile, “I hope you 
will be able to stop Sherman; it was more than I could do.” 
General Johnston is not of Mr. Ancrum's way of thinking as 
to his own powers, for he stayed here several days after he 
was ordered to the front. He must have known he could do 
no good, and I am of his opinion.</p>
        <p>When the wagon, in which I was to travel to Flat Rock, 
drove up to the door, covered with a tent-like white cloth, in 
my embarrassment for an opening in the conversation I 
asked the driver's name. He showed great hesitation in 
giving it, but at last said: “My name is Sherman,” adding,  
“and now I see by your face that you won't go with me. My 
name is against me these times.” Here he grinned and 
remarked:    “But you would leave Lincolnton.”</p>
        <p>That name was the last drop in my cup, but I gave him 
Mrs. Glover's reason for staying here. General Johnston had 
told her this “might be the safest place after all.” He thinks 
the Yankees are making straight for Richmond and General 
Lee's rear, and will go by Camden and Lancaster, leaving 
Lincolnton on their west flank.</p>
        <p>The McLeans are kind people. They ask no rent for for their 
rooms—only $20 a week for firewood. Twenty dollars!
and such dollars—mere waste paper.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Munroe took up my photograph book, in which I 
have a picture of all the Yankee generals. “I want to see the 
men who are to be our masters,” said she. “Not mine”        
I answered, “thank God, come what may. This 
<pb id="mches353" n="353"/>
was a free fight. We had as much right to fight to get out as 
they had to fight to keep us in. If they try to play the 
masters, anywhere upon the habitable globe will I go, never 
to see a Yankee, and if I die on the way so much the better.” 
Then I sat down and wrote to my husband in language much 
worse than anything I can put in this book. As I wrote I was 
blinded by tears of rage. Indeed, I nearly wept myself away.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 26th</hi>.—Mrs. Munroe offered me religious 
books, which I declined, being already provided with the 
Lamentations of Jeremiah, the Psalms of David, the 
denunciations of Hosea, and, above all, the patient wail of 
Job. Job is my comforter now. I should be so thankful to 
know life never would be any worse with me. My husband 
is well, and has been ordered to join the great Retreater. I 
am bodily comfortable, if somewhat dingily lodged, and I 
daily part with my raiment for food. We find no one who 
will exchange eatables for Confederate money; so we are 
devouring our clothes.</p>
        <p>Opportunities for social enjoyment are not wanting. Miss 
Middleton and Isabella often drink a cup of tea with me. 
One might search the whole world and not find two cleverer 
or more agreeable women. Miss Middleton is brilliant and 
accomplished. She must have been a hard student all her 
life. She knows everybody worth knowing, and she has been 
everywhere. Then she is so high-bred, high-hearted, pure, 
and true. She is so clean-minded; she could not harbor a 
wrong thought. She is utterly unselfish, a devoted daughter 
and sister. She is one among the many large-brained women 
a kind Providence has thrown in my way, such as Mrs. 
McCord, daughter of Judge Cheves; Mary Preston Darby, 
Mrs. Emory, granddaughter of old Franklin, the American 
wise man, and Mrs. Jefferson Davis. How I love to praise 
my friends!</p>
        <p>As a ray of artificial sunshine, Mrs. Munroe sent me an 
Examiner. Daniel thinks we are at the last gasp, and now
<pb id="mches354" n="354"/>
England and France are bound to step in. England must 
know if the United States of America are triumphant they 
will tackle her next, and France must wonder if she will 
not have to give up Mexico. My faith fails me. It is all too 
late; no help for us now from God or man.</p>
        <p>Thomas, Daniel says, was now to ravage Georgia, but 
Sherman, from all accounts, has done that work once for 
all. There will be no aftermath. They say no living thing is 
found in Sherman's track, only chimneys, like telegraph 
poles, to carry the news of Sherman's army backward. </p>
        <p>In all that tropical down-pour, Mrs. Munroe sent me 
overshoes and an umbrella, with the message, “Come 
over” I went, for it would be as well to drown in the 
streets as to hang myself at home to my own bedpost. At 
Mrs. Munroe's I met a Miss McDaniel. Her father, for 
seven years, was the Methodist preacher at our negro 
church. The negro church is in a grove just opposite 
Mulberry house. She says her father has so often 
described that fine old establishment and its beautiful lawn, 
live-oaks, etc. Now, I dare say there stand at Mulberry 
only Sherman's sentinels -stacks of chimneys. We have 
made up our minds for the worst. Mulberry house is no 
doubt razed to the ground.</p>
        <p>Miss McDaniel was inclined to praise us. She said:  
“As a general rule the Episcopal minister went to the family 
mansion, and the Methodist missionary preached to the 
negroes and dined with the overseer at his house, but at 
Mulberry her father always stayed at the ‘House,’ and the 
family were so kind and attentive to him.” It was rather 
pleasant to hear one's family so spoken of among strangers.</p>
        <p>So, well equipped to brave the weather, armed 
cap-a-pie, so to speak, I continued my prowl farther afield 
and brought up at the Middletons'.  I may have surprised 
them for “at such an inclement season” they hardly expected 
a visitor. Never, however, did lonely old woman receive such a 	
warm and hearty welcome. Now we know the worst.  Are
<pb id="mches355" n="355"/>
we growing hardened? We avoid all allusion to Columbia; 
we never speak of home, and we begin to deride the certain 
poverty that lies ahead. </p>
        <p>How it pours! Could I live many days in solitary 
confinement? Things are beginning to be unbearable, but I 
must sit down and be satisfied. My husband is safe so far. 
Let me be thankful it is no worse with me. But there is the 
gnawing pain all the same. What is the good of being here at 
all, Our world has simply gone to destruction. And across 
the way the fair Lydia languishes. She has not even my 
resources against ennui. She has no Isabella, no Miss 
Middleton, two as brilliant women as any in Christendom. 
Oh, how does she stand it! I mean to go to church if it rains 
cats and dogs. My feet are wet two or three times a day. We 
never take cold; our hearts are too hot within us for that.</p>
        <p>A carriage was driven up to the door as I was writing. I 
began to tie on my bonnet, and said to myself in the glass,    
“Oh, you lucky woman!” I was all in a tremble, so great 
was my haste to be out of this. Mrs. Glover had the 
carriage. She came for me to go and hear Mr. Martin 
preach. He lifts our spirits from this dull earth; he takes us 
up to heaven. That I will not deny. Still he can not hold my 
attention; my heart  wanders  and  my  mind strays back to 
South Carolina. Oh, vandal Sherman! what are you at there, 
hard-hearted wretch that you are! A letter from General 
Chesnut, who writes from camp near Charlotte under date of 
February 28th:</p>
        <p>“I thank you a thousand, thousand times for your kind 
letters. They are now my only earthly comfort, except the 
hope  that  all  is not yet lost. We have been driven like a 
wild herd from our country. And it is not from a want of 
spirit  in  the  people or soldiers, nor from want of energy 
and competency in our commanders. The restoration of Joe 
Johnston,  it  is  hoped,  will  redound to the advantage of 
our cause and the reestablishment of our fortunes! I 
<pb id="mches356" n="356"/>
am still in not very agreeable circumstances. For the last 
four days completely water-bound.</p>
        <p>“I am informed that a detachment of Yankees were sent 
from Liberty Hill to Camden with a view to destroying all 
the houses, mills, and provisions about that place. No 
particulars have reached me. You know I expected the worst 
that could be done, and am fully prepared for any report 
which may be made.</p>
        <p>“It would be a happiness beyond expression to see you 
even for an hour. I have heard nothing from my poor old 
father. I fear I shall never see him again. Such is the fate of 
war. I do not complain. I have deliberately chosen my lot, 
and am prepared for any fate that awaits me. My care is for 
you, and I trust still in the good cause of my country and the 
justice and mercy of God.”</p>
        <p>It was a lively, rushing, young set that South Carolina 
put to the fore. They knew it was a time of imminent danger, 
and that the fight would be ten to one. They expected to win 
by activity, energy, and enthusiasm. Then came the wet 
blanket, the croakers; now, these are posing, wrapping 
Cæsar's mantle about their heads to fall with dignity. Those 
gallant youths who dashed so gaily to the front lie mostly in 
bloody graves. Well for them, maybe. There are worse 
things than honorable graves. Wearisome thoughts. Late in 
life we are to begin anew and have laborious, difficult days 
ahead.</p>
        <p>We have contradictory testimony. Governor Aiken has passed 
through, saying Sherman left Columbia as he found it, and 
was last heard from at Cheraw. Dr. Chisolm walked home 
with me. He says that is the last version of the story; Now 
my husband wrote that he himself saw the fires which 
burned up Columbia. The first night his camp was near 
enough to the town for that.</p>
        <p>They  say  Sherman  has  burned Lancaster—that 
Sherman nightmare, that ghoul, that hyena! But I do not 
believe it. He takes his time. There are none to molest him.
<pb id="mches357" n="357"/>
He does things leisurely and deliberately. Why stop to  do 
so needless a thing as burn Lancaster court-house, the jail, 
and the tavern? As I remember it, that description covers 
Lancaster. A raiding party they say did for Camden.</p>
        <p>No train from Charlotte yesterday. Rumor says 
Sherman is in Charlotte.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">February 29th</hi>.—Trying to brave it out. They have 
plenty, yet let our men freeze and starve in their prisons. 
Would you be willing to be as wicked as they are? A 
thousand times, no! But we must feed our army first—if we 
can do so much as that. Our captives need not starve if 
Lincoln would consent to exchange prisoners; but men are 
nothing to the United States—things to throw away. If they 
send our men back they strengthen our army, and so again 
their policy is to keep everybody and everything here in 
order to help starve us out. That, too, is what Sherman's 
destruction means—to starve us out.</p>
        <p>Young Brevard asked me to play accompaniments for 
him. The guitar is my instrument, or was; so I sang and 
played, to my own great delight. It was a distraction. Then I 
made egg-nog for the soldier boys below and came home. 
Have spent a very pleasant evening. Begone,  dull care; you 
and I never agree.</p>
        <p>Ellen and I are shut up here. It is rain, rain, everlasting rain. 
As our money is worthless, are we not to starve? Heavens! 
how grateful I was to-day when Mrs. McLean sent me a 
piece of chicken. I think the emptiness of my larder has 
leaked out. To-day Mrs. Munroe sent me hot cakes and eggs 
for my breakfast.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 5th</hi>.—Is the sea drying up? Is it going up into 
mist and coming down on us in a water-spout? The rain, it 
raineth every day. The weather typifies our tearful despair, 
on a large scale. It is also Lent now—a quite convenient 
custom, for we, in truth, have nothing to eat. So we fast and 
pray, and go dragging to church like drowned rats to be 
preached at.</p>
        <pb id="mches358" n="358"/>
        <p>My letter from my husband was so—well,  what in a 
woman you would call heart-broken, that I began to get 
ready for a run up to Charlotte. My hat was on my head, my 
traveling-bag in my hand, and Ellen was saying “Which 
umbrella, ma'am?”  “Stop, Ellen,” said I, “someone is 
speaking out there.” A tap came at the door, and Miss 
McLean threw the door wide open as she said in a 
triumphant voice: “Permit me to announce General 
Chesnut.” As she went off she sang out, “Oh, does not a 
meeting like this make amends?”</p>
        <p>We went after luncheon to see Mrs. Munroe. My 
husband wanted to thank her for all her kindness to me. I 
was awfully proud of him. I used to think that everybody 
had the air and manners of a gentleman. I know now that 
these accomplishments are things to thank God for. Father 
O'Connell came in, fresh from Columbia, and with news at 
last. Sherman's men had burned the convent. Mrs. Munroe 
had pinned her faith to Sherman because he was a Roman 
Catholic, but Father O'Connell was there and saw it. The 
nuns and girls marched to the old Hampton house (Mrs. 
Preston's now), and so saved it. They walked between files 
of soldiers. Men were rolling tar barrels and lighting torches 
to fling on the house when the nuns came. Columbia is but 
dust and ashes, burned to the ground. Men, women, and 
children have been left there homeless, houseless, and 
without one particle of food—reduced to picking up corn that 
was left by Sherman's horses on picket grounds and 
parching it to stay their hunger.</p>
        <p>How kind my friends were on this, my fête day! Mrs. 
Rutledge sent me a plate of biscuit; Mrs. Munroe, nearly 
enough food supplies for an entire dinner; Miss McLean a 
cake for dessert. Ellen cooked and served up the material 
happily at hand very nicely, indeed. There never was a more 
successful dinner. My heart was too full to eat, but I was 
quiet and calm; at least I spared my husband the trial of a 
broken voice and tears. As he stood at the window, 
<pb id="mches359" n="359"/>
with his back to the room, he said: “Where are they now- 
my old blind father and my sister? Day and night I see her 
leading him out from under his own rooftree. That picture 
pursues me persistently. But come, let us talk of pleasanter 
things.” To which I answered, “Where will you find them?”</p>
        <p>He took off his heavy cavalry boots and Ellen carried 
them away to wash the mud off and dry them. She brought 
them back just as Miss Middleton walked in. In his agony, 
while struggling with those huge boots and trying to get 
them on, he spoke to her volubly in French. She turned away 
from him instantly, as she saw his shoeless plight, and said 
to me, “I had not heard of your happiness. I did not know 
the General was here.”  Not until next day did we have time 
to remember and laugh at that outbreak of French. Miss 
Middleton answered him in the same language. He told her 
how charmed he was with my surroundings, and that he 
would go away with a much lighter heart since he had seen 
the kind people with whom he would leave me.</p>
        <p>I asked my husband what that correspondence between 
Sherman and Hampton meant—this while I was preparing 
something for our dinner. His back was still turned as he 
gazed out of the window. He spoke in the low and steady 
monotone  that  characterized our conversation the whole 
day,  and yet there was something in his voice that thrilled 
me as he said: “The second day after our march from 
Columbia we passed the M.'s. He was a bonded man and not 
at  home.  His  wife said at first that she could not find 
forage for our horses, but afterward she succeeded in 
procuring some. I noticed a very handsome girl who stood 
beside her as she spoke, and I suggested to her mother the 
propriety of sending her out of the track of both armies. 
Things were no longer as heretofore; there was so much 
straggling, so many camp followers, with no discipline, on 
the outskirts of the army. The girl answered quickly, ‘I 
<pb id="mches360" n="360"/>
wish to stay with my mother.’ That very night a party of 
Wheeler's men came to our camp, and such a tale they told 
of what had been done at the place of horror and 
destruction, the mother left raving. The outrage had been 
committed before her very face, she having been secured 
first . After this crime the fiends moved on. There were only 
seven of them. They had been gone but a short time when 
Wheeler's men went in pursuit at full speed and overtook 
them, cut their throats and wrote upon their breasts: ‘These 
were the seven!’ ”</p>
        <p>“But the girl?”</p>
        <p>“Oh, she was dead!”</p>
        <p>“Are his critics as violent as ever against the President?” 
asked I when recovered from pity and horror. “Sometimes 
I think I am the only friend he has in the world. At these 
dinners, which they give us everywhere, I spoil the sport, for 
I will not sit still and hear Jeff Davis abused for things he is 
no more responsible for than any man at that table. Once I 
lost my temper and told them it sounded like arrant nonsense 
to me, and that Jeff Davis was a gentleman and a patriot, 
with more brains than the assembled company.” “You lost 
your temper truly,” said I. “And I did not know it. I thought 
I was as cool as I am now. In Washington when we left, 
Jeff Davis ranked second to none, in intellect, and may be 
first, from the South, and Mrs. Davis was the friend of Mrs. 
Emory, Mrs. Joe Johnston, and Mrs. Montgomery Blair, and 
others of that circle. Now they rave that he is nobody, and 
never was.” “And she?” I asked. “Oh, you would think to 
hear them that he found her yesterday in a Mississippi 
swamp!” “Well, in the French Revolution it was worse. 
When a man failed he was guillotined. Mirabeau did not die 
a day too soon, even Mirabeau.”</p>
        <p>He is gone. With despair in my heart I left that railroad 
station. Allan Green walked home with me. I met his wife 
and his four ragged little boys a day or so ago. She
<pb id="mches361" n="361"/>
is the neatest, the primmest, the softest of women. Her 
voice is like the gentle cooing of a dove. That lowering 
black future hangs there all the same. The end of the war 
brings no hope of peace or of security to us. Ellen said I 
had a little piece of bread and a little molasses in store for 
my dinner to-day.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 6th</hi>.—To-day came a godsend. Even a small piece 
of bread and the molasses had become things of the past. 
My larder was empty, when a tall mulatto woman brought a 
tray covered by a huge white serviette. Ellen ushered her in 
with a flourish, saying, “Mrs. McDaniel's maid.”  The maid 
set down the tray upon my bare table, and uncovered it with 
conscious pride. There were fowls ready for roasting, 
sausages, butter, bread, eggs, and preserves. I was dumb 
with delight. After silent thanks to heaven my powers of 
speech returned, and I exhausted myself in messages of 
gratitude to Mrs. McDaniel.</p>
        <p>“Missis, you oughtn't to let her see how glad you was,” 
said Ellen. “It was a lettin' of yo'sef down.”</p>
        <p>Mrs. Glover gave me some yarn, and I bought five dozen 
eggs with it from a wagon—eggs for Lent. To show that I 
have faith yet in humanity, I paid in advance in yarn for 
something to eat, which they promised to bring to-morrow. 
Had they rated their eggs at $100 a dozen in “Confederick” 
money, I would have paid it as readily as $10. But I haggle 
in yarn for the millionth part of a thread.</p>
        <p>Two weeks have passed and the rumors from Columbia 
are still of the vaguest. No letter has come from there, no 
direct message, or messenger. “My God!” cried Dr. Frank 
Miles, “but it is strange. Can it be anything so dreadful they 
dare not tell us?” Dr. St. Julien Ravenel has grown pale and 
haggard with care. His wife and children were left there.</p>
        <p>Dr. Brumby has at last been coaxed into selling me 
enough leather for the making of a pair of shoes, else I 
should have had to give up walking. He knew my father 
<pb id="mches362" n="362"/>
well. He intimated that in some way my father helped him 
through college. His own money had not sufficed, and so 
William C. Preston and my father advanced funds sufficient 
to let him be graduated. Then my uncle, Charles Miller, 
married his aunt. I listened in rapture, for all this tended to 
leniency in the leather business, and I bore off the leather 
gladly. When asked for Confederate money in trade I never 
stop to bargain. I give them $20 or $50 cheerfully for 
anything—either sum.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 8th</hi>.—Colonel Childs came with a letter from my 
husband and a newspaper containing a full account of 
Sherman's cold-blooded brutality in Columbia. Then we 
walked three miles to return the call of my benefactress, 
Mrs. McDaniel. They were kind and hospitable at her house, 
but my heart was like lead; my head ached, and my legs 
were worse than my head, and then I had a nervous chill. So 
I came home; went to bed and stayed there until the Fants 
brought me a letter saying my husband would be here today. 
Then I got up and made ready to give him a cheerful 
reception. Soon a man called, Troy by name, the same who 
kept the little corner shop so near my house in Columbia, 
and of whom we bought things so often. We had fraternized. 
He now shook hands with me and looked in my face 
pitifully. We seemed to have been friends all our lives. He 
says they stopped the fire at the Methodist College, perhaps 
to save old Mr. McCartha's house. Mr. Sheriff Dent, being 
burned out, took refuge in our house. He contrived to find 
favor in Yankee eyes. Troy relates that a Yankee officer 
snatched a watch from Mrs. McCord's bosom. The soldiers 
tore the bundles of clothes that the poor wretches tried to 
save from their burning homes, and dashed them back into 
the flames. They meant to make a clean sweep. They were 
howling round the fires like demons, these Yankees in their 
joy and triumph at our destruction. Well, we have given 
them a big scare and kept them miserable for four 
years—the little handful of us.</p>
        <pb id="mches363" n="363"/>
        <p>A woman we met on the street stopped to tell us a 
painful coincidence. A general was married but he could not 
stay at home very long after the wedding. When his baby  
was born they telegraphed him, and he sent back a rejoicing   
answer with an inquiry, “Is it a boy or a girl?”  He was 
killed before he got the reply. Was it not sad? His poor 
young wife says,    “He did not live to hear that his son 
lived.” The kind woman added, sorrowfully, “Died and did 
not know the sect of his child.”  “Let us hope it will be a 
Methodist,” said Isabella, the irrepressible.</p>
        <p>At the venison feast Isabella heard a good word for me 
and one for General Chesnut's air of distinction, a thing 
people can not give themselves, try as ever they may. Lord 
Byron says, Everybody knows a gentleman when he sees 
one, and nobody can tell what it is that makes a gentleman. 
He knows the thing, but he can't describe it. Now there are 
some French words that can not be translated, and we all 
know the thing they mean—<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">gracieuse</hi></foreign> and <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">svelte</hi></foreign>, for 
instance, as applied to a woman. Not that anything was 
said of me like that—far from it. I am fair, fat, forty, and 
jolly, and in my unbroken jollity, as far as they know, they 
found my charm. “You see, she doesn't howl; she doesn't 
cry; she never, never tells anybody about what she was 
used to at home and what she has lost.” High praise, and I 
intend to try and deserve it ever after.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 10th</hi>.—Went to church crying to Ellen, “It is 
Lent, we must fast and pray.” When I came home my good 
fairy, Colonel Childs,  had been here bringing rice and 
potatoes, and promising flour. He is a trump. He pulled out 
his pocket-book and offered to be my banker. He stood 
there on the street, Miss Middleton and Isabella witnessing 
the generous action, and straight out offered me money.  
“No, put up that,” said I. “I am not a beggar, and I never 
will be; to die is so much easier.”</p>
        <p>Alas, after that flourish of trumpets, when he came with 
a sack of flour, I accepted it gratefully. I receive things I
<pb id="mches364" n="364"/>
can not pay for, but money is different. There I draw a line, 
imaginary perhaps. Once before the same thing happened. 
Our letters of credit came slowly in 1845, when we went 
unexpectedly to Europe and our letters were to follow us. I 
was a poor little, inoffensive bride, and a British officer, 
who guessed our embarrassment, for we did not tell him (he 
came over with us on the ship), asked my husband to draw 
on his banker until the letters of credit should arrive. It was 
a nice thing for a stranger to do.</p>
        <p>We have never lost what we never had. We have never 
had any money—only unlimited credit, for my husband's 
richest kind of a father insured us all manner of credit. It 
was all a mirage only at last, and it has gone just as we 
drew nigh to it.</p>
        <p>Colonel Childs says eight of our Senators are for 
reconstruction, and that a ray of light has penetrated inward 
from Lincoln, who told Judge Campbell that Southern land 
would not be confiscated.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 12th</hi>.—Better to-day. A long, long weary day in 
grief has passed away. I suppose General Chesnut is 
somewhere—but where? that is the question. Only once has 
he visited this sad spot, which holds, he says, all that he 
cares for on earth. Unless he comes or writes soon I will 
cease, or try to cease, this wearisome looking, looking, 
looking for him.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 13th</hi>.—My husband at last did come for a visit of two 
hours. Brought Lawrence, who had been to Camden, and 
was there, indeed, during the raid. My husband has been 
ordered to Chester, S. C. We are surprised to see by the 
papers that we behaved heroically in leaving everything we 
had to be destroyed, without one thought of surrender. We 
had not thought of ourselves from the heroic point of view. 
Isaac McLaughlin hid and saved everything we trusted him 
with. A grateful negro is Isaac.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 15th</hi>.—Lawrence says Miss Chesnut is very proud of 
the presence of mind and cool self-possession she showed 
<pb id="mches365" n="365"/>
in the face of the enemy. She lost, after all, only two bottles 
of champagne, two of her brother's gold-headed canes, and 
her brother's horses, including Claudia, the brood mare, that 
he valued beyond price, and her own carriage, and a 
fly-brush boy called Battis, whose occupation in life was to 
stand behind the table with his peacock feathers and brush 
the flies away. He was the sole member of his dusky race at 
Mulberry who deserted “Ole Marster” to follow the 
Yankees.</p>
        <p>Now for our losses at the Hermitage. Added to the 
gold-headed canes and Claudia, we lost every mule and 
horse, and President Davis's beautiful Arabian was 
captured. John's were there, too. My light dragoon, Johnny, 
and heavy swell, is stripped light enough for the fight now. 
Jonathan, whom we trusted, betrayed us; and the plantation 
and mills, Mulberry house, etc., were saved by Claiborne,  
that black rascal, who was suspected by all the world. 
Claiborne boldly affirmed that Mr. Chesnut would not be 
hurt by destroying his place; the invaders would hurt only 
the negroes. “Mars Jeems,” said he, “hardly ever come 
here and he takes only a little sompen nur to eat when he do 
come.”</p>
        <p>Fever continuing, I sent for St. Julien Ravenel. We had a 
wrangle over the slavery question. Then, he fell foul of 
everybody who had not conducted this war according to his 
ideas. Ellen had something nice to offer him (thanks to the 
ever-bountiful Childs!), but he was too angry, too anxious, 
too miserable to eat. He pitched into Ellen after he had 
disposed of me. Ellen stood glaring at him from the 
fireplace, her blue eye nearly white, her other eye blazing as 
a comet. Last Sunday, he gave her some Dover's powders 
for me; directions were written on the paper in which the 
medicine was wrapped, and he told her to show these to me, 
then to put what I should give her into a wine-glass and let 
me drink it. Ellen put it all into the wine-glass and let me 
drink it at one dose. “It was enough to last you 
<pb id="mches366" n="366"/>
your lifetime,” he said. “It was murder.” Turning to I 
Ellen:    “What did you do with the directions?”  “I  
nuvver see no d'rections. You nuvver gimme none.”  “I 
told you to show that paper to your mistress.”  “Well, I 
flung dat ole brown paper in de fire. What you makin' all 
dis fuss for? Soon as I give Missis de physic, she stop 
frettin' an' flingin' 'bout, she go to sleep sweet as a suckling 
baby, an' she slep two days an' nights, an' now she heap 
better.” And Ellen withdrew from the controversy.</p>
        <p>“Well, all is well that ends well, Mrs. Chesnut. You 
took opium enough to kill several persons. You were 
worried out and needed rest. You came near getting 
it—thoroughly. You were in no danger from your disease. 
But  your doctor and your nurse combined were deadly.”  
Maybe I was saved by the adulteration, the feebleness, of 
Confederate medicine.</p>

        <p>A letter from my husband, written at Chester Court 
House on March 15th, says: “In the morning I send 
Lieut. Ogden with Lawrence to Lincolnton to bring you 
down. I have three vacant rooms; one with bedsteads, 
chairs, washstands, basins, and pitchers; the two others 
bare. You can have half of a kitchen for your cooking. I 
have also at Dr. Da Vega's, a room, furnished, to which 
you are invited (board, also). You can take your choice. 
If you can get your friends in Lincolnton to assume 
charge of your valuables, only bring such as you may 
need here. Perhaps it will be better to bring bed and 
bedding and the other indispensables.”</p>
      </div1>
      <pb id="mches367" n="367"/>

        <head>XX. CHESTER, S. C.</head>
        <head><hi rend="italics">March</hi> 21, 1865—<hi rend="italics">May</hi> 1, 1865</head>
        <p>CHESTER, S. C., <hi rend="italics">March 21,1865</hi>.-Another flitting 
has occurred. Captain Ogden came for me; the splendid 
Childs was true as steel to the last. Surely he 
is the kindest of men. Captain Ogden was slightly 
incredulous when I depicted the wonders of Colonel 
Childs's generosity. So I skilfully led out the good 
gentleman for inspection, and he walked to the train with 
us. He offered me Confederate money, silver, and gold; 
and finally offered to buy our cotton and pay us now 
in gold. Of course, I laughed at his overflowing bounty, 
and accepted nothing; but I begged him to come down to 
Chester or Camden and buy our cotton of General Chesnut there.</p>
        <p>On the train after leaving Lincolnton, as Captain Ogden 
is a refugee, has had no means of communicating with his 
home since New Orleans fell, and was sure to know how 
refugees contrive to live, I beguiled the time acquiring 
information from him. “When people are without a cent, 
how do they live?” I asked. “I am about to enter the noble 
band of homeless, houseless refugees, and Confederate pay 
does not buy one's shoe-strings.” To which he replied,          
“Sponge, sponge. Why did you not let Colonel Childs pay 
your bills?”  “I have no bills,” said I.  “We have never 
made bills anywhere, not even at home,  where they would 
trust us, and  nobody  would  trust  me  in  Lincolnton.”        
“Why  did  you not borrow his money? General Chesnut 
could pay him at his leisure?”  “I am by no
<pb id="mches368" n="368"/>
means sure General Chesnut will ever again have any 
money,” said I.</p>
        <p>As the train rattled and banged along, and I waved my 
handkerchief in farewell to Miss Middleton,    Isabella, and 
other devoted friends, I could only wonder if fate would ever 
throw me again with such kind, clever, agreeable, congenial 
companions, The McLeans refused to be paid for their 
rooms. No plummet can sound the depths of the hospitality 
and kindness of the North Carolina people.</p>
        <p>Misfortune dogged us from the outset. Everything went 
wrong with the train. We broke down within two miles of 
Charlotte, and had to walk that distance; which was pretty 
rough on an invalid barely out of a fever. My spirit was 
further broken by losing an invaluable lace veil, which was 
worn because I was too poor to buy a cheaper one—that is, if 
there were any veils at all for sale in our region.</p>
        <p>My husband had ordered me to a house in Charlotte kept 
by some great friends of his. They established me in the 
drawing-room, a really handsome apartment; they made up 
a bed there and put in a washstand and plenty of water, with 
everything refreshingly clean and nice. But it continued to 
be a public drawing-room, open to all, so that I was half 
dead at night and wanted to go to bed. The piano was there 
and the company played it.</p>
        <p>The landlady announced, proudly, that for supper there 
were nine kinds of custard. Custard sounded nice and light, 
so I sent for some, but found it heavy potato pie. I said:        
”Ellen, this may kill me, though Dover's powder did not.”     
“Don't you believe dat, Missis; try.” We barricaded 
ourselves in the drawing-room that night and left the next 
day at dawn. Arrived at the station, we had another 
disappointment; the train was behind time. There we sat on 
our boxes nine long hours; for the cars might come at any 
moment, and we dared not move an inch from the spot.</p>
        <p>Finally the train rolled in overloaded with paroled 
<pb id="mches369" n="369"/>
prisoners, but heaven helped us: a kind mail agent invited 
us, with two other forlorn women, into his comfortable 
and clean mail-car. Ogden, true to his theory, did not stay 
at the boarding-house as we did. Some Christian 
acquaintances took him in for the night. This he explained 
with a grin.</p>
        <p>My husband was at the Chester station with a 
carriage. We drove at once to Mrs. Da Vega's.  </p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 24th</hi>.-I have been ill, but what could you 
expect? My lines, however, have again fallen in pleasant 
places. Mrs. Da Vega is young, handsome, and agreeable, 
a kind and perfect hostess; and as to the house, my room 
is all that I could ask and leaves nothing to be desired; so 
very fresh, clean, warm, and comfortable is it. It is the 
drawing-room suddenly made into a bedroom for me. But 
it is my very own. We are among the civilized of the earth 
once more.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 27th</hi>.—I  have moved again, and now I am 
looking from a window high, with something more to see 
than the sky. We have the third story of Dr. Da Vega's 
house, which opens on the straight street that leads to the 
railroad about a mile off.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bedon is the loveliest of young widows. Yesterday 
at church Isaac Hayne nestled so close to her cap-strings 
that I had to touch him and say, “Sit up!” Josiah Bedon 
was killed in that famous fight of the Charleston Light 
Dragoons. The dragoons stood still to be shot down in their; 
tracks, having no orders to retire. They had been forgotten, 
doubtless, and they scorned to take care of themselves.</p>
        <p>In this high and airy retreat, as in Richmond, then in 
Columbia, and then in Lincolnton, my cry is still: If they 
would only leave me here in peace and if I were sure 
things never could be worse with me. Again am I 
surrounded by old friends. People seem to vie with each 
other to show how good they can be to me.</p>
        <p>To-day Smith opened the trenches and appeared laden 
<pb id="mches370" n="370"/>
with a tray covered with a snow-white napkin. Here was my 
first help toward housekeeping again. Mrs. Pride has sent a 
boiled ham, a loaf of bread, a huge pancake; another 
neighbor coffee already parched and ground; a loaf of sugar 
already cracked; candles, pickles, and all the other things 
one must trust to love for now. Such money as we have 
avails us nothing, even if there were anything left in the 
shops to buy.</p>
        <p>We had a jolly luncheon. James Lowndes called, the 
best of good company. He said of Buck, “She is a queen, 
and ought to reign in a palace. No Prince Charming yet; no 
man has yet approached her that I think half good enough 
for her.”</p>
        <p>Then Mrs. Prioleau Hamilton, <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">née</hi></foreign> Levy, came with the 
story of family progress, not a royal one, from Columbia 
here: “Before we left home,” said she, “Major Hamilton 
spread a map of the United States on the table, and showed 
me with his finger where Sherman was likely to go. 
Womanlike, I demurred. ‘But, suppose he does not choose 
to go that way?’  ‘Pooh, pooh! what do you know of war?’  
So we set out, my husband, myself, and two children, all in 
one small buggy. The 14th of February we took up our line 
of march, and straight before Sherman's men for five weeks 
we fled together. By incessant hurrying and scurrying from 
pillar  to  post,  we  succeeded  in  acting  as  a  sort of 
<foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">avant-courier</hi></foreign>  of the Yankee army. Without rest and with 
much haste, we got here last Wednesday, and here we mean 
to stay and defy Sherman and his legions. Much the worse 
for wear were we.”</p>
        <p>The first night their beauty sleep was rudely broken into 
at Alston with a cry, “Move on, the Yanks are upon us!”  
So they hurried on, half-awake, to Winnsboro,    but with no 
better  luck.  There  they had to lighten the ship, leave 
trunks, etc., and put on all sail, for this time the Yankees 
were  only  five  miles  behind. “Whip and spur, ride for 
your life!”  was the cry.  “Sherman's objective point
<pb id="mches371" n="371"/>
seemed to be our buggy,” said she; “for you know that 
when we got to Lancaster Sherman was expected there, and 
he keeps his appointments; that is, he kept that one. Two 
small children were in our chariot, and I began to think of 
the Red Sea expedition. But we lost no time, and soon we 
were in Cheraw,    clearly out of the track. We thanked God 
for all his mercies and hugged to our bosoms fond hopes of 
a bed and bath so much needed by all, especially for the 
children.</p>
        <p>“At twelve o'clock General Hardee himself knocked us 
up with word to ‘March! march!’  for  ‘all the blue bonnets 
are over the border.’ In mad haste we made for Fayetteville, 
when they said: ‘God bless your soul! This is the seat of 
war now; the battle-ground where Sherman and Johnston 
are to try conclusions.’  So we harked back, as the hunters 
say, and cut across country, aiming for this place. Clean 
clothes, my dear? Never a one except as we took off 
garment by garment and washed it and dried it by our camp 
fire, with our loins girded and in haste.”  I was snug and 
comfortable all that time in Lincolnton.</p>
        <p> . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . . </p>
        <p>To-day Stephen D. Lee's corps  marched  through—only 
to surrender. The camp songs of these men were a 
heartbreak; so sad, yet so stirring. They would have warmed 
the blood of an Icelander. The leading voice was powerful, 
mellow, clear, distinct, pathetic, sweet. So, I sat down, as 
women have done before, when they hung up their harps by 
strange streams, and I wept the bitterness of such weeping. 
Music? Away, away! Thou speakest to me of things which 
in all my long life I have not found, and I shall not find. 
There they go, the gay and gallant few, doomed; the last 
gathering of the flower of Southern pride, to be killed, or 
worse, to a prison. They continue to prance by, light and 
jaunty. They march with as airy a tread as if they still 
believed the world was all on their side, and that there were 
<pb id="mches372" n="372"/>
no Yankee bullets for the unwary. What will Joe Johnston 
do with them now?</p>
        <p>The Hood melodrama is over, though the curtain has 
not fallen on the last scene. Cassandra croaks and makes 
many mistakes, but to-day she believes that Hood stock is 
going down. When that style of enthusiasm is on the wane, 
the rapidity of its extinction is miraculous. It is like the 
snuffing out of a candle; “one moment white, then gone 
forever.” No, that is not right; it is the snow-flake on the 
river that is referred to. I am getting things as much mixed 
as do the fine ladies of society.</p>
        <p>Lee and Johnston have each fought a drawn battle; only 
a few more dead bodies lie stiff and stark on an unknown 
battle-field. For we do not so much as know where these 
drawn battles took place.</p>
        <p>Teddy Barnwell, after sharing with me my first 
luncheon, failed me cruelly. He was to come for me to go 
down to the train and see Isabella pass by. One word with 
Isabella worth a thousand ordinary ones! So, she has gone 
by and I've not seen her.</p>
        <p>Old Colonel Chesnut refuses to say grace; but as he 
leaves the table audibly declares, “I thank God for a good 
dinner.”  When asked why he did this odd thing he said:        
“My way is to be sure of a thing before I return thanks for 
it.”  Mayor Goodwyn thanked Sherman for promised 
protection to Columbia; soon after, the burning began.</p>
        <p>I received the wife of a post-office robber. The poor 
thing had done no wrong, and I felt so sorry for her. Who 
would be a woman? Who that fool, a weeping, pining, 
faithful woman? She hath hard measures still when she 
hopes kindest. And all her beauty only makes ingrates!</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 29th</hi>.—I was awakened with a bunch of violets 
from Mrs. Pride. Violets always remind me of Kate and of 
the sweet South wind that blew in the garden of paradise 
part of my life. Then, it all came back: the dread 
unspeakable that lies behind every thought now.</p>
        <pb id="mches373" n="373"/>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Thursday</hi>.—I find I have not spoken of the box-car which 
held the Preston party that day on their way to York from 
Richmond. In the party were Mr. and Mrs. Lawson Clay, 
General and Mrs. Preston and their three daughters, Captain 
Rodgers, and Mr. Portman,  whose father is an English earl, 
and connected financially and happily with Portman Square. 
In my American ignorance I may not state Mr. Portman's 
case plainly. Mr. Portman is, of course, a younger son. Then 
there was Cellie and her baby and wet-nurse, with no end of 
servants, male and female. In this ark they slept, ate, and 
drank, such being the fortune of war. We were there but a 
short time, but Mr. Portman, during that brief visit of ours, 
was said to have eaten three luncheons, and the number of 
his drinks, toddies, so called, were counted, too. Mr. 
Portman's contribution to the larder had been three small 
pigs. They were, however, run over by the train, and made 
sausage meat of unduly and before their time.</p>
        <p>General Lee says to the men who shirk duty, “This is 
the people's war; when they tire, I stop.” Wigfall says, “It is 
all over; the game is up.”  He is on his way to Texas, and 
when the hanging begins he can step over into Mexico.</p>
        <p>I am plucking up heart, such troops do I see go by every 
day. They must turn the tide, and surely they are going for 
something more than surrender. It is very late, and the wind 
flaps my curtain, which seems to moan, “Too late.” All this 
will end by making me a nervous lunatic.</p>
        <p>Yesterday while I was driving with Mrs. Pride, Colonel 
McCaw passed us! He called out, “I do hope you are in 
comfortable quarters.” “Very comfortable,” I replied. “Oh, 
Mrs. Chesnut!” said Mrs. Pride, “how can you say that?”    
“Perfectly comfortable, and hope it may never be worse 
with me,” said I.  “I have a clean little parlor, 16 by 18, with 
its bare floor well scrubbed, a dinner-table, six chairs, 
and—well,    that is all; but I have a charming lookout 
<pb id="mches374" n="374"/>
from my window high. My world is now thus divided into 
two parts—where Yankees are and where Yankees are not.”</p>
        <p>As I sat disconsolate, looking out, ready for any new 
tramp of men and arms, the magnificent figure of General 
Preston hove in sight. He was mounted on a mighty steed, 
worthy of its rider, followed by his trusty squire, William 
Walker, who bore before him the General's portmanteau. 
When I had time to realize the situation, I perceived at 
General Preston's right hand Mr. Christopher Hampton and 
Mr. Portman, who passed by. Soon Mrs. Pride, in some 
occult way, divined or heard that they were coming here, 
and she sent me at once no end of good things for my 
tea-table. General Preston entered very soon after, and with 
him Clement Clay, of Alabama, the latter in pursuit of his 
wife's trunk. I left it with the Rev. Mr. Martin, and have no 
doubt it is perfectly safe, but where?  We have written to 
Mr. Martin to inquire. Then Wilmot de Saussure appeared. 
“I am here,” he said, “to consult with General Chesnut. He 
and I always think alike.” He added, emphatically: “Slavery 
is stronger than ever.” “If you think so,” said I, “you will 
find that for once you and General Chesnut do not think 
alike. He has held that slavery was a thing of the past, this 
many a year.”</p>
        <p>I said to General Preston: “I pass my days and nights 
partly at this window. I am sure our army is silently 
dispersing. Men are moving the wrong way, all the time. 
They slip by with no songs and no shouts now. They have 
given the thing up. See for yourself. Look there.”  For a 
while the streets were thronged with soldiers and then they 
were empty again. But the marching now is without tap of 
drum.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">March 31st</hi>.—Mr.   Prioleau Hamilton told us of a great 
adventure. Mrs. Preston was put under his care on the train. 
He soon found the only other women along were “strictly 
unfortunate females,” as Carlyle calls them, beautiful and 
aggressive. He had to communicate the unpleasant fact to 
<pb id="mches375" n="375"/>	
Mrs. Preston, on account of their propinquity, and was lost 
in admiration of her silent dignity, her quiet self-possession, 
her calmness, her deafness and blindness, her thoroughbred 
ignoring of all that she did not care to see. Some women, no 
matter how ladylike, would have made a fuss or would have 
fidgeted, but Mrs. Preston dominated the situation and 
possessed her soul in innocence and peace.</p>
        <p>Met Robert Johnston from Camden. He has been a 
prisoner, having been taken at Camden. The Yankees 
robbed Zack Cantey of his forks and spoons. When Zack 
did not seem to like it, they laughed at him. When he said he 
did not see any fun in it, they pretended to weep and wiped 
their eyes with their coat-tails. All this maddening derision 
Zack said was as hard to bear as it was to see them ride off 
with his horse, Albine. They stole all of Mrs. Zack's jewelry 
and silver. When the Yankee general heard of it he wrote 
her a very polite note, saying how sorry he was that she had 
been annoyed, and returned a bundle of Zack's love-letters, 
written to her before she was married. Robert Johnston said 
Miss Chesnut was a brave and determined spirit. One 
Yankee officer came in while they were at breakfast and sat 
down to warm himself at the fire. “Rebels have no rights,” 
Miss Chesnut said to him politely. “I suppose you have 
come to rob us. Please do so and go. Your presence agitates 
my blind old father.” The man jumped up in a rage, and 
said, “What do you take me for—a robber?”  “No, 
indeed,” said she, and for very shame he marched out 
empty-handed.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 3d</hi>.—Saw General Preston ride off. He came to tell 
me good-by. I told him he looked like a Crusader on his 
great white horse, with William, his squire, at his heels. Our 
men are all consummate riders, and have their servants well 
mounted behind them, carrying cloaks and traps—how 
different from the same men packed like sardines in dirty 
railroad cars, usually floating inch deep in liquid tobacco 
juice.</p>
        <pb id="mches376" n="376"/>
        <p>For the kitchen and Ellen's comfort I wanted a pine table 
and a kitchen chair. A woman sold me one to-day for three 
thousand Confederate dollars.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Hamilton has been disappointed again. Prioleau 
Hamilton says the person into whose house they expected to 
move to-day came to say she could not take boarders for 
three reasons: First, “that they had smallpox in the house.”  
“And the two others?”  “Oh, I did not ask for the two 
others!”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 5th</hi>.—Miss Middleton's letter came in answer to 
mine, telling her how generous my friends here were to me.   
“We long,” she says, “for our own small sufficiency of 
wood, corn, and vegetables. Here is a struggle unto death, 
although the neighbors continue to feed us, as you would 
say, ‘with a spoon.’ We have fallen upon a new device. We 
keep a cookery book on the mantelpiece, and when the 
dinner is deficient we just read off a pudding or a creme.   It 
does not entirely satisfy the appetite, this dessert in 
imagination, but perhaps it is as good for the digestion.”</p>
        <p>As I was ready to go, though still up-stairs, some one 
came  to  say  General  Hood had called. Mrs. Hamilton 
cried out,  “Send  word  you  are not at home.”  “Never!” 
said I.   “Why make him climb all these stairs when you 
must go in five minutes?”  “If he had come here dragging 
Sherman as a captive at his chariot wheels I might say ‘not 
at  home,’  but  not now.”  And I ran down and greeted him 
on the sidewalk in the face of all, and walked slowly beside 
him as he toiled up the weary three stories, limping 
gallantly. He  was so  well  dressed  and so cordial; not 
depressed in the  slightest.  He  was  so  glad to see me. He 
calls his report self-defense; says Joe Johnston attacked him 
and he was  obliged  to  state  things  from  his  point  of  
view. And now follow statements, where one may read 
between the lines what one chooses. He had been offered a 
command in Western Virginia, but as General Lee was 
concerned because he and Joe Johnston were not on cordial 
terms, and as the 
<pb id="mches377" n="377"/>
fatigue of the mountain campaign would be too great for 
him, he would like the chance of going across the 
Mississippi. Texas was true to him, and would be his home, 
as it had voted him a ranch somewhere out there. They say 
General Lee is utterly despondent, and has no plan if 
Richmond goes, as go it must.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 7th</hi>.—Richmond has fallen and I have no heart to 
write about it. Grant broke through our lines and Sherman 
cut through them. Stoneman is this side of Danville. They 
are too many for us. Everything is lost in Richmond, even 
our archives. Blue black is our horizon. Hood says we shall 
all be obliged to go West—to Texas, I mean, for our own 
part of the country will be overrun.</p>
        <p>Yes, a solitude and a wild waste it may become, but, as 
to that, we can rough it in the bush at home.</p>
        <p>De Fontaine, in his newspaper, continues the old cry.       
“Now Richmond is given up,” he says, “it was too heavy a 
load to carry, and we are stronger than ever.”  “Stronger 
than ever?”  Nine-tenths of our army are under ground and 
where is another army to come from?  Will they wait until 
we grow one?</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 15th</hi>.-What  a week it has been—madness,  
sadness, anxiety, turmoil, ceaseless excitement. The 
Wigfalls passed  through  on  their way to Texas. We did 
not see them.  Louly  told  Hood they were bound for the 
Rio Grande,  and intended to shake hands with Maximilian, 
Emperor of Mexico. Yankees were expected here every 
minute. Mrs. Davis came. We went down to the cars at 
daylight to receive her. She dined with me. Lovely Winnie, 
the baby, came, too. Buck and Hood were here, and that 
queen of women, Mary Darby.   Clay behaved like a trump. 
He was as devoted to Mrs. Davis in her adversity as if they 
had  never  quarreled  in her prosperity. People sent me 
things for Mrs. Davis, as they did in Columbia for Mr. 
Davis. It was a luncheon or breakfast only she stayed for 
here. Mrs. Brown prepared a dinner for her at the station.
<pb id="mches378" n="378"/>
I went down with her. She left here at five o'clock. My 
heart was like lead, but we did not give way. She was as 
calm and smiling as ever. It was but a brief glimpse of my 
dear Mrs. Davis, and under altered skies.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 17th</hi>.—A letter from Mrs. Davis, who writes: “Do 
come to me, and see how we get on. I shall have a spare 
room by the time you arrive, indifferently furnished, but, oh, 
so affectionately placed at your service. You will receive 
such a loving welcome. One perfect bliss have I. The baby, 
who grows fat and is smiling always, is christened, and not 
old enough to develop the world's vices or to be snubbed by 
it. The name so long delayed is Varina Anne. My name is a 
heritage of woe.</p>
        <p>“Are you delighted with your husband? I am delighted 
with him as well as with my own. It is well to lose an 
Arabian horse if one elicits such a tender and at the same 
time knightly letter as General Chesnut wrote to my poor 
old Prometheus. I do not think that for a time he felt the 
vultures after the reception of the General's letter.</p>
        <p>“I hear horrid reports about Richmond. It is said that all 
below Ninth Street to the Rocketts has been burned by the 
rabble, who mobbed the town. The Yankee performances 
have not been chronicled. May God take our cause into His 
own hands.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 19th</hi>.—Just now, when Mr. Clay dashed up-stairs, 
pale as a sheet, saying, “General Lee has capitulated,” I 
saw it reflected in Mary Darby's face before I heard him 
speak. She staggered to the table, sat down, and wept aloud. 
Mr. Clay's eyes were not dry. Quite beside herself Mary 
shrieked, “Now we belong to negroes and Yankees!” Buck 
said, “I do not believe it.”</p>
        <p>How different from ours of them is their estimate of us. 
How contradictory is their attitude toward us. To keep the 
despised and iniquitous South within their borders, as part 
of their country, they are willing to enlist millions of men at 
home and abroad, and to spend billions, and we know 
<pb id="mches379" n="379"/>
they do not love fighting <hi rend="italics">per se</hi>, nor spending money. They 
are perfectly willing to have three killed for our one. We 
hear they have all grown rich, through “shoddy,” whatever 
that is. Genuine Yankees can make a fortune trading 
jack-knives.</p>
        <p>“Somehow it is borne in on me that we will have to pay 
the piper,” was remarked to-day. “No; blood can not be 
squeezed from a turnip. You can not pour anything out of 
an empty cup. We have no money even for taxes or to be 
confiscated.”</p>
        <p>While the Preston girls are here, my dining-room is given 
up to them, and we camp on the landing, with our one table 
and six chairs. Beds are made on the dining-room floor. 
Otherwise there is no furniture, except buckets of water and 
bath-tubs in their improvised chamber. Night and day this 
landing and these steps are crowded with the <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">élite</hi></foreign> of the 
Confederacy, going and coming, and when night comes, or 
rather, bedtime, more beds are made on the floor of the 
landing-place for the war-worn soldiers to rest upon. The 
whole house is a bivouac. As Pickens said of South Carolina 
in 1861, we are “an armed camp.”</p>
        <p>My husband is rarely at home. I sleep with the girls, and 
my room is given up to soldiers. General Lee's few, but 
undismayed, his remnant of an army, or the part from the 
South and West, sad and crestfallen, pass through Chester. 
Many discomfited heroes find their way up these stairs. 
They say Johnston will not be caught as Lee was. He can 
retreat; that is his trade. If he would not fight Sherman in 
the hill country of Georgia, what will he do but retreat in the 
plains of North Carolina with Grant, Sherman, and 
Thomas all to the fore?</p>
        <p>We are to stay here. Running is useless now; so we mean 
to bide a Yankee raid, which they say is imminent. Why fly? 
They are everywhere, these Yankees, like red ants, like the 
locusts and frogs which were the plagues of Egypt.</p>
        <pb id="mches380" n="380"/>
        <p>The plucky way in which our men keep up is beyond praise. 
There is no howling, and our poverty is made a matter of 
laughing. We deride our own penury. Of the country we try 
not to speak at all.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 22d</hi>.—This yellow Confederate quire of paper, my 
journal, blotted by entries, has been buried three days with 
the silver sugar-dish, teapot, milk-jug, and a few spoons and 
forks that follow my fortunes as I wander. With these 
valuables was Hood's silver cup, which was partly crushed 
when he was wounded at Chickamauga. </p>
        <p>It has been a wild three days, with aides galloping 
around with messages, Yankees hanging over us like a 
sword of Damocles.   We have been in queer straits. We sat 
up at Mrs. Bedon's dressed, without once going to bed for 
forty-eight hours, and we were aweary.  </p>
        <p>Colonel Cadwallader Jones came with a despatch,  a 
sealed secret despatch.   It was for General Chesnut.   I 
opened it. Lincoln,  old Abe Lincoln, has been killed, 
murdered, and Seward wounded! Why? By whom? It is 
simply maddening, all this.</p>
        <p>I sent off messenger after messenger for General 
Chesnut. I have not the faintest idea where he is, but I know 
this foul murder will bring upon us worse miseries. Mary 
Darby says, “But they murdered him themselves. No 
Confederates are in Washington.” “But if they see fit to 
accuse us of instigating it?”  “Who murdered him? Who 
knows?”  “See if they don't take vengeance on us, now that 
we are ruined and can not repel them any longer.”</p>
        <p>The death of Lincoln I call a warning to tyrants. He will 
not be the last President put to death in the capital, though 
he is the first.</p>
        <p>Buck never submits to be bored. The bores came to 
tea at Mrs. Bedon's, and then sat and talked, so prosy, so 
wearisome was the discourse, so endless it seemed, that we 
envied Buck, who was mooning on the piazza. She rarely 
speaks now.</p>

        <pb id="mches381" n="381"/>
        <p><hi rend="italics">April 23d</hi>.—My silver wedding-day, and I am sure the 
unhappiest day of my life. Mr. Portman came with 
Christopher Hampton. Portman told of Miss Kate Hampton, 
who is perhaps the most thoroughly ladylike person in the 
world. When he told her that Lee had surrendered she 
started up from her seat and said, “That is a lie.”  “Well, 
Miss Hampton, I tell the tale as it was told me. I can do no 
more.”</p>
        <p>No wonder John Chesnut is bitter. They say Mulberry 
has been destroyed by a corps commanded by General 
Logan. Some one asked coolly, “Will General Chesnut be 
shot as a soldier, or hung as a senator?” “I am not of 
sufficient consequence,” answered he.  “They will stop short 
of brigadiers.   I resigned my seat in the United States 
Senate weeks before there was any secession. So I can not 
be hung as a senator. But after all it is only a choice between 
drumhead court martial, short shrift, and a lingering death at 
home from starvation.”</p>
        <p>These negroes are unchanged. The shining black mask 
they wear does not show a ripple of change; they are 
sphinxes. Ellen has had my diamonds to keep for a week or 
so. When the danger was over she handed them back to me 
with as little apparent interest in the matter as if they had 
been garden peas.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Huger was in church in Richmond when the news 
of the surrender came. Worshipers were in the midst of the 
communion service. Mr. McFarland was called out to send 
away the gold from his bank. Mr. Minnegerode's English 
grew confused. Then the President was summoned, and 
distress of mind showed itself in every face. The night before 
one of General Lee's aides, Walter Taylor, was married, 
and was off to the wars immediately after the ceremony.</p>
        <p>One year ago we left Richmond. The Confederacy has 
double-quicked down hill since then.   One year since I 
stood in that beautiful Hollywood by little  Joe Davis's 
<pb id="mches382" n="382"/>
grave. Now we have burned towns, deserted plantations, 
sacked villages. “You seem resolute to look the worst in the 
face,” said General Chesnut, wearily. “Yes, poverty, with 
no future and no hope.” “But no slaves, thank God!” cried 
Buck. “We would be the scorn of the world if the world 
thought of us at all. You see, we are exiles and paupers.”      
“Pile on the agony.”  “How does our famous captain, the 
great Lee, bear the Yankees' galling chain?” I asked. “He 
knows how to possess his soul in patience,” answered my 
husband.  “If there were no such word as subjugation, no 
debts, no poverty, no negro mobs backed by Yankees; if all 
things were well, you would shiver and feel benumbed,” he 
went on, pointing at me in an oratorical attitude.  “Your 
sentence is pronounced—Camden for life.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">May 1st</hi>.—In Chester still. I climb these steep steps alone. 
They have all gone, all passed by. Buck went with Mr. C. 
Hampton to York. Mary, Mrs. Huger, and Pinckney took 
flight together. One day just before they began to dissolve in 
air, Captain Gay was seated at the table, halfway between 
me on the top step and John in the window, with his legs 
outside. Said some one to-day, “She showed me her 
engagement ring, and I put it back on her hand. She is 
engaged, but not to me.”  “By the heaven that is above us 
all, I saw you kiss her hand.”  “That I deny.” Captain Gay 
glared in angry surprise, and insisted that he had seen it.      
“Sit down, Gay,” said the cool captain in his most mournful 
way.  “You see, my father died when I was a baby, and my 
grandfather took me in hand. To him I owe this moral 
maxim. He is ninety years old, a wise old man. Now, 
remember my grandfather's teaching forevermore— ‘A 
gentleman must not kiss and tell.’ ”</p>
        <p>General Preston came to say good-by. He will take his 
family abroad at once. Burnside,  in New Orleans, owes him 
some money and will pay it. “There will be no more 
confiscation, my dear madam,” said he; “they must see that 
we have been punished enough.”  “They do not think 
<pb id="mches383" n="383"/>
so, my dear general. This very day a party of Federals 
passed in hot pursuit of our President.”</p>
        <p>A terrible fire-eater, one of the few men left in the world 
who believe we have a right divine, being white, to hold 
Africans, who are black, in bonds forever; he is six feet two; 
an athlete; a splendid specimen of the animal man; but he 
has never been under fire; his place in the service was a 
bomb-proof office, so-called. With a face red-hot with rage 
he denounced Jeff Davis and Hood. “Come, now,” said 
Edward, the handsome, “men who could fight and did not, 
they are the men who ruined us. We wanted soldiers. If the 
men who are cursing Jeff Davis now had fought with Hood, 
and fought as Hood fought, we'd be all right now.”</p>
        <p>And then he told of my trouble one day while Hood was 
here. “Just such a fellow as you came up on this little 
platform, and before Mrs. Chesnut could warn him, began 
to heap insults on Jeff Davis and his satrap,  Hood. Mrs. 
Chesnut held up her hands. ‘Stop, not another ward. You 
shall not abuse my friends here! Not Jeff Davis behind his 
back, not Hood to his face, for he is in that room and hears 
you.’ ”  Fancy how dumfounded this creature was.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Huger told a story of Joe Johnston in his callow 
days before he was famous. After an illness Johnston's hair 
all fell out; not a hair was left on his head, which shone like 
a fiery cannon-ball. One of the gentlemen from Africa who 
waited at table sniggered so at dinner that he was ordered 
out by the grave and decorous black butler. General Huger, 
feeling for the agonies of young Africa, as he strove to stifle 
his mirth, suggested that Joe Johnston should cover his head 
with his handkerchief. A red silk one was produced, and 
turban-shaped, placed on his head. That completely finished 
the gravity of the butler, who fled in helplessness. His 
guffaw on the outside of the door became plainly audible. 
General Huger then suggested, as they must have the waiter 
back, or the dinner could not go on, that Joe should eat with 
his hat on, which he did.</p>

        <head>XXI. CAMDEN, S. C.</head>
        <head><hi rend="italics">May</hi> 2,1865— <hi rend="italics">August</hi> 2, 1865</head>
        <p>CAMDEN, S. C., <hi rend="italics">May 2, 1865</hi>.—Since we left Chester 
nothing but solitude, nothing but tall blackened chimneys, 
to show that any man has ever trod this road before. This 
is Sherman's track. It is hard not to curse him. I wept 
incessantly at first. The roses of the gardens are already 
hiding the ruins. My husband said Nature is a wonderful 
renovator. He tried to say something else and then I shut my 
eyes and made a vow that if we were a crushed people, crushed by 
weight, I would never be a whimpering, pining slave.</p>
        <p>We heard loud explosions of gunpowder in the direction 
of Camden. Destroyers were at it there. Met William 
Walker, whom Mr. Preston left in charge of a car-load of 
his valuables. General Preston was hardly out of sight 
before poor helpless William had to stand by and see the car 
plundered. “My dear Missis! they have cleaned me out, 
nothing left,” moaned William the faithful. We have nine 
armed couriers with us. Can they protect us?</p>
        <p>Bade adieu to the staff at Chester. No general ever had 
so remarkable a staff, so accomplished, so agreeable, so 
well bred, and, I must say, so handsome, and can add so 
brave and efficient.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">May 4th</hi>.—Home again at Bloomsbury. From Chester to 
Winnsboro we did not see one living thing, man, woman, or 
animal, except poor William trudging home after his sad 
disaster. The blooming of the gardens had a funereal effect. 
<pb id="mches385" n="385"/>
Nature is so luxuriant here, she soon covers the ravages of 
savages. No frost has occurred since the seventh of March, 
which accounts for the wonderful advance in vegetation. 
This seems providential to these starving people. In this 
climate so much that is edible can be grown in two months.</p>
        <p>At Winnsboro we stayed at Mr. Robertson's. There we 
left the wagon train. Only Mr. Brisbane, one of the general's 
couriers, came with us on escort duty. The Robertsons were 
very kind and hospitable, brimful of Yankee anecdotes. To 
my amazement the young people of Winnsboro had a 
May-day celebration amid the smoking ruins. Irrepressible 
is youth.</p>
        <p>The fidelity of the negroes is the principal topic. There 
seems to be not a single case of a negro who betrayed his 
master, and yet they showed a natural and exultant joy at 
being free. After we left Winnsboro negroes were seen in the 
fields plowing and hoeing corn, just as in antebellum times. 
The fields in that respect looked quite cheerful. We did not 
pass in the line of Sherman's savages, and so saw some 
houses standing.</p>
        <p>Mary Kirkland has had experience with the Yankees. 
She has been pronounced the most beautiful woman on this 
side of the Atlantic, and has been spoiled accordingly in all 
society. When the Yankees came, Monroe, their negro 
manservant, told her to stand up and hold two of her 
children in her arms, with the other two pressed as close 
against her knees as they could get. Mammy Selina and 
Lizzie then stood grimly on each side of their young missis 
and her children. For four mortal hours the soldiers surged 
through the rooms of the house. Sometimes Mary and her 
children were roughly jostled against the wall, but Mammy 
and Lizzie were stanch supporters. The Yankee soldiers 
taunted the negro women for their foolishness in standing by 
their cruel slave-owners, and taunted Mary with being glad 
of the protection of her poor ill-used slaves. Monroe 
meanwhile had one leg bandaged and pretended to be lame, 
<pb id="mches386" n="386"/>
so that he might not be enlisted as a soldier, and kept 
making  pathetic appeals to Mary.</p>
        <p>“Don't answer them back, Miss Mary,” said he.  
“Let 'em say what dey want to; don't answer 'em back. 
Don't give 'em any chance to say you are impudent to 
'em.”</p>
        <p>One man said to her: “Why do you shrink from us 
and avoid us so?  We did not come here to fight for 
negroes; we hate them. At Port Royal I saw a beautiful 
white woman driving in a wagon with a coal-black negro 
man. If she had been anything to me I would have shot 
her through the heart.”  “Oh, oh!” said Lizzie, “that's 
the way you talk in here.  I'll remember that when you 
begin outside to beg me to run away with you.”</p>
        <p>Finally poor Aunt Betsy, Mary's mother, fainted from 
pure fright and exhaustion. Mary put down her baby and 
sprang to her mother, who was lying limp in a chair, and 
fiercely called out, “Leave this room, you wretches! Do 
you mean to kill my mother? She is ill; I must put her to 
bed.” Without a word they all slunk out ashamed. “If I 
had only tried that hours ago,” she now said. Outside 
they remarked that she was “an insolent rebel huzzy, 
who thinks herself too good to speak to a soldier of the 
United States,” and one of them said: “Let us go in and 
break her mouth.”  But the better ones held the more 
outrageous back. Monroe slipped in again and said:  
“Missy, for God's sake, when dey come in be sociable with 
'em. Dey will kill you.”</p>
        <p>“Then let me die.”</p>
        <p>The negro soldiers were far worse than the white ones.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Bartow drove with me to Mulberry. On one side 
of the house we found every window had been broken, 
every bell torn down, every piece of furniture destroyed, 
and every door smashed in. But the other side was intact.  
Maria Whitaker and her mother, who had been left in 
charge, explained this odd state of things. The Yankees 
were busy as beavers, working like regular carpenters, 
destroying everything when their general came in and 
stopped 
<pb id="mches387" n="387"/>
them. He told them it was a sin to destroy a fine old house 
like that, whose owner was over ninety years old. He would 
not have had it done for the world. It was wanton mischief. 
He explained to Maria that soldiers at such times were 
excited, wild, and unruly. They carried off sacks full of our 
books, since unfortunately they found a pile of empty sacks 
in the garret. Our books, our letters, our papers were 
afterward strewn along the Charleston road. Somebody 
found things of ours as far away as Vance's Ferry. </p>
        <p>This was Potter's raid.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref130" n="130" rend="sc" target="note130">1</ref>  Sherman took only our horses. 
Potter's raid came after Johnston's surrender, and ruined us 
finally, burning our mills and gins and a hundred bales of 
cotton. Indeed, nothing is left to us now but the bare land, 
and the debts contracted for the support of hundreds of 
negroes during the war.</p>
        <p>J. H. Boykin was at home at the time to look after his 
own interests, and he, with John de Saussure, has saved the 
cotton on their estates, with the mules and farming 
utensils and plenty of cotton as capital to begin on again. 
The negroes would be a good riddance. A hired man would be a 
good deal cheaper than a man whose father and mother, wife and 
twelve children have to be fed, clothed, housed, and nursed, 
their taxes paid, and their doctor's bills, all for his 
half-done, slovenly, lazy work. For years we have thought 
negroes a nuisance that did not pay. They pretend exuberant 
loyalty to us now. Only one man of Mr. Chesnut's left the 
plantation with the Yankees.</p>
        <p>When the Yankees found the Western troops were not at 
Camden, but down below Swift Creek, like sensible folk they 
came up the other way, and while we waited at Chester
	
<note id="note130" n="130" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref130">1. The reference appears to be to General Edward E. Potter, a native 
of New York City, who died in 1889. General Potter entered the 
Federal service early in the war. He recruited a regiment of North 
Carolina troops and engaged in operations in North and South Carolina 
and Eastern Tennessee.</note>
<pb id="mches388" n="388"/>
for marching orders we were quickly ruined 
after the surrender. With our cotton saved, 
and cotton at a dollar a pound, we might be 
in comparatively easy circumstances. But 
now it is the devil to pay, and no pitch hot. 
Well, all this was to be.</p>
        <p>Godard Bailey, editor, whose prejudices 
are all against us, described the raids to me 
in this wise: They were regularly organized. 
First came squads who demanded arms and 
whisky. Then came the rascals who hunted 
for silver, ransacked the ladies' wardrobes 
and scared women and children into fits—at 
least those who could be scared. Some of 
these women could not be scared. Then 
came some smiling, suave, well-dressed 
officers, who “regretted it all so much.”  
Outside the gate officers, men, and bummers 
divided even, share and share alike, the piles 
of plunder.</p>
        <p>When we crossed the river coming home, the ferry man at 
Chesnut's Ferry asked for his fee. Among us all we could not 
muster the small silver coin he demanded. There was poverty 
for you. Nor did a stiver appear among us until Molly was 
hauled home from Columbia, where she was waging war 
with Sheriff Dent's family. As soon as her foot touched her 
native heath, she sent to hunt up the cattle. Many of our 
cows were found in the swamp; like Marion's men they had 
escaped the enemy. Molly sells butter for us now on shares.</p>
        <p>Old Cuffey, head gardener at Mulberry, and Yellow 
Abram, his assistant, have gone on in the even tenor of their 
way. Men may come and men may go, but they dig on 
forever. And they say they mean to “as long as old master is 
alive.”  We have green peas, asparagus, lettuce, spinach, new 
potatoes, and strawberries in abundance—enough for 
ourselves and plenty to give away to refugees. It is early in 
May and yet two months since frost. Surely the wind was 
tempered to the shorn lamb in our case.</p>
        <p>Johnny went over to see Hampton. His cavalry are ordered
<pb id="mches389" n="389"/>
	
to reassemble on the 20th—a little farce to let themselves 
down easily; they know it is all over. Johnny, smiling 
serenely, said, “The thing is up and forever.”</p>
        <p>Godard Bailey has presence of mind. Anne Sabb left a 
gold card-case, which was a terrible oversight, among the 
cards on the drawing-room table. When the Yankee raiders 
saw it their eyes glistened. Godard whispered to her: “Let 
them have that gilt thing and slip away and hide the silver.”  
“No!” shouted a Yank, “you don't fool me that way; here's 
your old brass thing; don't you stir; fork over that silver.” 
And so they deposited the gold card-case in Godard's hands, 
and stole plated spoons and forks, which had been left out 
because they were plated. Mrs. Beach says two officers 
slept at her house. Each had a pillow-case crammed with 
silver and jewelry—“spoils of war,”  they called it.</p>
        <p>Floride Cantey heard an old negro say to his master:    
“When you all had de power you was good to me, and I'll 
protect you now. No niggers nor Yankees shall tech you. If 
you want anything call for Sambo. I mean, call for Mr. 
Samuel; dat my name now.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">May 10th</hi>.—A letter from a Pharisee who thanks the Lord 
she is not as other women are; she need not pray, as the 
Scotch parson did, for a good conceit of herself. She writes, 
“I feel that I will not be ruined. Come what may, God will 
provide for me.” But her husband had strengthened the 
Lord's hands, and for the glory of God, doubtless, invested 
some thousands of dollars in New York, where Confederate 
moth did not corrupt nor Yankee bummers break through 
and steal. She went on to tell us: “I have had the good 
things of this world, and I have enjoyed them in their season. 
But I only held them as steward for God. My bread has been 
cast upon the waters and will return to me.”</p>
        <p>E. M. Boykin said to-day: “We had a right to strike for 
our independence, and we did strike a bitter blow. 
<pb id="mches390" n="390"/>
 They must be proud to have overcome such a foe. I dare 
look any man in the face. There is no humiliation in our 
position after such a struggle as we made for freedom from 
the Yankees.”  He is sanguine. His main idea is joy that he 
has no negroes to support, and need hire only those he really 
wants.</p>
        <p>Stephen Elliott told us that Sherman said to Joe 
Johnston, “Look out for yourself. This agreement only binds 
the military, not the civil, authorities.” Is our destruction to 
begin anew?  For a few weeks we have had peace.</p>
        <p>Sally Reynolds told a short story of a negro pet of Mrs. 
Kershaw's. The little negro clung to Mrs. Kershaw and 
begged her to save him. The negro mother, stronger than 
Mrs. Kershaw, tore him away from her. Mrs. Kershaw wept 
bitterly. Sally said she saw the mother chasing the child 
before her as she ran after the Yankees, whipping him at 
every step. The child yelled like mad, a small rebel 
blackamoor.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">May 16th</hi>.—We are scattered and stunned, the remnant of 
heart left alive within us filled with brotherly hate. We sit 
and wait until the drunken tailor who rules the United States 
of America issues a proclamation, and defines our 
anomalous position.</p>
        <p>Such a hue and cry, but whose fault? Everybody is 
blamed by somebody else. The dead heroes left stiff and 
stark on the battle-field escape, blame every man who stayed 
at home and did not fight. I will not stop to hear excuses. 
There is not one word against those who stood out until the 
bitter end, and stacked muskets at Appomattox.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">May 18th</hi>.—A feeling of sadness hovers over me now, 
day and night, which no words of mine can express. There is 
a chance for plenty of character study in. this Mulberry 
house, if one only had the heart for it. Colonel Chesnut, now 
ninety-three, blind and deaf, is apparently as strong as ever, 
and certainly as resolute of will. Partly patriarch, 
<pb id="mches390a" n="390a"/>
<figure id="ill14" entity="ches390"><p>COL. JAMES CHESNUT, SR.<lb/>From a Portrait in Oil by Gilbert Stuart.</p></figure>
<pb id="mches391" n="391"/>
partly grand seigneur, this old man is of a species that we 
shall see no more—the last of a race of lordly planters who 
ruled this Southern world, but now a splendid wreck. His 
manners are unequaled still, but underneath this smooth 
exterior lies the grip of a tyrant whose will has never been 
crossed. I will not attempt what Lord Byron says he could 
not do, but must quote again: “Everybody knows a 
gentleman when he sees him. I have never met a man who 
could describe one.”  We have had three very distinct 
specimens of the genus in this house—three generations of 
gentlemen, each utterly different from the other—father, son, 
and grandson.</p>
        <p>African Scipio walks at Colonel Chesnut's side. He is 
six feet two, a black Hercules, and as gentle as a dove in 
all his dealings with the blind old master, who boldly 
strides forward, striking with his stick to feel where he is 
going. The Yankees left Scipio unmolested. He told them 
he was absolutely essential to his old master, and they said, 
“If you want to stay so bad, he must have been good to 
you always.”  Scip says he was silent, for it “made them 
mad if you praised your master.”</p>
        <p>Sometimes this old man will stop himself, just as he is 
going off in a fury, because they try to prevent his 
attempting some feat impossible in his condition of lost 
faculties. He will ask gently, “I hope that I never say or do 
anything unseemly! Sometimes I think I am subject to 
mental aberrations.” At every footfall he calls out, “Who 
goes there?” If a lady's name is given he uncovers and 
stands, with hat off, until she passes. He still has the 
old-world art of bowing low and gracefully.</p>
        <p>Colonel Chesnut came of a race that would brook no 
interference with their own sweet will by man, woman, or 
devil. But then such manners has he, they would clear any 
man's character, if it needed it. Mrs. Chesnut, his wife, 
used to tell us that when she met him at Princeton, in the 
nineties of the eighteenth century, they called him “the
<pb id="mches392" n="392"/>
Young Prince.”  He and Mr. John Taylor,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref131" n="131" rend="sc" target="note131">1</ref> of Columbia, 
were the first up-country youths whose parents were 
wealthy enough to send them off to college.</p>
        <p>When a college was established in South Carolina, 
Colonel John Chesnut, the father of the aforesaid Young 
Prince, was on the first board of trustees. Indeed, I may say 
that, since the Revolution of 1776, there has been no 
convocation of the notables of South Carolina, in times of 
peace anti prosperity, or of war and adversity, in which a 
representative  man of this family has not appeared. The 
estate has been kept together until now. Mrs. Chesnut said 
she drove down from Philadelphia on her bridal trip, in a 
chariot and four—a cream-colored chariot with outriders.</p>
        <p>They have a saying here-on account of the large 
families with which people are usually blessed, and the 
subdivision of property consequent upon that fact, besides 
the tendency of one generation to make and to save, and the 
next to idle and to squander, that there are rarely more than 
three generations between shirt-sleeves and shirt-sleeves. 
But these Chesnuts have secured four, from the John 
Chesnut who was driven out from his father's farm in 
Virginia by the French and Indians, when that father had 
been killed at Fort Duquesne,<ref targOrder="U" id="ref132" n="132" rend="sc" target="note132">2</ref>  to the John Chesnut who 
saunters
<note id="note131" n="131" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref131">1.  John Taylor was graduated from Princeton in 1790 and became a 
planter in South Carolina. He served in Congress from 1806 to 1810, 
and in the latter year was chosen to fill a vacancy in the United States 
Senate, caused by the resignation of Thomas Sumter. In 1826 he was 
chosen Governor of South Carolina. He died in 1832.</note>
<note id="note132" n="132" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref132">2.  Fort Duquesne stood at the junction of the Monongahela and Alleghany 
Rivers. Captain Trent, acting for the Ohio Company, with some Virginia 
militiamen, began to build this fort in February, 1754. On April 17th of 
the same year, 700 Canadians and French forced him to abandon the work. 
The French then completed the fortress and named it Fort Duquesne. The 
unfortunate expedition of General Braddock, in the summer of 1755, was 
an attempt to retake the fort, Braddock's defeat occurring eight miles 
east of it. In 1758 General Forbes marched westward from Philadelphia 
and secured possession of the place, after the French, alarmed at his 
approach, had burned it. Forbes gave it the name of Pittsburg.</note>
<pb id="mches393" n="393"/>
along here now, the very perfection of a lazy gentleman, 
who cares not to move unless it be for a fight, a dance, or a 
fox-hunt.</p>
        <p>The first comer of that name to this State was a lad when 
he arrived after leaving his land in Virginia; and being 
without fortune otherwise, he went into Joseph Kershaw's 
grocery shop as a clerk, and the Kershaws, I think, so 
remember that fact that they have it on their coat-of-arms. 
Our Johnny, as he was driving me down to Mulberry 
yesterday, declared himself delighted with the fact that the 
present Joseph Kershaw had so distinguished himself in our 
war, that they might let the shop of a hundred years ago rest 
for a while. “Upon my soul,” cried the cool captain, “I have 
a desire to go in there and look at the Kershaw tombstones. I 
am sure they have put it on their marble tablets that we had 
an ancestor one day a hundred years ago who was a clerk in 
their shop.”  This clerk became a captain in the Revolution.</p>
        <p>In the second generation the shop had so far sunk that the 
John Chesnut of that day refused to let his daughter marry a 
handsome, dissipated Kershaw, and she, a spoiled beauty, 
who could not endure to obey orders when they were 
disagreeable to her, went up to her room and therein 
remained, never once coming out of it for forty years. Her 
father let her have her own way in that; he provided servants 
to wait upon her and every conceivable luxury that she 
desired, but neither party would give in.</p>
        <p>I am, too, thankful that I am an old woman, forty-two 
my last birthday. There is so little life left in me now to be 
embittered by this agony. “Nonsense! I am a pauper,” says 
my husband,  “and I am as smiling and as comfortable as 
ever you saw me.”  “When you have to give up your 
horses? How then?”</p>
        <pb id="mches394" n="394"/>
        <p><hi rend="italics">May 21st</hi>.—They say Governor Magrath has absconded, 
and that the Yankees have said, “If you have no visible 
governor, we will send you one.” If we had one and they 
found him, they would clap him in prison instanter.</p>
        <p>The negroes have flocked to the Yankee squad which has 
recently come, but they were snubbed, the rampant freedmen.     
“Stay where you are,” say the Yanks. “We have nothing for 
you.”  And they sadly “peruse” their way. Now that they have 
picked up that word “peruse,” they use it in season and out. 
When we met Mrs. Preston's William we asked, “Where are you 
going?”  “Perusing my way to Columbia,” he answered.</p>
        <p>When the Yanks said they had no rations for idle negroes, 
John Walker answered mildly, “This is not at all what we 
expected.” The colored women, dressed in their gaudiest 
array, carried bouquets to the Yankees, making the day a 
jubilee. But in this house there is not the slightest change. 
Every negro has known for months that he or she was free, 
but I do not see one particle of change in their manner. They 
are, perhaps, more circumspect, polite, and quiet, but that is 
all. Otherwise all goes on in antebellum <foreign lang="lat"><hi rend="italics">statu quo</hi></foreign>. Every day 
I expect to miss some familiar face, but so far have been 
disappointed.</p>
        <p>Mrs. Huger we found at the hotel here, and we brought 
her to Bloomsbury. She told us that Jeff Davis was traveling 
leisurely with his wife twelve miles a day, utterly careless 
whether he were taken prisoner or not, and that General 
Hampton had been paroled.</p>
        <p>Fighting Dick Anderson and Stephen Elliott, of Fort 
Sumter memory, are quite ready to pray for Andy Johnson, and 
to submit to the powers that be. Not so our belligerent clergy. 
“Pray for people when I wish they were dead,” cries Rev. Mr. 
Trapier. “No, never! I will pray for President Davis till I die. 
I will do it to my last gasp. My chief is a prisoner, but I 
am proud of him still. He is a spectacle to gods and men. He 
will bear himself as a soldier, a patriot,
<pb id="mches395" n="395"/>
a statesman, a Christian gentleman. He is the martyr of our 
cause.”  And I replied with my tears.</p>
        <p>“Look here: taken in woman's clothes?” asked Mr. 
Trapier. “Rubbish, stuff, and nonsense. If Jeff Davis has 
not the pluck of a true man, then there is no courage left on 
this earth. If he does not die game, I give it up. Something, 
you see, was due to Lincoln and the Scotch cap that he hid 
his ugly face with, in that express car, when he rushed 
through Baltimore in the night. It is that escapade of their 
man Lincoln that set them on making up the woman's 
clothes story about Jeff Davis.”</p>
        <p>Mrs. W. drove up. She, too, is off for New York, to sell 
four hundred bales of cotton and a square, or something, 
which pays tremendously in the Central Park region, and to 
capture and bring home her <foreign lang="fr"><hi rend="italics">belle fille</hi></foreign>, who remained North 
during the war. She knocked at my door. The day was 
barely dawning. I was in bed, and as I sprang up, discovered 
that my old Confederate night-gown had to be managed, it 
was so full of rents. I am afraid I gave undue attention to the 
sad condition of my gown, but could nowhere see a shawl to 
drape my figure.</p>
        <p>She was very kind. In case my husband was arrested and 
needed funds, she offered me some “British securities” and 
bonds. We were very grateful, but we did not accept the 
loan of money, which would have been almost the same as a 
gift, so slim was our chance of repaying it. But it was a 
generous thought on her part; I own that.</p>
        <p>Went to our plantation, the Hermitage, yesterday. Saw 
no change; not a soul was absent from his or her post. I 
said,    “Good colored folks, when are you going to kick off 
the traces and be free?” In their furious, emotional way, they 
swore devotion to us all to their dying day. Just the same, 
the minute they see an opening to better themselves they will 
move on. William, my husband's foster-brother, came up.     
“Well, William, what do you want?” asked my
<pb id="mches396" n="396"/>
husband. “Only to look at you, marster; it does me     
good.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 1st</hi>.—The New York Herald quotes General 
Sherman as saying, “Columbia was burned by Hampton's 
sheer stupidity.” But then who burned everything on the 
way in Sherman's march to Columbia, and in the line of 
march Sherman took after leaving Columbia? We came, for 
three days of travel, over a road that had been laid bare by 
Sherman's torches. Nothing but smoking ruins was left in 
Sherman's track. That I saw with my own eyes. No living 
thing was left, no house for man or beast. They who burned 
the countryside for a belt of forty miles, did they not also 
burn the town?  To charge that to “Hampton's stupidity” is 
merely an afterthought. This Herald announces that Jeff 
Davis will be hanged at once, not so much for treason as for 
his assassination of Lincoln. “Stanton,” the Herald says,      
“has all the papers in his hands to convict him.”</p>
        <p>The Yankees here say, “The black man must go as the 
red man has gone; this is a white man's country.” The 
negroes want to run with the hare, but hunt with the hounds. 
They are charming in their professions to us, but declare 
that they are to be paid by these blessed Yankees in lands 
and mules for having been slaves. They were so faithful to 
us during the war, why should the Yankees reward them, to 
which the only reply is that it would be by way of punishing 
rebels.</p>

The soldier laughed in her face, swaggered off, stumbled 
down the steps, and then his revolver went off by the 
concussion and shot him dead.</p>

soldierly looking black creature, fit to have delighted the

We asked him how the Yankees came to leave him. “Oh, I 
told them marster couldn't do without me nohow; and then 
I carried them some nice hams that they never could have 
found, they were hid so good.”</p>
        <p>Eben dressed himself in his best and went at a run to 
meet his Yankee deliverers—so he said. At the gate he met a 
squad coming in. He had adorned himself with his watch 
and chain, like the cordage of a ship, with a handful of 
gaudy seals. He knew the Yankees came to rob white 
people, but he thought they came to save niggers. “Hand 
over that watch!” they said. Minus his fine watch and 
chain, Eben returned a sadder and a wiser man. He was 
soon in his shirt-sleeves, whistling at his knife-board.  
“Why? You here?  Why did you come back so soon?” he 
was asked. “Well, I thought may be I better stay with ole  
marster that give me the watch, and not go with them that 
stole it.”  The watch was the pride of his life. The iron had 
entered his soul.</p>
        <p>Went up to my old house, “Kamschatka.”  The 
Trapiers live there now. In those drawing-rooms where the 
children played Puss in Boots, where we have so often 
danced and sung, but never prayed before, Mr. Trapier 
held his prayer-meeting.  I  do not think I ever did as much 
weeping or  as  bitter  in  the same space of time. I let 
myself go; it did  me  good.  I  cried  with  a  will. He 
prayed that we might have strength to stand up and bear 
our bitter 
<pb id="mches398" n="398"/>
disappointment, to look on our ruined homes and our 
desolated country and be strong. And he prayed for the man 
“we elected to be our ruler and guide.”  We knew that they 
had put him in a dungeon and in chains.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref134" n="134" rend="sc" target="note134">1</ref>   Men watch him day

Booth, says, “Destruction only to the wealthy classes.” 
Better teach the negroes to stand alone before you break up 
all they leaned on, O Yankees! After all, the number who 
possess over $20,000 are very few.</p>
        <p>Andy has shattered some fond hopes. He denounces 
Northern men who came South to espouse our cause. They 
may not take the life-giving oath. My husband will remain 
quietly at home. He has done nothing that he had not a right 
to do, nor anything that he is ashamed of. He will not fly 
from his country, nor hide anywhere in it. These are his 
words. He has a huge volume of Macaulay, which seems to 
absorb him. Slily I slipped Silvio Pellico in his way. He 
looked at the title and moved it aside. “Oh,” said I, “I only 
wanted you to refresh your memory as to a prisoner's life

        <p>I have been ill since I last wrote in this journal. Serena's 
letter came. She says they have been visited by 
bushwhackers, the roughs that always follow in the wake of 
an army. My sister Kate they forced back against the wall. 
She had Katie, the baby, in her arms, and Miller, the brave 
boy, clung to his mother, though he could do no more. They 
tried to pour brandy down her throat. They knocked Mary 
down with the butt end of a pistol, and Serena they struck 
with an open hand, leaving the mark on her cheek for weeks.</p>
        <p>Mr. Christopher Hampton says in New York people have 
been simply intoxicated with the fumes of their own glory. 
Military prowess is a new wrinkle of delight to them. They 
are mad with pride that, ten to one, they could, after five 
years' hard fighting, prevail over us, handicapped, as we 
were, with a majority of aliens, quasi foes, and negro slaves 
whom they tried to seduce, shut up with us. They pay us the 
kind of respectful fear the British meted out to Napoleon 
when they sent him off with Sir Hudson Lowe to St. Helena, 
the lone rock by the sea, to eat his heart out where he could 
not alarm them more.</p>
        <p>Of course, the Yankees know and say they were too many 
for us, and yet they would all the same prefer not to try us 
again. Would Wellington be willing to take the chances of 
Waterloo once more with Grouchy, Blücher, and all that

left to haphazard? Wigfall said to old Cameron<ref targOrder="U" id="ref135" n="135" rend="sc" target="note135">1</ref>    in 1861, “ 
Then you will a sutler be, and profit shall accrue.” 
Christopher Hampton says that in some inscrutable way in 
the world North, everybody “has contrived to amass 
fabulous wealth by this war.”</p>
        <p>There are two classes of vociferous sufferers in this 
community: 1. Those who say, “If people would only pay 
me what they owe me!” 2. Those who say,  “If people 
would only let me alone. I can not pay them. I could stand 
it if I had anything with which to pay debts.”</p>
        <p>Now we belong to both classes. Heavens! the sums 
people owe us and will not, or can not, pay, would settle all 
our debts ten times over and leave us in easy circumstances 
for life. But they will not pay. How can they?</p>
        <p>We are shut in here, turned with our faces to a dead wall. 
No mails. A letter is sometimes brought by a man on 
horseback, traveling through the wilderness made by 
Sherman. All railroads have been destroyed and the bridges 
are gone. We are cut off from the world, here to eat out our 
hearts. Yet from my window I look out on many a gallant 
youth and maiden fair. The street is crowded and it is a gay 
sight. Camden is thronged with refugees from the low 
country, and here they disport themselves.  They call the 
walk in front of Bloomsbury  “the Boulevard.”</p>
        <p>H. Lang tells us that poor Sandhill Milly Trimlin is 
dead, and that as a witch she had been denied Christian 
burial. Three times she was buried in consecrated ground in 
different churchyards, and three times she was dug up by a 
superstitious horde, who put her out of their holy ground. 
Where her poor, old, ill-used bones are lying now I do not 
know. I hope her soul is faring better than her body. She 
was a good, kind creature. Why supposed to be a witch? 
That H. Lang could not elucidate.</p>
        <note id="note135" n="135" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref135">1.  Simon Cameron became Secretary of War in Lincoln's Administration, on 
March 4, 1861. On January 11, 1862, he resigned and was made Minister to 
Russia.</note>
        <pb id="mches401" n="401"/>
        <p>Everybody in our walk of life gave Milly a helping hand. 
She was a perfect specimen of the Sandhill “tackey” race, 
sometimes called “country crackers.” Her skin was yellow 
and leathery, even the whites of her eyes were bilious in 
color. She was stumpy, strong, and lean, hard-featured, 
horny-fisted. Never were people so aided in every way as 
these Sandhillers. Why do they remain Sandhillers from 
generation to generation? Why should Milly never have 
bettered her condition?</p>
        <p>My grandmother lent a helping hand to her grandmother. 
My mother did her best for her mother, and I am sure the 
so-called witch could never complain of me. As long as I 
can remember, gangs of these Sandhill women traipsed in 
with baskets to be filled by charity, ready to carry away 
anything they could get. All are made on the same pattern, 
more or less alike. They were treated as friends and 
neighbors, not as beggars. They were asked in to take seats 
by the fire, and there they sat for hours, stony-eyed, silent, 
wearing out human endurance and politeness. But their 
husbands and sons, whom we never saw, were citizens and 
voters! When patience was at its last ebb, they would open 
their mouths and loudly demand whatever they had come to 
seek.</p>
        <p>One called Judy Bradly, a one-eyed virago, who played 
the fiddle at all the Sandhill dances and fandangoes, made a 
deep impression on my youthful mind. Her list of requests 
was always rather long, and once my grandmother grew 
restive and actually hesitated. “Woman, do you mean to let 
me starve?” she cried furiously. My grandmother then 
attempted a meek lecture as to the duty of earning one's 
bread. Judy squared her arms akimbo and answered, “And 
pray, who made you a judge of the world? Lord, Lord, if I 
had 'er knowed I had ter stand all this jaw, I wouldn't a took 
your ole things,” but she did take them and came afterward 
again and again.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">June 27th</hi>.—An awful story from Sumter. An old

gentleman, who thought his son dead or in a Yankee prison, 
heard some one try the front door. It was about midnight, 
and these are squally times. He called out, “What is that?” 
There came no answer. After a while he heard some one 
trying to open a window and he fired. The house was shaken 
by a fall. Then, after a long time of dead silence, he went 
round the house to see if his shot had done any harm, and 
found his only son bathed in his own blood on his father's 
door-step. The son was just back from a Yankee prison—one 
of his companions said—and had been made deaf by cold 
and exposure. He did not hear his father hail him. He had 
tried to get into the house in the same old way he used to 
employ when a boy.</p>
        <p>My sister-in-law in tears of rage and despair, her 
servants all gone to “a big meeting at Mulberry,”  though 
she had made every appeal against their going. “Send them 
adrift,” some one said, “they do not obey you, or serve you; 
they only live on you.” It would break her heart to part with 
one of them. But that sort of thing will soon right itself. 
They will go off <hi rend="italics">to better themselves</hi>—we have only to cease 
paying wages—and that is easy, for we have no money.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 4th</hi>.—Saturday I was in bed with one of my worst 
headaches. Occasionally there would come a sob and I 
thought of my sister insulted and my little sweet Williams. 
Another of my beautiful Columbia quartette had rough 
experiences. A raider asked the plucky little girl, Lizzie 
Hamilton, for a ring which she wore. “You shall not have 
it,” she said. The man put a pistol to her head, saying,  
“Take it off, hand it to me, or I will blow your brains out.” 
“Blow away,” said she. The man laughed and put down his 
pistol, remarking, “You knew I would not hurt you.” “Of 
course, I knew you dared not shoot me. Even Sherman 
would not stand that.”</p>
        <p>There was talk of the negroes where the Yankees had 
been—negroes who flocked to them and showed them where

silver and valuables had been hid by the white people. 
Ladies'-maids dressed themselves in their mistresses' gowns 
before the owners' faces and walked off. Now, before this 
every one had told me how kind, faithful, and considerate 
the negroes had proven. I am sure, after hearing these tales, 
the fidelity of my own servants shines out brilliantly. I had 
taken their conduct too much as a matter of course. In the 
afternoon I had some business on our place, the Hermitage. 
John drove me down. Our people were all at home, quiet, 
orderly, respectful, and at their usual work. In point of fact 
things looked unchanged. There was nothing to show that 
any one of them had even seen the Yankees, or knew that 
there was one in existence.</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">July 26th</hi>.—I do not write often now, not for want of 
something to say, but from a loathing of all I see and hear, 
and why dwell upon those things?</p>
        <p>Colonel Chesnut, poor old man, is worse—grows more 
restless. He seems to be wild with “homesickness.” He 
wants to be at Mulberry. When there he can not see the 
mighty giants of the forest, the huge, old, wide-spreading 
oaks, but he says he feels that he is there so soon as he hears 
the carriage rattling across the bridge at the Beaver Dam.</p>
        <p>I am reading French with Johnny—anything to keep him 
quiet. We gave a dinner to his company, the small remnant 
of them, at Mulberry house. About twenty idle negroes, 
trained servants, came without leave or license and assisted. 
So there was no expense. They gave their time and labor for 
a good day's feeding. I think they love to be at the old place.</p>
        <p>Then I went up to nurse Kate Withers. That lovely girl, 
barely eighteen, died of typhoid fever. Tanny wanted his 
sweet little sister to have a dress for Mary Boykin's 
wedding, where she was to be one of the bridesmaids. So 
Tanny took his horses, rode one, and led the other thirty 
miles in the broiling sun to Columbia, where he sold the led 
horse and came back with a roll of Swiss muslin. As he entered 
<pb id="mches404" n="404"/>
the door, he saw Kate lying there dying. She died praying 
that she might die. She was weary of earth and wanted to be 
at peace. I saw her die and saw her put in her coffin. No 
words of mine can tell how unhappy I am. Six young 
soldiers, her friends, were her pall-bearers. As they marched 
out with that burden sad were their faces.</p>
        <p>Princess Bright Eyes writes: “Our soldier boys returned, 
want us to continue our weekly dances.”  Another maiden 
fair indites: “Here we have a Yankee garrison. We are told 
the officers find this the dullest place they were ever in. 
They want the ladies to get up some amusement for them. 
They also want to get into society.”</p>
        <p>From Isabella in Columbia: “General Hampton is home 
again. He looks crushed. How can he be otherwise?  His 
beautiful home is in ruins, and ever present with him must 
be the memory of the death tragedy which closed forever the 
eyes of his glorious boy, Preston! Now! there strikes up a 
serenade to General Ames, the Yankee commander, by a 
military band, of course. . . . Your last letters have been of 
the meagerest. What is the matter?”</p>

        <p><hi rend="italics">August 2d</hi>.—Dr. Boykin and John Witherspoon were talking 
of a nation in mourning, of blood poured out like rain on the 
battle-fields-for what? “Never let me hear that the blood 
of the brave has been shed in vain! No; it sends a cry down 
through all time.”</p>
