      <head>BIOGRAPHY OF JAMES PATTON.</head>
      <opener>
        <salute>DEAR CHILDREN AND FRIENDS:</salute>
      </opener>
      <p>I HAVE thought it might tend to your advantage, and that of
your posterity, to give you a short and <sic>succint</sic> history of my life.
It is not my intention to extend it to a great length, but merely to
state some facts connected with it, which I hope, may prove not
only satisfactory, but beneficial to yourselves and those who are
to come after you.</p>
      <p>I was born in the North of Ireland, County of Derry and Parish 
of Tamlacht, on the 13th day of February, A. D. 1756, of
poor, but respectable parentage. My father was a Farmer by
occupation; he died when I was fourteen years of age. For
three years before his death, he was in bad health, and was not
able to be of any use to himself or his family. After the death
of my father, I continued to reside with my mother, and assisted 
her in supporting the family until I was in the twenty-eighth
year of my age, during which time I learned the Weaver's trade,
and worked at it for about five years: it was of great service to
me afterwards, when I commenced store-keeping, as it enabled
me to judge correctly of the different kinds of common cloth.</p>
      <p>The death of our landlord, and others coming in and raising 
the rents, prevented my mother from giving her children
more than a very limited education. This, together with the
many difficulties we <sic>laboured</sic> under in Ireland, induced a wish
on my part, to try my fortune in some other part of the world.
I accordingly, in the 28th year of my age, obtained her consent
to come to America for the purpose of procuring the necessary
means of bringing herself and family to this land of liberty, where
we would no longer feel the oppression of haughty landlords, and
where virtue and good conduct give a passport to the highest
stations in society.</p>
      <p>I embarked at Lairn, in the County of Antrim, on the 4th day
of June 1783, and landed at Philadelphia on the 3d day of August 
following. When I left Ireland, my mother furnished me
with two suits of clothing, two dozen shirts, and other things
necessary, so that I would be enabled to save all the money that
<pb id="patton2" n="2"/>I might make; calculating that I would return in two years and
bring them to America, but sickness prevented the execution of
this plan. After I landed, I remained in Philadelphia ten days;
I then left my chest and clothing at the house where I boarded,
and went into the country to the house of a Mr. Green, (a Quaker) 
fifteen miles from the city; the first night, I recollect, that
he observed to me -- “If thee have as good luck as thy countryman 
Robert Kerr, thee will do well. He rented a small house
at an early day in Philadelphia, and worked at hard <sic>labour</sic> on
the streets, and now, by the perseverance of himself and his
wife, he owns nearly a whole square in the city.” He made
many other observations, which occur to my mind, when I am
lying on my bed. I told him, that I came to this country for the
purpose of amending my condition in life, and that I would try
to do so. The remarks of Mr. Green, together with my own observations, 
soon convinced me that the Americans were not composed 
of Lords and Dukes and belted Knights, (as Burns says.)</p>
      <p>The next night I went to the house of Mr. Green's son, and
undertook to clear out a small piece of land for him at the end
of a field; and not being acquainted with such work, I hurt myself 
so much the first day, that I was not able to do any thing
the next. Mr. Green mentioned, that the work could be done in
two or three hours, but as I knew nothing about it, I could take
no advantage of the grubs, and therefore I spent the whole day
at it. From this I went to deliver a letter which I had promised, 
and then engaged to weave for sometime with a Mr. Chafin;
during the time I was here, an Englishman (a Tinker) came
along: he asked me, what I stopped here for? and told me to
quit the place; intimating some unfavorable things respecting the
people; accordingly, I left Chafin's and went to a Thomas Wilson's 
and wove sometime for him. During that winter, I worked
at different kinds of business, but principally threshing. The
Americans at this time were generally poor, having been stripped 
of almost every thing by the British during the Revolutionary 
War, consequently the price of labor was very low.</p>
      <p>Not being afraid of sickness, I went the next spring to the
Delaware River, where hands were employed in <sic>embanking</sic>.
There I was attacked by the dumb ague (as it was called in that
country) and was sick for nearly twelve months; in consequence
of which the small pittance I had earned, and the clothing my
mother had given me, had all to go for Doctors' bills and board.
When I became able to work again, I had nothing left but the
clothes on my back, one shirt, and a dollar in my pocket.</p>
      <p>I had boarded sometime with a Mr. Shaw, a countryman of
mine, and when I left his house, he took two horses and assisted
<pb id="patton3" n="3"/>me along the road for some distance. He inquired where I
was going ? I told him I was going to Canada, that my mother
had told me, she had an uncle and brother in that country, who
had become rich; and that I would endeavor to find them out.
But this was not my real motive, I was really afraid that nothing
awaited me but misery and poverty, and that news would reach
Ireland that I was in a most destitute situation, and being naturally 
of a proud spirit, I wished to go where I would not be
known by any person. My health was at this time so bad, that
I was unable to do any thing for myself; but thanks to the great
and mighty God! I had a mind that enabled me to surmount all
difficulties. When Mr. Shaw left me, I went off  the road into
the woods, sat down by an oak tree, and gave vent to a torrent
of tears.</p>
      <p>Just reflect on my situation at this time; a stranger in a strange
land, an ocean rolling between me and every relation I had on
earth, without a friend to advise or protect; health precarious,
and funds exhausted; misfortunes seemed to thicken around me,
and in whatever direction I would turn my head, I could see
nothing but misery staring me in the face. My situation was
truly disconsolate, but the Lord was my strength and my shield,
and to him I ought ever to be thankful for strength of mind capable 
of supporting me under such severe trials. That night, I
went to the house of Mr. John McCall, on the Susquehanna
River, (a countryman of my own) he treated me kindly, and
would have nothing for my lodging, but wished me to stay some
days with him; he had seen me at Mr. Shaw's and knew that I
was sick. When I left his house, he advised me to go to a Mr.
James Patton's (a namesake of mine) and live with him until I
would recover my health; I accordingly went and found him to
be a very friendly man, but he had a young wife of whom I did
not form so good an opinion.</p>
      <p>At this time I had but one dollar, and as I could not travel
long on that, I went to a canal that had been commenced at the
Ball Friar Ferry on the Susquehanna River; there I engaged to
work, and got into a mess of eight men -- old soldiers, and the
very refuse of the army. It was very disagreeable to me to associate 
with such people, and therefore applied to the employer
for a part of the canal that was clear of rocks, and not so difficult 
to work; I got an Irishman to join me. We worked at it
for three months and boarded ourselves. During the summer I
enjoyed tolerable health, with the exception of three weeks, and
worked about in different parts of the country.</p>
      <p>I was advised to go to some moral and orderly part of the
country; but it will appear from what follows, that I had not
<pb id="patton4" n="4"/>
done with misfortune: yet, on my way to the section of country
I had in view, I stopped at a Dutchman's house in York County,
Pennsylvania, and it then being in the winter, I engaged to work
for him for three months at a guinea per month. I dug a well
for him 52 feet in depth, in a very short time. When I first went
to his house, I handed him all the money I had, except three
dollars. Calculating that he would return the same when I
wanted it, and also pay me for my labor like an honest man.
One night when I returned from work, he and others were throwing 
dice and drinking: he kept a public house and would always
give me spirits when I came in from work. He proposed to me
to join their party, and that he would be my partner, and thought
it would be a money-making business; I refused, and told him
that I knew nothing about gambling. He said it was not gambling, 
that his little son could do it as well as a man. He gave
me some more liquor, (that wily destroyer of the human race,)
which had the desired effect, and I took my chance among them.
He and I were fortunate for some time: at last luck changed,
(as gamblers say) and I lost all. Too late I discovered that
they had too sets of dice, and instead of those we commenced
with, they had a set of their own which threw up twelve every
throw. I then found out that my partner had been acting the
scoundrel, in <sic>connexion</sic> with the others. It almost deranged
me to think, that I had lost all my hard-earned wages, by the influence 
of drink, and by the persuasion of a villain in whom I had
placed confidence. I accused the company of cheating me.
We all became angry, and consequently an affray took place:
fearing nothing in my then distracted situation, I took up the
tongs and paid some of them in hard coin: the balance of the
night I passed without sleep. When we went out to work the
next morning, the Dutchman's son appeared disposed to amuse
himself at my expense, and I thought proper to give him a little
of the same sort of change, and told him to go and tell his father
what I had done.</p>
      <p>I then left the house; having the character of a faithful laborer, 
a great many persons wished to employ me. From this, I
went to Yorktown, Pennsylvania, and set into work with an
honest Dutchman (Philip Kissinger, a brick-maker by trade)
and remained with him during the spring and summer; during
the time I was with Mr. Kissinger, two young Irishmen came to
the brickyard on their way to a canal on the Potomac River;
they urged me to go, and said that I could get two dollars per
day. I was flattered with the prospect of speedy gain, and requested 
Mr. Kissinger to let me off, as I had but about six weeks
to stay with him; he refused, as I suited his business, but at last
<pb id="patton5" n="5"/>agreed, on condition that he could get hands in the place of another
Irishman and myself; he got hands and let us go. We got fixed
for the journey and made a start. We stopped in Yorktown to
take a parting glass with our countrymen and some others, and
they all drank freely; it was almost daylight before I could get
them off. We had gone but a few miles from town, when they
all laid down to take some sleep by the side of the road; I sat
there like a wild goose watching, while the flock would be feeding. 
This put me to thinking. I asked myself, if this was the
kind of company I ought to keep? No, said I! -- I will part from
such people, and accordingly the next morning started to the
Canogege settlement, a rich section of country about 150 miles
from Philadelphia, and settled by a moral and orderly people.</p>
      <p>I had now been in America about three years, and through
sickness, misfortune and one imprudent attempt at gambling, I
had very little more than when I landed. This single act has
made me abhor gamblers and swindlers all my life, I consider
them no better than pickpockets.</p>
      <p>This Dutchman at the time he cheated me at throwing the
dice, had a plantation which at this time would probably sell
for twenty thousand dollars. About eight years after this, I
was going down with about two hundred head of good cattle, I
went ahead and stopped them opposite to the honest Dutchman's, 
Philip Kissinger, at whose brickyard I had worked. I
asked him who lived in the Widow Fryer's house ? He said
Coffield. I asked him what Coffield?  Said he, don't you know
the man who made you lose all your money? I then said, let
us go and see him. He had at this time no way of supporting
his wife and two children, but by her making straw hats, and
he selling them. When he saw my cattle, he said, good God!
How did you get all these cattle? I answered, sir, I got them 
after I quit gambling, and there are plenty more where these
came from; but a man must not gamble if he wants to get them.
It was very mortifying to the poor wretch.</p>
      <p>In the Canogege settlement, I made my home at a Mr. Walker's, 
an excellent man and a member of the Presbyterian
Church. He was very kind, and would always let me have a
horse to ride to preaching with himself and his wife. He would
often laugh at me, and say, “Jimmy, you will be a rich man yet!
Never mind Jimmy, you will be a rich man yet.” Said he,
“The grandfather of that young man, (alluding to a young lawyer) 
came to this country a very poor man; he had as much
money when he landed as bought a bed and a cow in Philadelphia. 
He placed his clothes on the cow's back, and milked her
at night.” He also said, that his own father, Mr. Dickey and
<pb id="patton6" n="6"/>many others were in the same situation when they came to
America. I first cleared ten acres of land for Mr. Walker, and
agreed to wait for the payment until he could make it out of the
first crop of wheat which he raised on the land. I made my
home at his house for three years and worked about in the country, 
at various kinds of business, such as blowing rocks, digging
wells, &amp;c.</p>
      <p>The last time that I drove cattle to Philadelphia, I went
somewhat out of my road to reach this settlement where I had
lived for three years. I had two objects in view -- one was to
see my old friends -- another, was to indulge a pride of my mind
which I always possessed. I wished them to see that I was rising 
a little in the world. I staid three nights in the settlement,
and one of them with my old friend Mr. Walker; and the most
of the time I was there, he was in my company. He and his
wife were anxious that I should have connected myself with their
family, but I had commenced trading and it did not suit me at
that time. But to return from this digression: for a great portion
of the time, I worked in this part of the country -- I got only
about 26 cents per day: a hand in the harvest field could not
get more than 31 1/4 cents per day. This shows that the price of
labor was very low at that time. I made it a rule to be always
employed, and for three years was scarcely ever seen any where
except at my work, or at Church.</p>
      <p>I soon discovered the difficulty of clothing myself decently,
and making money merely by hard labor alone; I would therefore 
try to make a little besides when an opportunity offered.
I once bought one hundred bushels of rye from a man who needed 
some money and had it distilled, the distiller giving me six
quarts and a pint for every bushel I delivered at the mill: I
made something by this speculation. I also bought a field of
wheat of a man who wished to move away; it was covered with
snow when I bought it; in the spring it looked very yellow, and
Mr. Walker would laugh and tell me, I was cheated, although
he knew better at the time.</p>
      <p>When the wheat was ready to be cut, the neighbors and their
daughters came, and assisted me. They brought plenty of every
thing to eat, and I had plenty of rye whiskey, of which I gave
them freely. The wheat was ripe two weeks sooner than any
in the neighborhood, on account of its being sowed on slate land.
I had understood that there was a premium offered in Baltimore
for the first load of good new flour that might be delivered in that
market, a premium for the second, and also a premium for the
third, and I was determined to compete for one of them. The
neighbors were all anxious that I should be successful, and Mr.
<pb id="patton7" n="7"/>Dickey had his mill put in the best kind of order by the time my
wheat was ready. I had it cleaned and ground as soon as I
possibly could. I hired a young man to haul it, and agreed to
give him something extra to hurry him, but he was so slow in
his movements, that I lost the premium by about one hour. The
neighbors were much mortified that I did not get it, and ridiculed 
the young man very much, for he could have gotten there
in time, if he had pushed his team.</p>
      <p>I had worked hard and used great economy, and all I had at
the end of the three years that I had lived in the Canogege settlement 
was two hundred dollars. In the mean time I kept myself 
decently clothed, which I always would do, if I had nothing
left. From the long spell of sickness which I had -- the effects
of which I can feel to this day -- I was unable to work constantly 
at hard labor, (for I could eat no strong diet) and therefore
concluded that I would turn my attention to some other business.
The first thing that suggested itself to my mind was to get three
or four young men to unite their small capitals with mine, purchase 
a boat load of flour, and take it to New-Orleans; but in
this I was disappointed. In the same year that I intended to
start, a difference took place between the Spaniards and Kentuckians, 
which prevented all trade from passing down the
river. Having failed in this scheme, I (contrary to the advice
and wishes of all my friends) concluded to lay out the little money 
I had in dry goods, and vend them over the country as well
as I could. The principal objection that was urged against this
plan was, the scarcity of money. I told them that I could get
something else that would answer in the place of money. About
this time I wrote for my mother and family, and mentioned in
my letter that I had been unfortunate from sickness, but that I
now saw the way clear before me. Accordingly, in the month
of November 1789, I went to Lancaster, Penn., and bought my
goods of an old German: he told me, that he and his wife had
both been servants, and had served out their time, and that he
started in the world on very little. The old woman furnished
a piece of Russia Duck, took it to the Saddler's and had it made
in the shape of saddle bags. The old German wrapped up the
goods in the best manner. I paid for the whole of them, taking
nothing on credit; I was so little acquainted with the nature of
trade that I did not ask for credit; neither did I expect that it
would be extended to me, as I was poor and had no friends to assist 
me. When I was ready to start, I placed the pack on the back
of my pony and drove her before me, with my staff in my hand,
whistling and singing in the highest spirits: I thought that I was
a very rich man, or was in a fair way to become so; but misfortune 
<pb id="patton8" n="8"/>seemed to await me at every turn: I had not gone more
than three miles when I met with an awful defeat at the millpond 
of a Mr. Stoner. The road passed over the end of the
mill dam, my pony stopped to drink, after drinking, instead of
keeping the road, she dashed into the pond, but could not get
through; she stuck fast in the mud at the bottom of the pond,
got her head upon a stump, and thus saved herself from drowning. 
Imagine (if you can) my distress, at seeing my whole fortune 
on the back of my pony in the middle of a mill pond, and
he stuck fast in the mud and unable to get out; it looked like a
bad beginning to the mercantile business; there was no time to
be lost, so Mr. Stoner procured some kind of a craft for the
purpose of rescuing my pony and goods. He wished to release
the pony and let her go out with the pack on her back, but
I said no! we will save the goods if the pony should be lost;
so we took out the pack of goods first, and then the pony.
The goods had been so carefully wrapped up that they received 
no material injury. That night I went to the house of a
widow woman, one mile and a half from Mr. Stoner's at the
forks of the Road, one leading to Anderson's Ferry, the other
to Wright's Ferry (now called Columbia) on the Susquehanna 
River. She furnished me with a good room and lines to
hang my wet goods upon. I sat up all night drying my goods
and cleaning my buckles and buttons with my brush and chalk,
so that they looked as well as they did at first.</p>
      <p>Having put all in good order, I proceeded on my way; I met
with a young Dutchman who wished to purchase a pair of silver
lockets; he asked me the price of them: I fearing that they were
probably too high, asked him the price of such in town. However, 
I sold them to him at 13 or 14 cents advance: this was the
first profit that I realized from the sale of my goods.</p>
      <p>The next night I went to the honest Dutchman's, Philip Kissinger, 
at whose brickyard I had worked, got all my goods hung
upon lines in the stove-room, where he and his wife slept: I
went to bed and took a sound sleep. The next morning, Mrs.
Kissinger took a dozen of my cotton handkerchiefs and sold eleven 
of them for me at about 13 cents advance on each, and for
her trouble and kindness, I gave her the twelfth and last one. I
had now made about $1.43 on my handkerchiefs, which money
I laid out for the same sort, and got as good a bargain as I did
for the first.</p>
      <p>I then steered my course for North-Carolina, fifteen miles from
the place I had lived; I met a young man who had been out
with $500 worth of goods to the same section of country I intended 
to go to. I said, hie, hie, Elick, sold all and returning, and
<pb id="patton9" n="9"/>I doing nothing? Yes, said he, it is well I met you here, I would
advise you to sell your goods and go to work; there is no money
in the back country, and I sold my goods to a merchant in Virginia 
for the same they cost me in Philadelphia. I said to him,
Elick, did you call at every house and all the cabins on the
road? He said, he did not: that he only called at the best looking 
houses, where he expected to find something. I told him
that he was wrong, that money was sometimes to be found in
cabins, when there was none to be had at fine houses. Sir, said
I, you are too finely dressed, you should have gone out in your
common clothes; a man should always be dressed to suit his business, 
and don't suppose that show will make money. The
people took you for some collegian going to College with a load
of books. No Sir, said I, they would laugh at me if I were to go
back, if I cannot get money, I will try to get something else, and
was determined that I would not be turned by him.</p>
      <p>I proceeded on my way and got in company with Mr. James
McIntyre, of Morgantown, Burke County, North-Carolina, near
Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. We travelled together, and
camped out at night, as he had a wagon loaded with goods.
My forming an acquaintance with him, was the cause of my
coming to this part of the country. I formed a good opinion of
him; he was kind and advised me what to do. We parted in
Botetourt County, Virginia, and I took the road to the head of
the Holston. After beating about for some time in that part of
the country, I crossed the mountain into the county of Surry;
thence, into Wilkes, Burke and Buncombe. To show how slowly 
I got along in my business, I will inform you that I travelled
in the section of country now called Ashe County, for ten days,
and got but three dollars in money. I could have purchased
fur skins, but was not willing to risk it, as I did not know their
value. During this trip I met with poor success in the sale of
my goods.</p>
      <p>I will here mention an incident which occurred to me at Morgantown; 
it will show you the kind of stuff I was made of. An
Act of Congress had been passed to pay the Revolutionary soldiers 
for their services; I found that the certificates were selling
very low, and I thought that something could be made by buying 
them; accordingly I purchased some of them, and paid part
in goods and part in money. When I was going from Wilkes to
Burke County, the Entry Taker of Wilkes, a Mr. Fletcher, requested 
me to take an £80 note of his, (as he called it) and dispose 
of it along with my own. When I got to Morgantown, I
showed it and some other notes to several persons in the public
<pb id="patton10" n="10"/>square, and they all refused to receive them, as the note I had
gotten of Fletcher proved to be a raised note from £8 to £80. I
then stepped into Mr. Intyre's and had scarcely seated myself,
before a man came in and told me to make my escape, that I had
bad money and would be taken up in an hour; said I, thank you
sir, for your information, but I never went to a place yet, where
I would go out of the back door if the front door was open, for
any crime which I have ever committed. I told him that I would
go immediately to the gentlemen; they were not dispersed, but
were talking together and probably laying some plan to secure
me. I said, gentlemen, I am told that I have bad money, if I
have, I don't know it. I am informed that this £80 note is raised
from 8 to £80, if so <sic>shew</sic> it to me; and that you intend to put me
in jail: I told them that I hoped they would not do that, that the
jail was never made for me; you can take my horse, my money
and all I have, until I satisfy you better. I had become acquainted 
with Mr. Wallace Alexander, a lawyer of Mecklenburg County, 
North-Carolina, at Wilkes Court, previous to this time: he
was in Morgantown: I told him that I had gotten that note from
Fletcher in Wilkes County, and that I had no suspicion at the
time, that it was not good. He said, gentlemen, I believe what
Mr. Patton says; he then told me that he would take the note,
and put it out of their power to do me any harm. I told him he
could have it, if he would stand between me and danger, and let
Fletcher have the note if he wanted it. Now you see, that I possessed 
a proud, independent spirit, and was not to be alarmed
at trifles, when I was conscious of my integrity; and remember,
a clear conscience will carry a person through difficulties when
every thing else fails. When I returned to Wilkes, I told Fletcher 
that he had done very wrong in giving me that note; that I
was not only near getting into trouble, but was in a fair way of
having my character injured, as I was a stranger in the country.
I told him that he could get his note if he would apply for it: he
said, let it go.</p>
      <p>I now made preparations to return to the North, which was in
the spring of 1790.  On my way, I bought 200 pounds of indigo
at Fincastle in Virginia, and made almost as much profit on it,
as I had done on my goods. I also bought a few fur skins of
different sorts, to see what each kind would bring; I <sic>shewed</sic> them
to eight or ten different hatters, told them not to be offended before 
I opened them. This way of proceeding learned me the
value of the different kinds of fur, and was of great service to
me the next year, and many years afterwards, when I had a
store in Wilkes. This shows with what caution I acted in my
trading; I was unwilling to risk anything, even in the smallest
<pb id="patton11" n="11"/>matters, without some certainty of profit. During this trip, I
called upon my old friend Mr. Walker, with whom I had lived
for three years, as before mentioned. I had at that time two
good horses; I took the best care of them, and they were in fine
order. I purchased another from Mr. Walker, and went down
to the Federal City, and the adjacent country, with an old Mr.
McCall, who had a small drove of horses also. I sold one horse
and swapped the other two for an old horse, and got the difference 
in their value: the one that I got was poor but strong.</p>
      <p>I now discovered that there was something to be made by
buying feathers and taking them up the country. Accordingly,
I purchased some, made a large cloth sack and filled it, and
loaded my horse and started.  You see, children, nothing was
too humble for me that was honest; I was not ashamed of any
thing that soap and water would wash out.</p>
      <p>On my return I bought an old Jersey wagon for about $30,
which was not worth thirty shillings, except the iron. This
<sic>shews</sic> that a person should not touch on matters of which he is
not a judge. It was a bad time for me to pay high for my schooling, 
as I had but little to go on; however, I got my wagon so
repaired that I got it to Lancaster, Pennsylvania. There I had
to get it made almost entirely new, no part of it being worth any
thing, except the body and some of the irons. As I was going to
the North this trip, (of which I have been speaking) I met two
young men on the way; one of them said to the other, does not
that man (alluding to me) favor old Mrs. Patton and family who
came in the vessel with us? I then made some inquiry about
them, and asked the men if they could name them ? They soon
satisfied me that it was my good mother and family; this was
the first information I had received of their arrival. The next
night I arrived at the place they were, and we had a joyful meeting. 
I then went to Philadelphia and bought as many goods as
I was able to pay for, and $90 worth on a credit besides, which
I did not ask. When I looked over the bills, I discovered that
they would take too much of my money, and prevent me from
buying other goods on which I could make more profit, and requested 
the merchants to take some of them back, and told them
my reasons. These merchants were Quakers. One of them
said to the other, don't thee think James will come back and pay
us ? O, Yes, said the other. I thought he was amusing himself
with me at the time. I took the goods, and this was the
commencement of a credit that would afterwards have commanded 
twenty thousand dollars or more., if I had asked it,
at that house and others. I happened to see a young man in
Philadelphia at this time, who was going to Ireland and to the
<pb id="patton12" n="12"/>very neighborhood in which I had lived in that country; I sent a
small amount of money by him to defray the expenses of my
brother Thomas and family to this country, which he received
and came in the next summer. When he arrived, the whole of
the family were in this country, except one brother who had
gone to the East-Indies.</p>
      <p>I now left Philadelphia with my goods, for the State of North-
Carolina; sold all I could on the road, and would stop a day or
two at a place for that purpose. When I came to North River,
Rockingham County, Virginia, I stopped at an honest German's
house by the name of Jacob Singer, and staid there three weeks.
With what I had gotten before and during this time, I had upwards 
of three hundred dollars in cash, and also some fur skins
and beeswax. The fur skins and beeswax I left at that place
until I would return. I laid out what money I had on hands in.
Staunton, Augusta County, Virginia; this was in the fall of the
year; I bought such goods as I thought would sell readily in the
country; I got them on very good terms, and had at this time a
pretty good assortment. The last purchase I thought would
help to sell the first. I travelled on by the way of Lexington,
Pattonsburg, Fincastle, Pepper's Ferry on New River, to the
head of the Holston. On my way I frequently stopped from
six to twelve days at a place; would send out word beforehand,
that I would be at such places at the time appointed. By this
means the people would get their trade ready, such as fur skins,
beeswax, &amp;c., and some money. I sometimes left money with
men on whom I could depend, to purchase fur skins, beeswax,
&amp;c., for me at such prices as I directed them to give. This
year I took in fifteen hundred skins of different sorts, and made
a handsome profit on them, having the year before made myself
acquainted with the prices of all kinds, from a rabbit skin to an
otter skin. I left my wagon on the south fork of the Holston and
packed my goods on horseback; came to Roan's creek, thence
into Ashe, Wilkes, Burke and Buncombe counties.</p>
      <p>I returned to the North the first of the next summer. I left my
small wagon and got a light four horse wagon. I purchased as
many goods as I was able, and returned the same road that I
had travelled the first two years, stopped at the same places,
and sold double the amount of goods that I did the first two years.
I drove my own wagon, until I came to the North River, Rockingham 
County, Virginia; I then hired a little simple Dutchman
and kept him until I got to the head of the Holston; he was so
much of a fool, and withal so lazy, that I would not have him
any longer. I now met with Andrew Erwin, let him have about
$150 worth of  goods to trade on, sent him into the country and
<pb id="patton13" n="13"/>directed him where to go, and to meet me at Wilkes Court-house,
which he did. He transacted the business as well as I expected; 
I did not calculate on his doing much, as he was only nineteen 
years of age, and had little experience; but I found he was
honest: this has caused me to overlook many errors of young
men, all my life. I have had a great many in my employment
from this time until I quit business; for I touched at every thing
that I thought would be profitable -- gathering ginseng, snake
root, purchasing deer skins, bear skins and driving large numbers 
of cattle. Having left my wagon at the south fork of the
Holston, I hired a man to assist me, and packed a part of my
goods on horseback to Wilkes Court-house. Those that I left
with the man, at whose house my wagon was, I directed him to
sell during my absence, and collect all the fur skins, beeswax,
&amp;c., that he could.</p>
      <p>During this and the preceding trips, I had frequently stopped
at the house of a man by the name of Jonathan Tompkins, in
the County of Wilkes, a member of the Baptist Church, and apparently 
a very pious man. He told me, that his land was under 
execution, and that  £40 would save it; that his brother had
gone to South-Carolina for money, and would be certain to get
it, but for fear that he might be detained by high water or some
accident, wished me to let him have it, which I did. I knew so
little of mankind at that time, that I took no obligation on him
for the money, but merely made a memorandum of it in my
pocket book. This single circumstance is sufficient to <sic>shew</sic> my
great want of qualification for business at that time. I then attended 
Burke Court, and on my return, this same man came to
where I was stopped by high water, and told me that I would
lose my money, and he would lose his land if I did not pay £40
more. He therefore proposed to let me have a part of his land,
and he would have a good crop raised on it for me, if I would
pay the other £40, to which I agreed, as I intended to move my
mother and family to that part of the country.</p>
      <p>This summer I intended to go to Philadelphia to dispose of
my furs. and purchase goods to enable me to buy a handsome
drove of cattle, but finding it would be too late before I could go
and return, I stopped at Staunton, Augusta County, Virginia,
and employed three hatters to work up a part of my fur into
hats, and paid them in fur for their labor. I returned to North-
Carolina with my hats in boxes, packed upon horses. I purchased 
all the cattle I was able to pay for, in the counties of
Wilkes, Burke and Buncombe, and started for Philadelphia;
stopped at Staunton, Virginia, and took on the balance of the
furs which I had left there. I purchased in Philadelphia as
<pb id="patton14" n="14"/>many goods as I was able to pay for, and returned to North-
Carolina with two wagons, one loaded with goods, and the other
with my mother and family. We moved to the piece of land
which I got of Tompkins, in Wilkes County, North-Carolina, fifteen 
miles from the Court-house on Lewis' Fork, near the foot
of the Blue Ridge. This was in the winter of 1792; at that
time there was no building of any kind on the place; but I got
the assistance of the neighbors who were very kind, and in two
weeks had a comfortable house a story and a half high to move
into. It was built of pine logs and covered with clapboards.
I put up my goods on the second story of the house. My principal 
reason for commencing business at my mother's, was to
procure such things as were necessary for the family. We never
lived better in our lives, and had plenty of every thing that was
comfortable. By this time I had fully seen the value of a good
parent who strove so hard for the comfort and the happiness of
her children.</p>
      <p>The ensuing fall I moved my goods to Wilkes Court-house.
The nest year in the fall, I moved my brother Thomas and family 
to Wilkes County, and settled him on the top of the Blue
Ridge, ten miles from my mother's. I let him have cattle and
horses to make a beginning on, and he lived well though at a
distance from neighbors; he had but three children and they
were small: his wife was an excellent woman, I always esteemed
 her highly: she was a high-minded honorable woman, and
endeavored to instill pure principles into the minds of her children. 
Brother Thomas was a weakly man, but did all he could
for his family. I gave them all the assistance in my power, but
it could not be expected that I could do much for them in so
short a time from my little beginning of two hundred dollars;
however, I put them all in a way to support themselves and
raise their families decently. They are now respectable, which
is well known by those who are acquainted with them.</p>
      <p>The first year after I moved my mother to Wilkes County, I
bought a small drove of horses and took them to the Federal City,
and from that to Baltimore. I also bought a house and lot in
Staunton, Virginia, from a man who lived in Wilkes County,
North-Carolina, and agreed to give him two young negroes for
it. Indeed, before I bought it, I had sold it on condition that I
would make a right to it. If a man will help himself, he will
always find friends. The merchants of Staunton saw that I was
making a better use of my small beginning, and some of them
became my security for a title, before I had bought it myself. I
made something by the speculation. I also bought some other
negroes, besides the two that I paid for the house and lot. The
<pb id="patton15" n="15"/>money was all paid down for the house and lot, and I intended to
lay it out for cattle. You will observe how careful I was; I
knew how much I would have to pay for negroes, and also knew
what I could get for the house and lot before I made the trade.</p>
      <p>About two years from the time that I moved my mother to
Wilkes County, I was married to your good and great mother.
She was the daughter of Francis Reynolds, a man of little property, 
but as honest and respectable as any man in the County
of Wilkes. He was one of the first settlers on the Yadkin River
in that county; he had twelve children, of course he was not
able to give her much: all she ever got did not amount to more
than three hundred dollars. When we were married, she was
in the bloom of youth and very handsome; amiable and sensible.
There was great disparity in our ages; she was twenty years
and five months younger than myself. She was ambitious to
excel in all the duties of a wife, and assisted me greatly in my
business. She saw that I was using all the exertions in my power, 
and having confidence in my judgment, it gave an increased
impulse to her industry.</p>
      <p>Her mother (Mrs. Reynolds) was a superior housekeeper: it
was from the management of her domestic concerns, the neatness
of her house, and the nice arrangement of every thing about it,
that I took a fancy to my wife, and I was not disappointed. She
was every thing I expected and looked for -- prudent, industrious
and economical, ready at all times to receive advice -- cheerful,
but not ostentatious. I gave it as my opinion, that it would be
imprudent for myself and her to appear at Church and other public 
places in superfluous dress, or to appear at any time above
our neighbors; not only because I disliked vain show, but my
principal reason was, that as we were just starting in the world,
and were dependent on the public for our success, it might have
an improper influence on their minds, and excite prejudices very
much against our interest. My motto was, plainness and neatness; 
and this is as far as any one should go, however prosperous 
their circumstances may be: a beautiful exterior may dazzle
the fancy for a short time, but solid worth depends entirely on a
well trained and virtuous mind.</p>
      <p>I made it a rule to consult my wife on all weighty and important 
matters that I thought she could comprehend, and when I
deviated from her opinion, I generally found that I was in error.
I would advise all married men to consult their wives in every
important undertaking. If they cannot fully understand the
whole of any matter that may be presented to their consideration, 
they will be certain to catch at parts, and make some observations 
that will set their husbands to thinking. My opinion
<pb id="patton16" n="16"/>is, that women have never been allowed their just weight in society: 
were they permitted to use that influence in society to
which I consider them entitled. they would contribute much more
to the success of business through life, than is generally imagined, 
and particularly to domestic prosperity and happiness.
During the third year after I had commenced trading, I took
Col. Andrew Erwin in, to assist me in my business. The second 
year that he was in my employment, he married my sister.
About twelve months after his marriage, I took him into full <sic>connexion</sic> 
with me in trade, although he had nothing at the time; I
had two reasons for it, one was, on account of the high regard I
had for my sister -- she was a high-minded honorable young woman; 
the other was, that I wished to encourage him, as he had
become my <sic>connexion</sic>. At this time my capital was greater
than his by twenty-eight hundred dollars, after all I had done for
my good mother and family.</p>
      <p>It gives me consolation at this time, to think that I did not
grasp all, and prevent others from coming forward, which (it is
well known) I had no disposition to do. I find fault very much
with wealthy men, for not taking poor young men by the hand,
and putting them in a way to do well, when they find them honest, 
trusty and capable. I had now lived in Wilkes County,
North-Carolina, twelve years, and my health had become so
greatly impaired, that I took a dislike to Wilkesborough, and resolved 
to leave the place; accordingly, I rented my possessions
to Waugh &amp; Finley (merchants) for seven years. We then
moved into the county of Buncombe in April 1807, and settled
on the farm where my son Thomas now lives, three miles from
Asheville, where we lived for seven years. We then moved
from the farm to Asheville, where we lived together thirteen
years and six months, before your mother died. She had been
afflicted with a liver complaint for several years, which finally
took her off. I think I can date her indisposition back to the
birth of your sister Jane Hardy, who died the past winter in
Charleston, South-Carolina: she then took cold, and was more
or less indisposed from that time until her death. From the time
we were married, until the death of your mother, was thirty-two
years and ten months. We had eleven children, of whom we
raised ten. At the time we moved to Asheville my son James
was 11 years of age, my second son John 9, Franklin 7, and
Thomas 5 years old. You can judge from this that I had to
contend with many disadvantages when I commenced public
house-keeping.</p>
      <p>Col. Erwin and myself were in partnership for twenty years,
and made a complete dissolution in one day, to the astonishment
<pb id="patton17" n="17"/>of every person of understanding: it was effected in the following
manner. As he was the active partner, I told him to make a
division of the whole, accompanied with a statement on paper,
and give me my choice, which he did; and in this way we came
to an amicable settlement at once.</p>
      <p>Col. Andrew Erwin was a man of a clear head and a good
heart, but too credulous and too easily imposed upon by bad
men. I was like the little boat spoken of by Dr. Franklin, I
would always keep near the shore; I would not venture far out
to sea for fear of accidents, therefore, I always endeavored to
find out whether a man was deserving of confidence, before I
trusted much in his hands.</p>
      <p>I have thought it unnecessary to extend this narrative any
further, as my principal object has been to give you some knowledge 
of my low beginning in the world, more than any thing
else: and my dear children, having thus endeavored to give you
a short sketch of the struggles and difficulties which I have
passed through in life, I can assure you that I have not done it by
way of boasting, but quite the contrary. It would be vain and
foolish in me to suppose that it would be of any advantage to me
as an individual, for at my time of life I have no disposition to
indulge any such feelings; but I have thought that if it should
never be of any benefit, it would perhaps afford satisfaction to
some of my posterity to know from whence they sprang. You
could not reasonably expect, that I would be able at my advanced 
age (being now in my 84th year) to give you an exact and
accurate account of the various vicissitudes of my life, merely
from memory. I know that I have omitted many things worthy
of notice, but I could not from recollection alone, embody them
in a way calculated either to please or instruct; but imperfect
as it is, I hope it may be profitably read by some of you when I
am no more. You will see that I had many hard trials to endure, 
and difficulties to encounter. You will also observe how
much can be accomplished by industry and frugality. To the exercise 
of these virtues is mainly to be attributed the little success
I have had in life, for I was possessed of very moderate qualifications 
for the business in which I was generally engaged; but
I had a firm mind, which by the assistance of a kind providence
enabled me to surmount the many obstacles which were in my
way. Besides the many hardships and difficulties which I have
before enumerated, I have met with various personal misfortunes: 
the first was, the long spell of sickness which I have
mentioned, and which was a serious drawback on me at that
time. I have met with various accidents also, but the worst of
all was at the Warm Springs where my son John lives. I was
<pb id="patton18" n="18"/>giving some directions about making a path to a limestone spring
on the opposite side of the river, to the house, when an <sic>unthoughful</sic> 
boy loosed a large rock from its bed, and it rolled against
both my legs, fracturing and bruising them very much. I was
greatly injured, and in consequence of it was confined to my
cabin for several months: I was then in the 80th year of my age.
It is however, a consolation to me to think, that these accidents
all occurred when I was engaged in some laudable business,
that I thought would be of advantage to my children. But with
all the trials and misfortunes that have come my way, I never
desponded; I always looked onwards and suffered nothing to arrest 
my progress; If I met with troubles, I consoled myself with
the reflection, that it was the common lot of man, and endeavored 
to profit by it for the future. The little success I have had
in life, was owing (as I before mentioned) to industry and frugality, 
for I settled in the upper part of North-Carolina, at that
time the poorest part of the country I ever saw to make property;
but I do not entertain the same opinion now. Changes and improvements 
have taken place, which have convinced me that
there are few sections of country superior to the western part of
North-Carolina. I am thankful that the Almighty blessed my
weak means and enabled me to do as much as I have, and I
have the consolation at this day to think, that I never made any
thing at the expense of the widow and the fatherless. I have
never sold the widow's cow or the poor man's land. You know
my character, and I hope that no conduct of mine will ever
cause you many blushes; although I cannot that I have been
guilty of many errors; but one thing I will say, that when I did
wrong, I always disliked myself for it more, than any other person 
could have done, and endeavored to do better for the future.</p>
      <p>Let me advise you to live in a peaceable and friendly manner
with each other. Never encourage family quarrels, but strive
against them. If any difference should take place among you,
suffer it not to come to the knowledge of the public, if you can
avoid it. If you cannot agree among, yourselves, refer the matter 
in dispute to <sic corr="some" resp="NS">snme</sic> of your own <sic>connexions</sic>, who have no
partiality, and are equally interested in your welfare, and if
either party should consider himself injured by the decision, let
him abide by it rather than expose himself and the family: it is
a disagreeable thing for relations to be at variance with each other;
besides, it is certain to injure their characters in public estimation; 
therefore, be cautious never to give cause of offence, family
differences are seldom adjusted, and when a breach is once
made, it is scarcely ever effectually closed. If any of you
should not be so successful and prosperous as the others, let it
<pb id="patton19" n="19"/>
not give rise to envy and dissatisfaction, if you encourage such
feelings, you will always be unhappy; and on the other hand, if
the exertions of any of you should be smiled upon by fortune,
don't look down upon the less fortunate with contempt: in this
way, envy and pride will both be avoided and peace and friendship 
insured. In my opinion, it shews a great want of good
sense for one person to consider himself superior to another, because 
he has a little property, particularly when he knows not
how it was earned. All men are not blessed with the same capacity, 
or the same opportunities to become rich, the situation
of some is so favorable that they appear to prosper without exertion, 
while others gain nothing by the most constant industry.
Therefore, a rich man should be thankful and not high minded.
Let all your intercourse with the world be marked by honesty
and integrity. If any person should do you an injury, don't retaliate 
and do the same to him; this course of conduct would serve
as an apology to others to injure you, who otherwise would not
have thought of it.</p>
      <p>Don't strive to be the richest people in the country, by grasping 
at too much, you may lose all. Therefore, never engage in
uncertain speculation.  Wealth is generally the result of patience, 
industry and frugality; but some persons are so eager to
become rich, that they leave the old beaten path, that would
certainly lead to success, and take by-paths for a short cut. In
nine cases out of ten, they become bewildered and never attain
their object; and it is seldom that they are ever in as prosperous 
condition as when they started. I will give you an instance
to shew how cautious I was in the transaction of my business.</p>
      <p>My partner, Col. Erwin, during a trip to the North, shipped
some goods which he had bought to Richmond, Virginia. Having 
heard that tobacco had taken a great rise, he wrote
to me to purchase all that could be procured in the counties 
of Wilkes and Burke, he stated that it was $10 per cwt.,
and it was thought would soon be $12. Before I bought any
tobacco, I tried to know how many wagons I could engage to
haul it of to market. I procured five or six, loaded them in
haste and started them; they went safe and he got $10 per cwt.
for it. As I could not engage any more wagons, I bought no
more tobacco. He came home and was much displeased that I
had not acted up to his instructions. He then bought 40 hhds.,
and before the tobacco could be taken to market, the price fell;
he then sent it to Fayetteville and stored it for some time; I
urged him to go and sell the tobacco for whatever it would bring,
as we needed the money; he then took it to Boston and sold it
(as he said) at or near the first cost. Taking into view the expense 
<pb id="patton20" n="20"/>
of wagons, storage, shipping, &amp;c., I do not believe that we
got more than half as much as it cost us, besides being deprived
of the use of the money, which we could have laid out for cattle
to good advantage, as they were in high demand at that time.
Now you see, my children, this was a bad speculation; had I
commenced in this way my $200 would not have counted $2,800
in three years, and enabled me to have done something for my
family besides. Never touch at speculation unless you have a
surplus on hands; if you then should be unsuccessful you will
not feel it so much. I approve of speculation for men in business, 
but remember, in the first trade I made in the 100 bushels
of rye, the fur skins I bought, and the house and lot, and some
others, how much caution I exercised. I would advise you to
have your business confined at home as much as possible. A
man seldom leaves home but he loses something. The most
trusty person that you can have in your employment, can not
act with that degree of care, attention and judgment in your absence, 
as he will when you are present, because he cannot take
the liberty. Make use of all honest and honorable means of
gain, and God will give the blessing. Treat every person with
kindness and respect, be plain and decent both at home and
and abroad, and you will have the good opinion of your poor
relations and neighbors. This was the advice I gave your good
mother when we commenced house-keeping. I found the good
effects of it. We kept a good table, good beds, and a good stable, 
and when we went to Church we did not ride in a fine carriage, 
or appear in the most stylish dress. Children, you know
the above to be true, and the public know it likewise. It is true,
we had not much to be proud of, but enough to have made us
vain and foolish, if we had been so disposed. I flatter myself,
that I have been more respected by both rich and poor, than I
would have been, if I had made a show in the world, as is usually 
the custom at this day.</p>
      <p>Be charitable to your poor relations and neighbors, and as
God has enjoined, that we must earn our bread by the sweat of
the brow, we must be industrious. In my opinion, a man cannot 
be a good Christian, unless he be industrious; and I know,
without industry he cannot be a good citizen. Do not think
from what I have said, that I wish you to be avaricious and covetous,
and worship wealth as an idol, and hoard it up for your
children, who will perhaps make a bad use of it. This is one
extreme, as much to be avoided as that of indolence and stupidity; 
but I wish you to use all the honest means necessary to
enable you to act your parts well in the world, and be useful and
respectable members of society. Give your children a good education, 
<pb id="patton21" n="21"/>
impress upon their minds principles of industry and morality, 
but above all set before them pious examples and encourage 
them to follow the same. I have observed that children of
pious parents generally pass through life with less trouble and
difficulty, than those brought up by parents of immoral and dissolute 
habits. Children may occasionally deviate from the rules
prescribed to them by their parents in early life, but it is seldom
that first impressions are completely effaced from the mind, especially 
those that have been made by the mother. To her
peculiarly belongs the task of training the infant mind and producing 
the first conceptions of right and wrong; this I know by
experience.</p>
      <p>You who are living in a public way, should have as many
tradesmen and others about you, as will be profitable, and you
can attend to; this will shew the extent of your business and attract 
public attention. Treat them all with kindness and assist
them in small matters. Never treat them coolly when they ask
favors, and if it should not suit you to comply with their requests,
deny them courteously. In this way you will always have their
good will, and they will do their duty with pleasure. I have
often given my assistance to poor young men who were beginning 
the world, but I would notice particularly, whether they
were making a good use of my kindness. As I have passed
through life I have often reflected on my hard lot, and wondered
that my father had not exerted himself more for the good of his
children when he had it in his power, but he was like many
others, he did not think properly until it was too late. He died
when his children were all small. I have often felt the consequences 
of his neglect, which has stimulated me to do all that I
could for you. If you should properly improve upon what I have
done, and leave your children in a more prosperous situation
than yourselves, it will shew to the world that you did not abuse
the means that were put into your hands; but that you properly
appreciated your advantages. Admonish them to pursue the
same course, shew them a worthy example and they will be
apt to follow it. I would advise you to avoid litigation as
much as possible. There may be instances of honest men appealing 
to the laws of their country for redress, but I think they
are rare; there is neither much profit nor much honor attending
it; very often each party is a loser. When the name of any
man becomes conspicuous on the Court docket, the public are
apt to form an unfavorable opinion of him; it shews one of two
things, either that he is dishonest, or that he is very careless in
the transaction of his business. When you make a contract even
of the most trifling nature, reduce the terms to the utmost certainty 
<pb id="patton22" n="22"/>
at first, and you will generally have little difficulty in your
dealings. I was once in company with one of our Superior
Court Judges, when a conversation casually took place in regard
to myself. He remarked, that I had been engaged in a great
deal of business and had accomplished much for my time; I
asked him if he had ever heard my name in Court; he said he
had not; I observed to him that I had never sold the widow's
cow or the poor man's land: he then asked me if I had ever
sued any one?  I told him that I had sued some persons, but
that I always laid some plan to avoid distressing them: I also
told him that a Sheriff had never served a process on me for
money, and that no man had ever to ask me more than once
for any thing I owed him. Now, this was owing entirely to correct 
calculation before hand, and my own exertions to carry my
plans into execution; and altogether by the means I had within
myself, for I never had but one thousand dollars from a Bank in
my life.</p>
      <p>There cannot be a stronger argument in favor of industry than
the fact, that a man cannot be a useful citizen without the means,
and without industry the means cannot be procured. People in
moderate circumstances can do but little towards assisting their
fellow-men in trouble and distress or aiding in any important
undertaking, however much they may desire it. But if you should
follow the advice which I have given, and should consequently
possess an abundance of the good things of this world, don't imagine 
that you hold them clear of all obligation to appropriate
some portion to objects not immediately connected with your
own personal interest. We are informed by divine authority,
that we are nothing more than stewards, and are bound to account 
for the talents put into our hands. The rich man who
lives only for himself, does not deserve the respect and esteem of
his fellow-man. He should always be viewed with suspicion
He shews by his conduct that he has in some measure separated
himself from the rest of the world, and that he has no feelings
connected with their interest and happiness.</p>
      <p>Be charitable to the poor: it was never intended that all men
should be rich, and I have often thought, that it was designed by
Providence that some portion of the human family should be in
a destitute condition, that the wealthy might have opportunities
of performing acts of beneficence. Don't confer acts of kindness 
to be seen of men: pride often prompts persons to bestow
favors when their feelings dictate the contrary, for the purpose
of increasing their reputation in the public view. In every case,
act with cheerfulness and without ostentation. One single act
of charity, when it accidentally comes to the knowledge of the
<pb id="patton23" n="23"/>
world, will add more to your character than a dozen performed
with a view to public approbation.</p>
      <p>You should exercise a good degree of judgment in determining
who are proper objects of charity, and who are not; there are
impostors in the world, and on that account many worthy persons 
have been refused favors when they deserved them: but
because there are such, we are not to withhold, with a parsimonious 
hand, from all who seek our assistance. We might with
as much propriety, refuse to add anything to the cause of religion, 
because there are some unworthy members in the Church.
And if we should unconsciously shew kindness to the undeserving, 
we are not to blame. Favors should not be conferred on
those, who we believe, will make a bad use of them; such as
spendthrifts, or persons of dissipated habits. It is only furnishing 
the means to assist them in their career of vice and profligacy; 
but there is a class of persons, in regard to whom, a course of
conduct should be pursued different from what is customary: I
allude to those who have indulged in intoxication and other vices
and who evince a disposition to reform. They are generally
treated by the community at large, and even by their own connexions, 
in a cold and distant manner. They are told that they
are unworthy of confidence, and that none should be placed in
them. In one word, they are treated with the utmost disregard
by those who are probably guilty of crimes, which, in comparison
with those of the unfortunate drunkard, are as mountains to molehills; 
but the world is ignorant of them and they go unpunished.
This is not the proper way to act towards them; it produces unhappiness 
and distress of mind, which plunges them deeper into
dissipation, and hastens them on in the road to destruction. The
minds of such persons are peculiarly sensitive either to kind or
harsh treatment, and while they admire the one, they will resent
the other. These unfortunate persons should be taken by the
hand and encouraged to do well. They should be kindly and
affectionately advised, and when they find your feelings enlisted
in their welfare, they may repay your kindness by a complete
change of conduct. This I know in some measure by myself. I
was often fond of <sic corr="spiritis" resp="BMG">spiriis</sic> when a young man, and even after I was
married, and frequently drank too much, and never can be too
thankful that I did not become the victim of intemperance. It
was in a good degree owing to my natural strength of mind
and determined resolution, that I escaped ruin and destruction;
but I must confess that it was also in a great measure attributable 
to the gentle and friendly admonitions of your mother. She
did not become irritated but acted with prudence and moderation. 
Had she acted in a different way (as many do) it is more
<pb id="patton24" n="24"/>
than probable that the effect on me would have been very different. 
She did not fret my mind, but left it free to think. This is
the only way to insure reformation. Can you expect, that a
man in a passion will think correctly when he is not in the possession 
of the faculty of reason? No: the only way to cause
them to reflect properly, is to act towards them with gentleness
and friendship.</p>
      <p>I would advise you to have your names connected in a greater 
or less degree with the public institutions of the present day.
The destitute condition of the human family in distant parts of
the world, is commanding the attention of philanthropists,
throughout every part of our widely extended country. These
institutions cannot be sustained without means, and the means
cannot be procured without the aid of individuals. You may
think that a small amount from you would have little bearing,
and on that account refuse it; but if every person were to act in
the same way, there would be nothing done; it is by the connexion 
of individual means that great objects are accomplished. -- 
Swannannoa is an insignificant stream, but it contributes its part
towards making the Mississippi what it has been justly called -- 
the Father of waters. Every man should be possessed of some
portion of public spirit. No day should pass without the consolation 
of having done some good to our fellow-men, and every
person who is so disposed can always discover some opportunity 
of performing some praiseworthy action, either of a public or
private nature. What do we live for, but to improve ourselves
and be useful to others? It is a melancholy reflection, that every
thing, from the mammoth down to the most filthy reptile answers
the purposes of its creation; but man -- possessed of reason and
reflection, and a faithful monitor within to distinguish right from
wrong -- pointing out the advantages arising from the one, and
the unhappy consequences resulting from the other, is it not
strange that he will in spite of all the examples which are daily
set before him, pursue a course of conduct, which is certain to
produce misery and degradation? It appears to me, that if we
were to consult nothing but our individual happiness, that we
would endeavor to abstain from all manner of evil. But there
are other considerations which should have a powerful influence
on all our actions in life -- gratitude to the parents who bore us,
should ever restrain us from committing any act calculated to
render them unhappy. How can children ever repay the enormous  
debt which they owe to their parents, who watched over
them in helpless infancy, who administered to their comfort in
sickness and in health, who have followed through good and
through evil report, and perhaps deprived themselves of the
<pb id="patton25" n="25"/>
common necessaries of life to advance their interest? The answer 
is easy -- by doing right. They ask no pecuniary rewards
-- they only ask them to pursue that course of conduct, that will
render themselves happy in this world, and that which is to
come. If children would only reflect on the constant anxiety of
their parents for their welfare, they would certainly endeavor
to smooth their passage through life by a virtuous course of conduct.  
But a parent only knows how a parent feels.</p>
      <p>Don't be too proud to ask advice when you are in doubt on
any subject; but take counsel of good men of understanding.
You will find that the flattering side of a prospect always presents 
itself first, and the side on which danger lies is dark and
silent. Be careful to examine both sides attentively, before you
make a decision. By following this advice, you will avoid much
trouble and difficulty through life, save your characters, and save
your property.</p>
      <p>Be humane to your servants; give them plenty of nourishing
diet and clothing. This will make them esteem you and cause
them to do their duty with cheerfulness. Don't keep a servant
or white person about your house who is possessed of a bad disposition, 
or inclined to mischief; it is hard to change their minds
and danger attends their living with you. But don't part from
a good servant, or any other person in your employment, for a
small fault; you may get one in his place that will not suit you
so well. I have had experience in these matters. I have had
men living with me from one to ten years-storekeepers, labourers 
on the farm, wagoners, blacksmiths, tanners, and others of
different occupations, and I would not dismiss them for trifling
offences.</p>
      <p>I would advise you to select young men from the middle rank
in life, of sober and industrious habits -- sons of honest and respectable 
farmers. These are the best citizens in any country;
these will consider themselves, in a great degree, dependant on
you for their advancement in life, whereas the sons of wealthy
parents will not think themselves under the same obligation to
do their duty. This is a rule which I have adopted myself, and
generally found to be correct; but if the character and capacity
of a young man were such as I wished. I would only employ him
for a short time at first, at low terms; because, they are not of
much value until they get some experience in business. If I
then found that they were honest, trusty and capable, I would
engage them for a longer time, and increase their wages. I
think it due to Jeremiah Cleveland, George Jones, and William
R. Smith, to state, that they were taken into my employment,
from the knowledge which I had of their parents. These men
<pb id="patton26" n="26"/>
were possessed of honesty and industry. They lived with me
from nine to eleven years, and when either of them was attending 
to my business, 1 was satisfied that all was right. They
were obedient and faithful: they did well for me, and they have
done well for themselves, and are now wealthy and respectable.
Many others have lived with me who have done well; but I
have mentioned these three, because they were in my employment 
longer than any others.</p>
      <p>I wish to say a few words to the female part of my family:
in the business in which your mother and I were engaged, we
were often obliged to have the assistance of females. We sometimes 
took the daughters of ignorant parents, who had been
raised in extreme indigence. They were frequently (when they
first came) in such a condition, that they were not fit to be seen
in company; but as soon as they were decently clothed, pride
would take possession of their minds, and they soon got above
their business; and although they had never known any thing
but poverty and want, they became wasteful and extravagant
as soon as they got where there was plenty. They were so deplorably 
ignorant, that they had no idea of economy, or the value
of any thing about them; but used every thing as if there never
could be an end of it. Such people should be avoided. Employ
such as have some smartness and capacity for business, and are
descended from honest and industrious parents. Such an one
was Nancy McElroy, now Mrs. Clayton. She lived with us for
several years until your mother's death; she was industrious,
capable, and attentive to business; her parents were honest and
respectable. She is now married to a man of excellent character 
and doing well.</p>
      <p>I will soon close my remarks, and will take the liberty of cautioning 
you most seriously against the danger of speculation,
when there is any uncertainty attending it. There have been
instances of some of you attempting speculation, when it appeared 
almost certain that you would realize some profit, but
how did it turn out ? It was attended not only with direct pecuniary 
loss, but still greater loss at home in various ways. Dr.
Franklin says, that the eye of the Master is worth both his hands,
and to employ men to work for you without attending to them, is
to leave them your purse open. Besides, the advantage that a
man will derive by staying at home and attending to his business
-- it is a gratification to every person of a well regulated mind
to be with his family. When I observe that any man is frequently 
from home, and appears regardless of the manner in which
his business is going on, I come to the conclusion at once, that
he is doing no good. And it is the same in regard to women -- 
<pb id="patton27" n="27"/>
not that I object to occasional visits, they may be proper and
even necessary, sometimes, but not often. A woman who is
much from home, is apt to acquire the character of a gossip, than
which there are few more despicable. Home is the place where
your affections and your business should be centered, and if it
should not be so extensive as to make you conspicuous in the
world, it will make you useful and respectable. Many men
have reduced themselves and their families from a high state of
prosperity to poverty and want, by engaging in uncertain
schemes of speculation. They could not exercise a little patience 
and wait for certain profit, but risked all to save time. -- 
Such men act with about as much sagacity as the boy who killed
the goose which laid the golden eggs. He wanted all at once,
and for want of proper consideration forever closed the door to
future gain. If any of you should be deceived by villains, (as
some of you have been) don't be discouraged, but renew your
efforts and be more careful for the future: pick up courage and
go ahead -- just think of me and you will never yield; but you
must be humble, don't try to cut a figure in the world until fortune 
smiles on your exertions again, and the world will honor
you for your energy and perseverance.</p>
      <p>Children, the little property which I have made, I have divided 
amongst you to the best of my judgment. When you take
into view every thing connected with it, I hope you will not think
that I have exercised any partiality, for I can assure you that I
had no such feeling, but made as just a distribution as I was
able, so as to keep the principal property together in Asheville,
and prevent it from going into the hands of strangers, for I wish
my name to be there when I should be no more, and therefore
imposed many burdens on your brother James, with which some
of you are unacquainted. When you take into consideration my
bad state of health, and the many misfortunes I have met with,
I hope that you will think that I have acted with as much justice
and impartiality as I was capable of.  Without a correct statement 
of every thing, it would be impossible for you to judge with
any degree of accuracy; but I could meet my God and say with
a clear conscience, that I intended nothing but justice to each
and every one of you. I hope you will all be satisfied, live in
peace, and be an <sic>honour</sic> to each other. You have many advantages 
for which you should be thankful. You are young, blessed 
with common capacities, and have something to start on in
the world; I had none of these. My education was very limited; 
I had no friends to lend me a helping hand, and at thirty-
four years of age had but two hundred dollars; besides, many
misfortunes came in my way which were obstacles to my success
<pb id="patton28" n="28"/>
in life. I now believe, that it was for my good, that I was unfortunate 
in my youth; had I never met with disappointments, it is
probable to me that I would not have effected as much as I have:
for they caused me to think and act with caution. Remember
that afflictions are sent for our good, and if we were to meet with
nothing but prosperity, we would soon forget the source from
whence we derive all our comfort and happiness.</p>
      <p>I will mention some other reasons which I had for keeping the
Asheville property together: in the first place, it was the wish
of  your good mother, who had done every thing in her power, to
assist you all, that it should remain in the hands of one of the
children, and James was the one she named, as he was the oldest 
son. It was her lot to die and be buried in Asheville; it is
my wish also to lie by the side of her and my mother, in the
small space of ground which is laid off for that purpose. Another 
was, that when your mother died, your two youngest sisters
had not received their education, the youngest being at that time
only twelve years of age. Your brother James gratified my
wishes in giving them excellent opportunities of improvement in
Salem, Philadelphia and Nashville, which was attended with
considerable expense; and his house, subsequent to that time
was the same to them that it had been before your mother's
death; they were both married there without any cost or expense. 
Besides, it is a pleasant place for the family to meet together 
and enjoy sociality and friendship, and has been, and is
at this time, a place of refuge for some of the connexion who
have been unfortunate. These considerations afford me a great
deal of pleasure, and at the very moment I am writing this sentence, 
I can look through my window and view the spot where
I will soon repose; and how happy would be my transit from
this world of toil and pain, if I were certain you would all do
well. Although I have often erred, still I am pleased that God
has blessed my weak means, and enabled me (at the advanced
age of 84 years) to give you some advice for your good. And
may the God of Grace, cheer and support me until the time of
our separation on earth, and give me a life of blessed immortality
beyond the grave. That you may live in peace and harmony
with each other, and so spend your lives in this world, that you
will be prepared for that which is to come, is the wish of your
affectionate father,</p>

          <p>The following extract of a letter from <sic corr="an" resp="BMG">and</sic> old old gentleman named
John Patton, a resident then of London, who had written to William
Patton, of Charleston, to inquire after a son of his; and of whom William 
Patton made some inquiry, as to his uncle Cornelius; gives the
family <sic>geneaology</sic>, which may be amusing to those of the same name.</p>

          <p>“ As to the Pattons, there are others -- as Peyton, Payton,
an Admiral Peyton, without arms. Patin, the Guy Patin, famous
French Physician. Patten, the Lancashire and Lincolnshire family,
one many years ago Lord of the Manor of Stoke, Newington, and repaired 
the Church at his own expense. One within these few years
sat in Parliament, and afterwards as Patten Bold. A daughter since
his decease, married to an Italian Prince, but not our family arms,
motto different. The Pattons or Patons are originally Scotch, found
wherever they are; there are two families -- arms the same, one with
the addition of a sword, motto to the same effect, one ‘<foreign lang="lat">virtute adepta</foreign>,’
the other <foreign lang="lat">‘virtute Lau dando</foreign> ;’ one from Kinaldy or Kincaldie, the
other Ferrochie -- crests, a sparrow hawk perching proper, with wings
expanded.” -- <hi rend="italics">Pout's Manuscript, or Nesbit</hi>, 41 &amp; 247.</p>
          <p>“The Pattons have been extended in my time, one was with Nelson
in the battle of the Nile, afterwards an Admiral, and Lord of the Admiralty. 
I have not met or heard of your Uncle Cornelius. I forgot
to say, reading that the Dukes of Devonshire, were from the daughter
of John Patton of Suffolk, Lord of Cavendish; and Roger de Garnon,
who came over with William the Conqueror. I referred to the history
of the peerage, and the spelling found different in the body and index; a
reference to manuscript can only clear that up. His Lordship was a
Patton or Patten. It would be desirable to see the arms of Cavendish
at the time.”</p>

        <div2>
          <p>The relative who attended to the printing of this Narrative, (which
is intended only for the family and a few friends) was desirous of adding 
a more extended list of each brother and sister's family, and wrote
to several persons to procure it. Having failed to obtain more than
the two which are annexed, he only gave a short account of the others,
fearing he might not be accurate, if he attempted more.</p>
          <p>The remains of James Patton are interred in the beautiful burial
ground of the Presbyterian Church in the village of Asheville, N. C.,
which ground he had presented to the Church; and in the spot he had
<pb id="patton34" n="34"/>
long before pointed out, which is marked with a plain marble obelisk,
bearing this inscription:</p>
          <p>“ In memory of <emph rend="bold">JAMES PATTON</emph>, born 13th July 1756, in County Derry, 
Ireland; died at Asheville, N. C., 9th September 1845, in the 90th
year of his age. He was the founder of his family in America; an honest 
and persevering man, accumulating much property without grinding 
the poor -- prudently assisting his poor relations, as well as bringing
forward in the world many deserving young men.”</p>
