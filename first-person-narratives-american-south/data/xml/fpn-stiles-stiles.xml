MARSE ROBERT</head>
        <div2 type="chapter">
          <head>CHAPTER I</head>
          <head>EXPLANATION OF THE TITLE—SCHEME OF THE WORK</head>
          <p>“Four years under Marse Robert.”</p>
          <p>At the first blush this title may strike one as inaccurate,
lacking in dignity, and bordering on the sensational. Yet the
author prefers it to any other and is ready to defend it; while
admitting, though this may seem inconsistent, that explanations
are in order.</p>
          <p>Not one of his men was an actual follower of Robert
Lee for four full years. In fact, he was not himself in the
military service of Virginia and of the Confederate States
together for that length of time, and he did not assume
personal command of what was then the Confederate “Army
of the Potomac” and later, under his leadership, became the
“Army of Northern Virginia,” until June 1, 1862.</p>
          <p>But more than a year before, indeed just after the secession of the State,
Governor Letcher had appointed Lee to the
chief command of the Virginia troops, which, under his plastic
hand, in spite of vast obstacles, were turned over in a few
weeks in fair soldierly condition to the Confederate
Government, and became the nucleus of the historic Army of
Northern Virginia; and their commander was created one of
the five full generals provided for by law in the military service
of the Confederate States.</p>
          <p>As full general in the Confederate service, Lee was not
at first assigned to particular command, but remained at
Richmond as “Military <sic corr="Advisor">Adviser</sic> to the President.” In that
<pb id="stiles18" n="18"/>
position, as also in his assignment, somewhat later, to the
conduct, under the advice of the President, of the operations of
all the armies of the Confederate States, he of course had
more or less supervision and control of the armies in Virginia.
Such continued to be Lee's position and duties, and his relations
to the troops in Virginia, until General Joseph E. Johnston,
commanding the army defending Richmond, was struck down
at Seven Pines, or Fair Oaks, June 1st, 1862, when President
Davis appointed Lee to succeed him in command of that army.</p>
          <p>From this brief review it appears clearly that the men who,
after June 1st, 1862, followed Lee's banner and were under his
immediate command were, even before that time and from the
very outset, in a large and true sense his soldiers and under his
control; so that, while strictly speaking no soldier followed Lee
for four years, yet we who served in Virginia from the
beginning to the end of the war are entitled, in the customary
and popular sense, to speak of our term of service as <hi rend="italics">“Four
years under Lee.”</hi></p>
          <p>But our claim is, “Four years under MARSE ROBERT.”
Why Marse Robert?”</p>
          <p>So, in Innes Randolph's inimitable song, “A Good Old Rebel,”
the hero thus vaunts his brief but glorious annals:</p>

            <l>“I followed old Mars' Robert</l>
            <l>For four year, near about;</l>
            <l>Got wounded in three places</l>
            <l>And starved at Pint Lookout.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>Again, why <corr>“</corr>Mars' Robert?” </p>
          <p>The passion of soldiers for
nicknaming their favorite leaders, re-christening them according
to their unfettered fancy and their own sweet will, is well
known. “The Little Corporal,” “The Iron Duke,” “Marshall
Forwards,” “Bobs,” “Bobs Bahadur,” “Little Mac,” “Little
Phil,” “Fighting Joe,” “Stonewall,” “Old Jack,” “Old Pete,” “Old
Jube,” “Jubilee,” “Rooney,” “Fitz,” “Marse Robert”—all these
and many more are familiar. There is something grotesque
about most of them and in many, seemingly, rank disrespect.
Yet the habit has never been regarded as a violation
<pb id="stiles19" n="19"/>
of military law, and the commanding general of an
army, if a staunch fighter, and particularly if victory often
perches on his banner, is very apt to win the noways doubtful
compliment of this rough and ready knighthood from his
devoted troops. But however this may be, “Marse Robert” is
far away above the rest of these soldier nicknames in pathos
and in power.</p>
          <p>In the first place, it is essentially <hi rend="italics">military</hi>.</p>
          <p>Though in form and style as far as possible removed from
that model, this quaint title yet rings true upon the elemental
basis of military life—unquestioning and unlimited <hi rend="italics">obedience</hi>.
It embodies the strongest possible expression of the short
creed of the soldier:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Theirs not to reason why,</l>
            <l>Theirs but to do and die.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>I do not believe an army ever existed which surpassed Lee's
ragged veterans in hearty acceptance and daily practice of this
soldier creed, and there is no telling to what extent their
peculiar nickname for their leader was responsible for this
characteristic trait of his followers. Men who spoke habitually
of their commanding general as “Master” could not but feel the
reflex influence of this habit upon their own character as
soldiers. This much may certainly be said of this graphic title of
the great captain; but this is not all.</p>
          <p>“Marse Robert!” It goes without saying that the title is
distinctively <hi rend="italics">Southern</hi>.</p>
          <p>The homely phrase was an embodiment of the earliest and
strongest associations of the men applied in reverent affection,
but also in defiant yet pathetic protest. It was, in some sense,
an outcry of the social system of the South assailed and imperilled
by the war and doomed to perish in the great
convulsion. The title “Marse Robert” fitted at once the life of
the soldier and the life of the slave, because both were based
upon the principle of absolute obedience to absolute authority.</p>
          <p>In this connection it may not be uninteresting to note—what
is perhaps not generally known—that during the
<pb id="stiles20" n="20"/>
last months of the war the Confederate authorities canvassed
seriously the policy of arming the Southern slaves and putting
them in the field as soldiers. I was told by a leading member of
the Senate of Virginia that, by special invitation, General Lee
came over from Petersburg and appeared before, as I
remember, a joint committee of the two Houses, to which this
matter had been referred, and gave his opinion in favor of the
experiment upon the ground, mainly, that unhesitating and
unlimited obedience—the first great lesson of the soldier— 
was ingrained, if not inborn, in the Southern slave.</p>
          <p>Yet once more—to christen Lee “Master” was an act of
homage peculiarly appropriate to his lofty and <hi rend="italics">masterful
personality.</hi></p>
          <p>There never could have been a second “Marse Robert;” as,
but for the unparalleled elevation and majesty of his character
and bearing, there would never have been the first. He was of
all men most attractive to us, yet by no means most
approachable. We loved him much, but we revered him more.
We never criticised, never doubted him; never attributed to him
either moral error or mental weakness; no, not even in our
secret hearts or most audacious thoughts. I really believe it
would have strained and blurred our strongest and clearest
conceptions of the distinction between right and wrong to have
entertained, even for a moment, the thought that he had ever
acted from any other than the purest and loftiest motive. I
never but once heard of such a suggestion, and then it so
transported the hearers that military subordination was
forgotten and the colonel who heard it rushed with drawn
sword against the major-general who made it.</p>
          <p>The proviso with which a ragged rebel accepted the doctrine
of evolution, that “the rest of us may have descended or
ascended from monkeys, but it took a God to make Marse
Robert,” had more than mere humor in it.</p>
          <p>I am not informed whether the figure of speech to which I
am about to refer ever obtained outside the South, or whether
its use among us was generally known beyond our borders. It
undoubtedly originated with our negroes, being
<pb id="stiles21" n="21"/>
an expression of their affectionate reverence for their masters,
by metaphor, transferred to the one great “Lord and Master” of
us all; but it is certainly also true that Southern white men, and
especially Southern soldiers, were in the habit—and that
without the least consciousness of irreverence—of referring
to the Divine Being as “Old Marster,” in connection especially
with our inability to comprehend His inscrutable providences
and our duty to bow to His irreversible decrees. There is no
way in which I can illustrate more vividly the almost worship
with which Lee's soldiers regarded him than by saying that I
once overheard a conversation beside a camp fire between
two Calvinists in Confederate rags and tatters, shreds and
patches, in which one simply and sincerely inquired of his
fellow, who had just spoken of “Old Marster,” whether he
referred to “the one up at headquarters or the One up yonder.”</p>
          <p>We never compared him with other men, either friend or
foe. He was in a superlative and absolute class by himself.
Beyond a vague suggestion, after the death of Jackson, as to
what might have been if he had lived, I cannot recall even an
approach to a comparative estimate of Lee.</p>
          <p>As to his opponents, we recked not at all of them, but only of
the immense material force behind them; and as to that, we
trusted our commanding general like a providence. There was
at first a mild amusement in the rapid succession of the Federal
commanders, but even this grew a little trite and tame. There
was, however, one point of great interest in it, and that was our
amazement that an army could maintain even so much as its
organization under the depressing strain of these successive
appointments and removals of its commanding generals. And
to-day I, for one, regard the fact that it did preserve its cohesion
and its fighting power under and in spite of such experiences,
as furnishing impressive demonstration of the high character
and intense loyalty of our historic foe, the Federal Army of the
Potomac.</p>
          <p>As to the command of the Army of Northern Virginia, so far
as I know or have reason to believe, but one man in the
Confederate States ever dared to suggest a change, and that
<pb id="stiles22" n="22"/>
one was Lee himself, who—after the battle of Gettysburg,
and again, I think, though I cannot verify it, when his health
gave way for a time under the awful strain of the campaign of
'64—suggested that it might be well he should give way to a
younger and stronger man. But the fact is, that Lee's
preeminent fitness for supreme command was so universally
recognized that, in spite of the obligation of a soldier to
undertake the duties of any position to which he may be
assigned by competent authority, I doubt whether there was an
officer in all the armies of the Confederacy who would have
consented to accept appointment as Lee's successor in
command of the Army of Northern Virginia—possibly there
was one—and I am yet more disposed to question whether
that army would have permitted Lee to resign his place or any
other to take it. Looking back over its record, from Seven
Pines to Appomattox, I am satisfied that the unquestioned and
unquestionable preeminence, predominance, and permanence
of Lee, as its commander-in-chief, was one of the main
elements which made the Army of Northern Virginia what it
was.</p>
          <p>I have said we never criticised him. I ought, perhaps, to
make one qualification of this statement. It has been suggested
by others and I have myself once or twice felt that Lee was
too lenient, too full of sweet charity and allowance. He did not,
as Jackson did, instantly and relentlessly remove incompetent
officers.</p>
          <p>The picture is before you, and yet it is not intended as a full
picture, but only as such a presentation of him, from the point
of view of his soldiers, as will explain and justify the quaint title
which they habitually applied to their great commander. I have
not attempted and shall not attempt a complete portrait. Why
should I, when the most eloquent tongues and pens of two
continents have labored to present, with fitting eulogy, the
character and career of our great Cavalier. It is our patent of
nobility that he is to-day regarded—the world over—as the
representative of the soldiery of the South.</p>
          <pb id="stiles23" n="23"/>
          <p>Not only is it true of him, as already intimated, that he
uniformly acted from the highest motive presented to his soul— 
but so impressive and all-compelling was the majesty of his
virtue that it is doubtful whether any one ever questioned aught
of this. It is perhaps not too much to say that the common
consensus of Christendom—friend and foe and neutral— 
ranks him as one of the greatest captains of the ages and
attributes to him more of the noblest virtues and powers, with
less of the ordinary selfishness and littleness of humanity, than
to any other great soldier. This is what is meant by our
dedication—that the world has come to view him very much
as his ragged followers did in the grand days when they were
helping him to make history.</p>
          <p>Can you point to another representative man upon whom the
light of modern day has been <sic corr="focused">focussed</sic> with such intensity, of
whom these supreme things may be said with so little strain; or
rather, with acquiescence practically universal? For our part,
we say emphatically—we know not where to look for the
man.</p>
          <p>The scheme of this book is a modest one. The author makes
no pretense that he is qualified to write history or to discuss
learnedly, from a professional standpoint, the battles and
campaigns of armies; while of course an old veteran cannot be
expected always and absolutely to refrain from saying how the
thing looked to him. All that is really proposed—and the
writer will be more than content if he acquit but rather to
select and record such incidents, arranged of course in a
general orderly sequence, as are deemed to be of himself
fairly well of this limited design—is to state clearly and
truthfully what he saw and experienced as a private soldier
and subordinate officer in the military service of the
Confederate States in Virginia from '61 to '65.</p>
          <p>It is not proposed, however, to give a consecutive recital of
all that occurred during these four years, even within the
narrow range of the writer's observation and experience;
inherent interest, or to shed light upon the portrait of the
Confederate soldier, the personality of prominent actors in the
war drama upon the Southern side, the salient points
<pb id="stiles24" n="24"/>
of the great conflict, or the general conditions of life in and
behind the Confederate lines.</p>
          <p>Again, such are the imperfections of human observation and
such the irregularities and errors of human memory, especially
in the record of events long past, that many may be disposed to
question the value of such a book as this, written to-day,
relating to our civil war. I can only reply that not a few of the
incidents recorded were reduced to writing years ago, indeed
soon after they occurred; while perhaps as much has been
gained in perspective as has been lost in detail, by waiting.
Certainly it can be better determined to-day what is worthy of
preservation and publication than it could have been
immediately after the war.</p>
          <p>The slips and vagaries of memory, however, cannot be
denied or excluded. It can only be said, “forewarned is
forearmed.” I shall endeavor to exercise that conscientious
care which the character of the work requires, but cannot hope
to attain uniform and unerring accuracy in every detail. In the
record of conversations, interviews, and speeches I shall
sometimes adopt the form of direct quotation, even where not
able to recall the precise words employed by the speakers and
interlocutors—if I am satisfied this form of narrative will best
convey the real spirit of the occasion.</p>
          <p>And as the writer is, in the main, to relate what he saw and
heard and did, he craves in advance charitable toleration of the
first personal pronoun in the singular number.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>Ante-war History of the Author—The Fight for the “Speakership” in 1860— 
Vallandigham, of Ohio—Richmond After the John Brown Raid—Whig
and Democratic Conventions of Virginia in 1860.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>There are features of my antecedent personal history
calculated, perhaps, to impart a somewhat special interest to
my experiences as a Confederate soldier. I was the eldest son
of the Rev. Joseph C. Stiles, a Presbyterian minister, born in
Georgia, where his ancestors had lived and died for
generations, but who moved to the North and, from my
boyhood, had lived in New York City and in New Haven,
Conn. I was prepared for college in the schools of these two
cities and was graduated at Yale in 1859. It so happened that I
had never visited the South since the original removal of the
family, which occurred when I was some twelve years of age;
so that practically all my education, associations and
friendships were Northern. True, I took position as a
Southerner in all our college discussions and debates, but never
as a “fire-eater” or secessionist. Indeed, I was a strong “Union
man” and voted for Bell and Everett in 1860.</p>
          <p>After my graduation in 1859 I passed the late summer and
autumn in the Adirondack woods fishing and hunting with
several classmates, and devoted the rest of the year to general
reading and some little teaching, in New Haven; until,
becoming deeply interested in the fierce struggle over the
Speakership of the House of Representatives, I went to
Washington, and from the galleries of the House and Senate
eagerly overhung the great final debates. I had paid close
attention to oratory during my college course and I doubt
whether there was an onlooker in the Capitol more deeply
absorbed than I. On more than one occasion
<pb id="stiles26" n="26"/>
the excitement and pressure of the crowd in the galleries of the
House was fearful, and once at least persons were dragged
out, more dead than alive, over the heads of others so
densely packed that they could not move; but I never failed to
secure a front seat.</p>
          <p>I grew well acquainted—that is, by sight—with the party
leaders, and recall, among others, Seward and Douglas and
Breckenridge, Davis and Toombs and Benjamin, in the Senate;
Sherman and Stevens, Logan and Vallandigham, Pryor and
Keitt, Bocock and Barksdale, and Smith, of Virginia, in the
House. It became intensely interesting to me to observe the
part some of these men played later in the great drama:
Seward as the leading figure of Lincoln's Cabinet; Davis as
President of the Southern Confederacy; Benjamin, Toombs,
and Breckenridge as members of his Cabinet, the two latter
also as generals whom I have more than once seen
commanding troops in battle; “Black Jack” Logan,—hottest of
all the hotspurs of the extreme Southern wing of the
Democratic party in the House in 1860,—we all know where
he was from '61 to '65; and glorious old “Extra Billy” Smith,
soldier and governor by turns; Barksdale, who fell at
Gettysburg, was my general, commanding the infantry brigade
I knew and loved best of all in Lee's army and which often
supported our guns; and poor Keitt! I saw him fall at Cold
Harbor in '64 and helped to rally his shattered command.</p>
          <p>The Republican party had nominated John Sherman for
Speaker, and he was resisted largely upon the ground of his
endorsement of Hinton Rowan Helper's book, which was
understood as inciting the negro slaves of the South to
insurrection, fire, and blood. The John Brown raid had
occurred recently, and Col. Robert E. Lee had led the party of
United States Marines which captured the raiders and their
leader. They had just been convicted and executed as
murderers. The excitement was frightful and ominous, and
scenes of the wildest disorder occurred in the House. One of
these was in every way so remarkable that I ask leave to
describe it somewhat fully.</p>
          <p>The Republican leaders had become convinced they could
not elect Sherman, and about the same time the Democrats,
<pb id="stiles27" n="27"/>
seeing there was no possibility of electing their original
candidate, Thomas S. Bocock, of Virginia, had put up William
N. H. Smith, of North Carolina, an old line Whig, or Southern
American, and it seemed certain they would elect him. Indeed,
he was elected and his election telegraphed all over the land;
but before the result of the ballot could be announced, Henry
Winter Davis, of Maryland, and E. Joy Morris, of
Pennsylvania, as I recollect, Northern Americans or
Republicans, who had voted for Smith, changed their votes and
everything was again at sea. It was then openly proposed to
withdraw Sherman; and John Hickman, of Pennsylvania, who
had been elected as an anti-Lecompton Democrat, but had
gone over to the Republicans, took the floor to resist what he
characterized as cowardice and treachery. Hickman had not
voted for Sherman until the crisis was reached, but had been
openly charged, on the floor of the House, with secretly
desiring and plotting to elect him. Pryor and Keitt and other
hotheaded Southerners had attacked Hickman fiercely, and
leading Northern Democrats had upbraided him for his
desertion. Under these taunts and thrusts he had become the
bitterest man upon the floor.</p>
          <p>In the gloom which seemed to overshadow the House,
Hickman, as he rose, looked pale, repellent, ghastly, almost
ghostly. Repeatedly during his harangue, which was really one
of great power, he walked from his seat in the back part of the
House, down the narrow aisle toward the Clerk's desk, his
right arm lifted high above his head, his fist clinched and his
whole frame trembling with passion, and as he reached the
open space in front of the desk he would shriek out the climax
of a paragraph, simultaneously smashing his fist wildly down
upon a table that stood there.</p>
          <p>The speech produced a profound, almost awful, impression. I
remember the peroration as if it were yesterday, as he
shouted, on his last stride down the aisle, glaring around upon
his Republican associates: “I know not and I care not what
others may do, but as for me and my house, we intend to vote
for John Sherman—until Gabriel's last trump, the crack of
doom, and the day of judgment.”</p>
          <pb id="stiles28" n="28"/>
          <p>In spite of this powerful protest, as soon as the dilatory
tactics of the opposition were exhausted and the ballot was
called, it became evident that Sherman had been withdrawn;
indeed he withdrew his own name, and Pennington, of New
Jersey, a moderate Republican, and personally an
unobjectionable man, was put up in his place. There was
nothing that could now be done; this call of the roll would end it
all.</p>
          <p>The Democrats went wild and every moment wilder, as the
Republicans—even John Sherman's most devoted friends as
their names were called—one after another fell into line and
voted, full-voiced, for “Pennington.” That is, all the Democrats
went wild except Vallandigham, of Ohio. He sat coolly in his
seat, while Barksdale, Keitt, Houston, Logan, and the rest
surged around him. When they appealed to him, with excited
gesticulations, he simply brushed them aside and kept his eyes
fixed on a particular spot on the Republican side. As
Hickman's name was called and he rose and voted for
Pennington, Vallandigham sprang to his feet and, stretching out
his right arm toward the Clerk's desk, in a long, resonant drawl
that would not be drowned, he shouted: “Mr. Clerk, I move that
this House do now adjourn!”</p>
          <p>Cries from the Republican side: “Sit down! Sit down!
Order! Order! You can't interrupt the ballot! Sit down!”</p>
          <p>But Vallandigham went right on. He would not sit down, and
he would interrupt the ballot—and he <hi rend="italics">did.</hi></p>
          <p>“Mr. Clerk, I move that this House do now adjourn;
especially, sir”—both arms now extended, mouth wide open,
eyes wide staring—“especially, sir, since we have just had
Gabriel's last trump, the crack of doom and the day of
judgment!”</p>
          <p>I question if anything like it ever occurred in the history of
legislative bodies; or if any speech or stroke of daring
leadership ever produced such an effect. A yell went up from
the entire House—Democrats and Republicans joining in it.
There was a wild burst and bolt, of perhaps half the delegates,
out of the chamber, and then a rush of the rest for
Vallandigham.</p>
          <pb id="stiles29" n="29"/>
          <p>I remember that old Houston, of Alabama, who weighed
about a ton, ran up, puffing like a porpoise, and threw his
immense bulk into Vallandigham's arms, rolling him upon the
floor. Poor Barksdale lost his wig in the scrimmage. In a
twinkling the hero of the moment was lifted high upon the
shoulders of his party friends, who marched triumphantly all
over the House, bearing him aloft and almost waving him like a
banner.</p>
          <p>By this flash of lightning out of the heavens, as it were, the
Democrats gained another day, though they did not win the
fight.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1">*</ref></p>
          <p>I cannot forbear another anecdote of this remarkable man;
for while not an eye and ear witness to it as to that just related,
the utterance attributed to him bears so unmistakably the
impress of his vigorous, incisive intellect and his power of
crushing sarcasm, that I am almost willing to vouch for the
truth of the recital.</p>
          <p>As the story goes, some time during the first half of the war
Mr. Thaddeus Stevens, or some other equally single-hearted
patriot, alarmed at the rapid depreciation of the currency,
offered in the House a measure providing in substance that
gold should not be sold at a premium; when from
<note id="note1" n="1" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1">*It is proper to say that the Congressional <hi rend="italics">Globe</hi> makes no mention of this
remarkable episode—that is, of the startling culmination of it—though
the facts and circumstances leading up to this culmination are there set out
substantially as above related. The proceedings of the House, as recorded in the
<hi rend="italics">Globe</hi> at and about the date, are orderly and consecutive and the adjournments
regular. The record, however, does show an adjournment over a day, and it may
well be that the unparalleled occurrence above described took place upon that
day. Those familiar with Congressional proceedings are aware of the usage or
rule preventing any trace upon the record of an irregular or illegal session or
adjournment of the House; e. g. the House has occasionally met for business on
Sunday and even remained in session all that day, but the entire Sunday session
—with everything transacted thereat—is entered as of the preceding day.
Therefore, while not assured precisely how the thing was done in this instance,
it is not unlikely that the irregular, illegal and abortive proceedings above
described took place upon the day covered by the adjournment, and that the
entry of the adjournment over that day was an after-thought.</note>
<pb id="stiles30" n="30"/>
the back benches, where the little Democratic contingent was
then wont to abide, Vallandigham arose and drawled out: “Mr.
Speaker! I move you, sir, the following amendment to the bill:
‘Provided that, during the pendency of this act, the laws of
nature and of finance and of common sense be, and they
are, hereby suspended.’ ”</p>
          <p>I do not know whether any biography of Vallandigham has
been published, but one should be. We realize, of course, that
his attitude, actions, and utterances during the war must have
been as offensive and irritating to the bulk of the people of the
Northern States as they were refreshing and delightful to us of
the South; but we believe the time has come when men of all
parties would be able to appreciate his tremendous vitality, his
unconquerable courage, his unquenchable brilliance.</p>
          <p>And, by the way, his death, as the circumstances were
narrated at the time in the public press, was even more
marvelous and startling than any incident of his checkered life.
As I recall the facts, some years after the close of the war he
was senior counsel for the defense in a murder trial which
excited great popular interest. There had been a collision
between the supposed murderer and his victim, at the close of
which the latter had fallen mortally wounded by a pistol shot.</p>
          <p>Vallandigham's theory was that he had been killed by the
accidental discharge of his own weapon, and during an
intermission in the trial, taking up a pistol, he proceeded to
illustrate to his associate counsel just how the thing might have
occurred, when, shocking to relate, it did so occur again—the
pistol was accidentally discharged into his own person and
Vallandigham fell dead.</p>
          <p>At the close of the prolonged fight over the Speakership I
left Washington and ran down to Richmond, with a view of
“spying out the land” as a place in which to try my fortune
when I should have acquired my profession. My father had
been pastor of a church in that city for four years during, my
childhood, and had been much beloved by his people, who
received me with more than old Virginia hospitality. I was
charmed with everything I saw and every one I met,
<pb id="stiles31" n="31"/>
except that I was shocked and saddened by meeting
everywhere young men of my own age in military uniform.
They had not long since returned from the camp at
Charlestown and the execution of John Brown, and it chilled
me to see that they regarded themselves, as they proved
indeed to be, the advance guard of the great army which
would soon be embattled in defence of the South. I loved the
Union passionately, and while I had seen a great deal at
Washington that made me tremble for it, yet I had not there
seen men armed and uniformed as actual soldiers in the war
of disunion.</p>
          <p>It was not a little singular that most of these young men
—that is to say, those whom for the most part I met in a social
way—belonged to the Richmond Howitzers, the very corps
which, without choice on my part, I joined in 1861, and with
which I served during the greater part of the war.</p>
          <p>State conventions, both of the Whig and Democratic parties,
sat in Richmond during my visit and discussed, of course,
mainly the one absorbing issue. I was an eager observer of the
proceedings and much impressed with the high average of
intelligence and speaking power in both bodies. This seemed
especially true of the Whig Convention—perhaps because I
was so much in sympathy with that party in deprecating the
disruption of the Union. I confess, however, the question has
since been often pressed home upon me whether, after all, the
Democrats of Virginia did not, in this great crisis, exhibit a
higher degree of prescient statesmanship.</p>
          <p>Among the Whig leaders I distinctly recall William Ballard
Preston, A. H. H. Stuart, Thomas Stanhope Flournoy, and
John Minor Botts. I do not remember whether John B. Baldwin
was a member of this convention of 1860. If so, I did
not happen to hear him speak. Mr. Preston, Mr. Stuart, and
Mr. Flournoy, as well as Mr. Baldwin, were, later, members of
the Secession Convention of Virginia, but all were Union men
up to President Lincoln's call for troops. Mr. Preston and Mr.
Stuart were not only finished orators, but statesmen of ability
and experience. Both had graced the Legislature of their State
and the Congress of the United
<pb id="stiles32" n="32"/>
States, and both had been members of the Federal Cabinet
—Mr. Preston during General Taylor's and Mr. Stuart during
Mr. Fillmore's administration. Mr. Preston was afterwards a
member of the Confederate Senate and Mr. Stuart one of the
commissioners appointed by Virginia to confer with Mr.
Lincoln as to his attitude and action toward the seceded States.</p>
          <p>Mr. Botts made a very powerful address before the
convention, but the spirit of it did not please me. He belittled
the John Brown raid, at the same time accusing Governor Wise
of having done everything in his power to magnify it. He
ridiculed the Governor's military establishment and his “men in
buckram,” while dubbing him “The un-epauletted hero of the
Ossawattomie war.” He said that old John Brown certainly did
a good deal against the peace and prosperity of the
commonwealth and the country, but added, “Whatever he left
undone in this direction has been most effectually carried out
by his executor, the late Governor of Virginia.”</p>

          <head>FROM NEW YORK TO RICHMOND</head>
          <argument>
            <p>Quieting Down to the Study of Law in New York—Progress of the Revolution
—Virginia's Attempted Mediation—Firing on Sumter—Back to New Haven—a Remarkable Man and a Strange, Sad Story—Off for Dixie—In Richmond Again.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>At the close of this, my first visit South, I turned Northward,
filled with admiration and affection for the Southern people
and feeling that I had found my future home. Notwithstanding
the dark shadow that impended, I little fancied that I would so
soon again see the fair city of my choice and under
circumstances changed so sadly. I was young, and as I turned
my back upon Virginia and the John Brown raid, which were
then the points of greatest tension, my strained nerves relaxed,
and what I had seen and heard of evil portent faded away like
a disturbing dream when one awakes.</p>
          <p>I found my dear ones well and the practical New
Englanders, at least most of them, deeply immersed in
business and finance. Like many wiser men, I felt reassured
by the comforting conviction that the material interests of this
rapidly developing country were too vast, too solid and
priceless to be shattered and sacrificed in these superficial
popular excitements.</p>
          <p>In the quiet of the family circle we discussed my plans and
determined that I should enter the Law School of Columbia
College in the approaching fall. I do not remember where I
went or what I did during the summer vacation, but in the
early autumn I came back thoroughly quieted, rested and
refreshed, went promptly to New York City and entered with
enthusiasm upon the study of my chosen profession under that
admirable teacher, Professor Theodore W. Dwight, of Columbia.</p>
          <pb id="stiles34" n="34"/>
          <p>For a time all went well. True, the ground swell of a mighty
revolution was gradually rising at the South, but no one
about me believed it would ever break in the angry waves of
actual war, and I was not wiser than my fellows. Indeed I
purposely turned my thoughts away, which for the time was
not difficult to do, enamored as I was of the law.</p>
          <p>Three or four of us, Yale graduates and classmates, were in
the same boarding-house on Washington Square. Ed
Carrington, a youth of uncommon power and promise, who lost
his life during the war in an obscure skirmish in Florida, like
myself, was studying law, but he roomed with Joe Twichell,
who was then studying theology; dear Joe, who preached the
bi-centennial sermon at Yale, and is to-day, as he has always
been, the most admired and best beloved man of the class of
'59. My room-mate was Tom Lounsbury, then employed in
literary work on one of the great encyclopedias, to-day the
distinguished incumbent of the Chair of English in Yale
University.</p>
          <p>But this peace was not to last long. The election of Lincoln,
the rapid secession of the Southern States, the formation of the
Southern Confederacy, the inauguration of the Presidents, first
of the new and then of the old federation; the adoption by the
seceded States of a different and a permanent
Constitution—all this tended strongly to convince thoughtful
men that the two sections, or the two countries, were deeply in
earnest and differed radically and irreconcilably as to the
construction of the United States Constitution. Then came the
strained situation in Charleston harbor, and the futile efforts of
the Peace Congress called by Virginia, and later, of her
commissioners and those appointed by the Confederate
Government to wait upon President Lincoln.</p>
          <p>It is unnecessary to say that, though striving hard to maintain
my hold upon the law, I was yet far from an indifferent
spectator of this majestic march of events. I went repeatedly
to talk with two or three of the leading business men of New
York, who had been friends and parishioners of my father
while pastor of a church in that
<pb id="stiles35" n="35"/>
city, and was delighted to find them hopeful; relying not only
upon the weight and influence of material and business
interests to avert actual war, but also, and especially, upon the
noble intervention and mediation of Virginia.</p>
          <p>It made my heart glow to hear how these great financiers
and merchant princes spoke of my adopted State. They said in
effect, that it had always been so; that Virginia was
undoubtedly the greatest and most influential of all the States;
that she had been the nursing mother of the Union and of the
country and would prove their preserver; that Virginians had
really made the United States in the olden days,—Washington,
Jefferson, Madison, Marshall,—and Virginians would save the
United States to-day. They declared that they had always
worshiped the Old Dominion, and now, more than ever, for the
noble position she had assumed in this crisis.</p>
          <p>How could I help glowing with pride and brightening with
hope! Alas! the shriek of the first shell that burst over Sumter
shattered these fair hopes—and pandemonium reigned in
New York.</p>
          <p>It is not within the province of this book to discuss the
responsibility for that shell. I will, however, be candid enough
to say that I never entertained a doubt as to the South having
the best of the Constitutional argument; and yet, so strong was
my love for the Union and my affection for my friends, at least
nine-tenths of whom were on the Northern side, that I often
felt, and more than once said, I could never strike a blow or
fire a shot in the conflict, if it should come. Nevertheless, I
was inexorably led in the sequel to give myself unreservedly
and whole-heartedly to the defense of the South.</p>
          <p>One link in the chain that led to this decision was the
conviction that forced itself upon me that I could not remain in
New York. After the firing upon Sumter the whole city was in
an uproar. A wild enthusiasm for “the flag” seized and swept
the entire population, which surged through streets hung with
banners and bunting, their own persons bedecked with small
United States flags and other patriotic devices. It is not worth
while to go further into these details.
<pb id="stiles36" n="36"/>
Enough to say that it was manifestly as uncomfortable
and impracticable, at that time, for me to remain in New York
as for an able-bodied young man, of strong convictions on the
Northern side of the controversy, to remain in Richmond.</p>
          <p>Therefore I returned to New Haven, where, with the entire
family assembled, we conferred over the situation and decided
that father and his three boys must go South as soon as
possible, leaving mother and the girls to follow when the way
should be clear and we ready to receive them. As there was
no assurance of reaching our destination in safety without
passports, father, who knew General Scott well, applied to him
for passes South for himself and his three boys. The General
replied, sending my father a pass, but refusing to furnish
passports for his sons, and it then became necessary for us
boys to devise some route, other than the railroads, for
reaching our Southern friends.</p>
          <p>My next younger brother was an expert sailor, having
followed the sea for years, and was recognized as perhaps the
most daring and skilful manager of a small sailing craft to be
found about New Haven harbor, or indeed anywhere in that
part of Long Island Sound. As there seemed to be no other
way to Virginia open to us, we bought a staunch, swift sail-boat,
had her carefully caulked and overhauled, and set to work
to make her some extra sails which my brother thought we
might need during our voyage. We procured a copy of a
detailed survey of the coast along that part of the Eastern
Shore of Virginia where we proposed to land, and also letters
to gentlemen living along that coast. The preparation of the
boat and the working up of our expedition was a great relief,
not only in giving us something to do, but also in holding out the
prospect of interesting adventure accompanied by a reasonable
spice of peril.</p>
          <p>About this time I discovered, in taking a sort of spiritual
inventory of myself, that I had passed to another and distinct
stage of feeling and of purpose. I believed firmly my people in
the South were right; I knew well they were weak; I saw
clearly they were about to be invaded; and I was striving to get
to them. To what end? With what purpose? To
<pb id="stiles37" n="37"/>
give them another mouth to feed, or to give them another man
to fight? Right, weakness, invasion!—how could there be any
save one inference from such a trinity of propositions? I did
not fully realize this process as it was wrought out in me; but
when I came to find my scruples and my shrinking gone— 
though not my sorrow—I looked back and plainly saw the
path along which I had been led. From that hour, throughout
the four years of my service as a Confederate soldier, never
did I entertain a doubt as to my being where I should be and
doing what I should do.</p>
          <p>While our boat was making ready for the trip, some one
called at the house and asked for me, but sent no card, so I
went to the reception-room, having no idea who my visitor
was.</p>
          <p>“Why, Beers!” I cried, “what are you doing here?” He was
very pale, and had evidently been subjected to severe mental
and moral tension—nevertheless, Yankee-like, he answered
my question by asking another, “What are you going to do?”
“Oh,” said I, “we are going South by sail-boat; General Scott
won't let us go by railroad.” Instantly he replied, “I am going
with you.”</p>
          <p>Who was the man who thus, without hesitation, reservation
or condition, cast in his lot with us?</p>
          <p>The story is in every way so remarkable that I cannot
forbear a full recital of it. It should not be forgotten, however,
that while the peace of death has, years agone, passed upon
the chief actor in this strange, sad drama, and probably also
upon most of his relatives living when he died—there may yet be
others now living to whom the record of his
life and death must needs be somewhat painful; therefore I
shall endeavor to tell the story simply and quietly.</p>
          <p>When I first knew James H. Beers he was an intelligent
young mechanic—originally, I think, from Bridgeport, Conn.,
but at the time living in New Haven, where I was a college student.
We were both members of a Bible-class
connected with a church of which my father was then pastor,
and Mr. Gerard Hallock, of the New York <hi rend="italics">Journal of
Commerce</hi>, the most prominent member.</p>
          <pb id="stiles38" n="38"/>
          <p>Soon after my first acquaintance with Beers, Mr. Hallock became
interested in him, attracted by his regular attendance at church and
Bible-class, and his modest yet self-respectful and intelligent bearing,
and he
took him to New York in some subordinate capacity connected with his paper.
This was a few years before the war, but Beers continued to visit New Haven
often, perhaps regularly. We heard from time to time that he had exhibited
unusual facility for journalism and had been rapidly advanced, until he
had come
to be an assistant to the night editor of Mr. Hallock's great paper.
It was probably through his connection with the leading Democratic daily that
he imbibed the views he held as to the construction of the Federal
Constitution
and the relations between the Federal Government and the States; views
which he
followed to their logical conclusion and in defense of which he
ultimately laid
down his life.</p>
          <p>As the sectional excitement increased and civil war became more and more
imminent, Beers grew more and more restless and unhappy, until actual
hostilities began with the bombardment of Sumter, when he informed
Mr. Hallock that it would be impossible for him to continue to discharge
his duties upon the paper. Thereupon he left New York and appeared in New
Haven, 
as above described.</p>
          <p>When he announced his determination of going with us I discouraged it,
reminding him that he was a Northern man and had, besides, a wife and two
little
girls to provide for; mentioning also his fine position and prospects,
all of which would necessarily be sacrificed. He replied that he had
some money which he would leave with my mother, trusting her to use it
for his wife and children and to bring them South when she came; adding that
God never gave a man a wife and children to stand in the way of the discharge
of his plain duty, and that it was plainly his duty to go with us and aid the
South in defense of her clear and clearly-violated rights.</p>
          <p>I cut the matter short by referring him to my father, and he at once went
to his room and saw him. Father afterwards told me it was obvious that Mr.
Beers' mind was irrevocably made up and that it would be worse than useless
to
<pb id="stiles39" n="39"/>
resist him further; so it was settled that he was to go with us.
I do not remember whether his wife and children were then in New
Haven, but they were committed by him to the care of our mother and
sisters, and later followed Beers to Virginia, as I now recollect, in company
with the ladies of our family.</p>
          <p>Everything was arranged and we were to embark and sail on a certain night,
but during the preceding day a telegram was received from a friend who was
standing guard for us in Washington, which by a sort of prearranged cipher
we understood to mean that we could slip through safely if we left New York
by a certain train the next day.  My recollection is that it was deemed best to
divide the party—Beers, my next younger brother and I getting off
so as to
catch the train indicated; father and my youngest brother, then below fighting
age, following later.</p>
          <p>We reached Washington and got safely across the river and to our
destination,
but, by some untoward accident, Beers was left behind and experienced some
difficulty in dodging the provost guard and completing the last stage of his
“on to Richmond.” We were very uneasy, met every train from
the North, and
were unspeakably relieved when he arrived. We had told his story to our friends
and he was welcomed into the same hospitable family circle which was
entertaining us. The city was crowded with people, but the sons of Virginia
were flocking home to her defense and every heart and every door was open to
receive them.</p>
          <p>A day of two after his arrival a most unpleasant experience befell poor Beers.
Walking by himself in the street, he was arrested as a spy and locked up in the
negro jail. For hours we were unable to ascertain what had become of him,
and when we did find out it was too late to procure his release on <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">habeas
corpus</foreign></hi>; so with profound mortification and profuse apologies we had to 
content ourselves with doing what we could to make him comfortable where
he was, he protesting that he needed nothing and could suffer no real
inconvenience that one night. Indeed, noble fellow that he was, he met me
with a manly smile at the door of his cell, expressing mingled amusement and
approbation; saying that
<pb id="stiles40" n="40"/>
while the charge of his being a spy was a little wide of the
mark, yet the mistake was a very natural one, that there were
doubtless numbers of such characters about, and he was glad
to see that we were on the alert for them.</p>
          <p>Next morning, when his case was called in the Mayor's
Court, something of the truth with regard to him had gotten
abroad and the court-room was crowded with the first
gentlemen of Richmond. I was the main witness, and it goes
without saying that the dramatic points of Beers' strange story,
especially those that would most commend him to the Southern
people, lost nothing in the telling. He was not only honorably
discharged, but he was vociferously cheered by the entire
audience, and he walked out of the court-room the idol of the
hour—the rest of the last rebel reinforcement from the North
shining somewhat in his reflected light. Thus, to our great relief,
the awkward contretemps of his arrest contributed rather to
the reputation and advantage of our friend.</p>
          <p>I recall this additional incident: Mr. John Randolph
Tucker—“Ran. Tucker”—then Attorney-General of Virginia,
was an intimate friend of my father, who had now arrived in
Richmond, and suggested to him that Mr. Beers and I, as we
were citizens of the State of Connecticut—where I had
recently cast my first vote—were in rather an exceptional
position, as bearing upon a possible charge of treason, in case
we should enlist in the military service. The suggestion was
deemed of sufficient importance to refer to Mr. Benjamin, then
Attorney-General of the Confederate States, and Mr. Tucker
and I interviewed him about it. These two great lawyers
concurred in the view that the principles which protected
citizens of the Southern and seceded States were, to say the
least, of doubtful application to us, and that it would probably go
rather hard with us if we should be captured. Notwithstanding,
I enlisted, and Beers would probably have done so with equal
promptness had he not been an expert mechanic—men so
qualified being then very scarce in Richmond and very much
needed. He was asked to assist in changing some old flintlocks
belonging to the State of Virginia into percussion muskets, and
all of us insisting that he
<pb id="stiles41" n="41"/>
could thus render far more valuable service than by enlisting in
the ranks, he reluctantly yielded and went to work.</p>
          <p>How long he was thus employed I do not know. My
youngest brother went on to our relatives in Georgia, but soon
after his arrival there insisted upon enlisting in one of the
battalions for coast defense. My sailor brother and I enlisted in
Richmond and joined the army at Manassas. I saw but little of
Beers after this. Just when he entered the army I cannot say,
but it must have been some time before the battles around
Richmond in the early summer of 1862; for on the battle field of
Malvern Hill I met some of the men of the “Letcher Artillery,”
to which he belonged, who told me that my “Yankee” was the
finest gunner in the battery and fought like a Turk. Between
Malvern Hill and Chancellorsville I saw Beers perhaps two or
three times—I think once in Richmond, after his wife and
children and my mother and sisters arrived from the North.</p>
          <p>I have seldom seen a better-looking soldier. He was about
five feet eleven inches in height, had fine shoulders, chest and
limbs, carried his head high, had clustering brown hair,
a steel-gray eye and a splendid sweeping moustache. Every now and
then I heard from some man or officer of his battery, or of
Pegram's Battalion, some special praise of his gallantry in
action, but as he was in A. P. Hill's command and I then in
Longstreet's, we seldom met. I am confident there is no
battle-scarred veteran of Pegram's Battalion living to-day but stands
ready to vouch for Beers as the equal of any soldier in the
command, and some of them tenderly recall him as a good and
true soldier of Jesus Christ as well as of Robert Lee. He was
in the habit of holding religious services with the men of his
battalion on every fitting occasion—services which they
highly appreciated.</p>
          <p>Just after the battle of Chancellorsville I was in Richmond,
having recently received an appointment in “engineer troops.”
I
am unable to recall the details, but I was notified to meet poor
Beers' body at the train. Colonel, afterwards General, R. L.
Walker (Lindsay Walker), commanding A. P. Hill's artillery,
hearing that Beers had been killed on the 3d of May and
buried upon the field, had the body exhumed and sent to me at
Richmond.</p>
          <pb id="stiles42" n="42"/>
          <p>It is strange how everything connected with the burial,
except the sad scene at the grave, seems to have faded out of
my recollection. I know he was buried in our family lot in
Hollywood, and as no one of us was buried there for long years
after this, we must have bought the lot for the purpose. I
remember, too, that we laid him to rest with military honors,
Captain Gay's company, the “Virginia State Guard,” acting as
escort; and I must have ridden in the carriage with the stricken
widow and his two little girls, for I distinctly recall standing
between the children at the side of the open grave and holding
a hand of each as the body of their hero-father was lowered to
its last resting place. I remember, too, that not a muscle of their
pale, sweet faces quivered as the three volleys were fired over
the low mound that covered him. They were the daughters of a
soldier.</p>
          <p>There stands to-day over the grave a simple granite marker
bearing this inscription:
<q direct="unspecified">JAMES H. BEERS,<lb/>
of Connecticut,<lb/>
Who Fell at Chancellorsville,<lb/>
Fighting for Virginia and the South,<lb/>
May 3, 1863.</q>
</p>
          <p>My story is done, and I feel that it is worthy of recital and
remembrance. Indeed it embodies the most impressive
instance I have ever known of trenchant, independent thought
and uncalculating, unflinching obedience to the resulting
conviction of duty—“obedience unto death.”</p>
          <p>Observe, Beers had never been South and had no idea of
ever going there until the Southern States were invaded.
Observe again, he was not a man without ties, a homeless and
heartless adventurer; but a complete man—a man blessed
with wife and children and home, and withal a faithful and
affectionate husband and father. Observe once more, he was
not an unsuccessful or disappointed man. On the contrary, I
have seldom known a man who had a position more perfectly
congenial and satisfactory to him or whose prospects were
brighter or more assured. It was simply and purely his
conviction of right and of duty which led him to us and to his
brave death.</p>
          <pb id="stiles43" n="43"/>
          <p>One feature of the poor fellow's story, of intense color, has
been purposely omitted. I refer to his parting with his parents.
It is my strong desire that this sketch shall not contain one
word calculated to bring unnecessary pain to the heart of any
relative of my dear friend under whose eye it may chance to
fall. If being a Southerner you would pass just and charitable
judgment upon his family, try for a moment to conceive what
would have been the feelings of a Southern father and mother
and family circle toward a son and brother who, in 1861 had
proposed to go North for the purpose of fighting against his
people and his State.</p>
          <p>My recollection is that Mrs. Beers did not long survive her
husband. It gives me pleasure to say that, so far as I know, the
family of Mr. Beers did their duty by his children. I tried to
have the little girls adopted in the South, and came very near
succeeding, yet perhaps it was, after all, well that their friends
sent for them and that they finally returned to the North.</p>
          <p>It is well, too, that there are not more men like Beers in the
world. The bands of organized society are not strong enough
to endure many such. They are too trenchant, too independent,
to be normal or safe. It is well that most of us believe and
think and feel and act with the mass of our fellow-beings
about us. If it were not so, quiet and harmonious society would
be impossible; it would dissolve and perish in fierce internecine
strife. And yet, when every now and then God turns out a man
of different mould, a man brave enough and strong enough not
to be dominated in opinion, in conscience, or in action by his
associates—we ordinary men, of average human stature and
strength, realize how almost pitifully small and weak we are.</p>
          <p>The mound that covers James H. Beers is indeed low and
humble, yet where will you dig in earth's surface to find richer
dust? I rejoice that he lies where he does, hard by my dear
ones and where my own body will soon rest, so that when the
resurrection trump shall call us all forth, after running over the
roll of my beloved and finding them “all present or accounted
for,” I can turn my eyes to the right and greet the hero whose
sacred dust I have guarded all these years.</p>

Richmond Howitzers—Intellectual Atmosphere of the Camp—Essential
Spirit of the Southern Volunteer.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>The exact dates of the personal movements and
experiences thus far narrated cannot be determined. This is
largely due to a habit of destroying family letters, and this to a
weak dread of opening them, or even of looking upon them,
after the lapse of years.</p>
          <p>Up to this point the lack of such letters has signified little. It
can make little difference just when I left New York for New
Haven, or when we left New Haven for Richmond, or
Richmond for Manassas. This book is not intended to be a rigid
record of the daily succession and the precise dates of camp
and march and battle; and yet there is no gainsaying the almost
inestimable value of letters to a book of reminiscence,
furnishing contemporaneous record and comment so much
more vivid and accurate than memory. In the absence of these
I shall have to rest largely, for the elements of time and date,
upon the relation of what I may record to the general
movement of the campaigns, which will, for the most part,
prove sufficient for my purpose. For example, I know that
Beers' funeral was just after the battle of Chancellorsville, May
3, 1863; that we arrived in Richmond a short time before the
battle of Bethel, June 10, 1861; that we left Richmond almost
immediately after the battle of Manassas, July 21, 1861.</p>
          <p>It was not our fault that we did not leave earlier. My brother
and I had volunteered in an infantry company called, after a
favorite corps which had left the city for the front, “Junior
Company F,” which was being drilled in awkward
<pb id="stiles45" n="45"/>
squads in a large basement room under the Spotswood Hotel.
We felt that the Juniors were hanging fire too long. The city
was crowded with troops from all over Virginia and the South,
pressing to the front, and with swarms of gaily-dressed staff
officers and military attachés and hangers-on, and we longed
to be away, out of this martial show, and off to the real front.
We grew daily more restless, especially after the affair at
Bethel—sometimes spoken of as “Big Bethel,” “Great
Bethel,” or “Bethel Church.” The main armies were facing
each other in central Virginia, and as day after day and week
after week passed, we began to feel that it would be a
personal reflection upon us if another fight should occur
without our being in it.</p>
          <p>Suddenly the great battles of Manassas shocked the city
and shook the continent, and we could stand it no longer. As I
remember, it was but a day or two after the main fight of July
21 that my brother and I met two soldiers of the First
Company, Richmond Howitzers, who were in the city on
business for the company, and were to return next day. So
without saying “by your leave” to any one, we boarded the
cars next morning with these men. They undertook to conceal
us on the train till it started and to secure our enrollment in the
company when we arrived—undertakings skilfully and
faithfully performed.</p>
          <p>The ride to Manassas was certainly not a reassuring
experience. The train was crowded almost to suffocation with
troops from a far Southern State. They had been long on the
way and were worn with travel in the heat of summer. Some
of the men were sleepy and sprawling, others restless and
noisy, and both men and cars were very dirty. It was a tedious
trip, but it ended at last, and we were glad to make our
escape. As we stepped from the train we were met by two or
three more of the Howitzers, to one of whom was committed
the duty of piloting us to the camp of the battery.</p>
          <p>We were very much struck with our guide. Scarcely more
than a half-formed country lad, he was yet a fellow of
genuine, transparent nature, healthy and hearty and strong in
body and mind; one of the sturdiest, manliest figures and
<pb id="stiles46" n="46"/>
faces I ever looked upon. He seemed to be exceptionally right-minded,
broad-minded, and intelligent, was evidently glad to
see us and “to tell us all about it”—the army and the battle and
the service, as he saw them—and we heard much from him
during our brief walk of just what we wanted to know.</p>
          <p>Such he was then. For the next four years he was the equal
of any soldier in that incomparable army. To-day, thank God!
he still lives, is perhaps the best beloved and most trusted
friend I have on earth, one of the best citizens and farmers in
Virginia—a man whom everybody knows and trusts and
looks up to and leans upon.</p>
          <p>At last we were in “the army ;” and what was it after all?
We walked perhaps a mile or more through the camps, and the
prominent ideas borne in upon me were—multitude,
overloading, lack of cohesion and of organization, absence of
women and children, and a general sense of roughness and
untidiness, of discomfort and confusion. Of course these
impressions were soon to give way to others; but it was not
alone my impressions that changed, it was the army itself.
During the few months next ensuing it dispensed with useless
baggage and equipment, acquired cohesion, organization,
power and endurance, and men learned to do fairly well for
themselves what women had theretofore invariably done for
them. Under the discipline of the next twelve months,
imperfect as it was, we trained down and trained up, just as the
fighting men do, to a condition of bare, hard flesh; compact yet
supple muscles; clean, clear lungs; sound, strong hearts; and
perfect possession and control of all our fighting powers.</p>
          <p>In connection with this process of training down to fighting
weight, it occurs to me that the wagon train of the First
Company, Richmond Howitzers, during the first nine months of
the war was, I verily believe, quite as large as that of any
infantry brigade in the army during the grand campaign of '64.
Many of the private soldiers of the company had their trunks
with them, and I remember part of the contents of one of them
consisted of a dozen face and a smaller number of foot or bath
towels; and when the order came
<pb id="stiles47" n="47"/>
for trunks to be sent back to Richmond or abandoned, the
owner of this elaborate outfit, although but a “high private in
the rear rank,” actually wrote and sent in to the captain an
elegant note resigning his “position.” Yet this curled and
scented gentleman became a superb soldier and used to laugh
as heartily as any of us when, in after years, at some point of
unusual want and stringency and discomfort, some impudent
rascal would shout out, “Jim, old fellow, don't you think it's
about time for you to resign again?”</p>
          <p>As to the battle-field, if it showed marked traces of the
conflict that had taken place I do not recall them. One scene
and incident, however, I do recall, which made a very tender
impression upon me. Not long after our arrival the battery was
about to change its position, indeed I think the head of the
column was already in motion, when some one said to me,
“Captain ------ is lying in that house over yonder seriously, or it may
be mortally, wounded; don't you want to go and see him a
moment?” I did not want to go, but I knew the poor fellow's
sisters and felt as if I ought to go, and I went. Few interviews
have ever made deeper impression upon me. The heroic
Christian man had been a prominent member of the Richmond
bar and the mainstay and support of his sisters. He was now
lying seriously wounded, in a deserted house, from which, as I
remember, even the doors and windows had been carried off,
and in which there seemed to be little or no furniture save the
bed he occupied. The attendant who took care of him was not
at the moment in the building. My comrade and I entered and
I walked to the bedside, made myself known to the Captain
and told him that I had seen his sisters within a day or two and
that they were well, but very anxious about him. He did not
seem to be suffering greatly at the time, but was evidently
death-struck and I think fully aware of it. Yet there was no
shrinking and no tremor. His voice was firm and clear and he
was entirely self-possessed. I took his hand, or he took mine,
and my recollection is that my comrade
and I knelt by the bedside and we all prayed together for a
few moments, and then we left him there in that desolate
place to meet the last enemy; but I felt, and I am sure he did,
that he would not meet him alone.</p>
          <pb id="stiles48" n="48"/>
          <p>I had helped to take wounded men from the trains in
Richmond, but they were surrounded by relatives and friends,
or by admiring, almost worshiping crowds, and the entire city,
with all it contained of sympathy and help, was at their feet.
Here, however, was an entirely different picture, and for a long
time my mind every now and then reverted to it with a sadness
I could not dispel.</p>
          <p>The intellectual atmosphere of the Confederate camps was
far above what is generally supposed by the people of this
generation, even in the Southern States, and this intellectual
aspiration and vigor of the men were exhibited perhaps equally
in their religious meetings and services and in their dramatic
representations and other exhibitions gotten up to relieve the
tedium of camp. But however this may be in general it cannot
be denied that the case of the Richmond Howitzers was
exceptional in this regard. The corps was organized at the time
of the John Brown raid by George W. Randolph, afterwards
Secretary of War, and has never been disbanded. In 1861 it was
recruited up to three companies and formed into a battalion, but
unfortunately the first company was never associated with the
other two in the field. The composition of the three companies
was very similar; that is, all of them were made up largely of
young business men and clerks of the highest grade and best
character from the city of Richmond, but included also a
number of country boys, for the most part of excellent families,
with a very considerable infusion of college-bred men, for it
was strikingly true that in 1861 the flower of our educated youth
gravitated toward the artillery. The outcome was something
quite unparalleled, so far as I know. It is safe to say that not
less than one hundred men were commissioned from the corps
during the war, and these of every rank from a Secretary of
War down to a second lieutenant.</p>
          <p>Few things have ever impressed me as did the intellectual
and moral character of the men who composed the circle I
entered the day our guide led my brother and myself to the
Howitzer camp. I had lived for years at the North, had
graduated recently at Yale, and had but just entered
<pb id="stiles49" n="49"/>
upon the study of law in the city of New York when the war
began. Thus torn away by the inexorable demands of
conscience and of loyalty to the South, from a focal point of
intense intellectual life and purpose, one of my keenest regrets
was that I was bidding a long good-by to congenial
surroundings and companionships. To my surprise and delight,
around the camp fires of the First Company, Richmond
Howitzers, I found throbbing an intellectual life as high and
brilliant and intense as any I had ever known.</p>
          <p>The Howitzer Glee Club, trained and led by Frederick
Nicholls Crouch, author of “Kathleen Mavoureen,” was the
very best I ever heard, and rendered music at once scientific
and enjoyable. No law school in the land ever had more
brilliant or powerful moot court discussions than graced the
mock trials of the Howitzer Law Club. I have known the burial
of a tame crow to be witnessed not only by the entire
command, but by scores, perhaps hundreds, of intelligent
people from a neighboring town, and to be dignified not only by
salvos of artillery, but also by an English speech, a Latin
oration, and a Greek ode, which would have done honor to any
literary or memorial occasion at old Yale.</p>
          <p>There was a private soldier in the battery—not the poet of
the crow's death either—a Grecian of such finished skill that
I have known him keep, for months together, a diary of the
movements of the battery, in modern Greek; and have
watched him—wondering if there was anywhere to be found
another man of scholarship and scholarly enthusiasm so
great—as he dodged the persistently pursuing smoke of a camp fire
and by its wretched, flickering light, with painstaking care,
jotted down his exquisite, clear Greek lettering that looked like
the most perfect output of the most perfect Greek press in
Germany. So much for the intellectual life of our camp and
march.</p>
          <p>What now of the essential spirit of these young volunteers?
Why did they volunteer? For what did they give their lives?
We can never appreciate the story of their deeds as soldiers
until we answer this question correctly.</p>
          <p>Surely it was not for slavery they fought. The great majority
of them had never owned a slave and had little or
<pb id="stiles50" n="50"/>
no interest in the institution. My own father, for example, had
freed his slaves long years before; that is, all save one, who
would not be “emancipated,” our dear “Mammy,” who clung to
us when we moved to the North and never recognized any
change in her condition or her relations to us. The great conflict
will never be properly comprehended by the man who looks
upon it as a war for the preservation of slavery.</p>
          <p>Nor was it, so far as Virginia was concerned, a war in
support of the right of secession or the Southern interpretation
of the Constitution. Virginia did not favor this interpretation; at
least, she did not favor the exercise of the right of secession.
Up to President Lincoln's call for troops she refused to secede.
She changed her position under the distinct threat of <hi rend="italics">invasion</hi>—the demand that she help <hi rend="italics">coerce</hi> her sister States. This was
the turning point. The Whig party, the anti-secession party of
Virginia, became the war party of Virginia upon this issue. As
John B. Baldwin, the great Whig and Union leader, said,
speaking of the effect of Lincoln's call for troops, “We have no
Union men in Virginia now.” The change of front was
instantaneous, it was intuitive. Jubal Early was the type of his
party—up to the proclamation, the most extreme
anti-secessionist and anti-war man in the Virginia Convention;
after the proclamation, the most enthusiastic man in the
Commonwealth in advocacy of the war and personal service
in it.</p>
          <p>But, coming closer down, let us see how the logic of these
events wrought itself out among my comrades of the Howitzer
Company. We will take as a type in this instance the case of a
brilliantly endowed youth of excellent family in Richmond, who,
like the guide who piloted us to the battery upon the field of
Manassas, became one of my closest and dearest friends, but
unlike him and most unhappily for his family and his comrades,
sealed his fate and his devotion with his life at Gettysburg.</p>
          <p>He was a student at the University of Virginia in the spring
of '61, and perhaps the most extreme and uncompromising
“Union man” among all the young men gathered
<pb id="stiles51" n="51"/>
there. Indeed, so exaggerated were his anti-secession views
and so bold and aggressive was he in advocacy of them, that
he became very unpopular, and his friends feared serious
trouble and even bloody collision. The morning President
Lincoln's proclamation appeared he had gone down town on
personal business before breakfast, and while there happened
to glance at a paper. He returned at once to the University, but
not to breakfast; spoke not a word to any human being, packed
his trunk with his belongings, left a note for the chairman of the
faculty explaining his conduct, boarded the first train for
Richmond and joined a military company, before going to his
father's house or taking so much as a morsel of food.</p>
          <p>What was the overwhelming force which thus in a moment
transformed this splendid youth? Was it not the God-implanted
instinct which impels a man to <hi rend="italics">defend his own hearth-stone?</hi></p>
          <p>There were 896 students at Harvard in 1861, there were 604
at the University of Virginia. Why was it that but 73 out of the
896 joined the first army that invaded the South, while largely
over half of the 604 volunteered to meet the invaders? It was
manifestly this instinct of defense of home which gave to the
Confederate service, from '61 to '65, more than 2,000 men of
our University, of whom it buried in soldiers' graves more than
400; while but 1,040 Harvard men served in the armies and
navies of the United States during the four years of the war,
and of these only 155 lost their lives in the service.<ref targOrder="U" id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2">*</ref></p>
          <p>Here, then, we have the essential, the distinctive spirit of the
Southern volunteer. As he hastened to the front in the spring
of '61, he felt: “With me is Right, before me is Duty, <hi rend="italics">behind me
is Home.</hi>”</p>

          <head>FIELD ARTILLERY IN THE ARMY OF NORTHERN VIRGINIA</head>
          <argument>
            <p>Inadequacy of General Equipment—Formation During First Two Years— 
High Character of Men Accounted For—An Extraordinary Story.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>The writer having served almost exclusively with the
artillery, what he has to tell must necessarily refer largely to
that arm. Some general observations upon field artillery in the
Army of Northern Virginia will therefore not be out of place.</p>
          <p>With the exception of a couple of long-range Whitworth
guns, run in from England through the blockade and which I
never saw, the artillery of General Lee's army consisted of old-fashioned
muzzle-loading pieces, for the most part 12-pounder
brass Napoleons and 3-inch rifles. Batteries were usually
composed of four guns. For the equipment and operation of
such a battery about seventy-five officers and men were
required and say fifty horses. Every old artilleryman will recall
the difficulty we experienced in keeping up the supply of
horses. After Gettysburg it was our habit, when a piece
became engaged, to send the horses to the rear, to some place
of safety, preferring to run the risk of losing a gun occasionally
rather than the team that pulled it.</p>
          <p>During the earlier stages of the war our artillery corps was
very inadequately provided with clumsy ordnance and
defective ammunition, manufactured for the most part within
the Confederate lines; but, as the struggle went on, this branch
of our service, as well as our infantry, was, to a constantly
increasing degree, supplied with improved guns and
ammunition captured from the armies opposed to us. We also
learned to make better ammunition and more reliable fuses, but
never approached the Federal artillery either in these respects
or in general equipment.</p>
          <pb id="stiles53" n="53"/>
          <p>For the first two years the armies of the Confederacy
adhered to that very defective organization in which single
batteries of artillery are attached to infantry brigades. Two
evils resulted: the guns were under the command of brigadier-generals
of infantry, who generally had very little regard for
artillery and still less knowledge as to the proper handling of it;
and the scattering of the batteries prevented that concentration
of fire in which, upon proper occasion, consists the great
effectiveness of the arm. At and after Chancellorsville,
however, the artillery of the Confederate armies, certainly that
of the Army of Northern Virginia, began to be massed into
battalions composed of, say, four or five batteries and fifteen
to twenty-five guns, and these placed under the command of
trained and experienced artillery officers. From that time the
artillery began to be really reckoned and relied upon in
estimating the effective strength of the army.</p>
          <p>So much for the physical aspect of the artillery of General
Lee's army. A word now as to the character of the men who
composed that corps. It will of course be admitted by every
man of intelligence and candor who served under Lee, that his
infantry was essentially his army; not alone because it
constituted the bulk and body of its fighting strength, but also
because it did the bulk and body of the fighting; and yet I think
even the infantry itself would admit that the artillery, though
appearing to afford least opportunity for personal distinction,
yet furnished, in proportion to its numbers, perhaps more
officers below the rank of general who were conspicuous for
gallantry and high soldiership than either of the other two
arms. Their names rise unbidden to my lips—Pegram and
Pelham, and Breathed and Carter, and Haskell, and many,
many more. Every veteran of the Army of Northern Virginia
is familiar with the splendid roll.</p>
          <p>If this claim be challenged, it may perhaps best be tested by
asking this question: admitting that the fact be so, <hi rend="italics">can any
satisfactory explanation of it be suggested?</hi></p>
          <p>For one, I answer unhesitatingly—yes, I think so;
explanation amounting to demonstration. I believe that any
man
<pb id="stiles54" n="54"/>
who looks into the matter without prejudice will be ready to
admit that it is to be expected that artillery soldiers should excel
in four great soldierly qualities—<hi rend="italics">intelligence, self-possession,
comradeship, loyalty to the gun.</hi></p>
          <p>I will not stay now to prove that these qualities characterized
our artillery in an eminent degree. The remaining chapters of
this book will furnish abundant demonstration. As to
<hi rend="italics">intelligence</hi>, the chapter last preceding would seem to be
all-sufficient; but apart from these positive exhibitions of
intelligence and even culture of a high order, it is obvious that
the very nature of the arm and its operation, its comparative
mechanical elaboration and complexity, and the blending of
scientific knowledge and manual and bodily dexterity required
for its most effective use, must in large degree influence the
original selection and the after development of the men of the
artillery branch of the service.</p>
          <p>Again, an artilleryman, officer or private soldier, should be a
broader-gauged man, especially as to his view and
comprehension of battle and campaign, than an infantryman of
corresponding grade. An infantry company in the Army of
Northern Virginia, during the latter part of the war, averaged
certainly not over fifteen or twenty men, and covered but a
small space on the line. A captain of infantry saw and touched
little outside these narrow limits. Two or three strides, so to
speak, would cover all of the line he was familiar with and
responsible for, and he came in contact with no officer of
wider domain and control, save his colonel, under whose eye
and immediate direction he was always, save when on picket
duty.</p>
          <p>A captain of artillery, on the contrary, was often separated
from his colonel by the stretch of several brigade fronts; for a
battalion, as usually placed, would cover about the front of a
division, and as he received no orders—after the organization
of the artillery into battalions—from any infantry officer of less
rank than a major-general, he was necessarily thrown in great
measure upon his own resources in the management of a
command which, including all its departments, was really of
greater complexity and difficulty than an infantry brigade.</p>
          <pb id="stiles55" n="55"/>
          <p>I trust I may not be misunderstood, or regarded as
attempting to magnify over-much myself or my office, when I
say that all this applies with special force to the adjutant of an
artillery battalion. This officer,—if he does his full duty,—as
adjutant of the command, as personal staff and aide to the
commanding officer, and often as battalion chief of the line of
caissons—familiarizing himself with the positions of all the
guns in battle, seeing that all are fully supplied with ammunition
and anything and everything else that may be required, and
passing from one to another as the exigencies of the fight may
demand—covers as wide a stretch of the line, sees as much
of the campaign, and comes as much in contact with officers
of high grade as any officer of his rank in the service. To-day,
more than a generation after that heroic Olympiad, it is a deep
satisfaction to be able to say that I endeavored to do my full
duty as adjutant of Cabell's Battalion—to attend to all my
duties in this broader and fuller construction of them, and in
battle, as far as possible, to be with that one of our batteries
which was most heavily engaged. The campaign of 1864 was
the only one in which I acted as adjutant of an artillery battalion
from the outset to the end, and in consequence my knowledge
of that campaign is at once more comprehensive and more
detailed than of any other, and what I have to tell of it is of
greater value.</p>
          <p>The training of the artillery service in the development of
imperturbable <hi rend="italics">self-possession</hi>, in emergency and crisis, is
self-evident and requires no comment. To appreciate it to the full, it
to was only necessary to look at one of our guns, already
overmatched, at the moment when a fresh gun of the enemy
rushing up at a wild gallop, and seizing a nearer and enfilading
position, hurled a percussion shell, crashing with fearful uproar
against our piece, and sweeping almost the entire gun
detachment to the earth. At such a moment I have marked the
sergeant or gunner of such a piece coolly disengage himself
from the wreck and, stepping to one side, stoop to take his
observations and make his calculations, of distance and of
time, free from the dust and smoke of the explosion; then, with
ringing voice, call out to No. 6
<pb id="stiles56" n="56"/>
at the limber,—whose duty it was to cut the fuse,—“three
seconds!” then, stepping back and bending over the trail
handspike, doggedly aim his strained and half-disabled piece, as
the undisabled remnant of the detachment step over the dead
and dying bodies of their comrades, each in the discharge of
the doubled and trebled duties now devolving upon him. The
story I have to tell is full of kindred scenes.</p>
          <p>Another of the most marked and developing features of the
artillery service is <hi rend="italics">comradeship.</hi></p>
          <p>I do not mean that lighter sense of happy and kindly
association which certainly did characterize the artillery, of
General Lee's army at least, in very high degree. I refer now
to an element far deeper and more powerful—the
<hi rend="italics">interdependence</hi>, the reliance upon each other, which inheres
in the very nature of artillery service, and is indispensable to
the effective working of the gun.</p>
          <p>The unit of the infantry is the man; of the cavalry, the man
and horse; of the artillery, the detachment. While co-operation
is a duty and in some degree a necessity in infantry service, yet
a single infantry soldier operates his arm perfectly, indeed each
one is complete in himself—more than one cannot operate the
same arm at the same time. If one runs away he only renders
himself useless, he deprives his country of his services alone.</p>
          <p>Not so with the artillery. It takes ten cannoneers (exclusive
of drivers) to make a gun detachment. Each man has his
special part to perform, but all indispensable to the perfect
working of the piece, so that each man is dependent upon all
the rest. If one fails, all the rest are affected, and even the
piece itself is rendered so far inefficient. Upon each man rests
the responsibility for the effective service of the detachment
and the gun.</p>
          <p>It is impossible not to perceive this distinction, and equally
impossible not to admit the importance of it, in the development
of a soldierly character. Again, I say, my story will not fail to
furnish apt and impressive illustration.</p>
          <p>But the strongest sentiment, aye, passion, of the true
artilleryman is <hi rend="italics">loyalty to the gun.</hi></p>
          <pb id="stiles57" n="57"/>
          <p>The gun is the rallying point of the detachment, its point of
honor, its flag, its banner. It is that to which the men look, by
which they stand, with and for which they fight, by and for
which they fall. As long as the gun is theirs, they are
unconquered, victorious; when the gun is lost, all is lost. It is
their religion to fight it until the enemy is out of range, or until
the gun itself is withdrawn, or until both it and the detachment
are in the hands of the foe. An infantryman in flight often
flings away his musket. I do not recall ever having heard of a
Confederate artillery detachment abandoning its gun without
orders.</p>
          <p>Nor were the Federal artillerymen one whit behind in this
loyal devotion to their pieces. One of the Haskells, who, as I
remember, served on General McGowan's staff, told me this
vivid story. It seems almost incredible, yet I have no reason to
question its truth; at all events, it is too good not to be told.</p>
          <p>In one of the late combats of the war, far away down on
the right of our line, Pegram, passing ahead of his infantry
support, had advanced his entire battalion against the enemy
strongly entrenched—showering double-shotted canister into
their infantry line and belching solid shot across the narrow
ditch, in the very faces of their gunners and into the very
muzzles of their guns. The Federal artillerymen, as was their
wont, fought him fiercely, muzzle to muzzle—until
McGowan's infantry coming up, Pegram passed around the
work, to the right and front, after the retiring Federal infantry,
while the artillerymen and their pieces fell into McGowan's
hands.</p>
          <p>Most of the horses of the staff had been killed or disabled,
and they had mounted Federal artillery horses from which in
some cases the harness had not been removed, so that, as the
staff officers rode to and fro delivering orders, the trace
chains rattled and jingled merrily.</p>
          <p>The Federal gunners had done what they could on the instant
to disable their pieces for the time, throwing away the lanyards
and running the screws down low, so that the muzzles pointed
high in the air. Having rooted out a few friction primers from a
gunner's haversack and fished a
<pb id="stiles58" n="58"/>
string or a handkerchief out of some one's pocket, for a lanyard,
McGowan's infantry managed to load one of the
captured pieces and, turning it in the direction of the retreating
Federals, sent two or three shots whizzing over their heads, to
seek the quartermasters and wagon camps in the rear.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, the gunner of this particular piece, a tall,
splendid-looking fellow, stood hard by, with his lip curled in
scorn and his arms twitching convulsively; until at last, unable
to stand it longer, he sprang into the midst of the blundering
infantry and hurled them right and left, shouting:</p>
          <p>“Stand aside, you infernal, awkward boobies! Let me at that
screw!” meanwhile whirling it rapidly up, until the gun came
down into proper range. Then, seizing the trail handspike and
aiming the piece, he sprang back, yelling out: “Now, try that!
Let 'em have it! Fire!”</p>
          <p>Away flew the shell on its flight of death, until it tore
through the line of his own friends. And he continued thus to
direct the movement of the awkward squad of rebel
cannoneers, and to sight and fire the piece, until the Federal
infantry were out of range. Then, stamping his great foot upon
the ground and gesturing wildly with his great clenched fist, he
exclaimed:</p>
          <p>“Damned if I can stand by and see my gun do such shooting
as that!”</p>

            <p>March and Counter-march—Longstreet and Prince Napoleon—Leesburg
—The Battle—The Mississippians—D. H. Hill—Fort Johnston.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>During the first few days of wild hurrah, uncertainty, and
drift which followed our victory at Manassas, the guns of our
battery were marched and counter-marched on scouting
expeditions, first with one brigade and then with another. Our
most noteworthy experience was with Longstreet's, then
known as the “Fourth Brigade,” in connection with which we
were reviewed by Prince Napoleon at Centreville. The Prince
did not strike me as an impressive man, but I recall the ease
and confidence with which Longstreet handled both his
artillery and infantry commands in the various maneuvers, and
the riding of one of the young officers of his staff, who sat his
beautiful thoroughbred superbly, dashing at full speed from
point to point, leaping ditches and obstructions without being
once jarred in his seat, though using a flat English saddle and
that <hi rend="italics">without stirrups</hi>. I remember, too, that it was so hot on
the sun-scorched plain that the metal-covered tops of the
ammunition chests actually burned us cannoneers, as we
mounted and dismounted at command, in the battery drill.</p>
          <p>The generals in the ranks, of whom there was, even at this
early stage, an abundant supply, being still of the opinion that
we ought to be and soon would be ordered to occupy
Washington, regarded these several movements as in execution
of or preparation for that grand objective—an objective
which our commanding generals, for reasons doubtless
satisfactory to themselves, seem to have soon given up—if
indeed they ever seriously contemplated it. Within a short time
all idea of a general offensive seeming to have been
<pb id="stiles60" n="60"/>
abandoned, even by the staff contingent in the ranks, we were,
on the 11th of August, '61, ordered to Leesburg, under
Brigadier-General N. G. Evans, of South Carolina, whose force
consisted of the Thirteenth, Seventeenth and Eighteenth
Mississippi Regiments, the Eighth Virginia Infantry, our
battery, and two companies of cavalry.</p>
          <p>Leesburg, the county seat of Loudoun, was at this time,
perhaps, the most desirable post in our lines, on account of the
character both of the country and its people—the former
beautiful and rich, full of everything needed by man and beast,
and the latter whole-hearted and hospitable, ready to share
with us all they had. If ever soldiers had a more ideal time
than we enjoyed at Leesburg, then I cannot conceive when or
where it was. During the war, in hunger and thirst, in want and
weariness and blood, our thoughts would often turn fondly
back to our bucolic Loudoun paradise. “When this cruel war
was over” more than one of our boys went back there to get
“the girl he left behind him” from '61 to '65, but would never
leave again; and to-day many a grizzled, wrinkled, burdened
man feels his heart grow young again and breaks into sunny
smiles when a comrade of the long ago slaps him on the back
and reminds him of the good times we had at Leesburg. It was
here we buried the crow, with honors literary and military; nor
was this by any means the only camp entertainment with
which we returned the many civilities extended to us by our
fair friends in the good little burg.</p>
          <p>Of course, where there were so many brave knights all
could not always succeed with the fair ladies. One of the
defeated took this startling and original revenge upon his
successful rival. “The captain with his whiskers” had
repeatedly run him off from a new-found Dulcinea, and this
same result happening once more, our hero returned to camp
weary and disgusted and threw himself down to sleep. Owing
to some abnormal condition of mind or body, he was at the
time much given to talking in his sleep and, dreaming himself
on guard and inquiry made as to the commanding officer of the
force, he electrified his half-slumbering companions by
shouting out:</p>
          <pb id="stiles61" n="61"/>
          <p>“Halt! You want to know who commands this battery, do
you? Well, sir, General Susceptibility commands this battery,
with a numerous staff of volunteer aides!”</p>
          <p>Poor fellow; but he was soon promoted to a captaincy and
commanded a battery of his own, and doubtless avenged his
grievous wrongs by perpetrating the like on his own boys upon
occasion. Very recently he received his last promotion, having
fought a good fight for many years as a faithful Christian
minister.</p>
          <p>We saw no really hard service at Leesburg, though the
activity of the force gradually increased. Our horses being in
fine condition with the abundant forage, and the great, open
fields affording a fine arena for it, we devoted ourselves
assiduously to battery drill. There was also considerable
scouting up and down the river and some little firing across.
One of our own men was wounded in one of these affairs and
one or two cavalrymen killed.</p>
          <p>About the middle of October, however, General Evans
withdrew his force and made a feint of retreat, which drew
the enemy across to our side of the river. Their plan of attack
seems to have been well conceived and came very near being
successfully executed. They landed in two columns, one at
Edwards' Ferry and another at Ball's Bluff, considerably
nearer to the town, the latter point, especially, being concealed
by thick woods. Our little army returned in the very nick of
time, but were misled as to the disposition and designs of the
enemy, regarding the Edwards' Ferry force as the main and
dangerous body, and were either entirely ignorant of the
crossing at Ball's Bluff, or at least did not regard that as of
any magnitude or moment. Indeed, as I recollect, the presence
of these latter troops was discovered as it were by accident,
just as they emerged from the forest, and were practically
between us and Leesburg. But General Evans acted with
vigor after the true condition of things was developed, rapidly
concentrating his force to meet the advance from Ball's Bluff;
first checking and then staggering it, and finally driving the
entire body back in bloody repulse upon and into the river,
where many were drowned.</p>
          <pb id="stiles62" n="62"/>
          <p>To us it seemed a mistake not then to have attacked the
Edwards' Ferry force, but there may have been good reason
for not doing so. The gallant Eighth Virginia, under its staunch
Colonel, afterwards General, Eppa Hunton—since the war
both a Congressman and a Senator of the United States from
Virginia—took a prominent and honorable part in the fight,
which was hotly contested and one of the most remarkable of
the minor battles of the war in the disproportion of the enemy's
loss to the number engaged on our side. No part of the honor,
however, belongs to our battery, as the fighting took place in
heavy woods, where it was impracticable to carry our guns.</p>
          <p>To me the battle of Leesburg, or Ball's Bluff, as the Federals
called it, presented several points of rather special interest.
First, the gallant and almost marvelous escape of a young
Federal officer, named Crowninshield, who had been the
strongest man on the Harvard boat crew about the time I held
the like prominent position among the boating men of Yale. In
the account of the battle, given by one of the Northern papers,
I noticed, with great interest and pleasure, that Crowninshield,
rather than surrender, swam the river and made good his
escape, after his right arm had been shattered by a Minie ball.
It was really a plucky and splendid feat.</p>
          <p>Then, too, I very much enjoyed a newspaper report of a
speech of Roscoe Conkling, delivered in the House of
Representatives at Washington, upon this battle, in the course
of which, extolling the valor of the Federal troops, he quoted
from Tennyson's “Charge of the Light Brigade” the lines:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Cannon to right of them,</l>
            <l>Cannon to left of them,</l>
            <l>Cannon in front of them,</l>
            <l>Volleyed and thundered.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>This was at once amusing and aggravating, as we had felt
peculiarly chagrined at not being able to fire even so much as
one shot while the battle roared in the thicket in front of us.
The enemy, on the contrary, did have and use at least one gun,
a brass three-inch rifle, which was captured and turned over to
our battery.</p>
          <pb id="stiles63" n="63"/>
          <p>A third incident was of a more personal nature. I had
broken my knee-cap by a heavy fall during our feigned
retreat, and the limb had become as rigid as a bar of steel. My
gun detachment was very anxious I should take part in the
fight, and, of course, I was eager for it, as I had seen no
service, and it had been agreed I should act as gunner and
sight the piece. We changed position several times during the
action, in the vain hope of finding a point from which we might
fire upon the enemy without imperilling our own men, and I
was carried from one to another of these positions, or as near
as might be, in an ambulance, driven by a half-witted youth
named Grover, employed for that purpose.</p>
          <p>As I was getting out of the vehicle, for the third or fourth
time, and preparing to hobble painfully up the hill to take my
place at the gun, I said to him: “Grover, why don't you go up
yonder with me to fight? You are better able to do it than I
am.”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” said he, “but there's a differ.”</p>
          <p>“Well, what is it?” I asked; “what is the differ?”</p>
          <p>“Why,” said he, “you see, you 'listed ter git killed and I 'listed
ter drive a avalanche.”</p>
          <p>It is of course familiar to students of the financial history of
the Confederacy, yet it may not be devoid of interest to the
general public, to note that, in the South during the war, banks,
municipalities, companies, and, even in some cases, individuals
issued fractional notes or shin plasters which passed as
currency supplementary to the Treasury notes issued by the
Confederate Government. I am confident every surviving
member of our battery, who was with us at Leesburg, will
recall the little “dog money” notes issued by the town,
ornamented by a picture of a majestic Newfoundland dog lying
down before a massive iron safe supposed to be full of
currency. No one, so far as I know, ever questioned the
validity of Leesburg's fiat money; certainly we Howitzers
experienced no difficulty whatever in getting rid of all we could
get our hands upon.</p>
          <p>About the middle of November, pursuant to a policy of
brigading together, so far as possible, troops from the same
State, the Eighth Virginia Regiment was ordered back to
<pb id="stiles64" n="64"/>
Manassas, and the Twenty-first Mississippi, commanded by
Col. B. G. Humphreys, was sent to fill its place—the entire
Mississippi brigade, consisting of the Thirteenth, Seventeenth,
Eighteenth and Twenty-first Regiments, being then, or shortly
after, put under the command of General Griffith, of that State,
who was killed at Savage Station in June, '62, when Barksdale,
theretofore colonel of the Thirteenth, was made brigadier-general
and took command of the brigade, which bore his
name up to Gettysburg, where he met his gallant death.
Thereupon Colonel Humphreys, of the Twenty-first, was
promoted to the rank of brigadier, and in turn commanded and
christened this fine body of soldiers. It may be well to mention
that Colonel Featherstone, of the Seventeenth, was made
brigadier in the spring of '62, so that three out of the four
original colonels of this brigade became generals, the fourth,
Colonel Burt, of the Eighteenth, having been killed at Ball's
Bluff. I may also add that General Humphreys was elected
Governor of Mississippi shortly after the close of the war.</p>
          <p>For more than a year after the battle of Leesburg, we were
closely associated with these sturdy fellows and became
strongly attached to them; indeed, up to the very end, the two
commands never crossed each other's path without hearty
cheers and handshakes.</p>
          <p>This Mississippi brigade was, in many respects, the finest
body of men I ever saw. They were almost giants in size and
power. In the color company of the Seventeenth Regiment,
when we first met them, there were thirty-five men more than
six feet one inch high, and in the Twenty-first there was one
man six feet seven inches in height, and superbly formed,
except that his shoulders were a trifle too square and too broad
in proportion. They were healthy and hardy, even ruddy, which
was surprising, coming as they did from a region generally
regarded as full of malarial poison. They were bear hunters from
the swamps and cane brakes and, naturally enough, almost
without exception, fine shots.</p>
          <p>As a body, they were very young men and brimful of
irrepressible enthusiasm, equally for play and for fight. The
laugh, the song, the shout, the yell of the rebel charge burst
<pb id="stiles65" n="65"/>
indifferently from their lips; but in any and every case the
volume of sound was tremendous. It was a common saying
that the “sick men” left in Barksdale's camp, when the brigade
was away on duty, made more noise than any other full
brigade in the army. The only comment I have to make upon
this statement is that I cannot recall ever having seen one of
them sick or “ailing” in any way, except when suffering from
hunger or from wounds. At times they seemed about as rough
as the bears they had hunted, yet they were withal simple-minded
and tender-hearted boys, and at Fredericksburg
hundreds of them became Christians.</p>
          <p>I knew almost every man in the brigade and often attended
their religious meetings. Many a time, after I became adjutant
of our battalion of artillery, Col. H. C. Cabell's, as I galloped
past their lines awaiting the order to charge, my heart has
been cheered and strengthened by a chorus of manly voices
calling after me, “God bless you, Brother Stiles, and cover
your head in the day of battle!” How could I help loving these
simple, brave, great-hearted fellows.</p>
          <p>Early in December, '61, General Evans was relieved of the
command at Leesburg and sent, I think, to South Carolina, his
native State, to take charge of some troops there, and Gen. D.
H. Hill, of North Carolina, was put in his place. He was a
brother-in-law of Stonewall Jackson and, like him a thorough
Christian and thorough Calvinist. That he was likewise a
thorough soldier may be inferred, as the logicians would say,
“<hi rend="italics">a-priori </hi>and <hi rend="italics">a-posteriori</hi>,” from the two facts, that he was a
graduate of West Point, and that he attained the rank of
lieutenant-general in the Confederate service. He was,
moreover, a man of intellect and culture, with a decided taste
for scholarship and letters, and was, both before and since the
war, connected with educational institutions of high grade and
a writer of books, both scientific and religious.</p>
          <p>Like Jackson he was, too, a born fighter—as aggressive,
pugnacious and tenacious as a bull-dog, or as any soldier in
the service, and he had a sort of monomania on the subject of
personal courage.</p>
          <pb id="stiles66" n="66"/>
          <p>It is certainly worthy of note that this fighting zeal is so
frequently combined with a high degree of spiritual religion.</p>
          <p>Almost countless stories are told of the grim courage and
grit of General Hill. In the first Maryland campaign he held the
pass at Boonsboro for many hours with a mere handful of
troops against McClellan's overwhelming numbers, thus giving
time for Jackson to complete his capture of Harper's Ferry and
join Lee at Sharpsburg. It is said that, toward the close of the
Boonsboro fight, as he rode down his short line, his men
reported that they were out of ammunition, and the stern old
North Carolina Puritan replied: “Well, what of it? Here are plenty of <hi rend="italics">rocks!</hi>”</p>
          <p>His habit was, when his skirmishers were firing wildly, to
ride out among them, and if he noticed a man lying down or
behind protection and firing carelessly, he would make him get
right up and come and stand out in the open, by his horse, and
load his musket and hand it to him. Then he would crane his
neck until he saw a Federal skirmisher, when he would point
him out to his man, but would fire at him himself, not only
taking long, portentous aim before pulling trigger, but making
equally long examination afterwards to determine whether he
had hit him; and he would continue and distribute these blood-curdling
object-lessons until his men settled down to a style of
firing that suited him.</p>
          <p>Very amusing accounts passed around the army about “old
D. H.” every now and then “<hi rend="italics">treating</hi>” the non-combatant
officers of his staff—the quartermasters, commissaries, and
doctors—to what he called “a little airing in a fight,” when he
thought they stood in need of it, or heard that they had been
“airing,” a little freely, their own martial experience and
prowess.</p>
          <p>Occasionally, in his official reports, he gave the tartest and
most amusing expressions to his strenuous views and
standards of soldierly courage and devotion. I recall one in
which, in commenting upon the flight of a body of cavalry
before overwhelming numbers, he remarks incidentally, that it
takes a good man to stand and fight against heavy odds,
<pb id="stiles67" n="67"/>
when he has only two legs under him; but that, if you put six
legs under him to run away with, it requires the best kind of a
man to stand and fight.</p>
          <p>In another report, in describing a stampede and the crush
and jam of fugitives in the highway, he says, “Not a dog; no,
not even a sneaking exempt, could have made his way
through.”</p>
          <p>As early in the drama as the Leesburg campaign he had
begun to indulge and exhibit these rather peculiar notions and
habits. Soon after taking command, desiring to know the
number, calibre, and character of the Federal guns across the
river, he gathered a large escort and rode up and down the
river bank in a manner calculated to attract the fire of artillery,
and when the enemy accepted his invitation and the shell
came singing over and buried itself in the earth hard by, he
called for a pick and shovel, dismounted and dug it up with his
own hands, apparently unconscious that other shells were
shrieking and bursting about him and is improvised and
somewhat nervous staff. Of course this impressed us no little;
exactly how, it would be difficult to say. One thing, however,
was clear—that this apparent unconsciousness of personal
peril was in no degree “put on,” that our general was
undoubtedly “to the manner born.”</p>
          <p>Our company had special reason for desiring to make a
good impression upon General Hill. At the battle of Bethel, or
“Big Bethel,” where he commanded a regiment and won the
spurs and stars of a general, he had with him the other two
companies of our “Howitzer Battalion,” which unfortunately
never materialized in the field. We did not wish him to draw
unfavorable comparisons and gave him no reason for doing so,
though we had no opportunity, while under him, of
distinguishing ourselves.</p>
          <p>He was a man of strong likes and dislikes, and in some way
was led to notice and to conceive a decided liking for me.
Not long after he assumed command he ordered Captain
Shields to send, I think, a sergeant and some fifteen or twenty
men, of whom I was one, to take charge of Fort Johnston, a
considerable, closed earth-work, on a commanding
eminence about a mile out of town, which mounted two
<pb id="stiles68" n="68"/>
or three siege pieces of rather clumsy construction, fired by
friction-primer like field pieces. In addition to this, we generally
had one and, much of the time two, of our field pieces also
with us at the fort. About the same time, the general ordered
about the same number of Mississippians—that is to say,
enough for two gun detachments—to report at the fort and to
be under my special charge. I have an indistinct recollection
that I selected these men. The idea was that we light
artillerymen should adapt our drill to the heavy guns and then
teach the Mississippians the manual and use of both field and
siege pieces, so that all of us could work effectually all the
pieces in the fort.</p>
          <p>The Mississippians were glad to come. They liked the noise
and smoke and uproar of the guns. There never were two
such field artillery detachments as they made after a brief
period of drill. They would shove the pieces up almost any
hillside, however steep, and would even hold them against the
recoil when inclined to roll too far back. We passed a good
deal of time running up and down the river with the field
pieces, the captain sometimes with us and sometimes not,
appearing first on one commanding hilltop and then on another,
and firing across at the railroad trains and canal boats on the
other side. On two or three occasions we stirred up a hornet's
nest in the shape of Federal batteries which happened to be
drilling in the neighborhood, and once were compelled to
withdraw with more speed than dignity; but my irrepressible
Mississippi artillerymen made fun of it all, actually playing leap
frog down the steep Loudoun hillside, under a galling fire, from
perhaps eight or ten guns. I was quite an athlete at the time,
having been considered the strongest man at Yale while there,
and had reason to deem myself an expert in matters involving
physical achievement and endurance. I have no hesitation in
saying that I never witnessed an exhibition of bounding,
buoyant power and unshakable bodily soundness and stamina
that compared with this performance of the Mississippians.
The men were all, or most of them, over six feet in height and
averaged, I <sic corr="should">shoud</sic> say, over 200 pounds in weight, and yet they
ran down the steep slope, keeping abreast of galloping
<pb id="stiles69" n="69"/>
horses, and leaping over each other's shoulders, the
head of course inclined, but the column of the body almost
upright; and as the leaper would strike far below, with a
jar calculated to jolt a man's vital organs out of gear forever,
he would instantly assume position again, with a shout,
while two hundred pounds of yelling, human trap-ball
would in turn execute the perilous flying leap over his
head.</p>
          <p>The situation at Fort Johnston, from the view-point of
rank, command, and subordination, was mixed and
delicate enough already, though I had no real difficulty, with
my own company officers, in keeping up my little <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">imperium in
imperio</foreign></hi>. But just about the time matters had settled into
working order with the existing elements, a militia regiment
from a neighboring county was ordered into the fort, for the
purpose of improving and strengthening as well as more fully
manning it. This regiment, as I remember, was afterwards
broken up and the men entered as individual recruits in veteran
regiments, as was the almost unvarying mode of recruiting
in the Confederate service; but at this time late winter of '61-'2,
or early spring of '62—this regiment seems to have retained
its original organization under its original officers. I have
spoken of it as a militia regiment, as we all did at the time,
but I do not know what its real status was. The regimental
officers were of course jealous of us—private artillery
soldiers seeming to be set over even infantry officers, and
the general being in the habit of communicating with us
directly in matters concerning the fort and everything in it. To
add to the uneasiness and discontent, the idea got abroad
that this small force was thus isolated with the view of
sacrificing it in case the enemy should cross over, to enable
the other troops to withdraw in safety.</p>
          <p>At one of the evening dress parades of the regiment, at
which of course the colonel was in charge, I attempted, with
his permission, to show the absurdity of this rumor, and at the
same time to pour oil generally on the troubled waters; but a
little before midnight one of my Mississippians, “Buck
Denman,” a man marked even among those heroes for
courage and power, who was corporal of the guard that night,
came and woke me up with the startling intelligence that the
<pb id="stiles70" n="70"/>
“melish” were formed and about to leave the fort. I rose
instantly and ordered Denman to call out his entire squad and
have them rendezvous at once at the outlet of the fort with
<hi rend="italics">loaded muskets.</hi></p>
          <p>He yelled like a Comanche as he sprang to execute the
order, and, by the time I reached the centre of the parade,
passing by the head of the regiment on the way, the bear
hunters were at their posts “loaded for b'ar” or “melish,” as the
case might be, and shouting for the battle. The “colonel
commanding” hesitated what command to give, and I at once
assumed his place and did not hesitate. The men were in
column and ready to march out, but they frontfaced readily at
my command, and I briefly laid the situation before them,
emphasizing—but never mind what I emphasized, the moon
gave light enough to shed a gleam on the musket barrels of the
Mississippians formed right across the only outlet, and these
added the emphasis; but I did appeal also to the better
judgment and better feeling of the men and closed with an
invitation to their colonel to call on General Hill with me in the
morning.</p>
          <p>While I was speaking I noticed immediately in front of me,
standing on a sort of irregular front line of officers, a
remarkable and grotesque figure. He was a tall, gaunt man,
dressed in an old Continental uniform or something very like it.
I recall the cocked hat, blue, buff-faced coat, of that cut,
fa'-top boots, and a drawn sword in his hand of about the length
and model of a scythe blade. It was not a very bright night, but
his whole attitude showed absorbed and sympathetic attention.
I had hardly ceased when he stepped briskly toward me,
saluted, wheeled and faced the regiment and his, the leading
company, and uttered, in quite a soldierly tone, just these
words: “Snickersville Blues, fall out! Mr. Stiles is right, and I
am going to stand by him!” The example was contagious, and
in a few moments the strained situation was entirely relieved.</p>
          <p>In the morning General Hill decided that I was right,
commended the course I had pursued, and said he would send
for a commission for me (which I presume he forgot); but
suggested that it might interest and conciliate the regiment
<pb id="stiles71" n="71"/>
if we would pick out two or three detachments and
drill them in the manual of the heavy pieces. We did so with
admirable result, of course offering to the gallant captain of
the “Snickersville Blues” the place of gunner of the first
detachment. The old fellow, whose name I think was
Moore, took the greatest interest and delight in the drill and
showed some proficiency at it; so that in a few days he asked
me to allow him to drill his detachment before General Hill,
who rode out almost every evening to see how we were
getting on. I never saw anything quite so irresistibly funny as
Moore's dress and bearing as he formed his detachment,
marched them to the gun and put them in position about it. He
got on fairly well until a primer failed and he could not recall
the appropriate command—“Don't advance, the primer has
failed!”</p>
          <p>As No. 2 first hesitated and then started to advance, Moore,
gasping with excitement and stretching out his right arm
deprecatingly toward the cannoneer, blurted out, “Don't go up,
the thing's busted!” Of course there was an explosion, though
not of the primer, but as Moore seemed so genuinely
mortified, it was soon hushed. General Hill seemed to
appreciate the situation, and assured the gunner that his
improvised command answered every purpose and was far
preferable, in such an emergency, to not saying anything
because unable to recall exactly what to say.</p>
          <p>Soon after this, in the early spring of '62, the General
directed us to have a large number of flannel powder bags
made up, a few for the heavy guns, but most of them of a size
suited to our field pieces, and gave such additional orders as
satisfied me that the army was about to abandon its present
lines and take position somewhere in the low country near
Richmond. The young ladies of Leesburg had offered
repeatedly to do anything they could for us, and so we held,
for several successive nights, a regular sewing bee over these
powder bags, which, as fast as made, were taken up to Fort
Johnston and filled in the magazine there. We had a lively,
lovely time, making the bags, but I felt all the while as if I
were guilty of the vilest deception; for of course these sweet
girls were led to believe these powder
<pb id="stiles72" n="72"/>
bags were to be used in their defense, while I well knew we
would abandon them to their fate about as soon as the bags
were finished, filled, and packed for transport. At last the time
for our departure actually came, and a sad leave-taking it was,
for some of these dear people had treated us as no strangers
were ever treated before; and besides, we all felt not only the
pain of parting but also something akin to the disgrace of
desertion.</p>
          <p>With D. H. Hill, worship of Stonewall Jackson held a place
next after and close alongside his religion. He had the greatest
admiration for Jackson's genius and the greatest confidence in
his future. He honored me with frequent and sometimes very
extended interviews; and as there was nothing else he so much
delighted to talk about or I to hear, I absorbed much that
prepared me for his brother-in-law's marvelous career. Even
at that early day, Hill predicted that if the war should last six
years and Jackson live so long, he would be in supreme
command.</p>
          <p>It is fair to add that the pure white star of Robert Lee had
not yet fairly appeared above the Southern horizon.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>We left Leesburg about the 7th of March, '62, for Culpeper
C. H., which was the place of rendezvous of the army before
taking up the line of march for the Peninsula, whither we
were ordered to repair to meet McClellan. Only two things of
interest occurred on the way—the reenlistment and
reorganization of the battery and a hurried glimpse at our
friends in Richmond. The former, as I remember, took place
at or near Culpeper C. H., about the 15th of March, and
deserves more than casual mention.</p>
          <p>In the spring of 1862, throughout our service, the men
reenlisting were allowed to elect their own officers; so that for
weeks about this time the army, and that in the face of the
enemy, was resolved—it is the highest proof of its patriotism
and character that it was not also dissolved—into nominating
caucuses and electioneering meetings. This compliment, by
the way, is as well deserved by the men voluntarily reenlisting
and electing their own officers, on the Federal side as the
Confederate, if, as I presume, the same system was adopted
by the Federals.</p>
          <p>I do not say this is not the usual mode of organizing a
volunteer army, at least in this country; nor do I deny that the
result was better, on the average, than might have been
anticipated, but it was bad enough. Our friend, Gen. D. H.
Hill, in a report of a little later date, says, “The reorganization
of the army, at Yorktown under the elective system, had
thrown out of service many of our best officers and had much
demoralized our army.”</p>
          <pb id="stiles74" n="74"/>
          <p>In short, the selection of military officers by the elective
method is a monstrosity, an utter reversal of the essential spirit
of military appointment and promotion. It ought to be enough to
immortalize it as such that, about the time of or soon after the
original enlistments, the men of one of the Virginia regiments,
in the exercise of their volunteer right to choose their officers,
protested successfully against the assignment of General, then
Colonel, Jackson to command them.</p>
          <p>It is fair also to add that the result, in the case of our
own company,—as I have abundantly shown an exceptionally
intelligent corps,—so far as the newly-elected captain was
concerned, could not have been more satisfactory, as he was a
man of the noblest nature and every inch a soldier. But this
was not by any means the case with all the officers elected by
us. Our two preceding captains were promoted, the one to be
colonel commanding “Camp Lee”—the camp of instruction at
Richmond—and the other, at a later date, to be surgeon of
that post, with rank of major.</p>
          <p>We seemed to be in no sort of hurry to get at McClellan;
that is, we took our time on the road, feeling sure, from past
experience, that he would take his. Our army and people
invariably regarded that general as “an officer and a
gentleman” and a fine soldier, too, except that he was a little
slow and prone to see double as to the number of his foes. The
Richmond <hi rend="italics">Examiner</hi>, by far the most vigorous journal published
in the South during the war, epitomized “little Mac” in the
following graphic sentence, “Accustomed in peace to the
indecent haste of railroad travel, McClellan adopted in war the
sedate tactics of the mud turtle.” He certainly did seem to have
a penchant for <hi rend="italics">mud</hi>, Peninsula mud, Chickahominy mud, James
River mud—any sort of mud; but he was too much of a
gentleman to “sling” any of it, even at us “rebels.”</p>
          <p>The only point of the march down at which we were made
to hurry, was the only one at which we would have demurred
to doing so, if it would have done any good, and that was
Richmond, where, as I remember, we arrived about the 10th
of April, and left by steamer down James River a day
<pb id="stiles75" n="75"/>
or two later. I remember, too, that as the boat left the
shouting thousands on the shore and swept out into the
stream, our glee club burst into the rollicking stanzas of
“Mynheer von Dunck”—a song as good in verse and in
music as it is bad in morals:</p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“Mynheer van Dunck, </l>
            <l>Though he never got drunk, </l>
            <l>Sipped brandy and water gaily; </l>
            <l>And he quenched his thirst </l>
            <l>With two quarts of the first</l>
            <l>To a pint of the latter, daily. </l>
            <l>Water well mingled with spirit, good store, </l>
            <l>No Hollander dreams of scorning; </l>
            <l>But of water alone he drinks no more</l>
            <l>Than the rose supplies </l>
            <l>When the dew drop lies</l>
            <l>On its bloom of a summer morning—</l>
            <l>For a Dutchman's draft should potent be, </l>
            <l>Though deep as the rolling Zuyder Zee.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>And as we steamed out of hearing of the pier the stout
voices of the singers were publishing, with metrical and
musical elaboration, the somewhat shady proposition that— </p>
          <lg type="verse">
            <l>“A pretty girl who gets a kiss and runs and tells her mother,</l>
            <l>Does what she should not do and don't deserve another.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>These revelling, rollicking songs came later to be prime
favorites with sundry brigadier, major and even
lieutenant-generals in the Army of Northern Virginia, and
they cheered too, many a comfortless camp and relieved
many a weary march of the old battery.</p>
          <p>In due time we made our landing and found our place in the
peninsular lines of Yorktown and Warwick River, which were
admirably adapted to the purpose for which General
Magruder designed and located them; namely, to enable a
small body of troops to hold the position—but for occupation
by a large army they were simply execrable. There was
scarcely solid ground enough accessible to afford standing,
sleeping, or living room for the men.</p>
          <pb id="stiles76" n="76"/>
          <p>Our boys had their first taste of actual war in these
abominable lines. Soon after our arrival the enemy attempted a
crossing in force. Our guns being called for, we made an
inspiring rush for the point of attack and were loudly cheered
by the long lines of waiting infantry as we thundered by with
our horses at a wild gallop. We got in only at the end of the
fight, but our pieces were soon placed in the works and in
situations about as trying as any we ever occupied. Our
positions were commanded by those on the other side, our
earth-works were utterly insufficient, we were heavily
outnumbered in guns, and the Federal sharpshooters were as
audacious and deadly as I ever saw them. For the most part
they were concealed in the tops of tall pine trees and had
down shots upon us, against which it was almost impossible to
protect ourselves. When we attempted to do so by digging
holes back of and beneath our works, the water rose in them
and drove us out. Then, too, the enemy had opposite to us
several rapid-firing guns of the earlier models, which we
dubbed “the hopper mine,” “the putty machine,”
etc., and which
ground out a stream of bullets almost equal to the fire of a line
of battle. The guns were not, however, really effective, and I
do not recall ever encountering them again. But our boys
showed excellent pluck and did some fine shooting,
dismounting one of the guns of a Rhode Island battery which
we had the luck of meeting several times during the war.</p>
          <p>The only relief we had from the sharpshooters was when
the marvelous Texan scouts got to work upon them, which
was as often as their “impudence” got to be unbearable. This
was the first time we had met those greatest of all soldiers, the
Texas brigade. I question whether any body of troops ever
received such a compliment as General Lee paid them in his
letter to Senator Wigfall, written later in the war, in which he
asked him, if possible, to go to Texas and raise another such
brigade for his army. He said that the efficiency of the Army
of Northern Virginia would be thereby increased to an
incalculable extent, and that he would be relieved of the
unpleasant necessity of calling on this one brigade so often in
critical junctures. I have not the letter
<pb id="stiles77" n="77"/>
before me, but I have read it several times and feel
substantially sure of its contents.</p>
          <p>In the present instance the work of these worthies appeared
little less than miraculous. They were apparently unconscious
of danger and seemed to bear charmed lives. When the
pressure of the Federal sharpshooters became intolerable. the
Texans would pass the word that it was time to go out
“squirrel shooting.” Then they would get up, yawn and stretch
a little, load their rifles and take to the water, disappearing
from view in the brush. Then everything would be still a few
minutes; then two or three shots, and the sputter of the
sharpshooters would cease. After a while the Texans would
straggle back, and report how many “squirrels” they
had got.</p>
          <p>Notwithstanding this relief, or it may have been for the lack
of it,—for our guns were separated by considerable
distances,—one of our detachments broke down utterly from
nervous tension and lack of rest. I went in as one of the relief
party to bring them out and take their places. It was, of
course, after nightfall, and some of these poor lads were
sobbing in their broken sleep, like a crying child just before it
sinks to rest. It was really pathetic. The men actually had to
be supported to the ambulances sent down to bring them
away.</p>
          <p>Amongst the unpleasant experiences of these lines were the
night attacks, or perhaps, to speak more accurately, I should
say, the night alarms. Down in these swamps at night it was
incredibly dark and musketry never roared and reverberated
as terribly anywhere else. These exhibitions reached the
dignity at least of fully developed “alarms.” Especially was this
the case when, one black night, a sudden outburst of fire— 
infantry, artillery, machine guns and all—stampeded a working
party of some two hundred negroes who had just begun the
much-needed strengthening of our very inadequate
fortifications. The working party not only fled themselves, but
the frantic fugitives actually swept away with them a part of
our infantry support.</p>
          <p>I was sent back to the drivers' camp to see that the horses
were harnessed and ready in case it should be necessary to
<pb id="stiles78" n="78"/>
withdraw our pieces, and I met a line or mass of troops
advancing to our support. Hearing some one call “Stiles!” I
asked, “Who said ‘Stiles’ and who are you speaking to?” A
voice answered, “I called Stiles,” and another, close beside me,
said, “He's speaking to me. Stiles is my name. I'm Capt.
Edward Stiles, of Savannah, Georgia.” I grasped his hand,
unable to see him, and having only time to say, “Then I'm your
cousin, Robert Stiles, of Richmond, Virginia. Look you up
to-morrow.” Until that moment I did not know I had a relative in
the Virginia army, knowing that some and supposing that all of
my cousins were in the armies of the coast defense.</p>
          <p>It was, of course, well understood by all of us that the
Federal commander, having complete control of the navigable
rivers, by virtue of his overwhelming naval power, could at
any time turn either of our flanks or land a heavy force
between us and Richmond, and that therefore our present line
could not be a permanent one. We were not surprised, then, at
receiving orders, about the 2d of May, to withdraw and march
toward Richmond, which we did.</p>
          <p>The enemy followed, but not vigorously. My recollection is
that our company was the rear battery during the next day and
that we several times unlimbered our pieces, but never fired a
shot; so the evening of the 4th of May found us on the
Richmond side of Williamsburg, hitched up and ready to fall in
behind our brigade. We heard firing in the rear, but thought
little of it until a mounted officer rode up with orders from
competent authority to bring up as rapidly as possible the first
battery he could find ready hitched up, and so we passed
rapidly back through Williamsburg, and became at once hotly
engaged, doing good service, as we also did the next day.
Indeed our action the first evening might, without much strain,
be termed <hi rend="italics">“distinguished.”</hi> The enemy, under a heavy fire
from our battery and another, abandoned a three-inch rifled
gun and a caisson of ammunition, and the general at whose
orders we had entered the fight calling for volunteers to bring
them into our lines, our boys volunteered and brought them off
the field, using the captured gun with fine effect the following
day.</p>
          <pb id="stiles79" n="79"/>
          <p>Williamsburg was not in any sense a decisive battle,
perhaps not designed to be so on either side. Upon our side
certainly, perhaps upon both sides, it accomplished its limited
purpose, which upon our part was to let General McClellan
see that it would not be well for him to seriously interfere with
or molest us in our “change of base,”—or “retreat” if one
prefers this latter term,—though, as above remarked, it cannot
be contended that the line we were leaving could ever have
been designed for permanent occupation.</p>
          <p>It is obvious, I say, that McClellan did learn the lesson we
intended; for after Williamsburg our army was allowed to
pursue its march very leisurely up the Peninsula—a
considerable part of it stopping to finish the reenlistment and
reorganization by the election of new officers.</p>
          <p>But it is not a satisfactory battle to contemplate, because the
administering of this lesson cost too much in blood, and this
because, as so often happens, some one blundered. Col.
Richard L. Maury, son of Commodore M. F. Maury, and an
exceptionally intelligent officer, who at the close of the fight
commanded the Twenty-fourth Virginia, Early's old regiment,
the colonel and lieutenant-colonel having been shot down— 
has written a brief but strong memoir on this battle, from
which it would seem well-nigh impossible to draw any other
conclusions.</p>
          <p>He makes substantially the following points:</p>
          <p>General Magruder had built, and was commended for
building, a chain of redoubts across the Peninsula from the
York to the James, as a second dine; Fort Magruder, a strong
closed work, about a mile from Williamsburg, on the main
road running down the Peninsula, being the key of the entire
line. The battle was fought in and from these fortifications, we
occupying Fort Magruder, but, incredible as it may seem, not
occupying the other works, and not even those within a short
distance of the main road along which lay our route to
Richmond. Indeed, General Hancock was allowed, without
firing a shot, to possess himself of one or more of these
works, and yet the heaviest loss in the action was entailed in
the attempt to dislodge Hancock, which failed. Several of the
general officers, by whose apparent neglect all this happened,
<pb id="stiles80" n="80"/>
have publicly defended themselves by stating that they
did not know and were not informed as to the location of these
works. It seems to go without saying that they ought to have
been informed. Furthermore, it is evident that if a single
general officer upon our side was fully informed as to the
entire line, it was General Magruder, who built it, and who, it
seems, took no part in this battle. Indeed, as I remember, he
had been sent on toward Richmond. As above intimated, it
would seem impossible that all these facts should co-exist with
prudence and generalship upon the part of all our leading
officers.</p>
          <p>There is, however, one relief to the rather sombre picture.
Our troops, whether prudently and wisely led or not, certainly
fought well. “Hancock the Superb” was generous enough to
say that the Twenty-fourth Virginia and the Fifth North
Carolina, the two regiments which attacked his strong force in
its fortified position, deserved to have the word “immortal”
inscribed upon their banners.</p>
          <p>Two of the most vivid pictures in the gallery of my memory
are set in the framing of this battle—the one the most
shocking instance of the inhuman demoralization of war, the
other the most inspiring illustration of the noblest traits
developed by it.</p>
          <p>During a lull in the fighting our guns were withdrawn and
were in column parallel to the road, in a common on the
outskirts of the town, resting and awaiting orders, when a
number of wounded Federal prisoners were brought up in
ambulances and laid temporarily on the grass, while a field
hospital was being established hard by. Among them was a
poor wretch, shot through the bowels, who was rolling on the
ground in excruciating agony and beseeching the bystanders to
put him out of his misery. There did not appear to be anything
that could be done for him, at least not in advance of the
coming of the surgeons, so I was in the act of turning away
from the painful spectacle when a couple of Turcos, or
Louisiana tigers, the most rakish and devilish-looking beings I
ever saw, came up and peered over the shoulders of the circle
of onlookers.</p>
          <p>Suddenly one of them pushed through the ring, saying: “Put
you out of your misery? Certainly, sir!” and before
<pb id="stiles81" n="81"/>
any one had time to interfere, or even the faintest idea of his
intention, brained the man with the butt of his musket; and the
bloody club still in his hands, looking around upon the other
wounded men, added glibly, “Any other gentleman here'd like
to be accommodated?”</p>
          <p>It is impossible to express my feelings. I fear that if I had
had a loaded musket in my hands I should have illustrated the
demoralization of war a little further by shooting down in his
tracks the demon, who suddenly disappeared, as a gasp of
horror escaped the spectators.</p>
          <p>For the honor of human nature, let me quickly give you the
other picture.</p>
          <p>At the crisis of the battle we were stationed in Fort
Magruder, as above explained, the key of our position. I was
standing, sponge-staff in hand, awaiting the firing of my gun,
the next piece to the left being a gun of the Fayette Artillery.
As my eye fell upon it, No. 1 was sponging out, No. 3, of
course, having his thumbstall pressed upon the vent. Suddenly
I saw No. 3 stoop, clapping his right hand upon his leg below
the knee, and then I saw him topple slowly forward, never,
however, lifting his thumb from the vent, but pressing it down
close and hard—his elbow strained upward as his body sank
forward and downward. The heroic fellow had been first shot
in the calf of the right leg, and as he bent to feel that wound a
bullet crashed through his skull; but his last effort was to save
No. 1 from the loss of his hands by premature explosion as he
rammed home the next charge I have never witnessed more
sublime faithfulness unto death than was exhibited by the
downward pressure of that thumb, as it was literally dragged
from the hole of the piece by the weight of the sinking body of
the noble cannoneer.</p>
          <p>This incident reminds me of another which well illustrates
how receptive and retentive of pictorial impression are the
minds of men—especially men of a certain type—at
moments of intense excitement. It is this faculty, in great
measure, which imparts special interest and value to the
personal reminiscences of men of this character.</p>
          <p>Nearly three years after the battle of Williamsburg, I think in
March, '65, entering the office of the provost-marshall
<pb id="stiles82" n="82"/>
of the city of Richmond for the first and only time during
the war, I found an officer, in a new uniform of a colonel of
cavalry, in an unpleasant altercation with one of the employees
of the office. As I approached he turned to me, saying:</p>
          <p>“It's a hard case, Major, that a veteran colonel of the Army
of Northern Virginia is bearded in this way by a beardless boy
of a provost-marshal's clerk, and that he cannot have even the
poor satisfaction of slapping his jaws as he is entrenched
behind this partition.”</p>
          <p>While pouring out this complaint the Colonel gazed at me
with increasing interest and, as he ceased—starting a little— 
said abruptly:</p>
          <p>“I have seen you before, sir!”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Colonel,” I replied, “or at least, I have seen you, and I
recall just when and where it was; but as you are the ranking
officer won't you be good enough to say first, if you can, when
and where you saw me?”</p>
          <p>“Certainly, sir,” said he; “it was at the battle of Williamsburg,
in May, '62. You were then a private soldier in an artillery
company and were standing, bare-headed, at the angle of Fort
Magruder with a sponge-staff in your hand as I led a charge of
cavalry past the fort.”</p>
          <p>My recollection exactly coincided with his. The officer, I
think, was Col. J. Lucius Davis, who commanded a body of
Virginia troops at Charlestown or Harper's Ferry during the
John Brown raid; but, whoever he was, he was not a colonel
at Williamsburg, but I think a captain; and, as I remember, then
wore a brown-gray tunic belted around his waist, and his hair,
which was then quite long, swept back from his forehead as
he gallantly led his men, sabre in hand, at full speed against the
enemy.</p>
          <p>We never met save on the two occasions mentioned and
could not possibly have seen each other at Williamsburg more
than a moment. The rank, dress, bearing—everything, indeed,
save the essential personality of the two men—was entirely
different at the two meetings, and yet neither of us felt the
slightest hesitation as to mutual identification or the time, place,
and circumstances of the first meeting.</p>
          <pb id="stiles83" n="83"/>
          <p>The one feature of the march up the Peninsula was mud.
Even the great “Mud turtle” himself must have been satiated
with it. As for me, I had never imagined anything approximating
to it. The ground had been saturated by recent heavy
rains, which seemed to have brought down with them myriads
of diminutive green frogs, the only living organisms, except of
course the mud turtle, which could enjoy the big lob-lolly
puddles into which the road-bed had been churned by the
multitude of troughs and wheels and the feet of the trampling
thousands. Our company wagon, containing a present supply
of commissary and quartermaster stores and all our extra
clothing, sank to the hubs and had to be abandoned. We feared
for the guns and could not think of wasting teams on wagons.
The danger was really imminent that the guns themselves
would have to be abandoned, and the captain instructed me to
have at hand a haversack with hammer and spikes and to keep
near the rear of the battery, and if a gun could not be dragged
through the mud, then to “spike it” as thoroughly as I could, slip
the trunnions from the sockets and let the piece drop into the
deepest mud I could find, and mark the spot. By dint, however,
of fine driving, and heavy lifting and shoving at the wheels, we
managed to save our brazen war dogs, for which we were
beginning to feel a strong attachment.</p>
          <p>The poor horses often sank to their bellies, and we were
several times compelled to unhitch a stalled horse, tie a
prolonge around him, hitch the rest of the team to the rope and
drag him out. I mean just what I say when I aver that I saw a
team of mules disappear, every hair, under the mud, in the
middle of the road. Of course they had first fallen, in their
impotent efforts to extricate themselves, and they afterwards
arose and emerged from their baptism of mud, at once the
most melancholy and the most ludicrous-looking objects that
could be imagined. It was wretched, and yet it had its funny
side.</p>
          <p>We mounted upon the gun and caisson horses, for the
emergency, the very best men, regard being had to the single
requisite of skill and experience in handling draft horses and
heavy loads, and no regard whatever as to whether or
<pb id="stiles84" n="84"/>
not they had theretofore been battery drivers. In this way it
happened that two of the finest soldiers in the command were driving
at my gun, the one the wheel team and the other the lead, there being
at the time six horses to the piece. It was stalled, and two or three
unsuccessful efforts having been made to start it, the wheel driver
declared it was the fault of the leader. The latter retorted, and the war
of words waxed hot, until suddenly the wheel charioteer dismounted
in the thigh-deep mud and, struggling up abreast of the lead team,
dared the driver of it to get down and fight it out then and there. It is
possible the other would have accepted the challenge if a glance
down at his friend and foe had not brought the absurdity of the
entire thing so vividly before him that he simply threw his head back
in a burst of laughter, saying, “Why, Billy, you must take me for an
infernal fool, to expect me to get down in that infernal mud to fight
you!” Whereupon the gentleman in the mud laughed, too, as did
everybody within sight and hearing, and Billy struggled back to his
wheelers, remounted, and with “a long pull, a strong pull, and a pull
altogether”—out she came.</p>
          <p>Another gentleman—he who had “resigned” when all
trunks were
sent to the rear from Manassas—having gotten at the company
wagon this day, just before it was abandoned, had on a beautiful
new suit of “Crenshaw gray,” and, thus arrayed, was making a
perilous passage out in the woods parallel to the road, dodging
behind the big pine trees and springing from tussock to tussock of
swamp grass and bushes. The boys had been watching him for some
time, but he begged so hard, by cabalistic signs, that they had not
“told on him.” But finally the lieutenant saw him and called to him to
come and get in the mud and help start a stalled gun. Of course he
had to come, but he came very slowly, meanwhile beseeching the
boys to “put on a little more steam and get the gun out!”</p>
          <p>But the fellows had now come to appreciate the fun of the thing,
as had also the lieutenant, and he ordered them to do nothing until
Jim should get down in the mud with them. He wriggled and
squirmed, his comrades standing in
<pb id="stiles85" n="85"/>
the mud about the gun jeering and jibing at him, as he mounted and
walked upon a big pine log which projected out to the slough of
despond in which the gun was stuck, till, getting about squarely
over it, he stopped and begged once more; but the boys shouted
derisively, and the lieutenant called out, “Get down to it, sir;
nobody's going to shove a pound until you get in and shove with
the rest!” Poor Jim! He lifted his foot and stamped it down in
vexation on the wet bark, which parted and slipped from the smooth,
slick bole of the tree, and down came Jim, with a great splash like the
mules, hide and hair and Crenshaw gray, all into and under the mud.
I don't think I ever heard such a shout as greeted this “knight of the
sorrowful figure” as he emerged, from his thighs up, the liquid mud
dripping from every part of the upper half of his person. But it cured
him and his suit as well, the beautiful Crenshaw gray thenceforward
exhibiting a sickly, jaundiced, butter-nut hue, like the clothes some
backwoods cracker regiments wore when they first came to Virginia.</p>
          <p>Only one other feature of our march up the Peninsula merits
notice, and that was our almost actual starvation on the way. The
cause of this was separation from our brigade, which was probably
ten miles from Williamsburg before we were ordered to follow. In the
condition of the roads already described, catching up with any
particular body of troops was of course out of the question. We
really had nothing to eat for two days and nights, except, that, as we
were compelled to impress corn for the horses-of course old, hard
corn—we roasted a little of it for ourselves.</p>
          <p>On the third day we overhauled a commissary train, in a by-road
we were traveling to escape the jam and the mud, and Captain
McCarthy, making known the extreme need of his men, begged
rations enough to give them just one meal; but the officer in charge
answered:</p>
          <p>“I cannot issue you anything, Captain, except upon the order of
General Griffith, your brigadier, or my commanding officer.”</p>
          <p>To which our captain replied:</p>
          <p>“General Griffith is somewhere between here and Richmond, I
don't know where your commanding officer is; but
<pb id="stiles86" n="86"/>
if you can't give me anything, except upon the order of one of
these two officers, then I can take what my men need, on my
own order, and I'll do it. Here, boys, drive a gun up here in the
road ahead of this train, unlimber it and load it. Now, sir, you
shan't pass here without issuing three days' rations for my
men; but I'll give you a written statement of what has
occurred, signed by me!”</p>
          <p>We sprang with a shout to execute the Captain's order, and
in a few moments had our three days' rations, cooking them in
the few utensils we always kept with us, and soon made a
good square meal. I suppose Captain McCarthy's conduct was
deemed justifiable, as no notice of a court-martial or a court of
inquiry was ever served upon him.</p>
          <p>It was, however, some days before the supply departments
were thoroughly organized, after the disorganization and
paralysis of the fearful mud deluge, and meanwhile not only
did we artillerymen once more come down to hard pan and
hard corn, but one evening General Griffith, who was a
charming gentleman, rode over to where our battery was
parked, saying to our captain that he came to beg three favors—a
couple of ears of corn for himself, a feed for his horse,
and a song from our Glee Club—to all of which he was made
royally welcome, and he sat right down about our camp fire
and roasted and ate his corn with us.</p>
          <p>The boys used to say, “ten ears to a horse, two to a man— 
which shows that a horse is equal to five men.” Later in the
war this ratio was practically vindicated, for the supply of
horses got to be in every sense a prime necessity with the field
artillery of the Confederate armies. Many a time, during the
campaign of '64, have I heard artillery officers of the Army of
Northern Virginia—belonging to different corps
meeting for the first time after heavy fighting, in which the
commands of both had been engaged, exchange some such
greeting as this:</p>
          <p>“Well, old fellow, how did you come out? How many horses
did you lose? Lose any men?”</p>

          </argument>
          <p>I turn back a moment to the mud and the march up the
Peninsula, in order to relate a reminiscence illustrative of
several matters of interest, aside from the mud, such as the
state of the currency, the semi-quizzical character and bearing
of the Confederate soldier and his marked respect for private
property, as well as the practical limitations to that respect.</p>
          <p>The column had halted at New Kent Court House, a little
hamlet in the great pine forest, then and now boasting not over
a half dozen houses, in addition to the tavern and the temple of
justice. The infantry had broken ranks and most of them were
resting and chatting, seated or reclined upon the banks of the
somewhat sunken road. On one side had been a large
cabbage patch from which the heads had been cut the
preceding fall, leaving the stalks in the ground, which under
the genial spring suns and rains,—it was the middle of
May,—had greened out into what I think are termed
“collards” or “sprouts.” They were just what the soldiers
longed for and required, and an enterprising fellow sauntered
up to the fence and offered an old woman, who stood near by,
“a dollar for one of them green things.”</p>
          <p>The price was fixed not by the seller but by the purchaser
and clearly under the combined influence of three
considerations he thought so much of the sprout, and so little
of the dollar, and then that dollar was probably the smallest
money he had.</p>
          <pb id="stiles88" n="88"/>
          <p>No sooner said than done, and by the time the fellow paid his
dollar and began browsing upon his sprout, the fence which was
about breast high and a very flimsy affair, was lined with soldiers,
each with his right arm extended toward the old woman, a one-dollar
Confederate Treasury note fluttering in his fingers. I can see and
hear them now:</p>
          <p>“Here, miss, please let me have one; I'm a heap hungrier'n these
other men.”</p>
          <p>“But, mother, I'm a sick man and <hi rend="italics">such</hi> a good boy; you ought to
'tend to me first.”</p>
          <p>And so it went; and so went the old woman, backward and
forward, jerking the sprouts out of the ground with wondrous speed,
and as fast as she gathered an armful, striding along the fence,
distributing them and raking in the dollars. I never witnessed a
brisker trade in cabbage; but the buyers were so eager and the
pressure of the leaning men became so great, that the fence, the frail
barrier between “<sic corr="teum"><hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">tuum</foreign></hi></sic> and <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">meum</foreign></hi>,” suddenly gave way, and quicker
than I can tell it there wasn't a sprout left in the patch.</p>
          <p>The men had no intention of breaking into the enclosure, but
Providence having removed the fence, they followed up the
Providential indications by removing the sprouts. It is not easy to
say just what the purchasing power of these dollars was, but at that
comparatively early date it is easy to see that the old woman,
counting only the money she actually got, made an astounding sale
of her entire crop of sprouts.</p>
          <p>At last we arrived and took our places in the outer line of
defenses of Richmond, McClellan at first establishing his lines
behind the Chickahominy—his base of supplies being White
House, on York River;—but he soon threw across, that is to our
side, the Richmond side, of the Chickahominy River and swamp, a
considerable force, strongly fortifying its position. Still it was
manifest, or seemed to be, that this force on the Richmond side was
not strong enough, without drawing aid from the other side, to repel
an attack by the entire army of Johnston. The water in the swamp
suddenly rose and apparently cut off communication with the other
side. Seven Pines was an attack upon the Federal force oil the
Richmond side of the stream and swamp, with the view
<pb id="stiles89" n="89"/>
of destroying it while it could not be reinforced from the main body
beyond the stream, and, as is well known, General Johnston was
struck down and totally disabled just at the crisis of the action.</p>
          <p>When the commanding general of an army, especially upon the
attacking side, is struck down while his plans are developing, it is
ordinarily not possible to say with confidence what would have
been the result of the engagement if no such calamity had befallen
the attacking force. Seven Pines is therefore what may properly be
termed an indecisive, if not an abortive, battle. While the determined
fighting on the Confederate side probably contributed to delay a
general advance by McClellan, thus giving time for Lee to get thorough hold
upon his army, to acquire their confidence, to mature his plans
generally, and in particular to arrange for the withdrawal of Jackson
from the Valley, yet it must be admitted that, as to the main design
of the Confederates, the battle was a failure.</p>
          <p>Doubtless, to the Southern people and soldiers generally, after
the Seven Days' battles, Seven Pines seemed to measure up to its
chief significance as the fight which resulted in removing Joseph E.
Johnston from the command of the main army of the Confederacy
and putting Robert E. Lee in his place; and I think likely it did so
present itself to me at the time—indeed such is my recollection. But
after the war it was my good fortune to be honored with the close
and intimate friendship of General Johnston,—closer and more
intimate than I ever enjoyed with any other of the great Southern
leaders,—and the knowledge thus acquired of the man himself has
imparted to the strange fatality of his being stricken down at Seven
Pines, <hi rend="italics">with the tenth honorable wound received in battle,</hi> and to
other unfortunate features of his career, a new and almost pathetic
interest.</p>
          <p>I found him, both as a man and a soldier, to be very different from
my previous estimate of him and in every way above that estimate;
so that, in looking upon the glorious career of Lee, I have
sometimes felt inclined to say in behalf of my friend what he never
said for himself: “Who can tell? It might have been!” And I do here
say of him, in a
<pb id="stiles90" n="90"/>
single sentence, that as a trained, professional soldier, I do not
believe he ever had his superior, if indeed his equal, on this
continent; while as a man, he was one of the purest and strongest I
ever knew, and perhaps the most affectionate.</p>
          <p>When he ran for Congress in 1878 against the candidate of the
combined Greenback and Republican parties, in a district including
Richmond City and several counties, I was chairman of his campaign
committee, and heartily wish it were appropriate to relate many of the
incidents of the campaign so graphically illustrating how world-wide
apart are the soldier and the politician. I must, however, be pardoned
for telling one.</p>
          <p>He came to his headquarters one morning much outraged at what I
had not heard of and, of course, had not authorized—the erection of
a banner, the night before, in the strongest manufacturing ward in the
city, with his name upon it and some popular catchword or phrase
squinting obscurely at “protection.” Upon military principles he held
me responsible, but I soon ascertained that it had been done with the
approval of a shrewd and experienced practical politician, who was
also an influential member of the committee, and I deemed it proper to
call that body together. Upon their assembling the General took the
matter entirely out of my hands, saying substantially and with very
hot emphasis: “Gentlemen, this is a matter about which I do not
propose to ask your advice, because it involves my conscience and
my personal honor. I spoke yesterday, at Louisa Court House, under
a ‘free-trade’ flag. I have never ridden ‘both sides of the sapling,’ and I
don't propose to learn how at this late day. That banner in Clay Ward
comes down to-day or I retire from this canvass by published card
to-morrow.”</p>
          <p>I have said he was the most affectionate of men. It will surprise
many, who saw only the iron bearing of the soldier, to hear that we
never met, or parted for any length of time, that he did not, if we were
alone, throw his arms about me and kiss me, and that such was his
habit in parting from or greeting his male relatives and most
cherished friends. I will only add that he and General Lee entertained
the most exalted estimate and opinion of each other, and when—very
<pb id="stiles91" n="91"/>
late in the war, I think in February, 1865—Lee was made practical
dictator and commander-in-chief of all the armies of the Confederacy,
his very first act as such was the restoration of Joseph E. Johnston
to the command of the army from which he had been removed when
Hood was put in his place.</p>
          <p>As to the actual fighting at Seven Pines, we took part in it, yet not
a very prominent part. Among the heroes of the day were our old
Leesburg acquaintance, now Major-General D. H. Hill, whose
division covered itself and its commander with blood and glory, by
one of the most dogged and deadly fights on record; and Captain,
afterwards Colonel, Tom Carter, of the King William Artillery—yesterday
the ideal artillerist, the idol of the artillery of the Army of
Northern Virginia, to-day an ideal Southern gentleman and the
efficient Proctor of our State University. He is a cousin of Robert E.
Lee, and combines more of the modesty, simplicity, purity, and valor
of his great kinsman than any other living man of my acquaintance.</p>
          <p>At Seven Pines his battery made a phenomenal fight against an
overwhelming weight of metal, and while Carter was sitting on his
horse, with one foot in the stirrup and the other thrown across the
pommel of his saddle, directing the undismayed fight of the
undestroyed fragment of his battery, up rode our old friend “D. H.,”
and in the midst of the awful carnage and destruction, once more
gave expression to his monomania on the subject of fighting pluck
by rising in his stirrups, saluting Carter and his men and declaring he
had rather be captain of the King William Artillery than President of
the Confederate States. But, as before said, this battle lives and will
live in history, mainly as that which brought together for the first
time the great Captain and the tattered soldiery, which ere long made
the world ring with their fame.</p>
          <p>Lee's grand plan of the Seven Days' battles has been so often
expatiated upon by able soldiers and writers that I could scarcely
hope to add anything of intrinsic value to the discussion, so I
propose to give what I have to say on the topic by way of
post-bellum reminiscence.</p>
          <p>It has been noted with surprise how many distinguished and
devout clergymen of the Church of England have admitted
<pb id="stiles92" n="92"/>
an irrepressible lifelong yearning for the army. My recollection
is that this feeling crops out more or less in Kingsley; I am sure it
runs like a refrain through Frederick William Robertson's life and
letters and appears perhaps in his sermons. Years ago, when he who
is now Rev. Dr. Rainsford, of St. George's, New York, was a glorious
youth, he conducted a most successful mission in St. Paul's Church,
Richmond, Va., and drew some of us very close to him. Toward the
close of his work he asked Col. Archer Anderson and myself to walk
with him over the field of the Seven Days' battles, or as much of it as
we could “do” on foot in a day. We started early one crisp February
morning, the Colonel and I full of interest, but fearful that we could
not keep up with the giant stride of our comrade, who was a trained
athlete and one of the most heroic-looking specimens of young
manhood I ever beheld. We could not help thinking what a soldier he
would have made. He was not then a Reverend Doctor and will, I am
sure, pardon me for speaking of him on this occasion as “Rainsford.”</p>
          <p>We explained to him the positions of the two armies just before the
opening of the battle; that Lee's was on this, the Richmond, side of
the Chickahominy, which was generally impassable, except where the
various roads, running out of Richmond like the spokes of a wheel,
crossed it; that McClellan's army was on both sides of the stream or
swamp, the bulk of it perhaps at this time on the Richmond side, but
he had established and fortified free communication between his two
wings; also that Jackson had been secretly drawn down from the
Valley, and was now hovering, hawk fashion, somewhere over
beyond and back of McClellan's right flank.</p>
          <p>We next showed him the disparity in numbers, McClellan, by his
own report, dated June 20, 1862, six days before the fighting began,
having “Present for duty one hundred and five thousand eight
hundred and twenty-five (105,825) men;” and as he was anticipating
battle and calling lustily for reinforcements, his force was probably
substantially increased during these six days; while Lee, as
demonstrated by Col. Walter H. Taylor, adjutant-general of his army,
and Gen. Jubal A. Early, both better informed on the subject
<pb id="stiles93" n="93"/>
than any other man ever was, had a little under or a little over eighty
thousand (80,000) men present for duty when the fight opened,
including Jackson's forces. Moreover, our inferiority in artillery, both
as to number and character of guns, and as to ammunition also, was
shocking.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, we were walking out, to and across the Chickahominy,
by the Mechanicsville turnpike or the Meadow Bridge road, the last
of which debouched on the other side of the stream, a little to our left
of the end of the Federal lines, this being the road by which Lee's
first attacking column filed out on the 26th of June, '62, swung
around McClellan's right flank and burst like an electric bolt upon the
besieging army; the next and supporting column marching out by the
Mechanicsville pike as soon as the first had cleared that road.</p>
          <p>We explained Jackson's part in the plan, entering the fight the next
day, on the left of the troops from Richmond and further in rear of
McClellan's right flank; our combined forces driving his right
wing—which was most ably handled and gallantly fought—back upon his
centre, from which troops had been already drawn to support his
right.</p>
          <p>We pointed out to him the audacious boldness of Lee's plan in
withdrawing approximately two-thirds of his army from the lines
about Richmond for this attack, so that barely 28,000 men were left
between the Federal army and the Confederate capital.</p>
          <p>And when at last McClellan succeeded in getting all of his hard-pressed
troops across to the Richmond side, this 28,000 men, who had
not yet been engaged, uniting with their victorious comrades, fell like
an avalanche (or rather had orders to fall-nearly one-third of them did
not fire a shot) upon his worn-out, beaten, and dispirited troops,
drove them pell-mell under the guns of their James River fleet, and
but for failure of subordinates to carry out instructions Lee would
undoubtedly have dictated terms of surrender to his gallant foe.</p>
          <p>We went out on the Meadow Bridge or Mechanicsville road,
made the entire sweep, and returned, I think, by the Williamsburg
road, the York River Railroad, and the New
<pb id="stiles94" n="94"/>
Bridge road—at all events, we could scarcely have walked much, if
any, less than twenty-eight to thirty miles. It was one of the most
enjoyable days of my life. Rainsford caught the plan instantly. Going
over it in detail with him, upon the very spots, and climbing the very
slopes up which Lee's legions had rushed to the charge, he was
thrilled to almost savage excitement, yelling like a rebel infantryman,
his giant frame and his grand face absolutely inspired. In his martial
ecstasy he threw his great arms about us, hugging us, to our
imminent peril; declaring he had loved us both at first sight, but
could never forget us now, and that to have lived in and been a part
of those days and those battles was enough to lift men forever to
heroic stature and character.</p>
          <p>Our battery was among the 28,000 men left on the Richmond side
of the Chickahominy, to defend the capital, to occupy the attention
of McClellan's troops on this side, and to prevent their recrossing to
the aid of their hard-pressed comrades on the other; but the real
defenders of the city were the men who stormed the bloody heights
at Gaines' Mill and the positions at Mechanicsville and Cold Harbor.
We were in General Magruder's command and were kept most of the
time hitched up and ready to move at a moment's warning. We were
subjected now and then to fire from Federal batteries, suffered some
loss of horses and equipment, and several of our men were wounded,
but there were no serious casualties.</p>
          <p>On the 29th of June—Sunday, I think it was—General Magruder
advanced his troops along the Nine-Mile road to feel the enemy,
when the main thing that struck us was the immense quantity of
abandoned stores and equipment, indicating how abundant had
been the supply of the Federal forces and how great the
demoralization of their retreat. Near Savage Station there must have
been acres covered by stacks of burning boxes of bacon, crackers,
and desiccated vegetables—“desecrated vegetables,” our boys
called them. To us poorly-equipped and half-starved rebels it was a
revelation. Here and elsewhere we picked up a few rations and a few
choice equipments of various kinds, but had really
<pb id="stiles95" n="95"/>
neither time nor taste for plunder. There were other mementoes of
their stay and of their hasty departure left by “our friends the
enemy,” not quite so attractive or appetizing—the ghastly leavings of
numerous field hospitals; pale, naked corpses and grotesque piles of
arms and legs.</p>
          <p>At one of these hospital stations we found an Irishman, whom we
at first thought dying, as perhaps he was; but a swallow or two of
the “crathur” revived him, and when, under such inspiration, did Pat
ever fail to be communicative and witty? He seemed to grasp the
situation perfectly, and upon some one asking if the apparent flight
might not after all be a trap—“Be dad,” said he, “an' ef it's a thrap,
thin shure <hi rend="italics">an' little Mac's lost the thrigger!</hi>”</p>
          <p>At or near Savage Station, I think on this 29th of June, our brigade
commander, General Griffith, was killed. In a shower of projectiles
turned loose upon us by an unseen foe, at least half a shell from a
three-inch rifled gun lodged in his body. The marvel is he did not die
instantly, but I noted the desperate clinch of his fingers and the
pallor of his face as he clasped his hands back of his head after he
had fallen from his horse. He was a genial and cultured gentleman
and regarded as a very promising officer. Colonel Barksdale, of the
Thirteenth, at once took command of the brigade, and was soon
commissioned brigadier.</p>
          <p>We then crossed over to the York River Railroad, upon which we
had what our men called our “railroad gun,” a siege piece, mounted
on a flat-car with an engine back of it, the front of the car being
protected by rails of track iron fastened upon an incline, the mouth
of the gun projecting a little as from an embrasure. As it puffed up, a
number of Federal batteries, invisible to us, opened upon it and
upon the troops, and General Magruder sent an order for our guns
to cross the railroad by the bridge hard by and come into battery in
the smooth, hard field beyond.</p>
          <p>We executed this dashing feat in gallant style, our captain riding
ahead, the pieces in a wild gallop and the men on a wild run
following. Again we seemed to be in full sight of an unseen enemy,
for the bridge was raked and swept by a fearful storm of shot and
shell. I distinctly remember the
<pb id="stiles96" n="96"/>
shells bursting in my very face, and the bridge must have been struck
repeatedly, the great splinters hurtling past and cutting the air like
flashes of lightning, yet no one was hurt. Once across, we were
ordered, “Forward into battery, left oblique, march!” which elaborate
movement was executed by the men as if on drill. I could not refrain
from glancing around, and was amazed to see every piece, limber,
caisson and man in the exact mathematical position in which each
belonged, and every man seemed to have struck the very attitude
required by the drill-book. And there we all stood, raked by a terrific
fire, to which we could not reply, being really a second line, the
first—consisting of infantry alone—having passed into the dense, forbidding
forest in front, feeling for the enemy. And so it was most of the way
to Malvern Hill. The country not admitting of the use of cavalry to
any extent, we were constantly playing at “lost-ball,” and exposed to
galling fire from a foe we could not see, and to whom we generally
could not reply because our infantry was in the woods in front of us.</p>
          <p>But two things delighted us greatly: Our old brigade had been in
our rear when we dashed across the bridge, taking the fire from them— 
and not only did they witness this, but they were lying down behind
us when we executed the beautiful movement and made the staunch,
soldierly stand in the open field beyond; so they cheered us
enthusiastically the next time we moved by them.</p>
          <p>The second morning after,—just as we came into battery on the
field of Frazier's (or Frayser's) farm, where the fighting had closed
after dark the preceding day, and which on that morning presented
perhaps the most ideal view of a battle-field I ever saw,—captured
cannon, exploded limbers and caissons, dead horses and dead men
scattered over it in most picturesque fashion,—Col. Stephen D. Lee,
of the artillery, afterwards lieutenant-general, rode out in front of our
guns, took off his hat to us and said that he had witnessed and
remarked upon our performance of two days ago, at the railroad
bridge and in the field, as General Magruder had also; that nothing
could have been more soldierly, and having thus shown ourselves
equal to the most trying duty of the
<pb id="stiles97" n="97"/>
soldier, the duty of standing and receiving fire without replying to it,
he had determined we should certainly have the opportunity of
seeing how well we could perform the easier part of returning fire,
blow for blow—an opportunity we certainly did have at Malvern Hill,
<hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">ad satietatem</foreign></hi>, or <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">ad nauseam</foreign></hi>, as the case might be, according
to the degree and intensity of a man's hankering and hungering for
fight. As for our own feelings upon this subject, just at this time, we
had but that moment turned our backs upon a scene no ways
calculated to impart hot stomach for battle.</p>
          <p>The six brigades of General Magruder's command—Barksdale's, to
which we were attached, being one—had arrived at Frazier's farm the
preceding night after dark and too late to take part in the
engagement. We were overpowered with fatigue, intent only on
sleep, and sank to rest amid the wreck and death of the hard-fought
field. In the shadowy dawn, as our guns, moving into position to
reopen the fight, threaded their way through the confused bivouac
of the slumbering, the dying and the dead—the mysterious hush of
the battle-field resting over all—we saw, side by side, upturned
together to the bleaching dew, the pale faces of the breathing and
the breathless sleepers, not distinguishable in the dim morning
twilight. Suddenly the drums beat to arms and the living rose,—and
then the stolidest veteran in that vast multitude shuddered as he left
the side of his ghastly bedfellow who had rested with him so quietly
all that summer night, and by whose side the frame that now shrank
away with horror might rest to-night as ghastly as he.</p>
          <p>All of us had been longing for a sight of Jackson. It is impossible
to exaggerate or even to convey an adequate idea of the excitement
and furor concerning him about this time, both in the army and
among the people.</p>
          <p>On Sunday evening, not far from Savage Station, I had been
struck directly over the heart by a spent ball, which glanced from a
buckle, but blackened my breast and nauseated me somewhat. Next
morning, still feeling badly and the battery remaining stationary for a
time, I had retired a little from the line and was half reclining at the
foot of a huge pine that stood on the edge of the Williamsburg
road. Hearing
<pb id="stiles98" n="98"/>
the jingle of cavalry accoutrements toward the Chickahominy, I
looked up and saw a half-dozen mounted men, and riding
considerably in advance a solitary horseman, whom I instantly
recognized as the great wizard of the marvelous Valley Campaign
which had so thrilled the army and the country.</p>
          <p>Jackson and the little sorrel stopped in the middle of the road,
probably not fifty feet off, while his staff halted perhaps a hundred
and fifty yards in his rear. He sat stark and stiff in the saddle. Horse
and rider appeared worn down to the lowest point of flesh
consistent with effective service. His hair, skin, eyes, and clothes
were all one neutral dust tint, and his badges of rank so dulled and
tarnished as to be scarcely perceptible. The “mangy little cadet cap”
was pulled so low in front that the visor cut the glint of his eyeballs.</p>
          <p> A ghastly scene was spread across the road hard by. The
Seventeenth and Twenty-first Mississippi, of our brigade, had been
ordered into the woods about dusk the evening before and told not
to fire into the first line they met; but the poor fellows ran into a
Federal brigade and were shocked and staggered by a deadly volley.
Splendid soldiers that they were, they obeyed orders, held their own
fire, laid down and took the enemy's. Almost every man struck was
killed, and every man killed shot through the brain. Their comrades
had gone into the woods as soon as it was light, brought out the
bodies and laid them in rows, with hands crossed upon the breast,
but eyes wide-staring. A sickly summer rain had fallen in the night
and the faces of the dead were bleached with more than death's
pallor. Every eyeball was strained upward toward the spot where the
bullet had crashed through the skull, and every forehead stained
with ooze and trickle of blood. Men were passing through the silent
lilies, bending low, seeking in the distorted faces to identify their
friends.</p>
          <p>Jackson glanced a moment toward this scene. Not a muscle
quivered as he resumed his steady gaze down the road toward
Richmond. He was the ideal of concentration—imperturbable,
resistless. I remember feeling that if he were not a very good man he
would be a very bad one. By
<pb id="stiles99" n="99"/>
a ludicrous turn of the association of ideas, the old darky minister's
illustration of faith flashed through my brain: “Bredren, ef de Lord
tell me to jump through a stone wall, I's gwine to jump at it; jumpin'
at it 'longs to me, goin' through it 'longs to God.” The man before me
would have jumped at anything the Lord told him to jump through.</p>
          <p>A moment later and his gaze was rewarded. A magnificent staff
approached from the direction of Richmond, and riding at its head,
superbly mounted, a born king among men. At that time General Lee
was one of the handsomest of men, especially on horseback, and
that morning every detail of the dress and equipment of himself and
horse was absolute perfection. When he recognized Jackson he
rode forward with a courier, his staff halting. As he gracefully
dismounted, handing his bridle rein to his attendant, and advanced,
drawing the gauntlet from his right hand, Jackson flung himself off
his horse and advanced to meet Lee, the little sorrel trotting back to
the staff, where a courier secured him.</p>
          <p>The two generals greeted each other warmly, but wasted no time
upon the greeting. They stood facing each other, some thirty feet
from where I lay, Lee's left side and back toward me, Jackson's right
and front. Jackson began talking in a jerky, impetuous way,
meanwhile drawing a diagram on the ground with the toe of his right
boot. He traced two sides of a triangle with promptness and
decision; then starting at the end of the second line, began to draw a
third projected toward the first. This third line he traced slowly and
with hesitation, alternately looking up at Lee's face and down at his
diagram, meanwhile talking earnestly; and when at last the third line
crossed the first and the triangle was complete, he raised his foot
and stamped it down with emphasis, saying, “We've got him;”
then
signalled for his horse, and when he came, vaulted awkwardly into
the saddle and was off. Lee watched him a moment, the courier
brought his horse, he mounted, and he and his staff rode away.</p>
          <p>The third line was never drawn—so we never “got” McClellan.</p>
          <pb id="stiles100" n="100"/>
          <p>I question if any other man witnessed this interview—certainly no
other was as near the two generals. At times I could hear their words,
though they were uttered, for the most part, in the low tones of close
and earnest conference. As the two faced each other, except that the
difference in height was not great, the contrast between them could
not have been more striking—in feature, figure, dress, voice, style,
bearing, manner, everything, in short, that expressed the essential
individuality of the two men. It was the Cavalier and the Puritan in
intensest embodiment. These two great roots and stocks of British
manhood had borne each its consummate flower in the rank soil of
the New World.</p>

          <head>MALVERN HILL AND THE EFFECT OF THE SEVEN DAYS'
BATTLES</head>
          <argument>
            <p>Not a Confederate Victory—The Federal Artillery Fire—Demoralization of Lee's
Army—“McClellan Will Be Gone by Daylight”—The Weight of Lee's
Sword—Stuart—Pelham—Pegram—“Extra Billy”—To Battle in a Trotting
Sulky—The Standard of Courage.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>I have said nothing as yet about Malvern Hill. No Confederate
cares to say anything about it. If McClellan had done nothing else in
the seven days to stamp him as a general, and his army nothing else
to stamp them as soldiers, beyond the selection of this position, the
disposition and handling of his artillery, and the stubborn and
successful stand there made, after and in spite of the experiences of
the six days preceding—the reputation, both of general and of
soldiers, might well be rested on this basis alone. If it had been a
single, isolated battle, it would have gone down into history simply
and squarely as a defeat for the Confederates, and even when
viewed in its historic connection, it must yet be admitted that all our
assaults were repulsed and our pursuit so staggered that the Federal general was
allowed to withdraw his army without being closely pressed.</p>
          <p> Upon our side there was not a single relieving feature in the
picture. In the first place, the battle ought never to have been fought
where it was. If the orders of Lee had been carried out, it would not
have been, for McClellan would never have reached this position.
The “third line,” of which Lee and Jackson spoke in the interview
described in the preceding chapter, was never drawn. The
understanding in the army at the time was that Huger and Holmes
were to have drawn it, but that their commands lost their way in
<pb id="stiles102" n="102"/>
the almost trackless forest. In an address on “The Campaigns
of Gen. Robert E. Lee,” delivered at Washington and
Lee University in 1872, on January 19th, Lee's birthday,
Gen. Jubal A. Early says: “* * * Holmes' command, over
six thousand strong, did not actually engage in any of the
battles.” But Col. Walter H. Taylor, in his “Four Years
with General Lee,” published in 1877, already referred to,
repeats three times—on pages 51, 53, and 54—that Holmes'
command numbered ten thousand or more; and it is obvious,
upon a comparison of the two statements, that Early's figures,
“over six thousand,” did not include Ransom's brigade,
which numbered thirty-six hundred.</p>
          <p>It seems incredible, yet it appears to be true, that General Holmes
was very deaf; so deaf that, when heaven and earth were shuddering
with the thunder of artillery and the faces of his own men were
blanched with the strain, he placed his hand behind his car, and
turning to a member of his staff, said, “I think I hear guns.” The story
was told by one of his own brigadiers, and if anything approximating
to it was true, then a great responsibility rests upon some one for
putting an officer so far disabled in charge of troops,—especially at
such a crisis and for such a service,—whatever his other
qualifications may have been.</p>
          <p>As before stated, General Lee left but twenty-eight thousand men
on the Richmond side of the Chickahominy when he crossed to the
other side to attack McClellan, and of course looked to these fresh
troops, when his victorious but decimated and worn-out soldiers had
driven the enemy into their arms, to fall upon the Federal general and
gather the fruits of victory. But here are more than one-third of these
fresh troops, and the very ones Lee had arranged should cut off the
retreat of his gallant foe, that never got into action at all, and
McClellan was permitted to reach and occupy the strong position
which saved his army and cost the lives of thousands of ours. And
even this was not all. Magruder, a most vigorous officer, to whose
command we were attached, lost his way and thus delayed the attack
and gave McClellan further time for his dispositions. And when at
last we did attack, it was in a disconnected and desultory
<pb id="stiles103" n="103"/>
fashion, which even to a private soldier seemed to promise no good
result. But I cannot give a fairer or better idea of our view of the
battle than by quoting from pages 48, 49 of Colonel Taylor's
admirable book:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>From these extracts I think it will be clear to the candid reader that the
retreat to the James River was a compulsory one, and due to a defeat then
acknowledged by General McClellan himself.</p>
            <p>The fighting, however, was not invariably attended with success to the
Confederates; notably, the defense of Malvern Hill by the Federals was in favor
of the latter, which result was as much due to the mismanagement of the
Confederate troops as to the naturally strong position occupied by the Federals
and their gallantry in its defense.</p>
            <p>
Considerable delay was occasioned in the pursuit from the fact that the
ground was unknown to the Confederate commanders. On this occasion General
Magruder took the wrong route and had to be recalled, thereby losing much
precious time; and when after serious and provoking delay the lines were
formed for attack, there was some misunderstanding of the orders of the
commanding general, and instead of a spirited, united advance by the entire
line, as contemplated, the divisions were moved forward at different times,
each attacking independently, and each in turn repulsed. Moreover, owing to
the peculiar character of the ground, artillery could not be advantageously
placed to aid the assaulting columns; whereas the Federal batteries, strongly
posted and most handsomely served, contributed in a very great degree to the
successful stand made by McClellan's retreating army at Malvern Hill.</p>
          </q>
          <p>I have characterized the foregoing as a fair statement, as it
certainly is, and yet even this fails to convey an adequate impression
of the stunning and temporarily depressing effect of this battle upon
our army. As to my own experience and feelings, the revelation I am
about to make may be a damaging one, yet I have no desire to sail
under false colors, and then, too, my own case may serve to confirm
and in part to explain the remarkable statements below made as to the
sudden and fearful deterioration in the condition of our army which
this battle, for the time, effected.</p>
          <p>Three of the guns of the old battery were put in action against
McClellan's majestic aggregation of batteries, by way of at least
making a diversion in favor of our assaulting
<pb id="stiles104" n="104"/>
infantry, a diversion which I presume we to some extent
accomplished; for I never conceived anything approximating the
shower and storm of projectiles and the overwhelming cataclysm of
destruction which were at once turned upon our pitiful little
popguns. In the short time they existed as effective pieces they were
several times fired by fragments of Federal shell striking them after
the lanyard was stretched and before it was pulled; and in almost
less time than it takes to tell it the carriages were completely crushed,
smashed, and splintered and the guns themselves so injured and
defaced that we were compelled to send them to Richmond, after the
battle, to be remoulded.</p>
          <p>We were put in action, too, after a long, hot run. I was as sound
and strong as human flesh could well be, and yet my lungs seemed
to be pumped out, my brain reeled and my tongue clave to the roof
of my mouth, which was burnt so dry that I experienced great
difficulty in swallowing. Nevertheless, I managed to do my part in
serving my gun, until, in a few moments, it was completely disabled,
when I fell to the earth, a horror of great darkness came upon me, and
the only distinct impression I can recall is that I felt I would be glad
to compromise on annihilation.</p>
          <p>When I roused myself from this semi-stupor or swoon
the detachment seemed to have disappeared, but in a few
moments I found most of the men. I remember catching by
the collar one who had dropped down, “all in a heap,” in an
unnecessarily exposed position on the projecting root of a
large tree, and jerking him up; when on the instant a shell
tore to pieces the root upon which he had been seated, and
yet he sank down again but a step or two from the spot. It
was the first battle in which members of the company had
been killed outright. The wonder is that any survived who
were working these three pieces; but I suppose it is to be
accounted for by the fact that the guns were quickly disabled
and put out of action.</p>
          <p>According to his own report of June 20, 1862, McClellan had three
hundred and forty pieces of field artillery. I see no reason for
doubting that a very large proportion of these were massed upon
Malvern Hill. Nothing human can long
<pb id="stiles105" n="105"/>
withstand the fire of such a mass of artillery concentrated, as the
Federal guns at Malvern Hill were, upon very short attacking lines of
infantry. Colonel Taylor says divisions were marched forward at
different times, each attacking independently and each in turn
repulsed. I think it was even worse than this, and that in some cases
single brigades advanced to the attack and were almost literally
swept backward by what seemed to be the fire of a continuous line
of battle of artillery.</p>
          <p>The effect of these repeated bloody repulses can hardly be
conceived. One fearful feature was the sudden and awful revulsion
of feeling among our soldiers, inspired by six days of constant
victory and relentless pursuit of a retreating foe. The demoralization
was great and the evidences of it palpable everywhere. The roads
and forests were full of stragglers; commands were inextricably
confused, some, for the time, having actually disappeared. Those
who retained sufficient self-respect and sense of responsibility to
think of the future were filled with the deepest apprehension. I know
that this was the state of mind of some of our strongest and best
officers; in fact, I do not know of any general officer in the army,
save one, who did not entertain the gloomiest forebodings, and I
recall hearing at the time, or rather a day or so afterwards,
substantially the same story of that one which within the last few
years and a short time before his own death was related by Dr.
Hunter McGuire, Jackson's medical director, a man whom of all men
he loved and trusted next after his great chief, Robert Lee. I quote
from an address first delivered by Doctor McGuire at Lexington, but
repeated several times afterwards by special request:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>At Malvern Hill, when a portion of our army was beaten and to some
extent demoralized, Hill and Ewell and Early came to tell him that they could
make no resistance if McClellan attacked them in the morning. It was difficult
to wake General Jackson, as he was exhausted and very sound asleep. I tried it
myself, and after many efforts, partly succeeded. When he was made to
understand what was wanted he said: “McClellan and his army will be gone by
daylight,” and went to sleep again. The generals thought him mad, but the
prediction was true.</p>
          </q>
          <p>The Hill here referred to is probably not our old friend “D. H.,”
but A. P. Hill, a more brilliant soldier, yet, perhaps,
<pb id="stiles106" n="106"/>
not so peculiarly distinguished for imperturbable grit. The
story illustrates two of the greatest and most distinguishing traits
and powers of Jackson as a general: he did not know what
demoralization meant, and he never failed to know just what his
adversary thought and felt and proposed to do. In the present
instance, not only did all that Jackson said and implied turn out to be
true, that McClellan was thinking only of escape, and never dreamed
of viewing the battle of Malvern Hill in any other aspect, but in an
incredibly short time our army had recovered its tone and had come
to take the same view of the matter. Indeed, as I believe, nothing but
another untoward accident prevented McClellan's surrendering his
entire army to Lee, notwithstanding his successful defense at
Malvern Hill. The matter will be found circumstantially set out in
Colonel Taylor's book, pages 41-44, substantiated and confirmed by
a full extract from General Stuart's manuscript of “Reports and Notes
on the War,” and also by extracts from the report of the “Committee
on the Conduct of the War,” and is in outline as follows:</p>
          <p>Stuart, Lee's chief of cavalry, following up McClellan's movements
after Malvern Hill, from the heights above West over, overlooked the
entire Federal army huddled together in the river bottoms of and
adjacent to Westover plantation, apparently in a state of utter
disorganization and unpreparedness, and he could not resist the
temptation of dropping a few shells among them, which produced a
perfect stampede among the troops and wagons, but at the same time
had the effect of calling the attention of the Federal commanders to
the fact that the position of their army was utterly untenable without
command of the heights from which these shells had been fired, and
they immediately sent a heavy force to take possession of them.
Stuart at once informed General Lee and received word that Jackson
and Longstreet were <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">en route</foreign></hi> to support him; but again the guides
proved incompetent, and Longstreet was led six or seven miles out of
the way, and Stuart, after resisting as long as he could, was
compelled to yield possession of the heights, which were promptly
occupied and fortified by an
<pb id="stiles107" n="107"/>
adequate Federal force, and McClellan's army was, for the first time,
safe from successful attack.</p>
          <p>After having for the third time traced the failure of the plans of the
Confederates to the incompetence or to the delinquency of guides,— 
in the misleading of Holmes and Huger, of Magruder, and now of
Longstreet,—it seems proper to remark that the entire region which
was the theatre of the Seven Days' battles is, for the most part,
covered by heavy pine forests and cypress swamps, and these
traversed by many wood roads, or paths rather, undistinguishable
the one from the other. The confusing character of the country is
well illustrated by the fact that the last time I went there, with a party
of survivors of our old battery, with the view, if possible, of
identifying certain positions occupied by our guns in the campaign
of '64, we had two guides born and reared in the neighborhood and
who professed to be perfectly familiar with the country and with the
positions we desired to find; and yet these men insisted upon
leading us astray, and would have done so, but that my recollection
and my instinct of locality were so opposed to their views that I
simply refused to be misled. Unassisted and unaccompanied I found
the first position sought, the rest of the party, with the guides,
wandering around for hours and finally working around to me. But it
should be remembered that the generals who were misled by guides,
to the disarrangement and defeat of General Lee's perfectly-arranged
plans, so far at least as I have reason to believe, had never been in
the region before.</p>
          <p>Yet, once more. “Stuart, glorious Stuart,” as Colonel Taylor justly
calls him, while his boyish indiscretion in firing into the huddled
masses of the enemy from Evelington heights, before informing
General Lee of the situation, was apparently the cause of the loss of
another great opportunity—yet it should not be forgotten, in this
connection, that the great plan of the Seven Days battles owed its
inspiration, or at least its completion and perfection, to the
information derived from Stuart's marvelous ride around McClellan's
entire army just in advance of Lee's attack, more than to any other
source outside the imperial intellect of the Commander-in-Chief
<pb id="stiles108" n="108"/>
himself. Stuart was a splendidly endowed cavalry leader, his
only fault being a tendency to indulge too far his fondness for
achievements that savored of the startling, the marvelous, and the
romantic.</p>
          <p>One more general reflection: Whatever effect the Seven Days'
battles may have had upon other reputations, Federal or Confederate— 
and there were upon our side generals whose names stood high
upon the roster of our main army when these operations began, but
never again appeared upon it after they closed—yet there is one name
and fame which these seven days gave to history and to glory, as to
which the entire world stands agreed, and all the after chances and
changes of the war but expanded the world's verdict. When we
contemplate Lee's great plan and the qualities of leadership which
these operations revealed in him, we know not which most to admire— 
the brilliance, the comprehensiveness, or the almost reckless
audacity of the scheme and of the man. It is a singular fact, and one
which seems to demand explanation, that the prominent impression
which Lee invariably seems to make is that of roundness, balance,
perfection; and yet unquestionably his leading characteristic as a
general is aggressive audacity. Take for example his leaving but 28,000
of 80,000 men between McClellan and Richmond, and with the other
52,000 crossing a generally impassable stream and attacking
McClellan's 105,000 in entrenched positions. Mayhap old Jubal Early,
who knew Lee and knew war as well as any other man on either side,
has the right of it and suggests the true explanation when he says, speaking of
this very operation: “Timid minds might regard this as rashness, but it
was the very perfection of a profound and daring strategy.”</p>
          <p>And when we attempt to measure the effect of these Seven Days'
battles—when we note that within less than one month from the day
he took command of an army with which he had had no previous
personal connection, Lee had completely secured its confidence and
correctly estimated its capabilities, had conceived and perfected his
great plan and every detail essential to its successful execution, had
begun to put it into operation and actually delivered his first great
<pb id="stiles109" n="109"/>
blow; when we note further that within a week after that blow was
struck Richmond was entirely relieved and within a few weeks more
Washington was in serious peril, and the United States Government
had called for three hundred thousand more men; when, we say, all
this is considered, we may well ask when did the weight of one
great Captain's sword, only this and nothing more, cause the scales
of war to dip with such a determined, downward sag?</p>
          <p>One of the most important features of these seven days of battle
was that it was the first prolonged wrestle of the Army of Northern
Virginia, the struggle that really gave birth to that army; that gave it
experience of its own powers, cohesion, character, confidence in
itself and in its great commander—proper estimate of its great
opponent, the Army of the Potomac, and its commander. Then, too,
these days of continuous battle tested the individual men, and
especially the officers of the army, winnowing the chaff from the
wheat and getting rid of some high in command who did not catch
the essential spirit of the army or assimilate well with it, or bid fair to
add anything of value to it; at the same time this week of continuous
battle brought to the front men who had in them stuff out of which
heroes are made and who were destined to make names and niches
for themselves in the pantheon of this immortal army.</p>
          <p>Among those in my own branch of the service who came
prominently to the front, besides Tom Carter, who never lost the
place he made for himself at Seven Pines in the affectionate
admiration of the artillery and of the army, were the boy artillerists
Pegram and Pelham, both yielding their glorious young lives in the
struggle—Pegram at the very end, Pelham but eight months after
Malvern Hill. The latter, an Alabamian, was commander of Stuart's
horse artillery, devotedly loved and admired by his commanding
general, the pride of the cavalry corps, one of the most dashing and
brilliant soldiers in the service, though but twenty-two years of age
when he fell. He was knighted by Lee himself in official report as “the
gallant Pelham.”</p>
          <p>The other, Pegram, was a more serious and a more powerful man,
who came of a family of soldiers who had rendered
<pb id="stiles110" n="110"/>
distinguished service, both in the army and navy, prior to
the war; an elder brother, a graduate of West Point and a
singularly attractive man, rising to the rank of major-general
in the Confederate service, and also losing his life in battle.
The younger brother, the artillerist, a student when the war
began, enlisted as a private soldier in a battery raised in the
City of Richmond, which he commanded when the Seven
Days' battles opened, rendering with it signal and distinguished
service. Eventually he rose to the rank and command
of colonel of artillery, and was recommended for appointment
as brigadier-general of infantry, General Lee saying
he would find a brigade for him just as soon as he could
be spared from the artillery; but meanwhile he fell in battle
at Five Forks in the spring of '65, even then hardly more
than a stripling in years.</p>
          <p>He had always been such a modest, self-contained and
almost shrinking youth that his most intimate friends
were astonished at his rapid development and promotion;
but it was one of those strongly-marked cases where war
seemed to be the needed and almost the native air of a young
man. He was, in some respects, of the type of Stonewall
Jackson, and like him combined the strongest Christian faith
and the deepest spirituality with the most intense spirit of
fight.</p>
          <p>As commander of an artillery battalion he built up a
reputation second to none for effective handling of his guns,
his favorite method, where practicable, being to rush to close
quarters with the enemy and open at the shortest possible
range. He admitted that it seemed deadly, but insisted that
it saved life in the end. When stricken down he lived
enough to express his views and feelings, briefly but clearly,
with regard to both worlds, and there never was a death
more soldierly or more Christian.</p>
          <p>Another, a very different and very racy character, who was
a good deal talked about after and in connection with the
fighting around Richmond in '62, was old “Extra Billy,”
ex-Governor William Smith, of Virginia, whom I mentioned as
a prominent among the Southern members in the Congress
of '59-'60. He was one of the best specimens of the political
<pb id="stiles111" n="111"/>
general, rising ultimately to the rank of major-general; a
born politician, twice Governor of the Commonwealth,—
once before and once after this date,—already beyond the
military age, yet one of the most devoted and enthusiastic
soldiers in the service. As a soldier he was equally distinguished
for personal intrepidity and contempt for what he
called “tactics” and for educated and trained soldiers, whom
he was wont to speak of as “those West P'int fellows.”</p>
          <p>It is said he used to drill his regiment at Manassas, sitting
cross-legged on the top of an old Virginia snake fence,
with a blue cotton umbrella over his head and reading the
orders from a book. On one occasion he was roused by the
laughing outcry, “Colonel, you've run us bang up against the
fence!” “Well, then, boys,” said the old Governor, looking
up and nothing daunted; “well, then, of course you'll have to
turn around or climb the fence.”</p>
          <p>In '62 this story was current about him,—though I do not
vouch for the truth either of this or of that just related,—
that he was ordered to carry a work and to take his command
through the abattis in front of it, reserving their fire.
The regiment started in, the old Governor intrepidly riding
in advance. The abattis swarmed with sharpshooters and his
men were falling all about him, but they followed on heroically.
At last they appealed to him, “Colonel, we can't
stand this, these Yankees will kill us all before we get in a
shot.” It was all the old hero wanted and he blazed forth:
“Of course you can't stand it, boys; it's all this infernal tactics
and West P'int tomfoolery. Damn it, fire! and flush the
game!” And they did, and drove out the sharpshooters and
carried the work.</p>
          <p>My own dear father is one of the prominent figures in my
recollections of that summer about Richmond. He was fond
of horses, an excellent judge of them, and used to ride or
drive the very best that could be found. I say “ride or
drive.” He was then between sixty-five and seventy years
of age and, though vigorous and enthusiastic, found it very
comfortable to drive sometimes; but his selected vehicle was
at once the most unclerical and unmilitary that could well
be imagined—a regulation skeleton “trotting sulky.” He
<pb id="stiles112" n="112"/>
kept his saddle at our battery and his habit was, when we were not
actually fighting or on the move, to return to Richmond at night,
coming down in the morning with a big market basket strapped under
his sulky full of bread and good things. His approach was generally
heralded by the shouts of the soldiers who followed; when, looking
up the road, we would see him, often standing on the shafts,
scattering biscuit and reading aloud the latest telegrams. Hundreds
of men would sometimes follow him to our camp, and then he would
have prayers with them and make a brief religious address.</p>
          <p>Coming in this way one morning he did not find us; the battle was
on and we had gone to the front. As he could not get his saddle, he
kept right on in his sulky, hoping to overtake us. In some way he
managed to pass through and get ahead of the second line and went
on, actually between the first and second lines of battle, until his
further progress was obstructed by a line of works which had been
captured by the first line, when he was forced to turn back, amidst a
storm of ridicule from the second line:</p>
          <p>“That's right, old man; this ain't no place for you, nor for me
neither, if I could only git my colonel to think so!”</p>
          <p>“Say, mister, won't your buggy carry double?”</p>
          <p>“Haven't you got a place for me?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, please, sir, take me with you! I ain't feeling so mighty well
this morning. I'm powerful weak, right now.”</p>
          <p>Father always followed the Scripture rule of “answering a fool
according to his folly,” and so he jeered back at them, telling them
“good-by,” but saying he'd be back in a minute—as he actually was,
riding, bareback and blind bridle, and passing right ahead with the
troops. I have heard of following a fox hunt in one of these sulkies,
but I venture to say this is the very first time a man ever entered
battle in one.</p>
          <p>It will at once occur to the reader as remarkable that father was
not arrested. He was, a few days later, at Malvern Hill, by order of
Gen. Rans. Wright, of Georgia, and a staff officer, as I recollect, of
General Armistead, told me that he was directed to arrest him on one
of the earlier battle-fields of the Seven Days, and made the attempt;
that up to that
<pb id="stiles113" n="113"/>
time he had regarded himself as a pretty daring rider and scout, but
that father, whom he did not then know, led him such a chase as he
had never before had, and that he returned to his general and
reported that he didn't believe there was any harm in that old fellow,
though he was certainly a crank, and if he got killed it would be his
own fault; but that, unless positively so ordered, he didn't propose
to get a bullet through his brain following that old fool right tip to
the Yankee skirmish line.</p>
          <p>It must be remembered that my father was a Christian
minister, devoted to the soldiers, and a sort of
chaplain-general among them. He was ready to whisper the
consolations of religion in the ear of a dying man, to help the litter
bearers, or to carry a wounded man off on his horse. Then,
too, he was well known to many of our generals, to whom,
by the way, he carried a vast amount of information
gathered on his daring scouts ahead even of our skirmishers. I
myself heard two or three of the most prominent generals
say that it was their belief my father had seen more of the
fighting of the Seven Days, from start to finish, than any
other one man in or out of the army. I was of course deeply
anxious about him, but he could not be controlled, and my
belief was then, and is now, that the Federal skirmishers
often refrained from firing upon him simply because they did
not care at the time to expose their position.</p>
          <p>Many of our soldiers knew him, especially the Georgians,
Virginians and Mississippians. Georgia was his native State. In his
early days he had done a great deal of evangelistic work in all parts
of it, and many young men and boys in the army had heard their
parents speak of him. I remember one evening, after a most
impressive sermon to Cobb's or Cummings' brigade, overhearing a
lot of soldiers talking at a spring, when one of them, anxious to
appear a little more familiarly acquainted with the preacher than the
rest, said, “I've heard my mother talk of the old Doctor many a time.
I reckon the old fellow's given me many a dose of physic for croup.”</p>
          <p>An incident occurred, on or near the Nine-Mile road, some time
before the week of battle opened, which is strongly
<pb id="stiles114" n="114"/>
illustrative at once of my father's faith and of the childlike
simplicity of the great bulk of our soldiery. Two companies,
I think from South Carolina, were supporting a section of
our battery in an advanced and somewhat isolated position.
About the middle of the afternoon father drove down from
Richmond, and after he had distributed his provisions and
talked with us a while, proposed to have prayers, which was
readily acceded to. Quite a number of men from the neighboring
commands gathered, and just as we knelt and my
father began his petitions the batteries across the way sent
two or three shells entirely too close to our heads to be comfortable—
I presume just by way of determining the object
of this concourse.</p>
          <p>I confess my faith and devotion were not strong enough
to prevent my opening my eyes and glancing around. The
scene that met them was almost too much for my reverence
and came near being fatal to my decorum. Our Carolina
supports, like the rest of us, had knelt and closed their eyes
at my father's invocation and, simple-hearted fellows that
they were, felt that it would be little less than sacrilege to
rise or to open them until the prayer should be completed;
and yet their faith was not quite equal to assuring them of
God's protection, or at least they felt it would be wise and
well to supplement the protection of heaven by the trees and
stumps of earth, <hi rend="italics">if they could find them,</hi> and so they were
actually groping for them with arms wide extended but
eyes tight closed, and still on their knees.</p>
          <p>I hardly know what might have been the effect upon me
of this almost impossibly ludicrous scene had I not glanced
toward my father. As was his habit in public prayer, he
was standing; his tall, majestic figure erect and his worshipful,
reverent face upturned to Heaven. Not a nerve
trembled, not a note quavered. In a single sentence he committed
us all to God's special keeping while we worshipped;
and then, evidently, he did worship and supplicate the Divine
Being without the slightest further consciousness of
the bursting shells, which in a few moments ceased shrieking
above or about us, and our little service closed without
further interruption. And then it was beautiful to observe
how these simple-hearted boys gazed at my father, as if indeed
<pb id="stiles115" n="115"/>
he had been one of the ancient prophets; but I heard
some of them say they liked that old preacher mighty well,
but they didn't just feel certain whether they wanted him
around having prayers so close under the Yankee guns; that
he “didn't seem to pay hardly enough attention to them
things.”</p>
          <p>Colonel Brandon, father of my Yale classmate of that
name, who was a captain in the regiment, was lieutenant-colonel
of the Twenty-first Mississippi. He was a dignified,
majestic-looking officer and a rigid disciplinarian, but an
old man and very stout and heavy. I do not recollect
whether Colonel Humphreys was present at Malvern Hill,
but Brandon certainly went in with his regiment when
the brigade, as I remember unsupported, made repeated
quixotic efforts to capture the Federal guns massed on the
hill. They were exposed to the fire I have already described,
and of course suffered bloody repulse. Colonel Brandon had
his ankle shattered while the regiment was advancing in the
first charge. On the way back his men proposed to carry
him with them to the rear, but he refused. He was sitting
up and pluckily applying his handkerchief as a tourniquet
above the wound, and he simply said: “Tell the Twenty-first
they can't get me till they take those guns!”</p>
          <p>When the line passed him on the second charge, Brandon
put his hat on his sword, held it up and waved it, cheering
the regiment on, but in a few moments the bleeding remnant
staggered to the rear again, and again they came for their
colonel, insisting that they must carry him with them. The
old soldier actually drew his revolver, declaring that he
would shoot down any man who laid hands upon him, and
he repeated his former message: “Tell the Twenty-first they
can't get their colonel till they take those guns!”</p>
          <p>Again the charge swept by the prostrate old man, who
waved his sword and his hat, urging his men up the awful
slope; but when again they returned to the rear utterly
broken and shattered, the old hero had fainted and the litter
bearers bore him off the field.</p>
          <p>I saw him in Richmond a few days later. His leg had
been amputated below the knee. He was doing wondrous
well physically, but was full of deep dissatisfaction, mortification
<pb id="stiles116" n="116"/>
and rage about the battle. I admitted the gross mismanagement
and was saying something in extenuation, when the old fellow broke
in:</p>
          <p>“Oh! it is not mismanagement that hurts me, sir; it is cowardice— 
the disgraceful cowardice of our officers and men.”</p>
          <p>I was astounded, and protested that I saw nothing of this, when
he broke out again:</p>
          <p>“Saw nothing of this, sir? Why, I saw nothing else! There is
General ---,” mentioning a man I never heard mentioned on any other
occasion save with admiration for his courage and devotion. “Why,
sir, with my own eyes I saw him perceptibly quicken his pace under
fire and that right before the men. And I saw him visibly incline his
head, sir, and that right in the presence of the men. He ought to be
shot to death for cowardice.”</p>
          <p>I confess I was utterly confounded. I had myself seen
General --- repeatedly passing and repassing a knoll
more fearfully torn by artillery fire perhaps than any other
spot of earth I ever looked upon. His men were behind it— 
he passed over it and <hi rend="italics">in front</hi> of them. My recollection is
that officers were not mounted. Of course he quickened his
pace, partly because his presence was required first at one
end of the line and then at the other; but the marvel to me
was that he lived at all. As to the inclination of his head,
all I saw was that instinctive inclination, equally natural
under a heavy fire and a heavy rain. When I recalled the
scene and the heroic conduct of General ---, I remember
saying to myself,</p>
          <p>“What is the true standard of courage?”</p>
          <p>There were a number of Yale men in the Twenty-first Mississippi,
among others two brothers, Jud. and Carey Smith. We used to call
Jud. “Indian Smith” at Yale. I think it was at Savage Station, when
the Seventeenth and Twenty-first Mississippi were put into the
woods at nightfall and directed to lie down, that Carey Smith, the
younger brother, putting his hand in his bosom, found it covered
with blood, when he withdrew it, and saying: “What does this
mean?” instantly died. He had been mortally wounded without
knowing when.</p>
          <pb id="stiles117" n="117"/>
          <p>Judson Smith went almost deranged; yes, I think altogether
deranged. He bore his dead brother out of the woods. His company
and regimental officers proposed to send the body to Richmond in
an ambulance and urged Judson to go with it. He refused both
propositions. He kept the body folded to his bosom, and all through
the night his comrades heard Judson kissing Carey and talking to
him and petting him, and then sobbing as if his heart would break.
Next morning he consented to have his brother's body sent to
Richmond, but refused to go himself. When the regiment moved he
kissed Carey again and again, and then left him, following the
column all day alone, allowing no one to comfort him or even to
speak to him. So that night he lay down alone, not accepting the
proffered sympathy and ministrations of his friends, and resumed
his solitary march in the morning.</p>
          <p>That was Malvern Hill day, and when the regiment, on its first
charge, stopped ascending that fearful slope of death and turned
back, Jud. Smith did not stop. He went right on, never returned and
was never seen or heard of again.</p>
          <p>The family was one of wealth and position in Mississippi, the
father an old man, and having only these two boys. When he heard
of the loss of both almost in one day he left home, joined Price's
army as a private soldier, and at Iuka did just as his eldest son had
done at Malvern Hill, which was the last ever seen or heard of him,
and the family became extinct.</p>
          <p>Walking over the field of Malvern Hill the morning after the
battle, I saw two young Federal soldiers lying dead, side by side,
their heads upon the same knapsack and their arms about each
other. They were evidently brothers and enough alike to be twins.
The whole pathetic story was plainly evident. One had first been
wounded, perhaps killed, and when the other was struck he
managed to get to his dead or dying brother, placed the knapsack
under his head, and then lying down by him and resting his head
on the same rude pillow, slipped his dying arms around his brother's body and slept in this embrace.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>I was not with the Army of Northern Virginia from the time it left
Richmond moving north after the Seven Days' battles until it
returned to Virginia after the invasion of Maryland; thus I missed the
campaign against Pope and the first Maryland campaign, the great
battles of second Manassas and Sharpsburg, or Antietam. No
soldier can expect to be present for duty in all the battles of a
protracted war—sickness, wounds, and capture will naturally prevent.
But the fact is, I was that exceptionally fortunate soldier who never
experienced either disabling sickness or wounds or captivity until
the very end of the struggle, and my absence from the active front is
to be accounted for on other grounds.</p>
          <p>It will be remembered that at Malvern Hill several of the guns of our battery,
my gun among them, were so roughly handled by the concentrated fire of the
Federal artillery that we were compelled to send them to Richmond to be
recast and remounted. This could not be done in time to enable the
battery to move with the army when it marched against Pope. One
section was equipped a little later and caught up in time to take part
in the battle of Sharpsburg. But this was not my section, and the
captain would not permit me to leave with the section first ready.
Therefore I saw nothing of the campaigns against Pope in Virginia
and McClellan in Maryland, and if I am to keep to the general line of
reminiscence
<pb id="stiles119" n="119"/>
I must simply omit the late summer and early autumn of '62, for
of course nothing of general interest occurred while we were
hanging about Richmond waiting for a new equipment. We had not
yet, to any great extent, equipped our artillery, as we did later,
especially in the Manassas and Maryland campaigns, by captures
from the armies opposed to us.</p>
          <p>I have said nothing worth recording occurred during our stay
around Richmond. The statement should be modified so far as to
say that one of the noticeable features of the general condition was
the heartrending affliction of my friends, almost every family having
lost a relative, or some intimate associate, during the week of bloody
battle. It had not, however, yet come to pass, as it did later, that
black became the recognized dress for woman in Richmond, and that
she actually appeared flippant and worldly and unfeeling if she wore
any color. In the second Punic war, when Hannibal was investing
Rome, the tribune Oppius had a law enacted forbidding women to
wear colors during the public distress. But in our great conflict no
such enactment was necessary for the devoted women of our
seven-hilled city; dark death had entered every home and his sombre garb
was everywhere.</p>
          <p>Of course, too, the hospitals were crowded just at this time, and
in the homes of citizens many wounded soldiers were cared for; so
that it seemed the one fitting province of women, young and old, to
serve as nurses and attendants upon the wounded and the dying. I
think, too, though I am not sure, that the churches had already
begun to give their bells to be moulded into cannon. Certainly, long
before the end of the war, the people of Richmond went to church
through silent streets, and ceased to hear that heavenliest of all
earthly sounds, which runs like a holy refrain through the sweetest
poetry and the tenderest memories of English-speaking peoples.</p>
          <p>To me these weeks around Richmond meant more than I can
express in welding the links that bound me to these dear people. I
had dedicated my life to them—I was theirs and they were mine. I felt
it; they felt it. Yes, these people
<pb id="stiles120" n="120"/>
were my friends, this city was my home. Our mother and sisters had
not yet been able to get South, but the faithful people of my father's
former pastoral charge assured me that they stood ready to receive
and care for them with open hearts in open homes, and, until they
arrived, noble women stood ready, in case my brother or I should
need such ministrations, to do, as far as possible, a mother's and a
sister's part by us.</p>
          <p>While I have of course no personal reminiscence to relate either
of the Manassas or the Maryland campaign of '62, yet an account
was given me of the very crisis and climax of the former, in its
essential character and all its surroundings so striking, that I feel
called upon to make record of it. I actually did so, indeed, while a
prisoner at Johnson's Island in 1865, and now use the memorandum
then made.</p>
          <p>One of the most promising of the younger officers of the Army of
Northern Virginia in the spring of '64 was Col. Edward Willis, of the
Twelfth Georgia Regiment. I saw him but once and under the
following circumstances: Our battery passed the winter of '63-'64, not
in the great artillery camp on the Central Railroad, but with the
advanced line of infantry guarding the middle fords of the Rapidan
River. Battalion headquarters were in a pine thicket between
Raccoon and Morton's fords. One beautiful day in the early spring I
was seated in our headquarters' tent at work on one of the battalion
reports, which it was my duty, as adjutant, to make to Artillery
Headquarters, when a very striking-looking head intruded itself in
the tent door and, in a very nonchalant, familiar tone, the owner of
the head asked, “Is Gibbes about?”</p>
          <p>We were not very punctilious about such matters in the
Confederate service, perhaps not enough so; but the intruder and
interlocutor was obviously, I thought, a private soldier and a
specially untidy looking one at that—his hat unquestionably “a
slouch,” his hair long and unkempt, his long overcoat, of whatever
original ground color, now by long usage the color of the ground,
and ending in a fringe of tatter, around the skirt; under it no sign of a
coat or of anything save a gray flannel shirt, no badge or insignia of
rank anywhere
<pb id="stiles121" n="121"/>
visible, nor even an appropriate place for any, and his
badly-worn pants turned up around his very small feet shod in very rough
shoes. I say it did stir me a little unpleasantly that just this man
should ask, in just these words and just this tone, for Major Wade
Hampton Gibbes, of South Carolina, a young West Pointer, who had
recently been assigned to duty with us. I might have answered
differently had not a second glance revealed a face of such
commanding intellect and personal force that I said, “If you will wait
a moment, I'll see,” and a moment later the very effusive meeting
between Gibbes and himself, and Gibbes' introduction, to Colonel
Cabell and myself, of “Col. Edward Willis, of the Twelfth Georgia,”
made me very glad I had answered as I had. They had been at West
Point together, I think, when the war broke out. Gibbes seated
himself, tailor fashion, at one end of a large box of clothing for one
of the batteries, which had not yet been opened, and Willis
stretched out on the box and put his head in Gibbes' lap, who began
running his fingers through the long, tangled, tawny hair which
hung almost to Willis' shoulders. It would have been greatly to the
advantage of the hair if Gibbes had used a comb instead of his
fingers.</p>
          <p>They began talking of their West Point classmates and comrades.
I was going on with my work and not listening
closely, yet I could not help being struck with the vigor and the
trenchant quality of Willis' characterization of the men. But in a few
moments he began telling of Jackson, and then I dropped my pen
and hung eagerly on his words. I knew he had been on Jackson's
staff and hoped he would tell, as he did, how he came to leave it.</p>
          <p>He said that after Second Manassas, perhaps after Sharpsburg,
Jackson sent for him and said: “Captain Willis, you have earned
your promotion, sir. You may take your choice between continued
service on my staff, with the rank of major, and a majority in an
infantry regiment.”</p>
          <p>To which Willis, without hesitation, replied: “I'll take the infantry
regiment, General.”</p>
          <p>A reply which revealed the mettle of the man, as Jackson
indicated by saying: “Sorry to lose you, sir; but you've
<pb id="stiles122" n="122"/>
made a soldier's choice; you'll be assigned to duty with the Twelfth
Georgia.”</p>
          <p>Ere long he became colonel of the regiment, and at the time of
which I write it was well understood throughout the army that no
one commanded a better regiment and no regiment had a better
commanding officer than the Twelfth Georgia.</p>
          <p>Soon Willis began to talk of the campaign against Pope, which he
regarded as Jackson's masterpiece, and as he had been closely with
Jackson through it all, I considered what he said of value, as it
certainly was of surpassing interest. He first expatiated at some
length upon the masterly—I had almost said dastardly—way in which
Jackson managed to find out all Pope's plans and purposes, and yet
to elude and delude and deceive and defraud him in the most
heartless and malignant fashion as to his own movements and
designs. Part of the time, while waiting for Lee and Longstreet,
Jackson was in extreme peril, dodging between and against the huge
Federal Army corps, rushing blindly like avalanches to crush him. On
one or two occasions, I think Willis said, he even went so far as to
sacrifice his skirmish line, that is, arrange to have them captured by
Pope's troops in a particular position, from which even the
skirmishers themselves, as well as their captors, would naturally infer
that “Old Jack” was marching in a certain direction and about a
certain time would be about a certain place, when
quite the reverse was the actual truth. In short, it must be
admitted that all of Jackson's
dealings with Pope, about this time, were disingenuous in the
extreme. Some one, not Willis, has said substantially that they
embodied a continuous, tortuous, twisted, aggravated, protracted
<hi rend="italics">lie</hi>—over fifty miles long.</p>
          <p>But at last, as Willis said, all these tactics of deception were
exhausted! Jackson was straight in front, in the famous position in
the railroad cut, and Pope's whole army moved upon him. They
advanced in imposing array, with several lines of battle—bands
playing, flags flying, and their artillery, following the second line,
slowly firing as they approached. Just as his dispositions—the best he
could make
<pb id="stiles123" n="123"/>
for resisting such an onslaught—were complete, Jackson
heard from Longstreet, who promised him aid in two hours.
The shock could be
delayed, however, only a few moments, and Jackson, feeling the
imminence of the crisis, started down his lines to communicate to his
troops, worn with fatigue and suspense, his own heaven-born faith
and fire and Longstreet's assurance of help. I understood from Willis
that he rode along the line with him, and that all he said was:</p>
          <p>“Two hours, men, only two hours; in two hours you will have
help. You must stand it two hours.”</p>
          <p>It was the crisis of the campaign, and both sides fully appreciated
it. The enemy came right on until within two hundred yards, and
then broke into the rush of the charge. The officer commanding the
leading centre brigade, and who was riding a powerful coal-black
charger, carried the colors in his hand and rested the staff on the toe
of his boot. Striking his spurs deep into the flanks of his horse, at
the same time reining him in, Willis said he came on, with great
plunges, the standard flapping about him and the standard bearer,
cap in hand, yelling at his side. The whole line thus gallantly led,
rushed upon Jackson's men with the enthusiasm of assured victory.</p>
          <p>A hundred yards nearer and the full fire from Jackson's line burst
upon them, but from the inclination of the musket barrels it looked
as if the gallant fellow on the black horse would be the only man to
fall. On the contrary, while many fell and the line wavered, he was
miraculously unhurt, and his men rallied and pressed on after him.
For a moment it looked as if he would actually leap into the cut upon
his foes, but the next moment the great horse reared wildly and fell
backward, but his heroic rider jammed the color staff into the earth
as he went down, only ten yards from the muzzles of Jackson's
muskets. The spell that held them together was broken, the
advancing lines halted and wavered throughout their length—a
moment more and the whole magnificent array had melted into a
mass of fugitives.</p>
          <p>Again Jackson rode down his lines: “Half an hour men, only half
an hour; can you stand it half an hour?”</p>
          <pb id="stiles124" n="124"/>
          <p>And now, as Willis said, it seemed as if some of his men exhaled
their very souls to him in shouts, while others, too much exhausted
to cheer, took off their hats and gazed at him in adoration as he
passed. The enemy, reformed, began again to advance, and Jackson
quickened his horse's gait. “They are coming once more, men; you
must stand it once more; you must stand it half an hour.”</p>
          <p>Could they have stood it? We shall never know—for before the
mighty wave broke again into the crest and foam of the actual
charge, the Texas brigade was in on Jackson's right and Old Pete and
Old Jack together swept them in the counter-charge like chaff before
the whirlwind.</p>
          <p>I have not pretended to give Colonel Willis' exact words, and yet
in my memorandum account of his visit to our camp above referred
to I incorporated his words as nearly as I could recall them, and I
have now conformed very closely to that memorandum. I never
listened to more vivid delineation of strategy or of battle. He was
thoroughly stirred while uttering it, and its impression upon us may
be gathered from Colonel Cabell's words as he and Gibbes and I
stood watching Willis as his figure disappeared in the thick pines:
“Stiles, there goes the only man I ever saw who, I think, by
possibility might make another Jackson!”</p>
          <p>In less than a month from that time he was made a
brigadier-general, for brilliant service on the field, and the very next day
yielded up his glorious young life in battle.</p>
          <p>Willis' name is not to be found on the roster of Confederate
general officers, but there is no doubt about the facts of his
promotion and death. The circumstances are entirely familiar to me
and are full of touching and tragic interest. These lists of
Confederate officers are very imperfect. My uncle William and my
cousin Edward, mentioned in these reminiscences, are both entered
on the list of field officers, but my name is not mentioned.</p>
          <p>While I do not regard discussions as to the purposes and
success or failure of campaigns, or the comparative numbers
engaged on the two sides, as properly within the general scope of
this book, yet I shall occasionally, when the matter is of special
interest, or I hope to be able to add something of special
<pb id="stiles125" n="125"/>
value do violence to these declared views—so I here take the liberty
of saying that it is by no means admitted among intelligent
Confederate soldiers that the only or the main design of the first
Maryland campaign was to stir up revolt in Maryland or to recruit
our army by enlistments there. It is not disputed that these may
have been among the objects sought to be accomplished, nor that,
so far as this is true, the campaign was a failure. The Confederate
view of the matter, from a military standpoint, is in brief this:</p>
          <p>By our invasion of Maryland we cleared Virginia of enemies,
sending them home to defend their own capital and their own
borders. We subsisted our army for a time outside our own
worn-out territory. We gathered large quantities of badly-needed
supplies, to a great extent fitting out our troops with improved
firearms, in place of the old smoothbore muskets, and replacing
much of our inferior field artillery with improved guns. At Harper's
Ferry alone we captured eleven thousand prisoners, seventy-three
pieces of artillery, thirteen thousand stand of excellent small arms
and immense stores; besides all which, we delayed further
immediate invasion of Virginia; indeed, as has been strongly said:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>Such had been the moral effect upon the enemy that the Confederate
capital was never again seriously endangered until the power of the
Confederacy had been so broken in other quarters, and its available territory so
reduced in dimensions, that the enemy could concentrate his immense
resources against the capital.</p>
          </q>
          <p>One word now as to the numbers engaged at Sharpsburg. This
battle has been much misunderstood. It was really the most superb
fight the Army of Northern Virginia ever made. This will readily
appear when we recall the fact that General McClellan in his official
report says that he had actually present for duty on the field that
day eighty-seven thousand one hundred and sixty-four (87,164)
men of all arms. General Early thinks he had ninety-three thousand
one hundred and forty-nine (93,149), while Colonel Taylor says and
shows that General Lee had less than thirty-five thousand two
hundred and fifty-five (35,255); Early says less
<pb id="stiles126" n="126"/>
than thirty thousand (30,000). Take it even at thirty-five thousand
(35,000) and eighty-seven thousand (87,000), and remember that
General Lee remained on the field all the day following the battle;
that McClellan did not attack him, and states in his testimony before
the Committee on the Conduct of the War (Reports, Vol. 2, Part 1,
1862-3, p. 441 ) as the reason therefor, that:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>The next morning (the 18th) I found that our loss had been so great and
that there was so much disorganization in some of the commands that I did not
consider it proper to renew the attack that day, especially as I was sure of the
arrival that day of two fresh divisions amounting to about 15,000 men.</p>
          </q>
          <p>Two further remarks, and we leave this part of the story of the
Army of Northern Virginia, of which I am not able to say <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">quorum
pars fui</foreign></hi>. And, first, that General McClellan's part in all this campaign
appears to have been greatly to his credit and honor. Summoned by
the President and begged to see if he could not, by his personal
influence, do something to heal the discords and want of union and
cohesion in the Army of the Potomac; then asked to take charge of it
again himself; then, with wondrous vigor gathering a composite
army and unifying and enheartening it; and lastly, so handling it, on
the march and in the field, as to save the Federal capital and to clear
Northern soil of invasion.</p>
          <p>But one incident must not be forgotten: McClellan was inspired
and enabled to march with such unwonted speed, to move with such
unerring judgment and to fight with such tremendous vigor and
pertinacity by the contents of a little paper which was picked up by a
Federal soldier in one of our deserted camps, and which turned out
to be a copy sent to one of our division commanders of General
Lee's order of battle and of campaign, showing in detail the position
and duty assigned to each important command in the army, and of
course just how our force was divided. There is no doubt as to the
facts. McClellan recites them in his testimony above referred to, p.
440, and speaks of the effect of this order upon his movements. It
was well understood among us. As Colonel Taylor says:</p>

            <p>The God of battles alone knows what would have occurred but for the
singular incident mentioned; it is useless to speculate on this point, but
certainly the loss of this battle order constitutes one of the pivots on which
turned the event of the war.</p>
          </q>
          <p>Again Culpeper Court House is the appointed trysting place of
the army, while waiting fuller development of the plan of General
Burnside, the new commander of the Army of the Potomac, and we,
the right section, having at last gotten our new equipment of guns,
had a delightful march thither through a country full of good things
and kind people, in the season of harvest and of fruit. Here, too, we
met, with great rejoicing, our comrades of the left section, from
whom we had been separated during the Manassas and Maryland
campaigns; and from this point were ordered, about the 19th of
November, to Fredericksburg, in connection with Longstreet's corps,
arriving there on the afternoon of the 21st, marching the last day
through one of the steadiest, heaviest, and coldest downpours of
autumnal rain I ever experienced. As the Federal batteries of heavy
guns on Falmouth and Stafford Heights commanded almost the
entire southern bank of the river and particularly the road by which
we would naturally enter the town, and as it was specially desired
that they should not be apprised of our arrival, we were halted just
outside the town and back of the point of a hill, until after nightfall,
and then marched to a dark and desolate bivouac, without fire and
without food, and frozen to the very soul—the more so as we had of
course steamed up while walking. I recall this as one of the most
comfortless and trying nights of my life, and yet so sound and
tough were we that I do not recall that a single man of us wheezed,
or even sneezed, from the exposure.</p>
          <p>In a few days, everything appearing to be quiet at the front, we
were sent down into Caroline County, along and near the R. F. &amp; P.
Railroad, to go into camp for the winter. We selected an ideal
position, went vigorously to work and built the very best shelters
for our horses and cabins for ourselves that we ever put up
anywhere; but hardly had they been completed, tried, pronounced
eminently satisfactory
<pb id="stiles128" n="128"/>
and christened “Sleepy Hollow,” when orders came for us to
return at once to Fredericksburg, and that through a blizzard of most
inclement weather. Of course we went and without delay—I cannot
say absolutely without grumbling. Indeed the right to grumble is the
only civil, political, or social right left to the soldier, and he stands
much in his own light if he does not exercise it to the full. We found
rather an uncomfortable and forbidding location selected for us
outside of Fredericksburg, and we were in a temper too bad to do
much for its improvement, so that, as to external conditions, we had
rather a hard, comfortless winter; though, even as to these, we
perhaps did better than the commands who were ordered to the front
later.</p>
          <p>The next incident of interest was the bombardment of the old
town, but I do not care to enlarge upon this. Really I saw then and
see now no justification for it. True the town was occupied by armed
men,—Barksdale and his men, our old brigade,—but then the fire did
not drive them out; in the nature of things, and especially of the
Mississippi brigade, of course it would not, and it did drive out the
women and children, many of them. I never saw a more pitiful
procession than they made trudging through the deep snow, after
the warning was given and as the hour drew near. I saw little
children tugging along with their doll babies,—some bigger than
they were,—but holding their feet up carefully above the snow, and
women so old and feeble that they could carry nothing and could
barely hobble themselves. There were women carrying a baby in one
arm and its bottle, its clothes, and its covering in the other. Some
had a Bible and a tooth brush in one hand, a picked chicken and a
bag of flour in the other. Most of them had to cross a creek swollen
with winter rains, and deadly cold with winter ice and snow. We took
the battery horses down and ferried them over, taking one child in
front and two behind and sometimes a woman or a girl on either side
with her feet in the stirrups, holding on by our shoulders.
Where they were going we could not tell, and I doubt if they could.</p>
          <p>I was about to say that the armed men had orders to come out,
and would have done so at the proper time. But I am
<pb id="stiles129" n="129"/>
not so sure about this, and certainly can't blame the Federals for not
knowing it, when we really couldn't get the plaguey Mississippians
to understand it themselves. They were ready to fight anything, from
his Satanic Majesty down; but they were a very poor set indeed as to
judging when not to fight, or when to stop fighting. Why, there was
Colonel Fizer, of the Seventeenth. He was down on the river bank
below the town. Of course he must have had retiring orders and
ought to have seen that the Federal batteries absolutely dominated
our shore; and yet he sent word to General Barksdale that if he would
just let the Howitzers come down, with a couple of their guns, he
could “drive these people back anyhow.” And “Old Barksdale,” who
was every bit as bad as Fizer, and a little worse, actually sent the
order, and our boys actually started. It would have been a practical
impossibility to get these two poor little guns anywhere near the
river. No two fragments of guns or men would have held together five
minutes after they appeared on the plain that stretched out from the
foot of the hills to the river and their intentions became known to the
batteries on Stafford Heights. Fortunately, our division general,
McLaws, and his staff met the guns just before they emerged on the
plain, and the general demanded of the officer in charge where we
were going and by whose order, and, on being told, instantly
countermanded the order and sent us back. It is fair to say for General
Barksdale that when our captain galloped rapidly into town and
explained the matter to him, he himself withdrew his own order; but
General McLaws had already acted. The incident strongly
accentuated the necessity for the battalion organization of the
artillery, and in our case it was put into immediate effect I think, just
after the battle.</p>
          <p>But Fizer was not the only officer of the Mississippi brigade that
could not get it into his head, even a little later, that the troops were
to abandon the town and retire before the enemy, who had now
gotten their pontoons down, and the head of their column landed in
the town. The brigade had been hospitably received by the citizens
and its blood was up in their defense.</p>
          <pb id="stiles130" n="130"/>
          <p>The Twenty-first Mississippi was the last regiment to leave the
city. The last detachment was under the command of Lane Brandon,
already mentioned as my <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="lat">quondam</foreign></hi> classmate at Yale, and son of old
Colonel Brandon, of the Twenty-first, who behaved so heroically at
Malvern Hill. In skirmishing with the head of the Federal column—led,
I think, by the Twentieth Massachusetts—Brandon captured a few
prisoners and learned that the advance company was commanded
by Abbott, who had been his chum at Harvard Law School when the
war began.</p>
          <p>He lost his head completely. He refused to retire before Abbott.
He fought him fiercely and was actually driving him back. In this he
was violating orders and breaking our plan of battle. He was put
under arrest and his subaltern brought the command out of town.</p>
          <p>Buck Denman,—our old friend Buck, of Leesburg and Fort
Johnston fame,—a Mississippi bear hunter and a superb specimen
of manhood, was color sergeant of the Twenty-first and a member of
Brandon's company. He was tall and straight, broad-shouldered and
deep-chested, had an eye like an eagle and a voice like a bull of
Bashan, and was full of pluck and power as a panther. He was rough
as a bear in manner, but withal a noble, tenderhearted fellow, and a
splendid soldier.</p>
          <p>The enemy, finding the way now clear, were coming up
the street, full company front, with flags flying and bands
playing, while the great shells from the siege guns were
bursting over their heads and dashing their hurtling
fragments after our retreating skirmishers.</p>
          <p>Buck was behind the corner of a house taking sight for a last shot.
Just as his fingers trembled on the trigger, a little three-year-old,
fair-haired, baby girl toddled out of an alley, accompanied by a Newfoundland
dog, and gave chase to a big shell that was rolling lazily along the
pavement, she clapping her little hands and the dog snapping and
barking furiously at the shell.</p>
          <p>Buck's hand dropped from the trigger. He dashed it across his
eyes to dispel the mist and make sure he hadn't passed over the
river and wasn't seeing his own baby girl
<pb id="stiles131" n="131"/>
in a vision. No, there is the baby, amid the hell of shot and shell, and
here come the enemy. A moment and he has grounded his gun,
dashed out into the storm, swept his great right arm around the
baby, gained cover again, and, baby clasped to his breast and
musket trailed in his left hand, is trotting after the boys up to
Marye's Heights.</p>
          <p>And there behind that historic stone wall, and in the lines hard
by, all those hours and days of terror was that baby kept, her fierce
nurses taking turns patting her, while the storm of battle raged and
shrieked, and at night wrestling with each other for the boon and
benediction of her quiet breathing under their blankets. Never was
baby so cared for. They scoured the country side for milk, and
conjured up their best skill to prepare dainty viands for her little
ladyship.</p>
          <p>When the struggle was over and the enemy had withdrawn to his
strongholds across the river, and Barksdale was ordered to
reoccupy the town, the Twenty-first Mississippi, having held the
post of danger in the rear, was given the place of honor in the van
and led the column. There was a long halt, the brigade and
regimental staff hurrying to and fro. The regimental colors could not
be found.</p>
          <p>Denman stood about the middle of the regiment, baby in arms.
Suddenly he sprang to the front. Swinging her aloft above his head,
her little garments fluttering like the folds of a banner, he shouted,
“Forward, Twenty-first, here are your colors!” and without further
order, off started the brigade toward the town, yelling as only
Barksdale's men could yell. They were passing through a street
fearfully shattered by the enemy's fire, and were shouting their very
souls out—but let Buck himself describe the last scene in the drama:</p>
          <p>“I was holding the baby high, Adjutant, with both arms, when
above all the racket I heard a woman's scream. The next thing I
knew I was covered with calico and she fainted on my breast. I
caught her before she fell, and laying her down gently, put her baby
on her bosom. She was most the prettiest thing I ever looked at, and
her eyes were shut; and—and—I hope God'll forgive me, but I kissed her
just once.”</p>
          <pb id="stiles132" n="132"/>
          <p>Fredericksburg was the simplest and easiest won battle of the
war. The Federal batteries on Falmouth and Stafford Heights across
the river absolutely dominated the town and our bank of the river
and the flats on our side; but our troops were back on the hills,
which we had fortified somewhat, and which we could have held
against the world. It is believed that less than twenty thousand of
our men, about one-fourth of these present for duty, were actually
engaged. Our loss was comparatively light, the Federal loss very
heavy, especially in the attack upon Marye's Heights and the
famous stone wall, in front of which dead men were lying thicker
than I ever saw them on any other field. I attempted to count them,
but found it impossible. I could have walked considerable distances
in front of this wall, stepping only on dead men, and it was with
difficulty that I so guided my horse as to avoid trampling upon them.
Burnside saw, or his corps commanders showed him, his mistake,
and he refused to renew the attack, as we were hoping that he
would. There is, or perhaps I should say there was, a feeling, that we
should have ourselves made attack upon him, and that General
Jackson favored it. Colonel Taylor, General Early, and other
authorities scout any such idea. I do not feel that anything would be
gained by reopening the discussion.</p>
          <p>Tennyson is in error when he says, in “Locksley Hall,” that
“Woman is the lesser man.” She is the greater man. A good woman
is better than a good man, a bad woman is worse; a brave woman is
braver than any man ever was. During the bombardment I was sent
into Fredericksburg with a message for General Barksdale. As I was
riding down the street that led to his headquarters it appeared to be
so fearfully swept by artillery fire that I started to ride
across it, with a view of finding some safer way of getting to
my destination, when, happening to glance, beyond that point, I
saw walking quietly and unconcernedly along the same street I was
on, and approaching General Barksdale's
headquarters from the opposite direction, a lone woman.
She apparently found the projectiles which were screaming and 
exploding in the air, and striking and crashing through the
<pb id="stiles133" n="133"/>
houses, and tearing up the streets, very interesting— 
stepping a little aside to inspect a great, gaping hole one had just
gouged out in the sidewalk, then turning her head to
note a fearful explosion in the air. I felt as if it really would not do to
avoid a fire which was merely interesting, and not at all appalling, to
a woman; so I stiffened my spinal column as well as I could and rode
straight down the street toward headquarters and the
self-possessed lady; and having reached the house I rode around back
of it to put my horse where he would at least be safer than in front.
As I returned on foot to the front the lady had gone up on the porch
and was knocking at the door. One of the staff came to hearken, and
on seeing a lady, held up his hands, exclaiming in amazement:
“What on earth, madam, are you doing here? Do go to some safe
place if you can find one.” She smiled and said, with some little
tartness: “Young gentleman, you seem to be a little excited. Won't
you please say to General Barksdale that a lady at the door wishes
to see him.” The young man assured her General Barksdale could
not possibly see her just now; but she persisted. “General Barksdale
is a Southern gentleman, sir, and will not refuse to see a lady who
has called upon him.” Seeing that he could not otherwise get rid of
her, the General did come to the door, but actually wringing his
hands in excitement and annoyance. “For God's sake, madam, go
and seek some place of safety. I'll send a member of my staff to help
you find one.” She again smiled gently,—while old Barksdale
fumed and almost swore,—and then she said quietly: “General
Barksdale, my cow has just been killed in my stable by a shell. She is
very fat and I don't want the Yankees to get her. If you will send
some one down to butcher her, you are welcome to the meat.”</p>
          <p>Years afterwards I delivered a Confederate memorial address at
Fredericksburg and, when I told this incident, noticed increasing
interest and something very like amusement among the audience,
who had ceased to look at me, but all eyes were turned in one
direction, and just as I finished the story and my eyes followed
theirs—there before me sat this very lady, apparently not a day older,
and the entire audience rose and gave her three deafening cheers.</p>
          <pb id="stiles134" n="134"/>
          <p>One of the marked features of the battle was that when we lay
down in our blankets on the night of the 12th we could see nothing,
but could plainly hear Burnside's immense force getting into
position, and when we rose on the morning of the 13th a dense fog
overhung the entire flat in our front, shutting out all vision. Once or
twice we did see men, our own skirmishers, moving about, as the
blind man in the Scriptures saw when partially healed—“Men as
trees walking.” I remember that when a Federal cavalry officer lost
his bearings in the fog and came too near our lines we heard every
command and every movement, till suddenly two or three of the
horsemen loomed up in the mist in dim outline, magnified to the size
of haystacks. A moment more and they ran into the Texas brigade at
the foot of the hill in our front, and a volley emptied many a saddle,
their gallant leader's among them.</p>
          <p>A little later a light breeze sprang up. There was a swaying
movement of the thick vapor and then, all at once, it rolled up like the
stage curtain of a theatre, and there, spread out in the wide plain
beneath, was the most magnificent martial spectacle that can be
imagined—a splendidly-equipped army of at least one hundred
thousand men, in battle array. General Burnside testified that he had
that number on our side of the river. For a moment we forgot the
terrible business ahead of us in the majesty and glory of the sight.</p>
          <p>We were stationed on what was afterwards known as “Lee's Hill,”
an elevation centrally located between the right and left flanks
of our line, and jutting out at quite a commanding height into and
above the plain. For these reasons General Lee made it, for the most
part, his field headquarters during the fight. Portions of the city and
of Marye's Heights were not visible, at least not thoroughly so; but
every other part of the field was, clear away down, or nearly down,
to Hamilton's Crossing. From it we witnessed the break in our lines
on the right, where the Federals came in over a piece of marshy
ground, supposed to be impassable, between Lane's North Carolina
and Archer's Tennessee brigade. The entire attack, from its
inception to its unexpected
<pb id="stiles135" n="135"/>
success, was as clearly defined as a movement on a
chessboard, and I confess that tears started to and even from my
eyes; but a moment later a great outburst of fire a little back of the
line of battle indicated that the intruders had been gallantly met by
our second line, or our reserves, and in a few moments out they
rushed, the victors yelling at their heels. My uncle, William Henry
Stiles, colonel of the Sixtieth Georgia, and who, in the absence of the
general, was in command of Lawton's brigade in the battle, told me
an amusing story of this particular fight.</p>
          <p>When his brigade, with others, was ordered to stem this irruption,
drive out the intruders and reestablish—or rather, for the first time
properly extend and connect—our lines, his men were
double-quicking to the point of peril and he running from one end to the
other of his brigade line to see that all parts were kept properly
“dressed up,” when he observed one of the conscripts who had
lately been sent to his regiment—a large, fine-looking fellow—drop
out and crouch behind a tree. My uncle, a tall, wiry, muscular man,
was accustomed to carry a long, heavy sword, and having it
at the time in his hand, as he passed he struck the fellow a
sound whack across his shoulders with the flat of the
weapon, simultaneously saying, “Up there, you coward!” To
his astonishment the man dropped his musket, clasped his
hands and keeled over backwards, devoutly ejaculating,
“Lord, receive my spirit!”</p>
          <p>Uncle William said the entire dénouement was so unexpected and
grotesque and his haste so imperative, that he scarcely knew how
he managed to do it, but he did turn and deliver a violent kick upon
the fellow's ribs, at the same time shouting, “Get up, sir! the Lord
wouldn't receive the spirit of such an infernal coward;” whereupon,
to his further amazement, the man sprang up in the most joyful
fashion, fairly shouting, “Ain't I killed? The Lord be praised!” and
grabbing his musket he sailed in like a hero, as he ever afterwards
was. The narrator added that he firmly believed that, but for the kick,
his conscript would have completed the thing and died in good
order.</p>
          <p>On our part of the line I witnessed a scene not quite so humorous
as this, but strongly characteristic. I saw a tall
<pb id="stiles136" n="136"/>
Texan bring up the hill, as prisoners, some fifteen or twenty low,
stolid Germans,—Bavarians I think they were,—no one of whom
could speak a word of English. He must have been a foot taller than
any of them, as he stood leaning on his long rifle and looking down
upon them with a very peculiar expression. I asked him where he got
them and he replied in the most matter-of-fact way, “Well, me and
my comrade surrounded 'em; but he got killed, poor fellow!” He
really looked as if he could have surrounded the entire lot alone.</p>
          <p>Not often have I come in contact with relations more beautiful
than existed in some cases between young Southern masters in the
service and their slave attendants. These latter belonged for the
most part to one of two classes: either they were mature and faithful
men, to whose care the lad's parents had committed him, or else they
were the special chums and playmates of their young master's
boyhood days, who had perhaps already attended and waited upon
him in college.</p>
          <p>My first cousin, eldest son of the uncle above mentioned, and
who was a captain in his regiment, was seriously wounded late in the
evening of the battle, but the casualty was not generally known,
probably because the surgeons finding him on the field, after a
hurried examination, pronounced his wound necessarily and
speedily mortal, and added: “We are sorry to leave you, Captain, but
we and the litter bearers have all we can attend to.” To which he
replied: “Certainly, gentlemen, go on and attend to the men; but you
are mistaken about me. I haven't the least idea of dying.”</p>
          <p>They left him; the litter bearers of course did not report his case,
and probably neither his father nor any member of his company was
aware of his having been wounded. But there was one faithful soul
to whom he was more than all the rest of the regiment. If he
continued “missing” the world was empty to him, and so, in cold and
darkness and sadness, he searched every foot of ground the
regiment had fought over, till at last he found him. Then he
wandered about until he got from the bodies of dead men blankets
enough to make a soft, warm bed, and carefully
<pb id="stiles137" n="137"/>
lifted him on to it, and covered him snugly. He then managed to start
a fire and get water for him, and finally, most important of all, got
from the body of a dead Federal officer a small flask of brandy and
stimulated him carefully.</p>
          <p>About daylight the doctors came by again and, surprised to find
him alive, made a more careful examination and found that the ball
had passed entirely through his body from right to left, just between
the upper and lower vital regions; but they added that he would
have died of cold and exposure had it not been for the faithful love
that refused to be satisfied until it had found and provided for him.
That was the night of the 13th of December. On the 25th, I think it
was, he walked up to the third story of a house in Richmond to see
my mother, who had meantime gotten through from the North.</p>
          <p>The battle closed, as it began, with a marked, and this time a
beautiful, natural phenomenon. It was very cold and very clear, and
the aurora borealis of the night of December 13th, 1862, surpassed in
splendor any like exhibition I ever saw. Of course we enthusiastic
young fellows felt that the heavens were hanging out banners and
streamers and setting off fireworks in honor of our victory.</p>
          <p>Our friends, the enemy, seemed in no hurry to leave our
neighborhood, though they did not seem to long for another close
grapple, and as we appeared equally indifferent to any closer
acquaintance with them, General Burnside and his army, on the
night of December 15th, apparently insulted, retired to their own
side of the river and began to get ready for Christmas.</p>

Personal Conferences with Comrades—A Prayer Between the Lines—A
Percussion Shell at Gettysburg.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>No account of my experience as a Confederate soldier would be
complete if it failed to refer to the religious life of the army. This was
an element of importance in all our armies, from the outset to the end,
and was recognized and fostered as such by our leading generals,
many of whom attended the religious services held among the men
of their commands, some of them taking loving direction of these
services.</p>
          <p>I remember on one occasion, when my father was preaching to
Tom Cobb's brigade, on the lines about Richmond in '62, that the
service was interrupted by sharp firing in front and the command
marched off into the woods. It proved a false alarm, however; the
troops soon returned and the service was resumed. But the men were
preoccupied, nervous, and widely scattered, and everything
dragged, until the general, rising, begged my father to wait a moment,
and called out: “Men, get up close together here in front, till your
shoulders meet. You can't make a fire if the sticks don't touch.” They
“closed up” and the meeting proceeded with great power.</p>
          <p>Volumes have been written on this general theme by chaplains
and others, and I have already made brief incidental reference to it;
but more than this is required. Not that I propose to condense into
this chapter every fact or incident within my knowledge illustrative
of this phase of life in the Confederate armies. On the contrary, I
shall, in the main, throughout this book, allow the religious element
to
<pb id="stiles139" n="139"/>
mingle with others that gave character to our soldier life,
and to crop out here and there, as it actually did in our every-day
experiences; for, with a Confederate soldier especially, religion was
not a mere Sunday matter, to be put on and off with his Sunday
clothes, even if he had any such.</p>
          <p>But as the revival at Fredericksburg in the winter of '62-'63
concerned especially the infantry brigade with which I was longest
and most closely associated, I may be pardoned for giving a brief
sketch of what was probably the most marked religious movement in
our war and, as I believe, rarely paralleled anywhere or at any time.</p>
          <p>The religious interest among Barksdale's men began about the
time of, or soon after, the battle of Fredericksburg, which was about
the middle of December, '62, and continued with unabated fervor up
to and through the battle of Chancellorsville and even to
Gettysburg. In addition to the labors of the regimental chaplains, the
ablest and most distinguished ministers in Virginia, of all
denominations, delighted to come up and speak to the men. My
father, who was nearly seventy years old, came over from Jackson's
corps late in February and remained for many weeks. The fraternal
spirit of the Christian workers is thus portrayed in a letter by Rev.
William J. Hoge, D. D., of the Presbyterian Church, written from
Fredericksburg in the spring of 1863. Says Dr. Hoge:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>A rich blessing had been poured upon the zealous labors of the Rev. Mr.
Owen, Methodist chaplain in Barksdale's Brigade. The Rev. Dr. Burrows, of
the Baptist church, Richmond, had just arrived, expecting to labor with him
for some days. As I was to stay but one night, Dr. Burrows courteously insisted
on my preaching. So we had a Presbyterian sermon, introduced by Baptist
services, under the direction of a Methodist chaplain, in an Episcopal church!
Was not that a beautiful solution of the vexed problem of Christian union?</p>
          </q>
          <p>The Baptist church had been so injured during the bombardment
that it could not be used. The meetings were first held in the
Presbyterian church and then in the Methodist, and finally were
transferred to the Episcopal church, St.
<pb id="stiles140" n="140"/>
George's, which was the largest in the city, and accommodated, I
should say, packed as it invariably was, from a thousand to twelve
hundred men. I have never seen such eagerness to hear the Word of
God, nor greater simplicity, directness and earnestness in religious
services. Long before the hour appointed the men would begin to
gather, intent on getting into the church and securing a seat.
Thereafter every moment was occupied with some act of worship of
uncommon intensity and power. The singing, in which every one
joined, was hearty and impressive; the prayers, offered generally by
the men themselves, were soul-moving “cries unto God;” the
preacher was sometimes a distinguished divine from Richmond,
sometimes one of the army chaplains, sometimes a private soldier
from the ranks, but whoever he might be, he preached the gospel and
the gospel only. The following is an extract from a letter written by
my father just after he reached Fredericksburg:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>After my arrival we held three meetings a day—a morning and afternoon
prayer-meeting and a preaching service at night. We could scarcely ask of
delightful religious interest more than we received. Our sanctuary has been
crowded, lower floor and gallery. Loud, animated singing always hailed our
approach to the house of God; and a closely-packed audience of men, amongst
whom you might have searched in vain for one white hair, were leaning upon
the voice of the preacher as if God himself had called them together to hear of
life and death eternal. At every call for the anxious, the entire altar, the
front six seats of the five blocks of pews surrounding the pulpit, and all the spaces
thereabouts ever so closely packed, could scarcely accommodate the
supplicants.</p>
          </q>
          <p>To this graphic picture may I add a few touches. There was a
soldier in a red blanket overcoat who had a voice like the sound of
many waters, and who almost invariably sat or stood on the pulpit
steps and led the singing. I remember, too, the many marks of
cannon balls upon and in and through the building, and that it
added to the thrill of the services to realize that we were gathered
under the frowning batteries upon Stafford Heights. And while I
greatly enjoyed the many powerful sermons we heard from distinguished
<pb id="stiles141" n="141"/>
ministers, yet I was still more impressed by the simple song
and prayer and experience meetings of the men, which were
generally held for at least an hour before the regular service began.</p>
          <p>Many of the “talks” delivered by the private soldiers in these
preparatory services were thrilling beyond expression. Let me
attempt to reproduce two or three of these, promising that if I cannot
be sure of the precise words employed by the speakers, I at least will
not fail to reproduce the substance and the spirit of their addresses:</p>
          <p>I remember that one of these private soldiers, in illustrating and
enforcing the folly of living in this world as if we were to live in it
forever, asked his comrades what they would think of the good
sense or even the sanity of one of their number who should
to-morrow morning send to Richmond for an elegant wrapper, velvet
smoking cap and slippers, and when they came, throwing away his
blanket and stout shoes and clothes, should insist upon arraying
himself in “these butterfly things” in the face of the fact that the next
moment the long roll might turn him out into the deep snow or the
guns of the enemy batter down his cantonment over his head.</p>
          <p>Another, speaking of the trivial things to which a man gives his
heart and for which he may lose his soul, speculated with the finest
fancy as to what it was, and how very a trifle it may have been, that
turned the heart and the gaze of Lot's wife back toward Sodom and
turned her breathing body into a dead pillar of salt.</p>
          <p>And still another—a great, broad-shouldered, double-jointed son
of Anak, with a head like the Farnese Jove and a face and frame
indicative of tremendous power, alike of character and of
muscle—delivered himself of his “experience” in one of the most graphic and
moving talks I ever listened to. He said in substance:</p>
          <p>“Brethren, I want you to know what a merciful, forgiving being the
Lord is, and to do that I've got to tell you what a mean-spirited liar I
am. You remember that tight place the brigade got into, down
yonder at - - -, and you know the life I lived up to that day. Well, as soon
as ever
<pb id="stiles142" n="142"/>
the Minies began a-singing and the shell a-bursting around me, I up
and told the Lord that I was sorry and ashamed of myself, and if
He'd cover my head this time we'd settle the thing as soon as I got
out. Then I got to fighting and forgot all about it, and never thought
of my promise no more at all till we got into that other place, up
yonder at - - -; you remember it, tighter than the first one. Then,
when the bullets begun a-hissing like rain and the shell was fairly
tearing the woods to pieces, my broken promise come back to me.
Brethren, my coward heart stopped beating and I pretty nigh fainted.
I tried to pray and at first I couldn't; but I just said, ‘Look here, Lord,
if you will look: I feel I have lied to you and that you won't believe
me again, and may be you oughtn't to; but I don't want to go to hell,
and I'm serious and honest this time, and if you do hear me now,
we'll meet just as soon as I get out safe, and we certainly will settle
things.’</p>
          <p>“Well, brethren, He did all I asked of Him, the Lord did; and what
did I do? Brethren, I'm ashamed to say it, but I lied again, and never
thought one thing about it at all till one day we was shoved into the
very worst place any of us ever was in. Hell gaped for me, and here
come the two lies I had told and sat right down upon my heart and
my tongue. Of course I couldn't pray, but at last I managed to say,
‘Lord! Lord! I deserve it all if I do go there, right now, and I can't pray
and I won't lie any more. You can do as you please, Lord; but if you
do—. But, no, I won't lie any more, and I won't promise, for fear I
should lie. It's all in your hands, Lord—hell or mercy. I've got no time
to talk any more about it. I've got to go to killing Yankees. But, O
Lord! O Lord!—no, I daresn't, I daresn't; for I won't lie any more; I
won't go down there with a fresh lie on my lips; but, O Lord! Lord!’</p>
          <p>“And so it was, brethren, all through that dreadful day; fighting,
fighting, and not daring to pray.</p>
          <p>“But, brethren, He did it, He did it; and the moment the thing was
over I wouldn't give myself time to lie again, so I just took out and
ran as hard as ever I could into the deep, dark woods, where God
and me was alone together, and I
<pb id="stiles143" n="143"/>
threw my musket down on the ground and I went right down myself,
too, on my knees, and cried out, ‘Thank you, Lord; thank you, Lord!
but I'm not going to get up off my knees until everything's settled
between us;’ and neither I didn't, brethren. The Lord never held it
over me at all, and we settled it right there.”</p>
          <p>It is said that more than five hundred men professed conversion in
these Fredericksburg meetings, and this statement is based upon
careful figures made by the regimental chaplains, and particularly by
Rev. William Owen, who really began these meetings, and was
practically in charge of them. Some of the chaplains were very
uncommon men. My father, who was in the ministry more than fifty
years and had a very wide experience with men, expressed the
highest estimate of them.</p>
          <p>Easily the most marked man among them, however, was the Rev.
William Benton Owen, chaplain of the Seventeenth Mississippi
Regiment. My recollection is that he had been a private soldier and
was commissioned chaplain, because he was already doing the work
of one—yes, of half a dozen—without the commission. Of all the men I
ever knew, I think he was the most consecrated, the most unselfish,
and the most energetic, and that he accomplished more that was
really worthy of grateful recognition and commendation than any
other man I ever knew, of his ability. By this I do not mean to imply
that his ability was small, but simply that I do not include in this
statement a few men I have known, of extraordinary abilities and
opportunities.</p>
          <p>“Brother William,” as we used to call him, was also a man of the
sweetest, loveliest spirit, but of the most unflinching courage as
well. After he became chaplain he never felt it right or fitting that he
should attempt to kill or wound a man, so he never fired another
shot, yet he was seldom back of the actual line of battle. It may give
some faint idea of his exalted Christian heroism to say that his
regular habit was to take charge of the litter-bearers in battle, and
first to see to the removal of the wounded, Federal as well as
Confederate, when the former fell into our hands; and then to attend
to the burial of the dead of both sides, when we held
<pb id="stiles144" n="144"/>
the field and the enemy did not ask leave to bury their own
dead.</p>
          <p>It will be remembered by Federal soldiers that the
American Tract or Bible Society published Testaments with the
United States flag on the fly leaf, and, on the folds of the
banner, the printed words, “If I should fall, send this to - - -,”
space being left for his home address, which each
soldier was supposed to write in the appropriate place. Dear
Brother William could not always burden himself with all these
Testaments taken from the dead soldiers' pockets; but
because that was not possible, he used to carry a little blank
book in which he would copy the home addresses of the dead
soldiers and would afterwards write to their friends, telling
them where they were buried, and, if possible, how their
bodies might be identified.</p>
          <p>After one of the bloody repulses of the enemy at
Spottsylvania in 1864, Brother William was, as usual, out in
front of our works, utterly unconscious of his own heroism or
his own peril. He had removed the wounded of both sides
and taken note of our dead, and was making his memoranda
of the home addresses of the Federal dead, when a Minie
ball struck his left elbow, shattering it dreadfully. He
was at once carried to the field hospital, and some of
Barksdale's (now Humphreys') men sent word down the line
to me. As soon as our guns were disengaged I galloped to the
hospital to see him; but when I arrived he was under the knife,
his elbow being in process of resection, and, of course, was
unconscious. My recollection is that I saw him but for a
moment only. Much as I would have given for even so little as
one word from him, I could not possibly wait, but was obliged
to return to my post.</p>
          <p>I never saw him again. As usual, after one of these
death grapples of '64, Grant slipped off to his left and we
to our right, this time too far for me to get back. In a few
days we heard that Mr. Owen was in Richmond and then that
he had been sent home, and our hopes grew bright that
he would ultimately recover. But no; he was never really a
strong man; indeed he was one of the few small and slight men I
remember in the entire brigade, and, besides, he was
<pb id="stiles145" n="145"/>
worn and wasted with his ceaseless labors. He never really
rallied, but in a short time sank and passed away. Few
servants of God and man as noble and consecrated, as useful
and beloved, as William Owen have lived in this world or left
it for Heaven.</p>
          <p>I have referred incidentally to two special friends of mine in
the company,—whom we will now identify as Allan and Billy,— 
and in a later chapter will refer again to the sincerity and
candor of the intercourse, especially the religious intercourse,
of soldiers with each other. If now I can, by a touch here and
there, reveal something of what passed between me and each
of these noble boys as they were led into the higher life, I will
have done more than I could do in any other way to put
before you the every-day religious life of the army.</p>
          <p>Both my friends were younger than I, both were high,
moral men, but neither was a Christian; Allan and I were law
students when the war interrupted our studies—he at the
University of Virginia, I at Columbia College, New York. It
was he who, having been previously a pronounced Union
man, left the University before breakfast the morning
President Lincoln's call for troops was published and joined a
military company in Richmond before going to his father's
house. Billy was the guide who met us at the train the day we
joined the battery, and conducted us to the Howitzer camp.
We were all in the same detachment, that is, attached to the
same gun, so I readily could and actually did pass much of my
waking life first with one and then with the other, and I
generally laid down by one or the other at night. Our religious
conferences were seldom all three together, for the other two
differed in nature and did not have the same temptations or
difficulties to overcome. I began earnest effort with both of
them as far back as Leesburg, and when I was promoted and
left the battery, just after Chancellorsville, both had become
Christians.</p>
          <p>It may seem almost grotesque in such a connection to
remark that one of the most difficult things for a soldier to do
is to keep his person and his scant clothing reasonably clean,
and that one of the large memories of my soldier life
<pb id="stiles146" n="146"/>
is a record of “divers washings.” I cannot recall ever having
bathed or washed, while with the company, with any one
other than my two dear friends, and it is singular how
vividly I do recall standing waist deep in a pool or
stream of water with Billy or with Allan, each of us scrubbing
away at his only shirt, or at one of his two shirts, as
the case might be, meanwhile earnestly discussing some
aspect of the one great matter.</p>
          <p>Both my dear friends were exceptionally strong men
intellectually, but Billy had the simpler nature, with less
tendency to self-analysis and introspection, stronger physical
life and higher animal spirits; so that with him it was a clear
and a clearly-confessed case of light-hearted content and
happiness as he was, and consequent light-hearted
indifference to any great change. But he was growing more
thoughtful, more tender, more perfect in his moral life.</p>
          <p>He was wounded seriously at Malvern Hill and threatened
with the loss of an eye, and was at home in the country with
his mothers and sisters for some months. Meanwhile his father
died, and he began to realize that if he lived through the war
he would have a great burden to carry with his “seven
women,” as he afterwards called them when nobly bearing
them on his great shoulders. “Seven women taking hold of the
skirt of one man, and that the skirt of a round-about jacket,” as
Billy used to say. He returned to us just before
Chancellorsville to find the great revival at Fredericksburg in
progress and a general condition of thoughtfulness throughout
the army, including our battery. He attended some of these
wonderful services and we were together as much as possible.
I felt the greatest yearning and the strongest hope for him.</p>
          <p>Suddenly Chancellorsville burst upon us, and as Hooker's
really great plan was disclosed we all felt that the next few
days were indeed big with fate. Hooker had crossed an
immense force at the upper fords of the Rappahannock and
Sedgwick was crossing in front of Fredericksburg. All of us
were deeply stirred; and when night fell and our lines began to
grow still, I proposed to Billy that we should walk out to the
point of the hill overlooking the wide river
<pb id="stiles147" n="147"/>
bottom and hear, if we could not see, the Federal army getting
into position. We did so, and no previous hour of our lives had
ever proved as impressive as that which followed. We passed
beyond our pickets and continued to walk until we got where
the murmur of our lines could no longer be heard, while every
movement of Sedgwick's great host was plainly audible. We
heard the commands of the officers, the tramp of the men, the
nimble of the artillery carriages, the shouts and curses of the
drivers. We thought of the great meetings in Fredericksburg
violently brought to a close, and of the great audience of
worshipers to-night manning the lines with us. We thought of
the morrow and then of our dear ones praying for us, while I
found my arms gradually embracing my friend and drawing
him closer to my bosom; and then, taking off our hats, we
prayed,—oh, so quietly, yet so earnestly!—committing us and
ours to God's merciful keeping, for the night, for the morrow,
forever. I do not remember that we spoke after the prayer
ceased, but I felt a new answering pressure in Billy's arms
which now closely enfolded me, and the sense of a new
brotherhood between us. We walked silently back to the guns,
but with a new strength, a deep trust and peace in our souls,
and we lay down with our arms about each other and slept as
quietly as little children—as indeed we were, God's dear
soldier children, who had felt His gentle assurance that all
was and would be well.</p>
          <p>The facts relating to Allan's conversion and death are so
remarkable that I would scarcely dare record them were it
not that I have before me a written memorandum of them
prepared while I was a prisoner at Johnson's Island in the
spring of 1865. Allan was, as before intimated, rather prone
to introspection, but his mental processes were so definite
and his verbal expression of them so clear that one
experienced no difficulty in understanding him and always
felt assured that he thoroughly understood himself.</p>
          <p>A few days before Billy's return, Allan and I were washing
our clothes, and I, as usual, talking, when he abruptly and
almost impatiently interrupted me, saying substantially
that, while I evidently thought I was speaking sensibly and
<pb id="stiles148" n="148"/>
appositely, yet what I was saying had in fact no sort of
application to his case.</p>
          <p>“No doubt,” said he, “it is enough if a man believe on the
Lord Christ; but this direction is given to one who has, in all
sincerity and earnestness, asked, ‘What must I do to be saved?’
Now I feel that I have never sincerely and seriously asked
that question, and I am not asking it now. The fact is, the
whole current of my being sets toward the <sic corr="fulfillment">fulfilment</sic> of my
earthly purpose; though just now the immediate pursuit of it is
kept in abeyance by the war. It is not worth while to attempt
to deceive myself or you; what I really desire and am
absorbed in, my dear Bob, is not eternal life, but the life which
now is. Now then, what should, what can a man do, who is in
my condition? Tell me what you really think; and speak quietly
and practically, so there will be no mistaking your meaning.”</p>
          <p>I knew he was honest and hoped he was more earnest than
he realized at the moment, so I begged for light and guidance
before answering, and then I said:</p>
          <p>“Allan, do you intellectually and firmly believe the New
Testament records and the main outline of the Christian
system; and if you do, have you any feeling at all connected
with them and their bearing upon your life?”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” he said, “my intellectual belief is definite and decided,
and I probably, yes, certainly, have <hi rend="italics">some</hi> desire to accept the
truth in the fuller, Christian sense.”</p>
          <p>“Then,” said I, “your present duty is clear and it is to pray to
God to help you to accept in this fuller sense. Tell Him of your
full intellectual faith and your feeble heart faith. Utter
sincerely that prayer of prayers for a man in such a world and
such a life as this, ‘Lord, I believe, help Thou mine unbelief!‘
Do this sincerely, and I feel satisfied the heart or soul part of
your faith will grow.”</p>
          <p>He protested that the best prayer he could offer would be
but half-hearted and an insult to God. I combatted this idea,
contending that it would be a greater neglect and insult not to
attempt to pray at all, and he finally promised he would try.
When I next saw him alone I think we were on the march for
Chancellorsville. He was evidently unhappy,
<pb id="stiles149" n="149"/>
and when I asked him if he had prayed, he said he had not,
that he had been upon his knees, but could not pray, and added
that his nature must be more paralyzed and things even worse
with him than he had supposed. I saw that another Teacher
and Physician had taken the case out of my hands. He rather
clung to me, but I thought best to leave him with his new
Teacher, and I did.</p>
          <p>Two of our comrades were killed and horribly mangled by
solid shot or whole shell in our Chancellorsville fights, and we
buried one of them at night in a thicket. Returning there after
the burying party had withdrawn, I saw a man on his knees at
the graveside. It was Allan, and at my approach he rose and
advanced to meet me, saying:</p>
          <p>“Bob, I am a mystery to myself. I don't see how I am to go
up to the gun in to-morrow's fight and face temporal and
eternal death; and yet I presume I shall be able to do my
duty.”</p>
          <p>I said decidedly:</p>
          <p>“You have no business, Allan, and no need, to face eternal
death. That is not before you, unless you will have it
so.”</p>
          <p>We said a few words to each other, a few more to God,
went back and joined the sad circle around the camp fire a
short while, and then lay down together. I think I told him
about Billy, and then we slept.</p>
          <p>The next day, after evening roll call, we each put an arm
around the other's waist and walked off into the woods, and
as soon as we got out of earshot of others I began:</p>
          <p>“Well, Allan, to go back where we left off—”</p>
          <p>He put his other hand in mine, and I felt a thrill as he did so,
while, with the sweetest smile, he said:</p>
          <p>“No, Bob, I don't think we will go back there. I've gotten
beyond that point, and I don't like going back. I have found the
Lord Jesus Christ, or, rather, He has found me and taken hold
of me.”</p>
          <p>It was the largest, the most thrilling moment of my life.
Never before had I been conscious of such overpowering
spiritual joy. We were for the moment two disembodied
<pb id="stiles150" n="150"/>
human souls alone with God. The earth with its trappings had
disappeared.</p>
          <p>It was my last word with him. It must have been the next
day that I received my first promotion and left for Richmond,
for Beers was killed at Chancellorsville and I buried him at
Richmond. When I returned to the army it was to Early's
division of the Second Corps. True, we did not begin the
advance into Pennsylvania for almost a full month after
Chancellorsville, and what became of this month to me I
cannot say, except that I went where I was ordered, and do
not recall meeting the Howitzers again until after Gettysburg.</p>
          <p>On his way to his last battle this splendid youth wrote to his
family a brief note, in which he said:</p>
          <p>“In the hurry of the march I have little time for thought, but
whenever my eternal interests do occur to me, I feel entire
assurance of full and free pardon through Jesus Christ, and if
called upon to die this moment I think I could do so
cheerfully.”</p>
          <p>These were the last words he ever wrote.</p>
          <p>After Gettysburg I rode over to the old battery and they told
me this story. On the last day, worn with that tremendous
fight, two of our guns had taken up their last position. All
thought the struggle over. Allan had just seen a friend on the
staff who promised to, and did, send word home of his safety
at the close of the battle. Suddenly a terrific fire burst
thundering, flashing, crashing upon them and No. 1, while
ramming home the shot, had the sponge-staff shattered in his
hands. No. 1 was Billy; Allan was gunner, and stooped to
unkey the other sponge. A frightful explosion, the piece is
dismounted and most of the detachment hurled violently to the
earth!</p>
          <p>The sergeant, a quiet, phlegmatic man, looked about him in
horror. The lieutenant, running up, demanded:</p>
          <p>“Why don't you change that wheel?”</p>
          <p>“I haven't men enough left, sir; we've used up the
super-numeraries.”</p>
          <p>“Where's Allan?”</p>
          <pb id="stiles151" n="151"/>
          <p>“There he is, sir!”—pointing to a mangled mass which
no one had the nerve to approach.</p>
          <p>There lay our noble comrade, each several limb thrice
broken, the body gashed with wounds, the top of the skull
blown off and the brain actually fallen out upon the ground in
two bloody, palpitating lobes. A percussion shell had struck
the rim of the wheel while he bent behind it unkeying the
rammer.</p>
          <p>His chariot and horses of fire had caught him up into
Heaven.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>In the four or five months between Fredericksburg and
Chancellorsville, that is to say, between the middle of
December, '62, and the first of May, '63, several things
occurred of special interest to me personally, as well as
several others of more general and public significance. It is
not possible now to relate these events in their exact
sequence, nor even to be confident that every incident
referred to as belonging to this period actually happened
between the dates mentioned; but neither of these
considerations is important.</p>
          <p>To my next younger brother, Randolph, and myself the one
event of transcendent interest about this time was the
long-deferred arrival in Richmond of our mother and sisters, whom
we had left behind in New Haven in the spring of '61. Neither
of us had heretofore asked anything in the nature of a
furlough, or leave of absence, feeling that our comrades who,
by such leave, would be enabled to see father and mother,
sisters and home, should be entitled to the preference; and
now, when it became known that our dear people were in
Richmond, every one stood back for us and urged our claims.
Not only did the captain approve our application, but the first
lieutenant offered me his thoroughbred horse, “Rebel,” by the
aid of whose fleet limbs it was
<pb id="stiles153" n="153"/>
thought I might be able to get around to the necessary
headquarters in a day, and also, perhaps, have a chance to
say a word in behalf of my brother and myself, instead of
waiting the slow process and the somewhat uncertain
result of the papers working their own way through “the
regular channels.” My recollection is that all this
happened about Christmas time, so that the goodness
of our comrades in standing back for us was the more
praiseworthy.</p>
          <p>I did succeed in making “the grand rounds” in a day, but
might not have done so but for the combined intelligence
and stubbornest of little Rebel. It was almost dark when I
left the last headquarters I had to visit, and started for camp,
which was a long distance off, and the latter part of the way
almost a labyrinth of undistinguishable army tracks. The road
was yet, however, distinct, and my horse not at all fatigued
and making good speed; but just as I was felicitating myself
that all was working well, the road turned sharply to the left,
to avoid an apparently impassable swamp, but the little
horse absolutely refused to turn with it, insisting upon going
directly forward into the swamp.</p>
          <p>I fought him for ten or fifteen minutes to no purpose. He
only balked and wheeled and reared and plunged, until finally,
utterly worn out, I gave him his head and he took and kept his
course, as the crow flies, into and through the swamp, over
and past fence and ditch, on through brush and brake and
briar and thicket, I making no effort to guide or control him;
indeed, after a short time, utterly unable even to see where he
was going and only attempting to lie as close as possible to his
back and as far as possible to protect my face and eyes. I
never took another such ride, before or since, and had no
idea when or where it would end, until at last—yet in an
incredibly short time—the little fellow pushed his
determined front through the fringe of low pines that protected
our battery horse shelters and—we were at home. I was
bruised and scratched, tired and cold, wet and hungry, but I
made the plucky little horse comfortable before doing anything
for myself, and next morning satisfied myself that he had
never before been over the tract of country we had
traversed together, and that it was a clear case of unerring
<pb id="stiles154" n="154"/>
instinct for locality and direction. I had all the required
endorsements, and that very day “Randy” and I took the train
for Richmond, the two happiest boys among all Marse Robert's
ragged thousands.</p>
          <p>When it is recalled that it had been nearly two years since
we left our mother and sisters in the North; that during all this
time we had only irregular, illegal, and very infrequent
communication with them, and consequently had now all the
vivid experiences of two such years to interchange, the intense
interest and bliss of those furlough days in Richmond may be
faintly imagined. My memory is not absolutely clear, but I am
almost positive that Mrs. Beers and her little girls had come on
with our mother and sisters and that Beers had also gotten a
furlough to meet them and was in Richmond with us. If so, it
was the last time I ever saw the noble fellow alive. It will be
remembered he fell at Chancellorsville.</p>
          <p>One matter of very great importance which took shape
between Fredericksburg and Chancellorsville was the
organization of our (Cabell's) battalion of artillery. It was made
up of four batteries—ours, the First Company, Richmond
Howitzers, of Virginia; Manly's Battery, of North Carolina; the
Troupe Artillery and Frazier's Battery, of Georgia; and it
included, at different times, from sixteen to eighteen guns,
mostly brass Napoleons. Its commanding officer was Col. H.
C. Cabell, a member of the historic and illustrious Virginia
family of that name and a man every way worthy of his
lineage.</p>
          <p>For eighteen months of the hottest part of the war I was the
adjutant of Colonel Cabell, fighting by his side by day and
sleeping by his side by night, eating and drinking often out of
the same tin cup, lying upon the same oil cloth and covered
with the same blanket—side by side, heart to heart soul to
soul. If ever I knew a man through and through, I knew him;
and a cleaner, sweeter, more loyal soul I never knew. His
essential characteristics were pure and unselfish nature, tender
and affectionate heart, gentle and unfailing courtesy,
single-hearted and devoted patriotism, quiet but indomitable courage.
I never knew him to fail to be at the
<pb id="stiles155" n="155"/>
point of peril along the front of his battalion, nor there nor
anywhere to fail to measure up to the full standard of a
battalion commander's duty and responsibility. I never knew
him to shrink from any hardship or any duty or any sacrifice
for the cause to which we had devoted our lives. I never knew
him to fail to treat a private soldier with a consideration which
was grateful to him, and yet never knew this courtesy to
interfere with the maintenance of discipline. I never knew him
to wound intentionally the feelings of a human being, or fail to
repair the wrong if committed inadvertently. He was a man of
intellect and culture, as well as character; as a friend ever
faithful, as a companion always agreeable, as an officer
enjoying the unqualified confidence and approval of his
superiors, and the universal respect and affection of his
subordinates.</p>
          <p>I am well aware that all this should have resulted in even
more, but he who never did injustice to others never did full
justice to himself. He lacked self-assertion and aggression; to
some extent, too, he lacked the manner and bearing of a
soldier, and he never maneuvered for position for himself or
his battalion.</p>
          <p>He was not, however, lacking in proper soldierly ambition.
He already enjoyed distinguished position; for the officer who
attains and reputably maintains the rank of full colonel of
artillery fills a position of great honor and responsibility. But he
was much pleased to learn late in the war that certain of his
friends, as they announced themselves, were planning to
secure for him the exceptional rank of brigadier-general of
artillery. He was interested and gratified until he accidentally
discovered that it was involved in the plan that he should be
retired to the permanent defenses of Richmond, and another
officer should take his battalion in the field. When this feature
was developed, for once he flamed into ungovernable rage. It
was the only time I ever heard him swear. “Stiles,” said he,
“what do these people take me for? Have I given men any
reason to consider me a damned sneak and coward and fool?”</p>
          <p>I cannot forbear a trifling incident, revealing in a flash the
simplicity and beauty of his nature and of our relations and
<pb id="stiles156" n="156"/>
intercourse. It occurred at the left base of the Bloody Angle
at Spottsylvania in 1864, where one or two of his batteries had
been ordered to take the place of some of our artillery which
had been captured, and to stay the rout. The guns were in
column back of the lines, awaiting our return, we having
ridden into that gloomy pit of defeat and demoralization to
determine exactly where they should be placed. As we came
out, before riding back to bring up the guns, we dismounted in
a place of comparative security, just to stretch our limbs and
unbend a moment from the awful tension. Leaving his horse,
Colonel Cabell walked up to me, color mounting his face and
tears filling his eyes, and threw his arms about me, saying, in a
voice husky with feeling, exactly these words: “Stiles, if you
should dare to get killed, I'd never forgive you.”</p>
          <p>Such was the commanding officer of our battalion. Either
at the organization or soon after, Major S. P. Hamilton, of
South Carolina, was assigned to duty with the command, and
at a later period Major W. H. Gibbes, of the same State, was
with us for a few weeks or months. I am not certain as to the
date of my first service with the battalion as adjutant. Some of
my comrades insist that it was from the inception; but I am
sure this is not true, unless, as is possible, I may have been
detailed by Colonel Cabell to aid temporarily in arranging
matters and getting the new organization in working order. I
could not have been regularly even “acting adjutant,” for I held
no commission until after Chancellorsville, a battle in which
we were fought as a battalion, though in two divisions, while I
distinctly remember I fought as a private soldier, in the old
battery, in my usual position at my own gun.</p>
          <p>Soon after the battle of Gettysburg, whether on the Virginia
or Maryland side of the river I do not now remember, Colonel
Cabell met me and asked what I was doing, and learning that
I was at the time a sort of free lance, with one of the artillery
battalions of the Second Corps, urged me to get the informal
permission of General Early, with whose headquarters I kept
up some sort of connection, and go back with him to the First
Corps and act as adjutant of his
<pb id="stiles157" n="157"/>
battalion, which I did; he promising to get a regular order
assigning me to this duty. Upon reflection, I think the first
order of detail for duty at his headquarters, by Colonel Cabell
himself, prior to Chancellorsville, as above suggested, is very
probable, as I do not otherwise see how the Colonel would
have known me or had reason to suppose I would be
satisfactory to him in the position.</p>
          <p>Among matters worthy of note occurring prior to
Chancellorsville, it may not be out of place to mention the
very active commerce or interchange of commodities, carried
on by tiny sailing vessels, between the north and south banks
of the Rappahannock River, at and below Fredericksburg,
both before and after that battle. The communication was
almost constant and the vessels many of them really beautiful
little craft, with shapely hulls nicely painted, elaborate rigging,
trim sails, closed decks, and perfect steering apparatus. The
cargoes, besides the newspapers of the two sides, usually
consisted on our side of tobacco and on the Federal side of
coffee and sugar, yet the trade was by no means confined to
these articles, and on a sunny, pleasant day the waters were
fairly dotted with the fairy fleet. Many a weary hour of picket
duty was thus relieved and lightened, and most of the officers
seemed to wink at the infraction of military law, if such it
was. A few rigidly interdicted it, but it never really ceased.</p>
          <p>Another institutional amusement of the army in the winter
of '62-3, which tended greatly to relieve the almost
unendurable tedium of camp life, was the snow-ball battle.
These contests were unique in many respects. In the first
place here was sport, or friendly combat, on the grandest
scale, perhaps, known in modern times. Entire Brigades lined
up against each other for the fight. And not the masses of
men only, but the organized military bodies—the line and
field officers, the bands and the banners, the generals and
their staffs, mounted as for genuine battle. There was the
formal demand for the surrender of the camp, and the refusal,
the charge, and the repulse; the front, the flank, the rear
attack. And there was intense earnestness in the struggle— 
sometimes limbs were broken and eyes, at least
<pb id="stiles158" n="158"/>
temporarily, put out, and the camp equipment of the
vanquished was regarded as fair booty to the victors.</p>
          <p>I recall a visit paid in company with my father, not long after
the battle of Fredericksburg, to the camp of my uncle
mentioned in a former chapter as having been in command of
Lawton's brigade in that fight. He was still in command of it.
My father asked the cause of several very heavy bruises on
his face. I never saw my uncle more deeply embarrassed, as
he related, blushing like a girl, what he called his “preposterous
experience” in leading his brigade the day before in a snow
battle with Hoke's, which lasted several hours—and as the
really laughable picture was developed, its strong coloring
heightened by my uncle's embarrassed blushes, I never saw
my father more heartily amused. It seemed that my uncle at
one point in the conflict had been dragged from his horse and
captured by Hoke's men, but later had been recaptured by his
own command, and on both occasions had been pretty roughly
handled. One would have supposed these veteran troops had
seen too much of the real thing to seek amusement in playing
at battle.</p>
          <p>I had now been in the army for nearly two years and was
still a private soldier, yet quite content as such. My mental
attitude in this regard was perhaps rather unusual. I had
originally volunteered exclusively from sense of duty,
regarding the war, so far as it affected me personally, as an
interruption to my purposes and ambitions in connection with
the law; but I was never one of those who considered the
conflict to be a matter of sixty or ninety days or a year, and
soon came to look upon it as of indefinite duration and likely to
prove an absorbing business to me for a long time to come.
Gradually I became interested in military life and began to
contemplate it as perhaps my life work, and from this time my
interest in it grew apace. Still, I had thought little of promotion
except in the aspect of making myself deserving of it. True,
General Hill had, at quite an early period, said something of a
commission, but none had come, and I had continued to look
upon the position, even of a corporal, as requiring a certain
amount of military aptitude, not to say talent and training,
which I was not confident I had.</p>
          <pb id="stiles159" n="159"/>
          <p>But this morbid and unpractical view of things was giving
way before the stubborn fact, established by observation and
experience, that numbers of men in positions above me, were
obviously my inferiors in every qualification and requisite for
rank and command; nor could I be blind to the further fact
that my commanding officers regarded me with rather special
confidence and approval. Gradually I came to entertain the
idea that I might some day be offered promotion and perhaps
should not feel called upon to reject it, though I could never
contemplate any effort on my part to secure it.</p>
          <p>While I was in this state of mind, some little time before the
opening of the Chancellorsville campaign, I received a
communication from the Engineer Bureau in Richmond
containing an appointment to a second lieutenancy in “Engineer
Troops,” a new corps about to be organized in the Army of
Northern Virginia. There was no explanation accompanying
the paper, and I did not recognize as familiar any name
connected with it, and after due reflection concluded that the
communication had been sent me by mistake and was
intended for my cousin, Robert Mackay Stiles, who was an
engineer, as I understood then serving in the far South in
some appropriate capacity. I supposed his services were
desired in organizing the new corps, and I actually returned
the paper, with the above suggestion, and therewith dismissed
the matter from my mind. Meanwhile there occurred one of
the most noteworthy experiences of my life.</p>
          <p>The very day, I think it was, of what might be termed
“our spring opening” of '63, and probably before we made the
first move looking toward Chancellorsville, I was busy about
some duty in the battery, when I heard the captain's voice
calling me sharply, and as I approached his quarters noticed a
courier just leaving. The captain informed me that General
Jackson had sent an order for me to report immediately at his
headquarters. When my first surprise subtitled I told Captain
McCarthy, what I was then confident was the case, that the
message was doubtless from my father, who loved to
work in the Second Corps, and spent much time at the
General's quarters; but the captain protested that
<pb id="stiles160" n="160"/>
the order was from “Old Jack” himself, that he could not imagine
what he wanted with me; he hoped not to have me shot for some
violation of military law. “However,” said he, “you had better take
one of the sergeant's horses and go and find out for yourself”— 
which I proceeded at once to do; but had not gotten beyond the
confines of camp before I heard the captain calling again, the
utterance of my name this time alternating with shouts and peals of
laughter. On riding up I found him reading, for the second time, an
autograph note from General Jackson, addressed to Captain
McCarthy, and to the following effect: that if we had not already
received orders to move we would receive them in a few moments;
that Robert Stiles must not report to him until further orders; that he
didn't want any <hi rend="italics">“untried man”</hi> about him when about to move.</p>
          <p>The relations of our captain to the better soldiers in the battery
were peculiar and enjoyable. On duty he was our commanding
officer, off duty our intimate friend. I used to call him “the intelligent
young Irishman,” and to tell the following story in explanation: just
before the Howitzers left Richmond, in the spring of '61, General
Magruder called upon Major Randolph to send him a suitable man
for a courier, adding, “intelligent young Irishman preferred”—and
McCarthy was sent as “filling the bill.” The captain had long been
“laying for me,” as the saying is, and now he had his revenge—“Old
Jack” had conferred upon me orthodox Presbyterian baptism as “the
untried man,” and so far as the captain was concerned, certainly the
name “stuck.”</p>
          <p>What would he and I have given, two or three days later, to recall
the action of the next few moments. I distinctly remember the general
appearance of General Jackson's note. It was written in pencil on a
small half sheet of bluish paper, evidently torn from a letter, and I
remember, too, how Captain McCarthy—laughing still—tore it up,
when he had read it out three or four times, and how the fragments
floated adown the air. I told Mrs. Jackson of the circumstance not
long after the war, and she pronounced the contents of the note, and
particularly the last clause, to be strongly illustrative of the
directness and concentration which rendered
<pb id="stiles161" n="161"/>
her husband oblivious of everything but the one idea at any one
time having possession of him.</p>
          <p>A few days later, but after Jackson's death, my father gave me
what I may term the obverse, or face side, of this incident. He was at
Jackson's headquarters when the General, as it were in a tone of
inquiry, said:</p>
          <p>“Doctor, I understand you have a son in the army?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, General,” my father answered, “I have three of them.”</p>
          <p>“One is like you, isn't he?”</p>
          <p>“No, sir; I don't know that either of them is specially like me.”</p>
          <p>Then, somewhat impatiently:</p>
          <p>“Well, your oldest son is named Robert, isn't he?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, Bob is my eldest son.”</p>
          <p>“From what I have heard of him, I think I should like to have him
with me.”</p>
          <p>“Well, sir, I would be delighted to have him come.”</p>
          <p>“But it isn't for you to say, Doctor; he ought to be allowed to
decide for himself. Besides, both of you should consider that the
probability of his being killed will be greatly increased. I am liable to
make mistakes in my orders and to send a man into danger that might
be avoided by going around some longer and less perilous route. But
he must not stop to consider this. He must take his life in his hand
and carry my orders as I send them.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir; I think I understand, and I am sure Bob will carry your
orders <hi rend="italics">as you send them.</hi> His life is in God's hands. Longer or
shorter, I would like to have him spend it with you, and I am sure
that would be his choice, too.”</p>
          <p>“But, Doctor, you have no right to decide for him. Tell
him all I have told you, and let him decide for himself.”</p>
          <p>“But, General, I do decide and have decided, for Bob and for
myself. He will be delighted to come to you.”</p>
          <p>“Very well sir. In my opinion you have no right to make this
decision, but if you insist upon taking the responsibility, I'll send
for your son.”</p>
          <p>And he did, with the result already given.</p>
          <pb id="stiles162" n="162"/>
          <p>He was not as sure of me as my dear father was; to Jackson,
certainly, I was “the untried man.” I have often thought what might
have been if I had gone to him that day. Of course my blood would
have been up, and the chances are very great that I would have
fallen that fateful night in the Chancellorsville Wilderness, when the
wondrous captain did make one of those mistakes to which he said
he was “liable,” and which then cost, not a little life like mine, but
that great life of his, upon which destiny and history hung.</p>
          <p>Among the pet names with which our constant lover, the Army of
the Potomac, was wont to soften and sweeten its early spring
wooings of us was “Damned sassafras-tea-drinking rebels.” If a
trifle vigorous and not even a trifle euphonious, it was yet certainly
appropriate and suggestive, for the first steady spring sunshine,
that dried out the roads and caused the sassafras buds to swell,
sent the first tremors of returning life darting through the coils of the
great serpentine armies which had lain torpid in the winter's cold,
until suddenly the one or the other monster glided, hissing from its
den, and delivered its stroke. To our friends, the enemy, the only
relation between the swelling of the sassafras buds and the
spring-burst of battle was chronological; but with us the sassafras
amounted almost to a sub-commissariat—we chewed it, we drank it,
we smelled it, and it was ever at hand without the trouble or expense
of transport.</p>
          <p>All through the latter part of April, '63, even more than the normal
premonitory spring shudderings were noted throughout the great
winter camps and quarters of the Federal army corps across the
river, and very soon the marvelous army telegraph was in full
operation. Every surviving veteran of either side will understand
what I mean. It was really little less than miraculous the way in
which information—often astonishingly correct—as to what had
happened or was about to happen, was transmitted along the lines
of the army. Partial explanations readily occur, but I have yet to meet
the first intelligent and observant soldier of the Army of Northern
Virginia who is not ready to admit that, in some instances, the rapid
transmission of news and the detailed accuracy of forecast that
sifted through the army were at the time, and remain to-day,
inexplicable.</p>
          <pb id="stiles163" n="163"/>
          <p>Of course we knew of the resignation or removal of Burnside and
the appointment of Hooker as his successor, late in January, and we
had seen, too, the remarkable order of the latter, issued upon
assuming command, in which he declared that:
“In equipment, intelligence, and valor, the enemy is
our inferior. Let us never hesitate to give him battle whenever we
can find him.” From this order, as well as from his military history,
with which we were familiar, we “knew our man.” We knew also the
atmosphere that surrounded his appointment, but I for one never
saw, until long after the war, the remarkable letter of Mr. Lincoln to
his appointee, which not only revives and bears out my recollection
of the spirit of the times, but fills me with amazement that a
self-respecting officer could have accepted an appointment confirmed or
accompanied by such a letter:</p>

MAJOR-GENERAL HOOKER:</opener>
                  <p><hi rend="italics">General:</hi>—I have placed you at the head of the Army of the Potomac. Of
course I have done this upon what appears to me to be sufficient reasons. And
yet I think it best for you to know that there are some things in regard to
which I am not quite satisfied with you. I believe you to be a brave and skilful
soldier, which, of course, I like. I also believe you do not mix politics with
your profession, in which you are right. You have confidence in yourself,
which is a valuable, if not an indispensable quality. You are ambitious, which,
within reasonable bounds, does good rather than harm. But I think that during
General Burnside's command of the army you have taken counsel of your
ambition and thwarted him as much as you could, in which you did a great
wrong both to the country and to a meritorious and honorable brother officer.
I have heard in such a way as to believe it of your recently saying that both
the army and the Government needed a dictator. Of course it was not for this,
but in spite of it, that I have given you the command. Only those generals
who gain successes can set up as dictators. What I now ask of you, is military
success, and I will risk the dictatorship. The Government will support you to
the utmost of its ability, which is neither more nor less than it has done and
will do for all commanders. I much fear the spirit you have aided to infuse into
the army, of criticising their commander and withholding confidence from
him, will now turn upon
<pb id="stiles164" n="164"/>
you. I shall assist you as far as I can to put it down. Neither you nor
Napoleon, if he were alive again, could get any good out of an army
while such a spirit prevails in it. And now, beware of rashness! beware
of rashness! but with energy and sleepless vigilance, go forward and
give us victories. </p>

          <p>One of the ablest discussions of Chancellorsville from the
Confederate side is to be found in an address delivered by Gen.
Fitzhugh Lee before the Virginia Division of the Army of Northern
Virginia, on the 24th of October, 1879. In that address the author
says of this battle that, “It brings before the military student as high
a type of an offensive battle as ever adorned the pages of history.”
Col. Walter Taylor says: “Of all the battles fought by the Army of
Northern Virginia, that of Chancellorsville stands first as illustrating
the consummate audacity and military skill of commanders and the
valor and determination of the men.” It is probable that the general
consensus of opinion among the surviving officers and soldiers of
the Confederacy concurs in these estimates. My own conception of
the matter was at the time, and has ever since been, that the brilliant
genius and audacious courage of Lee and Jackson shone so
conspicuously throughout these operations, partly because the plan
of their adversary was truly great—far superior to anything that had
theretofore been projected against Lee and his staunch soldiers.</p>
          <p>The battle is of such exceptional interest, and at the same time
savors so much of the marvelous, that I ask pardon for making a
lengthy quotation from Colonel Taylor's book, premising that it was
twelve miles or more from Deep Run, below Fredericksburg, where
Sedgwick and Early opposed each other, to Chancellorsville, the
position selected by Hooker as the base of his main operations and
where he had concentrated the bulk of his army. On pages 83-5 of
his “Four Years with General Lee,” Colonel Taylor says:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p> General Lee, with fifty-seven thousand troops of all arms, intrenched
along the line of hills south of the Rappahannock, near Fredericksburg, was
confronted by General Hooker, with the Army of the Potomac, one hundred
and thirty-two thousand strong, occupying the bluffs on the opposite side of
the river.</p>
            <pb id="stiles165" n="165"/>
            <p>On the 29th of April the Federal commander essayed to put into execution an
admirably conceived plan of operations, from which he doubtless concluded
that he could compel either the evacuation by General Lee of his strongly
fortified position, or else his utter discomfiture, when unexpectedly and
vigorously assailed upon his left flank and rear by the “finest army on the
planet”—really more than twice the size of his own.</p>
            <p>A formidable force, under General Sedgwick, was thrown across the river
below Fredericksburg, and made demonstrations of an intention to assail the
Confederate front. Meanwhile, with great celerity and secrecy, General Hooker,
with the bulk of his army, crossed at the upper fords, and in an able manner and
wonderfully short time had concentrated four of his seven army corps,
numbering fifty-six thousand men, at Chancellorsville, about ten miles west of
Fredericksburg. His purpose was now fully developed to General Lee, who,
instead of waiting its further prosecution, immediately determined on the
movement the least expected by his opponent. He neither proceeded to make
strong his left against attack from the direction of Chancellorsville, nor did he move southward so as to put his army between that of General Hooker and the
Confederate capital; but leaving General Early with about nine thousand men to
take care of General Sedgwick, he moved with the remainder of his army,
numbering forty-eight thousand men, toward Chancellorsville. As soon as the
advance of the enemy was encountered, it was attacked with vigor, and very
soon the Federal army was on the defensive in its apparently impregnable
position. It was not the part of wisdom to attempt to storm the stronghold; but
Sedgwick would certainly soon be at work in the rear, and Early, with his
inadequate force, could not do more than delay and hamper him. It was,
therefore, imperatively necessary to strike—to strike boldly, effectively
and at once. There could be no delay. Meanwhile two more army corps had joined
General Hooker, who had now about Chancellorsville ninety-one thousand—six
corps, except one division of the second corps (Couch's) which had been
left with Sedgwick at Fredericksburg. It was a critical position for the
Confederate commander, but his confidence in his trusted lieutenant and brave
men was such that he did not long hesitate. Encouraged by the counsel and
confidence of General Jackson, he determined still further to divide his army;
and while he, with the divisions of Anderson and McLaws, less than fourteen
thousand men, should hold the enemy in his front, he would hurl Jackson upon
his flank and rear and crush and crumble him as between the upper and nether
millstone. The very boldness of the movement contributed much to insure its
success.</p>
            <p>This battle illustrates most admirably the peculiar talent and individual
excellence of Lee and Jackson. For quickness of perception, boldness in
planning and skill in directing, Lee had no superior; for celerity
<pb id="stiles166" n="166"/>
in his movements, audacity in the execution of bold designs and impetuosity in
attacking, Jackson had not his peer.</p>
          </q>
          <p>About the 28th of April dispatches by the army or grapevine
telegraph began to come in very rapidly, and that, too, minutely and
correctly revealing the situation. We were at the time in camp a little
back of the main fortified line. That evening, I think it was, we
received orders to be ready to move at a moment's notice. Very early
next morning we heard firing in the direction of Fredericksburg. It
was very foggy, and we could see nothing, but understood that a
heavy force of the enemy was crossing to our side. They remained
all day concealed under the river bank, but at night—I think the
night of the 29th—deployed out into position in the great plain.
Meanwhile our battery had been ordered to the same position it had
occupied in the battle of Fredericksburg, and all during that day
Hooker's plan of operations was becoming more and more clearly
developed, and with Sedgwick in our front and Hooker in
overwhelming force in the rear of our left flank, we deeply felt its
power.</p>
          <p>The discussion waxed hot as to what Marse Robert would do.
Until he decided, none of us knew what was best, yet the counter
plot was intensely absorbing, and when at last—I think it was the
night of the 30th—orders came for us to limber up and move out by
the little road by which we had come in, and which ran at right
angles between the lines and the main road running parallel to the
river, the interest was intense, and the dry betting ran high as to
whether, when we struck the main road, it would be “head of column
to the right” or to “the left.” If the latter, then we would know Marse
Robert had concluded that it was the part of wisdom to put his army
between Sedgwick and Richmond and to maneuver all the attacking
columns of his enemies to his front. In that case we might exhale a
deep, full breath; for a little while, at least, the extreme tension would
be off. But if the horses' heads turned to the right, then we knew well
that it was to be the closest and deadliest grapple we had ever
experienced. I cannot remember which I thought the wiser alternative
or what part I took in the discussion;
<pb id="stiles167" n="167"/>
but I do distinctly recall that when the first gun struck the
main road and the heads of the leaders swung around <hi rend="italics">to the right</hi>, I
drew in my breath and set my teeth, calling upon what was best and
strongest in my entire being to brace me for the struggle.</p>
          <p>I think it was a day or so before we finally left the
Fredericksburg lines that there occurred one of the most
remarkable minor incidents I witnessed from the beginning to the
end of the war. We had lifted the ammunition chest out of the hole,
back of and beneath the little work we had been occupying, and had
replaced it upon the gun carriage and limbered up the piece. A
group of about a dozen men, not all belonging to our battery, were
standing upon the earth-work gazing across the river bottom to the
Stafford side, when a little puff of white smoke indicated that the
gentlemen on the other side had determined to try their long-range
guns. The shell flew a little too high, but directly above us and too
close to be comfortable. Before quite reaching us, however, it began
to wobble and turn over, indicating that the projectile or propulsive
force was well nigh exhausted. My recollection is that we could see
the shell distinctly. An infantryman jumped from the work into the
hole just vacated by the limber chest. The shell exploded just after it
passed us, and the base came hurtling back and actually dashed out
the brains of that man, the only man who had not stood his ground.
Several other shots were fired, but not a man flinched and not
another man was injured.</p>
          <p>I was reminded of a story of the Emperor Napoleon, who in
visiting his picket line with the corporal of the guard came to a
position which commanded just the view he wanted of the enemy's
lines, but was exposed to a galling and dangerous fire from their
sharpshooters. The little corporal was standing, absorbed as was
his wont when analyzing a battle-field, head sunk between his
shoulders, hands behind his back and limbs far apart. He turned to
speak to the corporal of the guard, and just as he did so a ball
passed between the Emperor's legs and killed the corporal,
crouching behind him for protection. Two soldiers stooped to pick
up the body, but the Emperor hissed out, “Behold the just fate of
the coward! Let the carrion rot.”</p>

          </argument>
          <p>I recall but one or two features of the march to Chancellorsville.
We were with McLaws' division, and of the 14,000 (Anderson's and
McLaws' commands) with which General Lee undertook to hold, and
did hold, the front of Hooker's 92,000, while Jackson, with the balance
of our forces, swung around his right flank and rear.</p>
          <p>Two of our batteries, the Howitzers and Manly's, left
Fredericksburg at midnight, April 30th, 1863, and early on the
morning of May 1st were drawn up in column on the side of the Old
Turnpike, head toward Chancellorsville, to allow the “Light
Division,” as Gen. A. P. Hill's command was called, to pass. Jackson,
as we understood, was somewhere ahead, and Hill's superb troops
seemed to be resolved that he should not be compelled to wait even
a moment for them. They were in light marching order, and I thought
I had never seen anything equal to the swinging, silent stride with
which they fairly devoured the ground. The men were magnified in
the morning mist which overhung the low flat-lands they were
traversing, and at the same time imparted a ghostly indistinctness of
outline, which added to the impressiveness of the scene. All was
silent as the grave, save the muffled and almost synchronous tread
of the thousands of feet in the soft road, and the low clatter or jingle
of accoutrements.</p>
          <pb id="stiles169" n="169"/>
          <p>There was a sudden outburst in the rear of tumultuous shoutings,
which rapidly swept toward us, and very soon General Lee, with a
full staff, galloped to the front, passing between us and the Light
Division, which, however, had now halted and stacked arms across
the road from our guns. I cannot recall a moment of higher
enthusiasm during the four years of the war. The troops were
transported with the wildest excitement and the General also
appeared to be unusually impressed. I cannot say that it was his
habit, but I distinctly remember that on this occasion he lifted his
hat, taking it by the crown with his right hand and holding it
suspended above his majestic head as far as we could see him. I
remember, too, how the men greeted him, shouting, “What a head,
what a head! See that glorious head! God bless it, God bless it!”</p>
          <p>In a short time the Light Division got under way again, resuming
its swaying, swinging, panther-like step, others of Jackson's
command following them. When the last of his troops had passed,
we resumed our march and continued it until we finally reached the
position assigned us, with McLaws' division, which formed a part of
the thin Confederate line covering Hooker's front, and a most
peculiar position it was. It was an old house site in a small clearing,
but the main building had been burned or destroyed, apparently
years ago, while one or two outbuildings were standing. Our guns
came into battery in an old pansy bed, which before we left was
spattered with splotches of intenser color. We could see absolutely
nothing of the enemy, nor of any other part of our own lines; indeed
the entire region was a gloomy thicket and our infantry line so
stretched and attenuated that the men were scarcely in sight even of
each other. It was currently, and I have every reason to believe
correctly, reported, that in inspecting the line of his division,
General McLaws found one of his brigades actually faced to the
rear.</p>
          <p>Although the enemy was not in sight from our position, nor we
from theirs, yet we interchanged occasionally a considerable fire,
which resulted on our side in a few sad and ghastly casualties; but
we have already spoken of these and
<pb id="stiles170" n="170"/>
may speak of them again in another connection. For the present, let
us turn to something of a less painful nature.</p>
          <p>There were two little dogs in the battalion which afforded not
only a good deal of amusement, but also a field for some interesting
observation and discrimination. Both were small, the Troupe
Artillery dog, the larger of the two, about the size of a small coon
without a tail, which he in general resembled. He was dark, stone
gray on his back, inclining (somewhat more than a coon) to tan or
fawn color underneath. He had also rough, coarse hair; short, stout
legs, and, as implied, little or no tail. He had entered the service
early, joining the battery during the unfortunate campaign in
Western Virginia, and was named after the commanding general,
“Robert Lee.” He was very plucky in a personal difficulty, but I
blush to say, an abject coward in battle. The Howitzer dog, whom
we christened “Stonewall Jackson,” came to us a mere puppy in the summer of 1862, after the battles around Richmond, and while we were waiting the
re-equipment of the battery. He was a Welsh fice, very small, but
beautifully formed, gleaming white in color, with a few spots of jet
black, his hair fine and short, and lying close and smooth. He did
not carry guns enough, metaphorically speaking, to amount to much
in a canine encounter, but he was a born warrior, a perfect hero in
battle. When our guns were in action he was always careering wildly
about them, and in any pause of their hoarse thunders the shrill
treble of his tiny bark was always to be heard.</p>
          <p>In the battle of Chancellorsville, while we were occupying the
position above described, I had occasion to go down the little
declivity in rear of the guns to the caissons. I had just left the
battery firing actively and Stonewall even more than usually
excited, when my eye chanced to light upon poor little Bob Lee
sneaking to the rear, in fright absolutely pitiable. It may serve as an
excuse for him that he had gotten separated from his company,
which had been left behind at Fredericksburg with Early. To my
astonishment, he made for a large tree, back of which and as close in
and under as possible he crept, and crouched and squatted, very
much as a demoralized man might have done. The action and the
<pb id="stiles171" n="171"/>
purpose were unmistakable. I do not know that I could have
believed it if I had not seen it with my own eyes, but there was no
room for doubt. One might not feel generously and sympathetically
inclined toward a man under such circumstances, but it is pleasant
to be able to say that little Bob's prudent precautions accomplished
their object. As I have always understood, he passed safely
through the war and followed the men of his battery to Georgia.</p>
          <p>Stonewall was a remarkable little animal. It was surprising that he
was not lost or killed in action, especially when we had to change
our position rapidly under fire, which was very often. Under such
circumstances, whoever happened to be nearest the little fellow, if
by a frantic dive he could manage to get him in time, would lift the lid
of a limber chest, drop him in an empty compartment, and clap the lid
down again before the gun dashed off with the rest; but as soon as
it came into battery in the new position, No. 6, before getting at his
fuses, would first lift the little warrior from his dark, close quarters
and drop him on the ground, where, in a twinkling, he would recover
his balance, resume his part in the fight and keep it up until, in
another move, he was again imprisoned <hi rend="italics">in transitu</hi>, either in an
ammunition chest or under some one's arm.</p>
          <p>He was an intelligent, companionable little chap, and the boys
taught him some uncommon tricks. His special master, teacher,
patron and friend was dear old “Van,”—chief of the second
detachment,—who could do anything from shoeing a horse to
making a clock out of pine bark, and must of necessity be always
doing something, even if it were but training a puppy. Van taught
Stonewall to attend roll-call, and to sit up on his haunches, next to
him, on the advanced rank of non-commissioned officers, and he
made a little pipe for him, which Stonewall would hold firmly in his
mouth when Van had once inserted it between his teeth. Then when
the orderly sergeant, before beginning the roll, called “Pipes out!”
Van would stoop and slip Stonewall's pipe from his month to his left
paw, which would then instantly drop to his side with the other, and
the little corporal would stand, or sit, stiffly and staunchly in the
position of a soldier, eyes front, until the company was dismissed.</p>
          <pb id="stiles172" n="172"/>
          <p>Stonewall was stolen from us several times by Harry Hayes'
brigade, his Louisiana Creoles having the ungovernable passion of
the French soldier for pets. At last the cunning thieves succeeded in
hiding him, and we lost him finally, to the deep regret, not to say
grief, of every man in the battery.</p>
          <p>After fighting for some hours in a very indecisive and
unsatisfactory fashion, in the unsatisfactory position above
described, two of our pieces, my gun one of them, were advanced by
a neighborhood road, several hundred yards to the right and front
and to the top of a hill from which we could see the entire formation
of the Federal lines about Chancellorsville. Who discovered this
position I never knew, but it was one of the most remarkable,
perhaps the most remarkable, I ever saw. It was on the left flank and
rear of the Federal lines about Chancellorsville house, which was not
more than a thousand or twelve hundred yards distant from our
guns. The Federal artillery was as regularly and accurately stationed
as if on parade or at drill—guns in front and in action, the motions
of the cannoneers at the manual of the piece being distinctly
recognizable, except when the smoke of the successive discharges
momentarily shut them off; limbers the required distance in rear of
guns, caissons in rear of limbers, drivers sitting bolt upright on their
horses, and three heavy, black lines of infantry lying down back of
the artillery.</p>
          <p>I never before felt such a rising of my heart into my throat as I did
while lying just behind the crest of the ridge, gazing intently upon
this scene and aiding the gunners of the two pieces in making
careful estimate of the distance. We were unwilling to waste a shot,
knowing that, in the very nature of things, such an opportunity
would not be long vouchsafed us. In the pauses or subsidences of
the cannonade we could hear the clear, high-pitched, thrilling,
dauntless yell of our charging infantry, and we felt what our fire, if
well directed, might mean to those gallant fellows. We had already
unlimbered and moved the guns forward by hand, so that their
muzzles just failed to project over the brow of the hill. We went back
to the limbers,
<pb id="stiles173" n="173"/>
took out two shells and cut the fuses accurately in accordance with
our estimate of the distance, loaded and ran both pieces forward
again until they just cleared the crest of the ridge; then, running
down the screws and elevating the muzzles appropriately to the
distance, every man in the detachment fell into place, the primers
were inserted in the vents and both lanyards pulled simultaneously.
The car detected but one discharge, and the two shells flew
screaming and bursting together in the very midst of the mass of
Federal artillery, exploding certainly one, and, as it seemed, two,
ammunition chests or caissons.</p>
          <p>The blow was utterly unexpected, the effect overwhelming, and
we gave them no time to recover, but kept throwing in shell as
rapidly as the guns could be loaded and discharged, until the entire
hillside seemed to be cleared for the time of both artillery and
infantry. Suddenly we heard the regular huzzas of Federal infantry
very close to us, apparently at the foot of the hill on which we
stood, but concealed by the scrub forest. No pickets had been
thrown out in our front so far as we knew; there was no infantry
support with us; Minie balls began to drop in very briskly; the
hillside we had cleared filled up again, and it was deemed prudent to
retire.</p>
          <p>Strange it is, but I have not the slightest recollection as to what
artillery officer was in charge of us, but I do remember that in retiring
to our former position we passed very close to Gen. Lafayette
McLaws, commanding the division to which generally, as on this
occasion, we were attached. I was more deeply stirred than I had
ever before been, and have some indistinct recollection of urging
one or two of our artillery officers that the eight guns we had with
us should be advanced to the position our two guns had just left,
accompanied by infantry support.</p>
          <p>The suggestion was not approved by them, and I went to General
McLaws with it. He received me without the slightest reproof for my
impertinence, but said we had done our work with two rifles, and
that from what he knew of the ground the distance must be too
great for smooth-bore guns. I assured him that he was misinformed,
and that I
<pb id="stiles174" n="174"/>
knew what I was talking about, as I had helped to estimate the
distance and cut the fuses. I do not now exactly recall what the
distance was, but I am positive now, as I was then, that it was within
range of our shortest-ranged guns, and I insisted that with our eight
guns in action on that hill (the other eight had been left at
Fredericksburg with Early) we could fairly blow up Chancellorsville.
While I was saying this Major Goggin, adjutant-general of the
division, and a fine soldier, rode up and confirmed all I had said. I
have an indistinct recollection that we boosted the general, who was
short and stout, to the top of an old tobacco barn, but his view was
very little extended even from that vantage ground. Nevertheless, he
came to our opinion and sent the order for all our eight guns to
advance to the position indicated, supported by Semmes' brigade.</p>
          <p>I was almost delirious with joy, and ran back to the guns,
anticipating a scene of destruction and of triumph such as no one of
us had ever before witnessed. But just as the two batteries were
drawn out in column on the road we learned that our troops had
carried the enemy's works, that he had abandoned the position we
were to have shelled, and our opportunity was gone. Semmes,
however, went right on, and by a skilful movement and a short,
sharp fight, cut off and captured a Federal force which seemed to
have been sent forward with the view of capturing our two rifled
guns. A little later he marched his prisoners into the clearing we had
occupied, and it turned out that he had an entire regiment, I think of
“hundred-day men,” from New Haven, Conn.</p>
          <p>General Lee, convinced that there was, for the present at least, no
more dangerous fight in Hooker, had ridden through to General
McLaws' position to talk with him about turning back to help Early
take care of Sedgwick. He and McLaws were conferring, I think, at
the moment on horseback. My enthusiasm had spent itself, or rather
had oozed out with our disappointment, and I was walking down the
front of the captured regiment, kept, however, at proper distance by
the guard which had been placed over them. I had heard where the
prisoners hailed from and was carefully scanning their faces,
recognizing many of them. At last a
<pb id="stiles175" n="175"/>
little fellow who had been in my Sunday-school class in New Haven
recognized me. How he happened to do this is a mystery, as there
was not a trace of my former self visible, except my height and my
muscular figure. I had lost my hat, my hair was close-shingled, skin
tanned red brown; I had on only flannel shirt, pants, belt and shoes;
shirt front wide open, sleeves rolled up, clothes and skin spattered
black with powder water from the sponge—indeed I was, all in all,
about as desperate-looking a ruffian as could well be found or
imagined. But when this little chap, through all this disguise and
transformation, recognized me and called out my name, there was a
simultaneous shout of “Bob Stiles” from many throats. General Lee
called me to him and asked whether I really knew “those people,”—the
peculiar phrase which he employed habitually in speaking of the
Northern people or the Federal soldiery,—and upon my telling him
that I did, he ordered the guard to pass me in the lines, telling me to
find out what I could and let him know. He also offered to do
anything in his power for any prisoner whose circumstances I might
think required his intervention, and in this way I arranged a special
exchange for a young man named Sheldon, whom I had known at
Yale or at a preparatory school in New Haven. I also gathered
considerable information, which I gave to the commanding general.</p>
          <p>A short time after this, I cannot say exactly how long, but that
same evening and before we started back after Sedgwick, General
McLaws called me to him and said I ought not to be in the ranks;
that I was right about that movement of all our guns to that
advanced position, and this showed I had a gift for handling
artillery; that he would send for a commission as captain and have
me assigned to the command of a certain Georgia battery which he
mentioned; that it was true this battery had a way of
getting its captains killed and wounded, but that bad luck like that
didn't last forever, and that it was time the luck was turning with this
battery. I thanked him heartily, but told him that I had not
discovered the commanding position he referred to and didn't know
who was entitled to the credit
<pb id="stiles176" n="176"/>
of pointing it out; that I had simply reported what we had seen and
done—other men no less than I; that as to the battery he had
mentioned, while I thought I could sincerely say that the fate of its
former captains would not deter me, yet I presumed there were
officers in this battery who deserved and would expect promotion,
and if so I would not be willing to cut them out of their proper dues;
and besides, I much questioned whether I was really competent to
be put at once in command of a battery in the field. He seemed to be
a little disappointed at what he evidently thought my lack of proper
ambition, but said he would talk with me further about it, and I left
him, making a great effort not to show how profoundly moved I was.
Here, for the third time within a week, was promotion offered and a
door opened before me; for while I had returned the commission in
the engineer troops, yet I could not be sure it was not intended for
me, especially as it began to appear as if there was a general
consensus that I should be promoted.</p>
          <p>Shortly after I left General McLaws, he and General Lee resumed
their conference, and, just as they did so, there occurred an incident
which beautifully revealed the equipoise of General Lee's character
and the charm of his manner.</p>
          <p>If any of the minor characters mentioned in these  reminiscences
has a distinct personality every way worthy of approval and of
remembrance, it is “Brother William,” the consecrated, courageous
chaplain of the Seventeenth Mississippi, or rather of Barksdale's
brigade—the real hero of the great revival at Fredericksburg. He, of
course, had remained behind there, with his brigade, under the
general command of Early, to watch Sedgwick.</p>
          <p>I was standing in the shade of a tree, near our guns, which had
been ordered to draw out on the road, head of column to the rear,
that is, toward Fredericksburg,—an order and movement which we
all well understood,—when my attention was called to a horseman
coming at full speed from the direction in which we were heading,
and as he drew near I saw it was “Brother William,” and that he was
greatly excited. My recollection is that he did not have a saddle, but
was riding upon a blanket or cloth of some
<pb id="stiles177" n="177"/>
kind, and that his horse was reeking with sweat and panting from
exertion. When his eye fell upon General Lee he made directly for
him, and I followed as fast as I could. He dashed to the very feet of
the commanding general, indeed, almost upon him, and gasping for
breath, his eyes starting from their sockets, began to tell of dire
disaster at Fredericksburg—Sedgwick had smashed Early and was
rapidly coming on in our rear.</p>
          <p>I have never seen anything more majestically calm than
General Lee was; I felt painfully the contrast between him and dear
little Brother William. Something very like a grave, sweet smile
began to express itself on the General's face, but he checked it, and
raising his left hand gently, as if to protect himself, he interrupted
the excited speaker, checking and controlling him instantly, at the
same time saying very quietly:</p>
          <p>“I thank you very much, but both you and your horse are
fatigued and overheated. Take him to that shady tree yonder and
you and he blow and rest a little. I'm talking to General McLaws just
now. I'll call you as soon as we are through.”</p>
          <p>I said Brother William was at once dominated and controlled, and
he was—but not quite satisfied. He began a
mild protest: “But, General!” but he did not persist in it—he simply
could not. He had already dismounted, and he started back with me
to the tree, leading his horse.</p>
          <p>Unfortunately, I had none of General Lee's power over him, and
he began to pour out to me his recital of disaster and prediction of
ruin. All was lost below, Sedgwick had
stormed the heights and seized the town, the brigade had been cut
off, and, he feared, captured; Early had been beaten and pushed
roughly aside, and at least 30,000 victorious
troops were rapidly pressing on in our rear. Substantially, he alone
was left to tell the tale, and had fortunately been able to secure this
horse on which to come to tell it. If not already too late, it very soon
would be, to do anything even to moderate the calamity.</p>
          <p>In vain I suggested that General Lee could not be ignorant of all
this; that his scouts had, doubtless, given him information;
<pb id="stiles178" n="178"/>
that General Early certainly would have found means to
communicate with him; that Lee had beaten Hooker and his calm and
self-reliant bearing clearly indicated that he felt himself to be master
of the entire situation. But Brother William would not be comforted
or reassured. General Lee had not been upon the spot and could not
know; he had been and did know. The very calmness of the General
showed he did not appreciate the gravity of the situation. While we
were thus debating the matter, General Lee finished with McLaws,
who at once started his division on the back track to reinforce Early
and help him take care of Sedgwick—and, true to his promise,
Marse Robert now called for Brother William, and, as he approached,
greeted him with a smile, saying:</p>
          <p>“Now what were you telling us about Major Sedgwick?”</p>
          <p>Brother William again told his tale of woe—this time with
somewhat diminished intensity and less lurid coloring. When he had
finished the General thanked him, saying again:</p>
          <p>“I am very much obliged to you; the Major is a nice gentleman; I
don't think he would hurt us very badly, but, we are going to see
about him at once. I have just sent General McLaws to make a
special call upon him.”</p>
          <p>I did not, at the time, quite appreciate the marked peculiarity of
General Lee's allusion to Sedgwick, but, as I now understand, the
latter had been a major in the old service, of the regiment of which
Lee was colonel, and they had been somewhat intimate friends.</p>
          <p>There is a decided difference of opinion, and that among both
Federal and Confederate authorities, as to whether or not Sedgwick
heartily and vigorously supported and cooperated with Hooker's
plans in this campaign. Both Hooker and Warren reflect seriously
upon him for failure to do so, and Early and Fitzhugh Lee, on the
Confederate side, take a like view. The two latter estimate Sedgwick's
force at thirty thousand troops, while Early had only some ten
thousand to oppose him. Fitz says in substance that
Sedgwick's attacks were desultory, nerveless, and easily repulsed,
even by our very inferior force, until the extreme weakness of our
lines was discovered under flag of truce
<pb id="stiles179" n="179"/>
granted him to take care of his wounded. Then he attacked with
more determination and captured Marye's Heights and several
pieces of artillery, but even then did not push his advantage with
vigor. Barksdale seems to have been for the time separated from
Early, and it was at this juncture that Mr. Owen procured the horse
and galloped to Chancellorsville with his blood-curdling tale of
disaster. A staff officer of General Early had, however, preceded
him, as we afterwards learned.</p>
          <p>It was currently reported at the time that the whole of the
Mississippi brigade would have been captured, as part of it was,
had not the giant musketeer of the Twenty-first Regiment clubbed
his gun and rushed bare-headed down the hill upon the Federal
troops who were climbing it. At this fearful apparition they broke
and ran, and in the gap and confusion thus occasioned a large part
of the brigade made its escape.</p>
          <p>After McLaws joined forces with Early, Sedgwick, though still
outnumbering his foes, became the hunted rather than the hunter,
and seems to have counted himself happy, under cover of the
friendly darkness, to make his escape across the river.</p>
          <p>It is fair to say that some military critics take a different view of
Sedgwick's operations, and it may well be, after all, that Hooker's
lieutenant has suffered in general estimation mainly by reason of his
being brought into comparison with Lee's matchless second and his
absolutely perfect appreciation, support, and execution of the plans
of his great chief in this the most brilliant of his battles.</p>
          <p>Hooker's own part in these operations would seem to have been
more creditable, but his great weakness was a tendency to boasting.
There was a striking contrast between the records he made for
himself in his order book and in the field. When, on the 26th of
January, 1863, he took command of the Army of the Potomac, his
first act was to christen it in the memorable, high-sounding phrase— 
“The Finest Army on the Planet.” On the same day, in General Order
No. 1, he emphasized the inferiority of its enemy, and
<pb id="stiles180" n="180"/>
added: “Let us never hesitate to give him battle whenever we can
find him.” After just three months of waiting he did find him, right
across the river where he had all the time been, and moved upon him.
Then, after three days of really skilful maneuvering, on the 30th of
April, as he took up his position at Chancellorsville, he issued his
General Order No. 47, congratulating his army that now “Our enemy
must ingloriously fly, or come out from behind his defenses and give
us battle on our own ground, where certain destruction awaits him.”
The rash enemy chose the latter alternative, but objected strongly to
the predicted result of “certain destruction.” And lastly, on the 6th
day of May, after he had abandoned his famous and almost
impregnable position, and retired across the river in the dark, as
Sedgwick had already done, he published his General Order No. 49,
of which he asked, but apparently never got, President Lincoln's
opinion—in which “The Major-General Commanding tenders to the
army his congratulations on its achievements of the last seven days
* * *,” and adds: “The events of the last week may swell with pride
the heart of every officer and soldier in this army.”</p>
          <p>All these, however, are but the blasts of the war trumpet, and are
calculated to blind us to the admirable character of Hooker's general
plan and his creditable maneuvers in the attempted execution of it. In
parting with him I cannot refrain from saying that no soldier of the
Army of Northern Virginia can fail to kindle toward him, at least a
little, upon reading his testimony before the Committee on the
Conduct of the War, in which he gives the following curious and
tortuous, yet, upon the whole, manly explanation of the defeat and
failure of “The Finest Army on the Planet:”</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>Our artillery had always been superior to that of the rebels, as was also our
infantry, except in discipline; and that, for reasons not necessary to mention,
never did equal Lee's army. With a rank and file vastly inferior to our own,
intellectually and physically, that army has, by discipline alone, acquired a
character for steadiness and efficiency unsurpassed, in my judgment, in ancient
or modern times. We have not been able to rival it, nor has there been any near
approximation to it in the other rebel armies.</p>
          </q>
          <pb id="stiles181" n="181"/>
          <p>It is strange that I cannot recall when I first heard of Jackson's
being wounded, nor even of the overwhelming calamity of his
death. There is an impression on my mind that I saw his body lying
in state in the Capitol at Richmond; but upon reflection I am inclined
to think this an error and that I am confounding impressions derived
from reading the detailed accounts in the daily press with the actual
sight of the eye. The only reliable data I have, bearing upon the time
of this visit to Richmond, is Beers' burial there, at which I certainly
was present. He fell on the 3rd of May and was buried on the field. It
was warm weather and his re-interment at Richmond could not have
been many days later. Jackson did not die until the 10th of May, and
I could not have witnessed the funeral obsequies in Richmond
unless I remained there longer than I now think I did.</p>
          <p>Under these circumstances, there being nothing of value I can
add in the way of personal reminiscence, nothing would be gained
by my repeating the familiar story of that week of fearful suspense
or the heroic recital of the last interchange of confidence,
admiration, and affection between the great leader and his peerless
lieutenant. Suffice it to say, there are few passages in human story
as lofty, as tender, or in every way as creditable to human nature.
The following is the order which General Lee issued to his army
announcing the death of Jackson:</p>

                  <p>With deep regret the commanding general announces the death of

an All-wise Providence, are now lost to us. But while we mourn his death, we
feel that his spirit still lives, and will inspire the whole army with his
indomitable courage and unshaken confidence in God as our hope and strength.
Let his name be a watch-word to his corps who have followed him to victory
on so many fields. Let his officers and soldiers emulate his invincible

          <p>Meanwhile the commission in engineer troops had been returned
to me, accompanied by directions to report at Richmond for orders.
This seemed to settle the question. Evidently I could not wait for the
chance of the reopening of the appointment on Jackson's staff, or
for the captaincy in artillery of which General McLaws had spoken,
either of which I should have greatly preferred to the engineer
appointment. I had informed the Bureau when I returned the
commission that I was not an engineer and, with this knowledge, the
appointment had been confirmed. Besides, either before or when I
reported in Richmond, I found that I owed my appointment to a lady;
that Mrs. Gilmer, the wife of General Gilmer, the head of the Engineer
Bureau of our service, had told her husband that she wished to
nominate one officer when he made his appointments in engineer
troops, and had nominated me, without any previous personal
acquaintance, basing her action upon what she had heard of me
from others and particularly from my father, and out of regard for
him.</p>
          <p>Under these circumstances, to decline the appointment was out
of the question. So I tore myself away from my dear comrades, my
own brother among them, and reported at Richmond for my orders,
as directed.</p>

Army Organized into Three Corps—He Turns Northward and

Incidents of the Battle.</p>
          <p>It is singular that I cannot recall with distinctness anything that
occurred during this visit to Richmond, save the burial of poor
Beers; and as to that I remember only what I have related. I do not
recall much enthusiasm or elation of spirit about my promotion;
indeed I felt little, for it severed the strong ties that bound me to my
old comrades; it removed me from a branch of the service which I
loved and in which I felt competent to do efficient work, and
transferred me to another for which I possessed neither taste nor
training.</p>
          <p>My orders were to report to Major-General Early, in the field, and
in connection with the other officers of my company to organize a
company of engineer troops from men to be furnished us from his
division. I do not remember where General Early was, but somewhere
in the northern or central portion of the State, and I reported
promptly at his headquarters, meeting there for the first time Captain
Williamson, the commanding officer of our prospective company,
who proved to be a gentleman of character, a competent engineer
and thorough soldier, though, unfortunately, somewhat deaf. I do
not think he heard all that was said by the General during our
conference, or that he observed him quite as closely as I did.</p>
          <p>After the conference was over I saw Captain Williamson privately
and asked him how much aid and co-operation he
<pb id="stiles184" n="184"/>
expected from the General in getting up his company. He said he
hardly knew, and asked my views, which were quite decided and
decidedly expressed—to the effect that General Early had no idea of
losing a musket from his division if he could avoid it; that he would
aid us just so far as he was compelled to do so and no further; that
our orders were somewhat defective, or at least not framed to meet
such a case; that I did not mean to imply that the General was not
right in the position he had taken, but that right or wrong he had
clearly taken it; and as he was evidently a man of uncommon
intelligence and determination, I felt satisfied he would carry his
point.</p>
          <p>In the course of two or three days the situation became clearly
defined, the General taking little or no pains to conceal it, and I had
another talk with Captain Williamson, who felt that nothing more
could be done just now in the way of organizing the company,
adding that General Early had asked him, for the present, to act as
engineer officer on his staff. He had made no such suggestion or
request in my case, and Captain Williamson seemed to feel badly on
my account; but I begged him to think no more about it, assuring him
that I had sense enough to see that any such action in my case was
out of the question, as I was not an engineer. I omitted to say that my
orders entitled me to a horse to be furnished and fed, as I remember,
by the quartermaster of the division, and the General was very kind
and prompt in seeing that these requirements were complied with;
but I saw clearly that I was neither needed nor desired on the
division staff and that, if I remained, the best I could expect would be
the position and duty of a sort of upper courier, which I was not
willing to assume.</p>
          <p>I therefore went directly to General Early and had a full talk with
him. I did most of the talking, but he heartily acquiesced, and when I
was through I felt sure we thoroughly understood each other, and I
thought he liked me. I told him I saw clearly that, for the present, no
company of engineer troops was to be organized from his division;
that indeed I rather thought the division pioneer corps, under
command of Lieutenant, or Sergeant, Flood, was all
<pb id="stiles185" n="185"/>
the engineer company he cared to have. Flood was a New Orleans
stevedore, a rough but very efficient man, who, among his many
admirable qualifications, possessed this highly acceptable one, that
he had no sort of objection to Old Jube's airing his choice
vocabulary of profane rhetoric about him, or his work, or his men
whenever he might happen to need relief in that direction.</p>
          <p>I said further to the General that I thought the pioneer corps might
perhaps be regarded as the nucleus of the future company of
engineer troops, and while I had no idea of meddling with Flood's
work, which he was vastly better qualified to manage than I was, yet
I could help him about his requisitions, reports, etc.; but that as we
were evidently going into an active and aggressive campaign I
thought I would, in action, fight in some battery of Col. Hilary Jones'
Battalion, if he thought he could make use of me—standing ready,
however, at all times, to report back to Division Headquarters for
staff duty or for anything I could at any time do for the General.</p>
          <p>This arrangement seemed to be entirely satisfactory to General
Early, as it was also to Colonel Jones, in one or other of whose
batteries—usually with the Charlottesville Artillery, a corps that
reminded me somewhat of our old battery—I fought, whenever they
were engaged, throughout the campaign, notably at Winchester and
Gettysburg; sometimes in charge of one or more pieces, and again
fighting as a private soldier at a gun, or in any position where they
were weakest and most needed help. I said the arrangement seemed
to be entirely satisfactory to General Early, and yet in connection
with it there occurred a series of awkward and amusing incidents
which admirably illustrate some of the General's strongly-marked
traits.</p>
          <p>Soon after Gettysburg my brother and I passed and missed each
other, I riding over to the First Corps to learn what
had befallen my friends of the old battery, while he came over to
Early's division of the Second to inquire for me. His description of
the old General was so characteristic and vivid that to this day I am
prone to imagine that I saw and heard instead of my brother. He said
the sun was shining
<pb id="stiles186" n="186"/>
after the rain, and at Early's headquarters he saw a man rather above
middle age, heavily built, with stooping shoulders, a splendid head
and a full gray-brown beard, sitting in his shirt sleeves on a camp
stool, with one leg thrown over the other, his hands and apparently
his every thought employed in combing out and smoothing a
somewhat bedraggled black ostrich feather. My brother had no idea
who this figure was, but he passed beyond him to inquire of some
less absorbed person as to my welfare and whereabouts. The person
addressed, probably some courier, did not happen to know anything
of me, and the feather dresser piped in a whining, querulous voice:</p>
          <p>“Who are you looking for—Stiles? I can't tell you where he is, but I
can tell you where he ain't. He ain't with the division pioneer corps,
where he belongs; I reckon your best chance to find him would be
lying around with some battery.”</p>
          <p>When my brother told me this, as he did when we next met, I was
at once irritated and amused. It was after I had, with General Early's
approval, gone back to the old battalion to serve as its adjutant,
under Colonel Cabell. I did not happen to meet the General for some
time, and meanwhile fortune had smiled upon me in many ways. I
was located to my entire satisfaction, had a fine horse, was better
dressed and equipped every way, and was feeling generally
satisfied, independent, and happy. We had gotten back to the
sacred soil of Old Virginia, and, under Clark's Mountain, riding
alone, I overtook and passed the General accompanied by only a
single courier. My horse had the better action and movement, and I
merely saluted as I rode rapidly by. I had gotten perhaps a hundred
yards or more ahead, when the General called after me:</p>
          <p>“Hold on, Stiles;” and as he drew near, “you're a little offish this
morning.”</p>
          <p>“No, General, I think not.”</p>
          <p>“Well, what the devil's the matter?”</p>
          <p>“Nothing in the world, sir, except that I didn't suppose you'd care
for the company of a man of whom the best you could say was that
you felt sure he wasn't where he ought to be.”</p>
          <pb id="stiles187" n="187"/>
          <p>Old Jube cocked his head and cut his eyes around at me with an
expression of the intensest enjoyment, and in that illimitable voice
drawled out:</p>
          <p>“Stiles, you are an infernal fool. Why, man, I meant what I said of
you as a compliment. The main use I had for a pioneer corps was to
bury dead Yankees and horses, and you never seemed to fancy that
kind of business. You preferred to take a hand at the guns and
prepare 'em to be buried, and I thought a damned sight more of you
for it.”</p>
          <p>It is useless to say that this sledge-hammer stroke broke the ice;
indeed the ice disappeared and I was thawed out completely. From
that day the grand old fellow was one of the best friends I had in the
army, and our friendship continued to the day of his death. I don't
know that I was ever more touched than when—long years
afterwards, at one of the meetings of the “Virginia Division of the
Army of Northern Virginia,” in introducing me as one of the
speakers—he told this story, making use of the identical phraseology
above recorded, as nearly as I can recall it.</p>
          <p>It may be well to say that a full regiment of engineer troops was
ultimately organized, though the men were not drawn from the
troops in the field, as at first provided—General Lee agreeing with his
division generals that this should not be done. The corps rendered
very efficient service. It was under the command of Col. T. M. R.
Talcott, a member of General Lee's staff, and a thoroughly educated,
experienced, and able engineer, in whom the General felt as much
confidence as in any officer of his rank in the army. Strange to say, I
never served a day with the regiment, though holding a commission
in it, and I had the honor of being, for a year or more, a bone of
contention between the engineer troops and the artillery. Colonel
Talcott would every now and then report my absence from duty and
ask that I be ordered back to my post with his regiment, and this
application being referred to Colonel Cabell, he would answer that it
would be highly detrimental to the service to remove me, just at this
time, from my position as acting adjutant of his battalion. As these
papers had to pass through army headquarters, and in some
instances even to
<pb id="stiles188" n="188"/>
and from the Adjutant-General's Office in Richmond, months would
sometimes elapse before the grand rounds were completed. One
feature of the case very aggravating to the officers of the engineer
troops was that on one occasion, I presume through inadvertence, I
was actually advanced one grade in engineer troops for meritorious
service in artillery. At last, however, I was again promoted, this time
in artillery, which terminated the irritating, yet amusing, paper war.</p>
          <p>Some time after the close of the struggle, at a social gathering in
Richmond, I observed a gentleman staring and pointing at me in a
very peculiar manner, who, on being introduced, grasped my hand
and burst into an uncontrollable fit of laughter. Upon recovering his
composure he said that if our meeting had occurred a few years
earlier his feeling, and possibly his action, might have been different;
that he was one of the officers of the engineer regiment over whose
heads I had unceremoniously and irregularly vaulted, they having
served faithfully with the regiment and I having never even reported
to it. He further said that my name had been repeatedly read out at
dress parade of the regiment as “absent from duty,” when the
officers would speculate as to how soon I would be lassooed and
dragged in; but as the capture was constantly delayed and I
ultimately made good my escape, my fellow-officers in engineer
troops had changed their minds about me and concluded I was a
strategist of a high order and deserving of high position and
command. I may add that my personal relations with Colonel Talcott
since the war have been of a close and intimate character, and that
he is to-day one of my best friends.</p>
          <p>After the death of Jackson, Early was undoubtedly one of the
strongest and ablest of Lee's lieutenants. He was not perhaps the
brilliant and dashing soldier that A. P. Hill was, nor a superb,
magnetic leader like Gordon, and possibly he could not deliver quite
as majestic a blow in actual battle as Longstreet; but his loyal
devotion, his hardy courage, his native intellect, his mental
training, his sagacity, his resource, his self-reliant, self-directing
strength, were all very
<pb id="stiles189" n="189"/>
great, and the commanding general reposed the utmost confidence
in him. This he indicated by selecting him so frequently for
independent command, and to fill the most critical, difficult, and I
had almost said hopeless, positions, in the execution of his own
great plans; as for example, when he left him at Fredericksburg with
nine thousand men to neutralize Sedgwick with thirty thousand.
Later, he sent him to the Valley, with a very inadequate force, to
occupy and embarrass the enemy and to prevent overwhelming
concentration against the Confederate capital, where his operations
indicated the highest ability.</p>
          <p>Early was in some respects a bundle of inconsistencies and
contradictions; of religion and irreligion, of reverence and profanity.
I have heard my father speak of the General's deep interest in
religious work among the men of his division, and his readiness to
do everything in his power to facilitate it. I do not think I ever knew
one human soul to look up to another with a feeling nearer akin to
worship than that with which Early regarded Lee and Jackson, not
alone as great soldiers, but as great Christians also; and yet he was the
only man who was ever known to swear in General Lee's presence.
The General used to reprove him gently, yet at the same time to
express his special affection for him, by calling him “My bad old
man.”</p>
          <p>Old Jube struck the popular fancy in two respects only—his
passing at a single bound from intense Unionism to intense
Southernism, upon the issue of President Lincoln's proclamation
calling for troops, and his caustic, biting tongue. He was a sort of
privileged character in the army and was saucy to everybody, but
many of his brightest utterances will not bear publication because of
the sting in them. One of this general character, which, however, had
no real bitterness in it, is too good not to be told.</p>
          <p>The Hon. Jere Morton was in the Secession Convention with
Early, as extreme a Secessionist as Early was Unionist, and very
fond of talking about “our rights in the territories.” Morton was not
in the army, and was probably above fighting age. His handsome
estate, “Morton Hall,” was upon the outskirts of the great
battle-fields of Central Virginia,
<pb id="stiles190" n="190"/>
and on one occasion Mr. Morton narrowly escaped capture
there, and was obliged to mount a horse and fly. It so
happened that Early commanded the vanguard of the
Confederate forces advancing to meet the enemy. Riding at the
head of his column, and seeing Morton coming in hot haste,
digging his spurs into his horse's flanks, Early playfully threw a line
of troops across the road to intercept his progress, at the same time
calling out to him, “Hold on Morton! Are you going for our rights in
the Territories?”</p>
          <p>One evening, during General Jackson's life-time, after a hard day's
march, General Early received, soon after coming to camp,
substantially the following note:</p>

          <p>There was not another officer in the Army of Northern Virginia
who would have dared to send such an impertinent note to Jackson,
nor another, save Stuart, whose impertinence in sending it would
have been met with a laugh.</p>
          <p>After the war, its memories were Early's religion; his mission, to
vindicate the truth of history with regard to it. So long as the old
hero was alive in his hill city of Virginia, no man ever took up his
pen to write a line about the great conflict without the fear of Jubal
Early before his eyes.</p>
          <pb id="stiles191" n="191"/>
          <p>I am not now proposing to discuss the causes or the objects of
the war, nor who was responsible for it, but rather, its general
strategic character; therefore when, in this connection, I say that
upon the side of the Confederates it was a war of defense I am
enunciating a military and not a moral proposition. I mean simply
that the Confederacy had not the requisite resources, that its leaders
had no purpose or expectation of carrying on a war of aggression or
conquest, and that our invasions of Northern soil were intended
merely as subsidiary parts of our general scheme of defense; that is,
as diversions, as derangements of the general scheme of Federal
invasion.</p>
          <p>General Lee was a soldier who thoroughly appreciated the value
of an offensive defensive. He never allowed his adversary quietly to
mature and uninterruptedly to adhere to and carry out his own plan
of campaign. Although conducting a defensive struggle, he was yet
generally the attacking party. It was so in the Seven Days' battles
with McClellan, so in the Manassas campaign with Pope and the
Maryland campaign that followed. It was so at Chancellorsville. And
even in 1864, after the resources and fighting strength of the
Confederacy had been so fearfully reduced, when Grant entered the
Wilderness, Lee immediately pressed in after him and closed with
him in a death grapple in the very heart of the jungle.</p>
          <p>But perhaps the most perfect instance and illustration of
this characteristic feature of Lee's strategy and tactics, and
of the real significance of his two invasions of Northern
territory, is what occurred after Chancellorsville. When
Hooker retired across the Rappahannock and reoccupied his
former position it would manifestly have been little short of
madness for Lee to attack him there, especially deprived as
he was of Jackson, his offensive right arm; yet he did not
sit down, as a less courageous and resourceful leader would
have done, gloating over his victory, conceding the initiative
to Hooker, and awaiting developments. On the contrary,
he proceeded to maneuver his adversary out of a position
from which he could not drive him, and to force him to
<pb id="stiles192" n="192"/>
abandon all idea of further aggressive campaign in Virginia for that
year.</p>
          <p>Early in June, with his army reorganized into three corps, the
First under Longstreet, embracing the divisions of McLaws, Pickett,
and Hood; the Second under Ewell, embracing Early, Rodes, and
Johnson; and the Third under A. P. Hill, Anderson, Heth, and
Pender,—all the corps commanders being lieutenant-generals,— 
Lee drew away from the line of the Rappahannock, leaving Hill,
however, for a short time, to watch Hooker, proceeded northward, by
way of Culpeper and the Valley of Virginia,—the Second Corps in
advance,—crossed the Shenandoah near Front Royal about June
12th, and, near Winchester, routed and captured a large part of the
force which, under Milroy, was holding the Lower Valley. Hill
followed Ewell, Longstreet's corps hovering yet a while east of the
mountains, to cover their operations.</p>
          <p>It was about this time that President Lincoln and General Hooker
had their famous serpentine telegraphic correspondence:</p>
          <p>“Where is the Rebel army?”</p>
          <p>“The advance is at the fords of the Potomac and the rear at
Culpeper Court House.”</p>
          <p>“If the head of the animal is at the fords of the Potomac and the
tail at Culpeper Court House, it must be very thin somewhere. Why
don't you strike it?”</p>
          <p>This battle of Winchester—there were many conflicts in and
around that devoted old town—was one of the most perfect pieces of
work the Army of Northern Virginia ever did. Possibly the plan
seemed so admirably clear and definite and to move with the
precision and decision of a problem in mathematics, because, for the
first time, as a mounted officer and in an unusually free and
independent position, I personally watched every movement. I may
add that the execution of the plan was committed largely to Old Jube,
who certainly wrought it out and fought it out beautifully.</p>
          <p>The town of Winchester and the surrounding country were
dominated by a strong closed earthwork, heavily armed and
manned, which it would have been madness to assault,
<pb id="stiles193" n="193"/>
yet folly to neglect; and this work, on the only side which seemed to
offer anything like a practicable approach, was protected and itself
dominated by an outwork which it was absolutely necessary to
carry before the inner and more powerful work could be reduced.
Our scouts and engineers had done their work thoroughly and our
column was conducted by a long detour, in every foot of which we
were concealed from observation from either work by forests and
the configuration of the ground; until at last we found ourselves in a
position which had been attained with difficulty, but which perfectly
commanded the outwork. The infantry now lay down to rest and
recover breath, while the men of Hilary Jones' battalion of artillery
shoved their guns forward by hand up to and just back of a rock
fence which ran along the crest of a ridge, under cover of which we
had approached, and then loaded them. They next removed a few of
the stones in front of the muzzle of each gun, taking great care to
remain concealed while doing this; and when everything was ready
and every one warned to do his part on the instant, the guns were
discharged simultaneously upon the outwork and a rapid fire kept
up upon it, while the infantry rose, and, with the wild rebel yell
bursting from their lips, rushed forward in the charge. The surprise
was complete, the distance not great, and the effect overwhelming.
The outwork was abandoned almost without a struggle, its
defenders retiring to the main fortification, and our infantry again
lying down for rest and protection and to wait for us, while our guns
galloped forward to the captured work, some occupying and firing
from it, and others passing to the right and front to a level field hard
by, from which we had the main work beautifully in range.</p>
          <p>But this work had us in range not less beautifully, indeed even
more perfectly, and played havoc with us for a short time. My
recollection is that I was acting as No. 6 at one of the limbers, and
that I several times instinctively clapped down the lid of the
ammunition chest as the shell seemed to burst immediately over it.
We were at a loss to account for the preternaturally accurate aim of
the guns and cutting of the fuses, until some one chanced to
observe the practice
<pb id="stiles194" n="194"/>
target of the fort standing between the gun at which I was serving
and the one next to it, when, of course, we shifted our position in a
twinkling, dashing up still closer to the fort and finding, to our relief,
that here the shells passed for the most part over our heads.</p>
          <p>On one of the two occasions in which our guns passed to the
right and front of the recumbent infantry I observed our old friend
Extra Billy Smith, on the front line of his brigade, standing erect, with
his arms folded, his horse's bridle rein over one shoulder and his
blue cotton umbrella under the other, he and his horse the only two
figures I saw standing in all the long line. The heroic old man was as
cool as a cucumber and as smiling as a basket of chips, and he was
actually bowing to the artillerymen—as with hair flying and eyes
flashing they passed on a run—with that same manly, hearty greeting
which had, for more than a generation, proved irresistible on the
hustings in the Old Dominion. It was an unparalleled scene— 
unparalleled as an exhibition of courage, of personal force, and of
the force of habit. I noted the expression on the face of each
artilleryman as he recognized and responded to the old Governor's
salute, and felt—there's one vote sure for Extra Billy as long as that
gallant cannoneer lives. The old hero was at this time Governor-elect
of the Commonwealth of Virginia.</p>
          <p>I cannot determine exactly when, but I received a very singular,
and what threatened to be a very serious, injury during one of the
moves our guns made after becoming engaged—I rather incline to
think it must have been the first time we shifted position. At all
events, I had, for some reason, given up my horse to some one and
was fighting on foot in some position with one of the guns of the
Charlottesville battery, when the orders were given, “Cease firing,
limber to the front, cannoneers mount!” I sprang upon a limber chest
upon which there was already the full complement of three men, all
faced, of course, to the front. I faced to the rear, and bracing my
back against the back of the middle man, attempted to hold my
position with my feet resting on the “lunette plate”—a flat piece of
iron fitted over the end of the trail of the gun, ending in a heavy
ring, which,
<pb id="stiles195" n="195"/>
when slipped over the “pintle hook” on the front axle, coupled the
gun to the limber. We started at a run and were galloping under fire
through a grove, by a wood road the track of which was full of
limestone rocks projecting more or less above the ground. It was
very difficult to keep my footing, as I had on a pair of stiff and
slick-soled English shoes, the nails in which had worn perfectly smooth.</p>
          <p>Suddenly, at full run, we struck a large rock. The jar was terrific,
and all the men were thrown off, but the others, having firm footing,
described arcs which landed them on the turf at the side of the road.
My feet, however, slipped, and I went down between the front and
rear wheels and directly under the gun. The concussion was so
tremendous that I supposed the limber chest had exploded, and
distinctly remember thinking to myself, “Then this is the way it feels
to be blown up, is it? Well, I'll try anyhow to save my arms and legs
in case I shouldn't be killed,” and with a violent effort I did
manage to get them out of the track of the hind wheels, one of
which, however, ran directly, or rather, diagonally, across the small
of my back on a flat limestone rock.</p>
          <p>My comrades picked themselves up, all right though slightly
shocked. They thought me dead, but dragged me out of the track of
the other guns, and left me lying on the grass under a tree. In a
short time I came to myself, and, on taking a hurried inventory,
found that though very badly jarred and bruised, yet no bones
seemed to be broken, and concluded I would try to hobble on into
the fight, which I did, lying down that night in a pouring rain and
sleeping in a puddle—I presume about as good treatment as could
have been prescribed. Next day I was carried into Winchester, and
after two or three days' rest rode on after the army. The mark of the
gun wheel remained on my back for a year or more, but I never
experienced any serious pain or inconvenience from the injury. I
attribute my escape, in part at least, to my unusually full muscular
development at the time.</p>
          <p>Upon one of our shiftings of position in the battle I was on foot,
abreast of one of the guns of the Charlottesville battery, and
following close after John Hunter, sergeant of
<pb id="stiles196" n="196"/>
that piece, who was riding his little chestnut mare, “Madge,” when a
thirty-pounder Parrott shell passed through her body, just back of
the legs of the rider, exploding as it emerged, and spattering me
profusely with the blood of the poor animal. Little Madge was not
even jarred—any experienced artillerist will understand this. She
“never knew what hit her,” but sank gently down; while Hunter did
not get even so much as a decent “shaking up,” not a very easy
thing to administer to him, I frankly admit. When his feet touched the
ground—they were not far from it even while Madge stood up on all
fours—he simply disengaged them from the stirrups, turned around,
glanced a moment at the bloody horror, and said: “Well, poor little
Madge!”</p>
          <p>True, there was nothing more to be said, but all the same there
was not another man of my acquaintance who would not have said
more.</p>
          <p>The sergeant still lives. His yea is still yea and his nay, nay. He is
a shining example of that admirable class of men and philosophers
who never say anything superfluous or give strained or exaggerated
expression to anything; yet his heart, as every one knows, is not
only in the right place, but the very rightest kind of a heart. He is
one of my best friends and the husband of one of Billy's “seven
women.”</p>
          <p>During our next change of position, or it may have been during
the same move, I witnessed a scene of horror and of agony so
extreme that I would not describe it, were it not that a knowledge of
the widest swings of the pendulum of war, through the entire orbit
of human experiences and emotions, is needed for adequate
appreciation of the life of the soldier.</p>
          <p>The entire battalion, Hilary Jones', was moving in column, the
Charlottesville battery, in which I was serving, following immediately
after Garber's. The farm road we were using led between two heavy
old-fashioned crate posts. My recollection is that they were of stone
and that there was no gate and no fence on either side of the posts,
but the ground outside of and near the posts was somewhat rough
and steep. One of Garber's men, belonging to his rear gun, attempted
to run abreast of the piece between the
<pb id="stiles197" n="197"/>
gate posts, presumably to avoid the rough ground outside. There
was not room enough for him to pass, and the wheel crowding him
against the post, the washer hook caught and tore open his
abdomen, dragging the poor wretch along by his intestines, which
were literally pulled from his body in a long, gory ribbon.</p>
          <p>At one of the last positions we took in the fight—it may have been
the very last—there passed before me one of those scenes which give
a flash-light revelation of the incomparable greatness of war and the
sublime self-abnegation of the true soldier. The fire of the Federal
guns was very deadly and demoralizing, and the captain of the
battery next on our right, I think the Louisiana Guard Artillery, came
up the hill between his battery and ours to steady his men. He was a
fine horseman, finely mounted, and might well have served as a
model for an equestrian statue as he rode out between the smoking
muzzles, and, rising in his stirrups, cheered on his gunners. At that
moment a shell tore away his bridle arm high up near the shoulder.
Instantly he caught the reins with his right hand and swung his
horse's head sharply to the left, thus concealing his wounded side
from his men, saying as he did so, “Keep it up, boys; I'll be back in a
moment!” As he started down the hill I saw him reel in the saddle,
and even before he reached the limbers the noble fellow fell from his
horse—dead.</p>
          <p>We were actively engaged, as I remember, until almost or quite
dark; but as soon as the fire slackened I lay down, very sore from
the severe bruising and crushing I had received, and of course in no
condition for close or accurate observation, so I do not know when
it was discovered that the garrison were abandoning the fort and
preparing to retreat, or what steps were taken to intercept them.
They were intercepted, however; our operations resulting, as
General Lee reported, “in the expulsion of the enemy from the Valley,
the capture of four thousand prisoners, with a corresponding
number of small arms; twenty-eight pieces of superior artillery,
including those taken by General Rodes and General Hayes; about
three hundred wagons and as many horses, together with a quantity
of ordnance, commissary, and quartermaster's stores.”</p>
          <pb id="stiles198" n="198"/>
          <p>The remnant of Milroy's forces took refuge behind the fortifications
of Harper's Ferry; but as the reduction of that place had proved a very
disturbing element in General Lee's plans for the Maryland campaign
of the preceding year, we gave it the go-by this time; Lieutenant-General
Ewell with his three divisions, still in the van, crossing the
Potomac in the latter part of June, rapidly traversing Maryland and
advancing into Pennsylvania.</p>

Brigade Band Playing “Yankee Doodle,” and Makes a Speech on the Public

Burghers of Carlisle.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>I do not remember where I overtook Ewell's corps, but think I
entered Pennsylvania with them. General Lee had issued stringent
orders against plundering and, certainly in the main, the men
carefully observed these orders. I was constantly told by the
inhabitants that they suffered less from our troops than from their
own, and that if compelled to have either, they preferred having “the
rebels” camped upon their lands. I saw no plundering whatever,
except that once or twice I did see branches laden with fruit broken
from cherry trees.</p>
          <p>Of course, it goes without saying, that the quartermasters,
especially of artillery battalions, were, confessedly and of malice
aforethought, horse thieves. It was, perhaps, adding insult to injury
to offer to pay for the horses, as we did, in Confederate money; yet
occasionally the owners took it, as “better than nothing”—how
better it would be difficult to say. I felt sorry for the farmers, some of
whom actually concealed their horses in their dwelling houses, or,
rather, attempted to conceal them, for we became veritable
sleuth-hounds in running down a horse, and were up to all the tricks
and dodges devised to throw us off the track.</p>
          <p>After all, we gained very little by our horse stealing. The
impressed animals were, for the most part, great,
<pb id="stiles200" n="200"/>
clumsy, flabby Percherons or Conestogas, which required
more than twice the feed our compact, hard-muscled little
Virginia horses required, and yet could not do half the
work they did, nor stand half the hardship and exposure. It
was pitiable, later, to, see these great brutes suffer when,
compelled to dash off at full gallop with a gun, after pasturing
on dry broom sedge and eating a quarter of a feed of
weevil-eaten corn. They seemed to pine for the slow draft
and full feed of their Pennsylvania homes.</p>
          <p>To me this campaign of invasion was of somewhat peculiar
interest. Not only did I have a wide general acquaintance with
the North, but two or three of my Yale classmates
were from the very section of country we were traversing,
and I therefore felt somewhat acquainted and connected with
the people and the region. I was struck, too, with the resemblance,
both of the country and its inhabitants, to the
Valley of Virginia. I noted the same two great stocks and
races as making up the population,—the Dutch and the
Scotch-Irish,—and to a great extent they had laid out their
smaller towns and arranged their buildings, orchards, wells,
—everything, in short,—upon their farms, very much after
the familiar Valley pattern.</p>
          <p>One bright day toward the end of June, our column was
passing through the main street of such a town, when, being
very thirsty, I rode up to the front fence of a house which,
with its yard and surroundings, might have been set down in
the main street of any one of a half-dozen Valley of Virginia
towns without being in any respect out of place, and asked
an elderly lady sitting in the porch if I might get a drink of
water from the well. She courteously gave permission and
I entered the yard, got a delicious drink of water, thanked
her, and was in the act of leaving, when the old lady—who
looked like the typical Valley gran'ma—very pleasantly asked
if I wouldn't take a seat and rest a little. I thanked her,
stepped up on the porch and sat down, and we soon got 
into a friendly and pleasant conversation, in the course of
which she asked me of myself, family, and surroundings,
and seemed much interested to know that I had a sister in
New Haven, Conn. She gladly consented to mail a letter for
<pb id="stiles201" n="201"/>
me, and had a table, pen, ink, paper and stamps brought that
I might write it. This letter was faithfully mailed by the
old lady, and was the only communication my sister received
from me for a year or more.</p>
          <p>As I finished writing a young married woman, evidently
the daughter of my kindly hostess, came to the door, saying
that her little son, naming him, was missing. In a few moments
they brought the child, a boy of five or six years, to
the front porch, pale and trembling violently. They had
found him between the mattress and feather bed in an upstairs
room, where he had hidden for fear of the rebels, of
whose ferocious cruelty, blood-curdling tales had been told
him. In a few moments he was in my lap, and we were
the best of friends.</p>
          <p>Just as he was beginning to warm into his nest his
mother announced that she had not seen anything of her
elder son for some time, when, on the instant, a bright boy
of ten or twelve summers burst into the gate, breathless
with excitement, and gasped out, “Mother, mother! may I
go to camp with the rebels? They are the nicest men I ever
saw in my life. They are going to camp right out here in
the woods, and they are going to have a dance, too!”</p>
          <p>Harry Hayes' Louisiana brigade was passing at the moment,
and in the open gate stood the lad's companion, waiting for him
—a bowing, smiling, grimacing, shoulder-shrugging Frenchman,
who promised, in rather broken English,
that he would take the best possible care of him. The
mother hesitated, but a glance at her youngest, whose arm
had now stolen around my neck, decided her, and off went
her eldest with his Creole comrade; and if the brigade did
have the dance, then the lad saw what was really worth seeing,
for if there was anything Hayes' Creoles did and loved
to do better than to fight, it was to dance; and their camp
stag dances, sandwiched in between a big march and a big
battle, were said to be the most “utterly utter” performances
in the way of faun-like pranks, that grown and sane men
ever indulged in.</p>
          <p>Before I left the old lady asked me if I had ever seen
Stonewall Jackson, and upon my responding that I had, she
<pb id="stiles202" n="202"/>
said quietly, but with the deepest feeling, that she expected
to see him soon, for if any one had ever left this earth who
had gone straight to Heaven it was he.</p>
          <p>This was almost too much, and I said to her, “Madam, who on
earth are you and where did you come from?” She said she was born
in the Valley of Virginia and had been brought to this country when
a girl. I could not forbear kissing her hand as I departed, and told her
I felt sure she would get There, and I hoped we would meet in that
blessed country where there would be no more wars nor separations
between God's dear children.</p>
          <p>By this time the reader has doubtless learned that things were not
likely to be dull when our old friend “Extra Billy” was about; that in
fact there was apt to be “music in the air” whenever he was in
charge. On the occasion below described, the old Governor seemed
to be rather specially concerned about the musical part of the
performance.</p>
          <p>We were about entering the beautiful Pennsylvania town of York,
General Smith's brigade in the lead. Under these conditions, feeling
sure there was likely to be a breeze stirring about the head of the
column, I rode forward so as to be near the General and not to miss
the fun. As we approached, the population seemed to be very
generally in the streets, and I saw at a glance that the old Governor
had blood in his eye. Turning to Fred, his aide,—who was also his
son, and about the strongest marked case of second edition I ever
saw,—he told him to “Go back and look up those tooting fellows,”
as he called the brigade band, “and tell them first to be sure their
drums and horns are all right, and then to come up here to the front
and march into town tooting ‘Yankee Doodle’ in their very best
style.”</p>
          <p>Fred was off in a jiffy, and soon here came the band, their
instruments looking bright and smart and glistening, in the June
sunlight—playing, however, not “Yankee Doodle,” but <hi rend="italics">“Dixie,”</hi> the
musicians appearing to think it important to be entirely impartial in
rendering these national airs, and therefore giving us “Dixie” by way
of prelude to “Yankee Doodle.”</p>
          <p>When they got to the head of the column, and struck up “Yankee
Doodle,” and the Governor, riding alone and bare-headed
<pb id="stiles203" n="203"/>
in front of his staff, began bowing and saluting first one side
and then the other, and especially every pretty girl he saw, with that
manly, hearty smile which no man or woman ever doubted or
resisted—the Yorkers seemed at first astounded, then pleased, and
finally, by the time we reached the public square, they had reached
the point of ebullition, and broke into enthusiastic cheers as they
crowded about the head of the column, actually embarrassing its
progress, till the old Governor,—the “Governor-General,” we might
call him,—nothing loth, acceded to the half suggestion and called a
halt, his brigade stacking arms, and constituting, if not formally
organizing, themselves and the people of York into a political
meeting.</p>
          <p>It was a rare scene—the vanguard of an invading army and the
invaded and hostile population hobnobbing on the public green in
an enthusiastic public gathering. The General did not dismount, but
from the saddle he made a rattling, humorous speech, which both
the Pennsylvanians and his own brigade applauded to the echo. He
said substantially:</p>
          <p>“My friends, how do you like this way of coming back into the
Union? I hope you like it; I have been in favor of it for a good while.
But don't misunderstand us. We are not here with any hostile intent— 
unless the conduct of your side shall render hostilities unavoidable.
You can see for yourselves we are not conducting ourselves like
enemies today. We are not burning your houses or butchering your
children. On the contrary, we are behaving ourselves like Christian
gentlemen, as we are.</p>
          <p>“You see, it was getting a little warm down our way. We needed a
summer outing and thought we would take it at the North, instead of
patronizing the Virginia springs, as we generally do. We are sorry,
and apologize that we are not in better guise for a visit of courtesy,
but we regret to say our trunks haven't gotten up yet; we were in
such a hurry to see you that we could not wait for them. You must
really excuse us.</p>
          <p>“What we all need, on both sides, is to mingle more with each
other, so that we shall learn to know and appreciate
<pb id="stiles204" n="204"/>
each other. Now here's my brigade—I wish you knew them as I do.
They are such a hospitable, whole-hearted, fascinating lot of
gentlemen. Why, just think of it—of course this part of Pennsylvania
is ours to-day; we've got it, we hold it, we can destroy it, or do what
we please with it. Yet we sincerely and heartily invite you to stay.
You are quite welcome to remain here and to make yourselves
entirely at home—so long as you behave yourselves pleasantly and
agreeably as you are doing now. Are we not a fine set of fellows?
You must admit that we are.”</p>
          <p>At this point my attention was called to a volley of very heated
profanity poured forth in a piping, querulous treble, coming up from
the rear, and being mounted and located where I commanded a view
of the road, I saw that the second brigade in column, which had been
some distance in the rear, had caught up, and was now held up by
our public meeting, which filled and obstructed the entire street, and
that Old Jube, who had ridden forward to ascertain the cause of the
dead-lock, was fairly blistering the air about him and making furious
but for the time futile efforts to get at Extra Billy, who in plain sight,
and not far off, yet blissfully unconscious of the presence of the
major-general and of his agreeable observations and comments, was
still holding forth with great fluency and acceptability.</p>
          <p>The jam was solid and impervious. As D. H. Hill's report phrased
it, “Not a dog, no, not even a sneaking exempt, could have made his
way through”—and at first and for some time, Old Jube couldn't do
it, and no one would help him. But at last officers and men were
compelled to recognize the division commander, and he made his
way so far that, by leaning forward, a long stretch, and a frantic grab
he managed to catch General Smith by the back of his
coat collar. Even Jube did not dare curse the old General in an
offensive way, but he did jerk him back and around pretty
vigorously and half screamed:</p>
          <p>“General Smith, what the devil are you about! stopping the head
of this column in this cursed town?”</p>
          <pb id="stiles205" n="205"/>
          <p>With unruffled composure the old fellow replied:</p>
          <p>“Having a little fun, General, which is good for all of us, and at the
same time teaching these people something that will be good for
them and won't do us any harm.”</p>
          <p>Suffice it to say the matter was amicably arranged and the brigade
and its unique commander moved on, leaving the honest burghers
of York wondering what manner of men we were. I should add that
General Early had the greatest regard and admiration for General
Smith, which indeed he could not well avoid, in view of his intense
patriotic devotion and his other sterling and heroic qualities. I have
seldom heard him speak of any other officer or soldier in the service,
save of course Lee and Jackson, in such exalted terms as of the old
“Governor-General.”</p>
          <p>May I be pardoned for relating one more incident of our
Pennsylvania trip, and that not strictly a reminiscence; that is, I was
not present and did not myself hear the conversation I propose to
relate. During the latter part of the war I enjoyed the privilege and
pleasure of intimate personal acquaintance with Lieutenant-General
Ewell, but at this time I knew him only as every soldier in the army
knew him. Some of his salient peculiarities, as well as the peculiar
character of some of our intercourse with the people of
Pennsylvania, are well brought out in the following story, which I
have every reason to regard as authentic.</p>
          <p>The General was, I think, at Carlisle, though I am not quite certain
of the place, when the burghers of the town, or rather a deputed
committee of solid citizens, called at headquarters to interview him
with reference to several matters. Amongst other things they said
there was a certain mill, the product of which was used largely by the
poorer people of the place, who were suffering and likely to suffer
more, because of the mill's not running, and they asked whether he
had any objection to its being run.</p>
          <p>“Why, no,” said Old Dick; “certainly not. It isn't my mill; what
have I got to do with it anyhow? But stop, maybe this is what you
want—if any of my people should interfere with your use of your mill,
you come and tell me. Will that do, and is that all?”</p>
          <pb id="stiles206" n="206"/>
          <p>They thanked him profusely and the spokesman said:</p>
          <p>“No, General, that isn't quite all. We are Lutherans and we've got
a church.”</p>
          <p>“Glad to hear it.”</p>
          <p>“Well, can we open it next Sunday?”</p>
          <p>“What? What do you mean? It isn't my church. Certainly, open it,
if you want to. I'll attend it myself if I am here.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, thank you, General! we hoped you wouldn't object.”</p>
          <p>“Object? What do you mean, anyway? What's the matter? What
do you want? Out with it. I'll do anything I can for you, but I've got
nothing to do with your mills or your churches. I'm not going to
interfere with them, but I haven't time to stay here all the evening
talking nonsense like this.”</p>
          <p>“But, General, we hope you won't be mad with us. We are
Lutherans and we have a church service. Can we use it next
Sunday?”</p>
          <p>“Look here, I'm tired of this thing! What have I got to do with
your mill, your church, or your service? Speak quick and speak plain,
or leave at once!”</p>
          <p>“Well, then, General, we hope you won't get mad. In our service
we pray—we pray for—we pray for the President of the United States.
May we use our service? Can we pray for him?”</p>
          <p>“Who do you mean, Lincoln? Certainly, pray for him; pray as much
as ever you can—I don't know anybody that  stands more in need of
prayer!”</p>

          </argument>
          <p>Gettysburg, generally regarded as the pivotal battle of our great
civil war, has been more studied and discussed than any other, and
much unpleasant feeling between prominent actors in the drama on
the Confederate side and their adherents and partisans has been
brought out in the discussion. The writer has his own opinions
upon most or all of the disputed points; but, while resting upon
grounds satisfactory to himself, these opinions are not based upon
such a thorough study of the battle as would alone justify the effort
to influence the views of others, if indeed such an effort could be
regarded as properly within the scope of such a work as this.</p>
          <p>As usual with great battles, it was not the plan or purpose of
either side to fight this one when and where it was fought. Meade,
who had succeeded Hooker, had selected a position on Pipe Clay
Creek, where he would have concentrated his army—but for the
capture of President Davis' message to General Lee, revealing the
fact that he feared to uncover Richmond by detaching Beauregard
to threaten Washington as Lee had advised—and Lee had ordered
the concentration of his army at Cashtown; but there was this great
difference between the circumstances of the two armies. The battle
was brought on by the advance of the Federal cavalry, in the
discharge of its legitimate work of developing our forces and
<pb id="stiles208" n="208"/>
positions and gathering information for the Federal commander. The
Confederate leader, on the other hand, was, in great measure, without
his cavalry; no information whatever had been received by him, since
crossing the Potomac, of or from General Stuart or his troopers. His
army was, therefore, in the condition of a blind man surrounded by
enemies endowed with vision and making full use of it.</p>
          <p>It is fair to Stuart to say that it had been left to his discretion when
and where he should cross the river—whether east of the mountains,
or in the track of the infantry at the mouth of the Valley; but Colonel
Taylor says: “He was expected to maintain communication with the
main column, and especially directed to keep the commanding
general informed of the movements of the Federal army.” Did his one
besetting weakness betray him again? Was he too much absorbed
and infatuated with the fun of seeing how near his eastern sweep
could approach the fortifications of Washington, or how far his
bursting shell could terrorize the Federal capital?</p>
          <p>On the eve of Gettysburg the Army of Northern Virginia, with the
exception of the cavalry, was well in hand and in the finest possible
plight. Of course its equipment was not perfect, though better, I
think, than I remember to have seen it at any other time, while the
physical condition and the spirit of the men could not have been
finer. The way in which the army took the death of Jackson was a
striking test of its high mettle. I do not recall having talked with a man
who seemed to be depressed by it, while the common soldiers spoke
of it in wondrous fashion. They seemed to have imbibed, to a great
extent, the spirit of Lee's order announcing Jackson's death. They
said they felt that his spirit was with us and would be throughout the
campaign. It seemed to be their idea that God would let his warrior
soul leave for a time the tamer bliss of Heaven that it might revel once
more in the fierce joy of battle.</p>
          <p>The Third Corps, A. P. Hill's, the last to leave the line of the
Rappahannock, was the first to become engaged in the great fight.</p>
          <p>On the 29th of June, Hill, who was at Fayetteville, between
Chambersburg and Gettysburg, under general orders
<pb id="stiles209" n="209"/>
to co-operate with Ewell in menacing the communications of
Harrisburg with Philadelphia, sent Heth's division to Cashtown,
following it on the 30th with Pender's, and on the 1st of July with
Anderson's division. On the 1st, Heth sent forward Pettygrew's
brigade toward Gettysburg, where it encountered a considerable
Federal force, how considerable Pettygrew could not determine; but
it consisted in part at least of cavalry, and this information was at
once sent, through Heth and Hill, to the commanding general, who
directed Heth to ascertain if possible what force was at Gettysburg,
and if he found infantry to report at once, but not to force an
engagement. He did find infantry, a large body of it, and finding
himself unable to draw away from it, soon became hotly engaged.
The sound of artillery hurried Hill to the front and he put in Pender's
division in support of Heth. Anderson did not get up in time to take
part in this fight.</p>
          <p>But the Second Corps, Ewell's, to which I was attached, or rather
two divisions of it, Early's and Rodes', which were already en route
for Cashtown, hearing at Middletown that Hill was concentrating at
Gettysburg, turned toward that point, and Rodes, who was in the
advance, gathering from the cannonading that a sharp engagement
was in progress, hurried forward and made his dispositions for
battle. But before he could form his lines so as to most effectively aid
Hill's two divisions, he found fresh Federal troops deploying in his
own front and soon became engaged with these. Meanwhile, our
division (Early's) was subjected to one of the most straining of the
experiences of the soldier—approaching a field of battle, invisible as
yet, and played upon by the cadence and the swell of the fire. I well
recall the scene as, about three o'clock in the afternoon, our column
left the road and deployed out into line upon an elevated plateau,
from which we had a full view of the field and of the drawn battle
trembling in the balance in our front.</p>
          <p>Every experienced soldier, particularly if he is a man of sensitive
nature and pictorial memory, will appreciate my saying that two
strongly contrasted figures are almost
<pb id="stiles210" n="210"/>
equally prominent in my recollections of this scene. One is Old Jube,
as with consuming earnestness he connected his right with Rodes'
left and gave the order to advance—his glossy black ostrich feather,
in beautiful condition, seeming to glisten and gleam and tremble
upon the wide brim of his gray-brown felt hat, like a thing of life;
and the other, a dwarfish, dumpy little fellow, of the division pioneer
corps, who at this moment came running up to his command, just as I
was leaving it to take my place with the artillery, carrying under each
arm a great, round Dutch loaf of bread about the size of a cart wheel,
giving him, upon a side view, such as I had of him, the appearance
of rolling in on wheels.</p>
          <p>Early's attack was one of great impetuosity, especially that
of Gordon's brigade, and while, even after his two brigades
—Hayes' and Gordon's—entered the fight, the preponderance
in numbers was still with the Federal side, yet they broke
almost immediately, in front of Early; whereupon our entire
line—the two divisions of our corps and the two of Hill's—made
a
simultaneous advance, and the whole Federal force,
consisting of the First and Eleventh Corps, of three divisions
each, and Buford's cavalry, gave way in utter rout. The
Charlottesville battery followed immediately in rear of Gordon,
and I was in charge of one of their pieces. We drove
the enemy pell-mell over rolling wheat fields, through a
grove across a creek, up a little slope and into the town
itself. The pursuit was so close and hot that, though my gun
came into battery several times, yet I could not get in a shot.</p>
          <p>Gordon was the most glorious and inspiring thing I ever looked
upon. He was riding a beautiful coal-black stallion, captured at
Winchester, that had belonged to one of the Federal generals in
Milroy's army—a majestic animal, <ref targOrder="U" id="ref3" n="3" rend="sc" target="note3">*</ref> whose “neck was clothed with
thunder.” From his grand joy in
<note id="note3" n="3" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref3"><p>*In <hi rend="italics">Scribner's</hi> for June, 1903, General Gordon mentions this horse,
describing him very much as I have done. He adds that he only rode him in one
battle; that he behaved well at first under artillery fire, but later, encountering a fierce fire of musketry, he turned tail and bolted to the rear a
hundred yards or more.</p><p>I am glad I did not witness this disgraceful fall. Nothing could have been
more superb than his bearing so long as he was under my eye.</p></note>
<pb id="stiles211" n="211"/>
battle, he must have been a direct descendant of Job's horse, or
Bucephalus, or Black Auster. I never saw a horse's neck so arched,
his eye so fierce, his nostril so dilated. He followed in a trot, close
upon the heels of the battle line, his head right in among the slanting
barrels and bayonets, the reins loose upon his neck, his rider
standing in his stirrups, bareheaded, hat in hand, arms extended,
and, in a voice like a trumpet, exhorting his men. It was superb;
absolutely thrilling. I recall feeling that I would not give so much as a
dime to insure the independence of the Confederacy.</p>
          <p>The loss of the enemy was terrific. General Butterfield, chief of
staff of the Federal army, testifying before the Committee on the
Conduct of the War, puts the total Federal force engaged in this
fight at twenty-two to twenty-four thousand, and Swinton estimates
their loss at “near ten thousand men.” Our loss, at least in Gordon's
brigade, was slight. I distinctly remember, in a momentary pause,
calling out to Gordon, “General, where are your dead men?” and his
reply: “I haven't got any, sir; the Almighty has covered my men with
His shield and buckler!” Later in the war General Ewell said to me
that he believed Gordon's brigade that evening put <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">hors de combat</foreign></hi> a
greater number of the enemy in proportion to its own numbers than
any other command on either side ever did, from the beginning to the
end of the war; but he added that he would not be misunderstood as
awarding this gallant brigade credit in like proportion, because it
simply turned the scale of a theretofore evenly-balanced battle.</p>
          <p>I cannot forbear telling how, a few months later, this heroic scene
was brought again vividly to my mind.</p>
          <p>Happening to be in Richmond for a few hours, I went down to a
train to aid in getting off some wounded men, and was helping to
ease down from a box-car a Georgia soldier very badly shot. With
some difficulty we managed to get him on a litter and then to lower
him to the platform, without a jar; when, as he was resting a moment,
I asked the universal soldier question, “What command do you
belong
<pb id="stiles212" n="212"/>
to?” His pained and pallid face lit up with a glow of pride as he
answered: “I belong to Gordon's old brigade, Cap'n. Did you ever
see the Gin'ral in battle? He's most the prettiest thing you ever did
see on a field of fight. It'ud put fight into a whipped chicken just to
look at him.”</p>
          <p>My gun had come again into battery in the outskirts of the town.
No enemy was in sight in our front; but in anticipation of a sudden
rush I had the piece loaded and several rounds of canister taken
from the ammunition chest and put down hard by the gaping muzzle,
ready to sweep the street in case they should turn upon us. At this
moment little George Greer, a chubby boy of sixteen, rode on by
further into the town. George was General Early's clerk and a favorite
with Old Jube, just because more fond of riding courier for him and
of driving spurs into the flanks of a horse than of driving pen across
paper. I shouted a caution to him as he passed, but on he went,
disappearing in the smoke and dust ahead. In a few moments a cloud
of blue coats appeared in the street in front of us, coming on, too, at
a run. I was about to order the detachment to open fire, when
beyond and back of the men in blue I noticed little Greer, leaning
forward over the neck of his horse, towering above the Federals,
who were on foot; and with violent gesticulations and in tones not
the gentlest, ordering the “blue devils” to “double quick to the rear
of that piece,” which they did in the shortest time imaginable. There
must have been over fifty of them.</p>
          <p>I am aware this statement sounds incredible, but the men had
thrown away their arms and were cowering in abject terror in the
streets and alleys. Upon no other occasion did I see any large body
of troops, on either side, so completely routed and demoralized as
were the two Federal corps who were beaten at Gettysburg the
evening of July 1st.</p>
          <p>And this one reminds me of other incidents of those tremendous
moments when our fate hung in the balance.</p>
          <p>There was an Irishman named Burgoyne in the Ninth Louisiana,— 
Harry Hayes' brigades—a typical son of the Emerald Isle, over six
feet high in his stockings (when he had any) broad-shouldered and
muscular, slightly bow-legged
<pb id="stiles213" n="213"/>
and springy as a cat; as full of fire and fight and fun as he could
hold; indeed, often a little fuller than he could hold, and never
having been known to get his fill of noise and scrimmage. Whenever
the Ninth supported Hilary Jones, if the musketry fire slackened
while the artillery was in action, Burgoyne would slip over to the
nearest gun and take some one's place at the piece.</p>
          <p>Seeing us unlimber in the street, as above related, he had come
over now for this purpose, seized the sponge-staff and rammed
home the charge, and was giving vent to his enthusiasm in screams
and bounds that would have done credit to a catamount.</p>
          <p>Standing on the other side of the gun, with his arms folded, was a
Federal Irishman, a prisoner just captured—a man even taller than
Burgoyne and somewhat heavier in frame, altogether a magnificent
fellow. Catching Burgoyne's brogue, he broke out— </p>
          <p>“Hey, ye spalpane! say, what are yez doing in the Ribil army?”</p>
          <p>Quick as a flash, Burgoyne retorted:</p>
          <p>“Be-dad, ain't an Irishman a freeman? Haven't I as good right to
fight for the Ribs as ye have to fight for the - - - Yanks?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, yes!” sang out the Federal Irishman, “I know ye, now you've
turned your ougly mug to me. I had the plizure of kicking yez out
from behind Marye's wall, that time Sedgwick lammed yer brigade
out o' there!”</p>
          <p>“Yer a - - - liar,” shouted our Pat, “and I'll jist knock yer teeth down
yer ougly throat for that same lie,” and suiting the action to the
word, he vaulted lightly over the gun, and before we had time to
realize the extreme absurdity of the thing, the two had squared off
against each other in the most approved style and the first blow had
passed, for the Federal Irishman was as good grit as ours.</p>
          <p>Just as the two giants were about to rush to close quarters, but
before any blood had been drawn in the round, I noticed that the
right fist of the Federal gladiator was gory, and the next movement
revealed the stumps of two shattered fingers, which he was about to
drive full into Burgoyne's face.</p>
          <pb id="stiles214" n="214"/>
          <p>“Hold!” I cried; “your man's wounded!” On the instant
Burgoyne's fists fell.</p>
          <p>“You're a trump, Pat; give me your well hand,” said he. “We'll
fight this out some other time. I didn't see ye were hurt.”</p>
          <p>Just as this intensest climax of the great battle was happily
avoided, a member of General Early's staff—I thought it was Major
Daniel, but he says not—galloped by, and shouted, “Lieutenant,
limber to the rear!”</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">To the front,</hi> you mean, Major!”</p>
          <p>“No,” came the answer, <corr>“</corr><hi rend="italics">to the rear!</hi>”</p>
          <p>“All right, boys,” said I, “I reckon the town's barricaded, and
we'll just pass round it to the front.”</p>
          <p>But, no. <hi rend="italics">Back, back,</hi> we went, for perhaps a mile or more, and
took position on a hill from which, next morning, we gazed upon the
earthworks which had sprung up in the night on Cemetery Ridge,
and the tide, which taken at the flood might have led on to
overwhelming victory and even to independence, had ebbed away
forever. So it looked to me then, and nothing I have read or heard
since has altered the impressions of that moment.</p>
          <p>It is my nature to be reverential toward rightful authority and not
to question the wisdom of its decisions; but on this occasion I
chafed and rebelled until it almost made me ill. I was well nigh
frenzied by what appeared to me to be the folly, the absolute fatuity
of delay. One point must be cleared up. It has been suggested that
General Lee himself was responsible; that, coming late upon the
field, he forbade the advance which his lieutenant would have made.
Mr. Swinton goes so far as to say unqualifiedly that “Ewell was
even advancing a line against Culp's Hill when Lee reached the field
and stayed the movement.” Nothing could be less like Lee and
nothing further from the truth. Colonel Taylor makes this full and
explicit statement:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>General Lee witnessed the flight of the Federals through Gettysburg and up
the hills beyond. He then directed me to go to General Ewell and say to him
that, from the position which he occupied, he could see the enemy retreating
over those hills, without organization and in great confusion; 
that it was only necessary to press “those people” in order to
<pb id="stiles215" n="215"/>
secure possession of the heights, and that, if possible, he wished him to do this. In obedience to these instructions I proceeded immediately to General
Ewell and delivered the order of General Lee; and after receiving from him some
message for the commanding general in regard to the prisoners captured,
returned to the latter and reported that his order had been delivered.</p>
          </q>
          <p>At this time I admired General Ewell as a soldier; later I loved him
as a man, and he treated me with more informal and affectionate
kindness than any other of our leading generals ever did during the
war. But the truth must be told, and Ewell was the last man on earth
to object to this. Colonel Taylor speaks of the discretion General Lee
always accorded to his lieutenants. In the exercise of this discretion,
Ewell probably decided it best not to press his advantage on the
evening of July 1st. Why, we do not know; at least I do not recall
any statement from him on the subject, and his lips are now sealed. I
ask no judgment against him, but only that General Lee's skirts
should be cleared of responsibility for the failure to go right on that
evening and occupy the heights.</p>
          <p>It is also undeniably true, that Lee desired and purposed to renew
the attack, in full force, at daylight the next morning, the morning of
July 2d, but was again thwarted by lack of prompt and vigorous
co-operation among his generals. This book being in the main a record
of personal reminiscence, I do not care to go into details of these
various and desultory movements and failures to move, until some
time, I think early in the afternoon of the second, when I was
brought again in personal touch with the matter and ultimately into
one of the most tremendous experiences of my life.</p>
          <p>As I remember, about the time mentioned, two of Early's brigades,
Gordon's being one, were sent off to watch the York road and a
suspicious-looking body of troops which had appeared and
disappeared in that direction, say two miles to the left, and which
threatened the left flank and rear of Edward Johnson's division,
which was our extreme left and under orders to take part in a general
advance against the enemy. Gordon was in command of this little
<pb id="stiles216" n="216"/>
army of observation, and as I was mounted and relished the idea of a
scout and the prospect of adventure, I joined the expedition.</p>
          <p>When we reached our objective we readily satisfied ourselves
that no danger boded from this direction, and that the troops we had
regarded with suspicion were not hostile. We did not come into
absolute contact with them,—we could not wait for that,—but my
recollection is that they proved to be the advance of Stuart's
cavalry, which had just come up, and were really doing just what we
had come to do, that is, guarding our left flank and rear.</p>
          <p>After making this discovery, the point was to get word to
Johnson, at the earliest possible moment, that he could press on,
feeling no uneasiness about his flanks. Not a member of Gordon's
staff was with him—all were off on various errands. Captain Mitchell
came up at the moment, but both he and his horse were exhausted,
utterly unfit for such a ride as this. The General called for volunteers,
mounted officers, to take the message—two, I think; one to go around
a longer and safer way, but one to cut right across, or rather, as his
course would be after the first quarter of a mile, directly in the teeth
of the artillery fire, which was sweeping the approaches to the
Federal position from our left.</p>
          <p>I offered to take this latter ride and do my best to get word to
General Johnson promptly. The General thanked me, and off I
dashed, braced, as I thought, for anything, yet little dreaming what
the ride would really be.</p>
          <p>For the first few hundred yards, as above suggested, the
configuration of the ground was such that the fire was entirely cut
off—not so much as even one stray shell whistled above my head. But
in a few moments, as I rose a hill and my course veered to the left, I
struck a well-defined aerial current, a meteoric stream, of projectiles
and explosions, and I felt my little horse shudder and squat under
me, and then he made one frantic effort to turn and fly. I pulled him
fiercely back against the iron torrent until he breasted it squarely and
then, seeming to realize the requirements of the position, he
elongated and flattened himself as much as possible, while I lay as
close to him as I could, and we fairly devoured the way.</p>
          <pb id="stiles217" n="217"/>
          <p>One of the horrors of the thing, during a large part of the ride, was
that I could see almost every shell that passed, as they were coming
straight toward me, and their propulsive force was pretty well
exhausted. As I approached the points at which the fire was
directed, while I could not see so large a proportion of the shells,
and this strain was of course diminished, yet the number of
projectiles and explosions increased—until at last there was
absolutely no separation between the reports, but the air was rent
by one continuous shriek of shell and roar of explosion, and torn
with countless myriads of hurtling fragments.</p>
          <p>When a man is undergoing an experience like this he does not
think—his entire conscious being is concentrated upon the one point
of endurance. But unconsciously, inadvertently, he may receive
powerful impressions and bear away with him vivid and unfading
mental photographs.</p>
          <p>I have borne with me ever since, in my recollections of this ride,
three pictures. The first is a silhouette of my little horse and me as
we sped on our perilous way. I put him first because he did it, I only
endured. After his first shy he never shrank or swerved again, but
held to his course straight and swift as a greyhound; nay, as an
arrow flies. He seemed to be possessed, whether intelligently or
instinctively, of the double purpose of making himself small and
getting there. His figure was that of a running hare—low to the
ground, with ears laid flat and every limb stretched—while I was
nothing but the smallest possible projection above his back and
along his flanks.</p>
          <p>I am not satisfied whether this is purely a mental and
inferential picture, or whether, as I incline to think, my eye,
in an involuntary sidelong glance, caught our shadow as we
flew. But of this I am satisfied—that, in all the years since,
the battle of Gettysburg has never obtruded itself upon my
mental vision that this strange figure, of horse and man blent
together into one by the terrible tension, has not been the
frontispiece.</p>
          <p>The next picture is of Latimer's battalion, which, with splendid
pluck but little judgment, had engaged in a most unequal artillery
duel with the Federal batteries massed upon Cemetery Ridge and
Culp's Hill. Never, before or after,
<pb id="stiles218" n="218"/>
did I see fifteen or twenty guns in such a condition of wreck and
destruction as this battalion was. It had been hurled backward, as it
were, by the very weight and impact of metal, from the position it had occupied
on the crest of a little ridge, into a
saucer-shaped depression behind it; and such a scene as it
presented—guns dismounted and disabled, carriages splintered and
crushed, ammunition chests exploded, limbers upset, wounded
horses plunging and kicking, dashing out the brains of men tangled
in the harness; while cannoneers with pistols were crawling around
through the wreck shooting the struggling horses to save the lives
of the wounded men.</p>
          <p>I said the little horse did not again swerve from his course. He
was compelled to do so at this point, as it was impracticable to ride
through the battalion, which lay directly in our track; but we had a
full view of it as we followed the higher ground from which it had
been driven.</p>
          <p>The third and last picture connected with my desperate ride is of
the finish and of the doughty division commander in whose behalf I
had taken it. He was sometimes called “Alleghany Johnson” and
“Fence-Rail Johnson,” because of his having been wounded at the
battle of Alleghany, and, in consequence, walking with a very
perceptible limp and aiding the process with a staff about as long as
a rail and almost as thick as the club of Giant Despair. He was a
heavy, thick-set man, and when I saw him was on foot and hobbling
along with the help of this gigantic walking-cane. It was toward the
gloaming and I did not see him very distinctly, but remember that
when I gasped out the message I bore from Gordon, he simply
growled back, “Very well, sir”—and, my responsibility discharged, I
dropped from the saddle to the ground, the last thing I remember
being my little horse standing over me, his sides heaving and panting
and his head drooping and sinking until his muzzle almost touched
my body. How long I lay and he stood there, or where we went after
we recovered breath and motion, I have not the faintest recollection.</p>
          <p>Johnson's attack was made not long before dark, but it was not
vigorously supported, except by two of Early's brigades, and it
failed to accomplish any important result.</p>
          <pb id="stiles219" n="219"/>
          <p>I was not in any way personally connected with the main
operations of the next day, July 3d, the last day of the great battle.
That was a matter primarily of Longstreet's corps, a part of Hill's
acting as support to his attack. I shall, therefore, not enter into the
hotly-debated question of responsibility for the failure of the
Confederate assault, nor indulge in any heroics over its gallantry.</p>
          <p>Nor shall I discuss the question which side is entitled to claim the
victory. It is clear that the Confederates retired first from the field,
but they did not do so until the 5th of July, the rear guard leaving
late on that day, and even then they were not pursued. General
Sickles, before the Committee on the Conduct of the War, testified
that the reason the Confederates were not followed up was a
difference of opinion among the Federal generals whether their army
should not retreat; that “it was by no means clear, in the judgment of
the corps commanders, or of the general in command, whether they
had won or not.”</p>
          <p>It is a suggestive, even a solemnizing reflection, to one who is a
believer in a superintending Providence, that the event of this
campaign, like that of the preceding year upon Northern soil turned
upon the capture by the enemy of an important dispatch—this time
the dispatch of President Davis positively declining to act upon
General Lee's suggestion to gather an army under Beauregard to threaten
Washington.</p>
          <p>There is but one other scene of the battle-field which I care to
mention, and that only for a reason already touched upon in a like
connection, namely, to give to those who have had no actual
experience of war some approximate conception of the variety and
extravagance of horrors which the soldier is called upon, from time
to time, to undergo.</p>
          <p>On the 4th of July, in readjusting and straightening our lines, the
guns of Hilary Jones' battalion were put in position, on a part of the
field which Hill's corps had fought over on the 1st and upon which
the pioneer corps and burying parties had not been able to complete
their work; so that the dead bodies of men and horses had lain there
putrefying under the summer sun for three days. The sights and
smells
<pb id="stiles220" n="220"/>
that assailed us were simply indescribable—corpses swollen to twice
their original size, some of them actually burst asunder with the
pressure of foul gases and vapors. I recall one feature never before
noted, the shocking distension and protrusion of the eyeballs of
dead men and dead horses. Several human or unhuman corpses sat
upright against a fence, with arms extended in the air and faces
hideous with something very like a fixed leer, as if taking a fiendish
pleasure in showing us what we essentially were and might at any
moment become. The odors were nauseating, and so deadly that in a
short time we all sickened and were lying with our mouths close to
the ground, most of us vomiting profusely. We protested against the
cruelty and folly of keeping men in such a position. Of course to
fight in it was utterly out of the question, and we were soon moved
away; but, for the rest of that day and late into the night, the fearful
odors I had inhaled remained with me and made me loathe myself as
if an already rotting corpse.</p>
          <p>While a prisoner at Johnson's Island, in the spring of '65, I became
much interested in one of my fellow-prisoners, a Major McDaniel, of
Georgia. He did not at first strike one as an impressive man. Indeed, if
I recollect rightly, he had somewhat of an impediment in his speech
and was not inclined to talk much; but there was a peculiar pith and
point and weight in what he did say, and those who knew him best
seemed to regard him as a man of mark and to treat him with the
greatest respect. The impression he made upon me was of simplicity
and directness, good sense and good character, dignity, gravity,
decorum. They told me this surprising story of him:</p>
          <p>He was seriously wounded at Gettysburg, and, of course, in the
hospital. His friends who had been captured and were about to be
marched off to prison, came in to bid him good-by; but he declared
he would not be left behind, that he could and would go with them.
Both his comrades and the Federal surgeons and nurses, who were
kind and attentive, protested that this was absolutely out of the
question—that he would die on the road.</p>
          <p>“Very good,” said McDaniel, “I'll die then. I am certainly going,
and if you don't bring a litter and put me on it
<pb id="stiles221" n="221"/>
and carry me, then I will simply get up and walk till I
drop.”</p>
          <p>Finally the surgeons yielded, saying that, in his condition,
it would be as fatal to confine him forcibly in bed
as to lift him out and attempt to transport him; that either course was
certain death. So the litter was brought, he was placed upon it, his
friends sadly took hold of the bearing poles and started, feeling that
the marching column of prisoners was really McDaniel's funeral
procession.</p>
          <p>The journey would have been trying enough, even for a sound,
strong man, but for one in McDaniel's condition it was simply
fearful. Why he did not die they could not see, yet he did seem to
grow weaker and weaker, until at last, as the column halted in a little
Pennsylvania town and his bearers put the litter gently down in the
shade, his eyes were closed, his face deadly pale, and the majority of
those about him thought he was gone. The whole population was in
the streets to see the Rebel prisoners go by, and some stared, with
gaping curiosity, at the dead man on the stretcher.</p>
          <p>His most intimate friend, Colonel Nesbit, stood nearest, keeping a
sort of guard over him, and just as he made up his mind to examine
and see if it was indeed all over, McDaniel opened his eyes, and
beckoned feebly for Nesbit to come close to him. As he reached his
side and bent over him, McDaniel took hold upon the lapel of
Nesbit's coat and drew him yet closer down, until their faces well
nigh touched, and then, with a great effort and in a voice scarcely
audible, McDaniel whispered his name—“Nesbit!”</p>
          <p>Nesbit says he confidently expected some last message for his
family, or some tender farewell to his friends, when, with extreme
difficulty, his supposed-to-be-dying friend, pointing with trembling
finger, uttered just these words:</p>
          <p>“Nesbit, old fellow! Did you ever see such an ungodly pair of
ankles as that Dutch woman standing over there on that porch has
got?”</p>
          <p>Of course such a man could not be killed and would not die; and
it was not a matter of surprise to me when, a few years later, he was
elected Governor of Georgia by a hundred thousand majority.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>I confess I have not read current war literature very closely, but
certainly I have never seen, in any publication, any allusion to what
is related below; indeed I cannot recall any mention of it even in
conversation with comrades—and yet my recollection of what
transpired is clear and vivid.</p>
          <p>Much has been said, and justly, of the unshaken condition of the
Army of Northern Virginia when it retired from the Federal front at
Gettysburg; and yet it is equally true that army had been through a
most trying experience, and as it was still in hostile territory and a
swollen and at the time impassable river flowed between it and the
friendly soil of Old Virginia, Lee had great cause for anxiety, and it
behooved him to be thoroughly informed and certified as to the real
condition and spirit of his troops. With this view he directed his
generals, particularly his generals of division, to make prompt and
thorough investigation in this regard, and to report results to him.
McLaws, our division general, made a special tour around the camp
fires of his men one evening, while we were in line of battle at
Hagerstown, Md., waiting for Meade to attack, or for the Potomac to
<pb id="stiles223" n="223"/>
fall, so that we might in safety cross it, and I was at special pains to
follow, and to see and hear what I could.</p>
          <p>McLaws was rather a peculiar personality. He certainly could not
be called an intellectual man, nor was he a brilliant and aggressive
soldier; but he was regarded as one of the most dogged defensive
fighters in the army. His entire make-up, physical, mental and moral,
was solid, even stolid. In figure he was short, stout,
square-shouldered, deep-chested, strong-limbed; in complexion, dark and
swarthy, with coal-black eyes and black, thick, close-curling hair and
beard. Of his type, he was a handsome man, but the type was that of
the Roman centurion; say that centurion who stood at his post in
Herculaneum until the lava ran over him. It should be mentioned in
his honor that when General Lee, with scant 14,000 muskets, held the
front of Hooker's 92,000 at Chancellorsville, McLaws commanded
one of the two divisions he had with him.</p>
          <p>He was a Georgian, and his division, consisting of two
Georgia brigades, one from South Carolina and one from
Mississippi, was as stalwart and reliable as any in the
service. Nothing of course could repress our Mississippians,
but the general effect and influence of the man upon his
command was clearly manifest in the general tenor of the
responses he elicited. His men were respectful, but not
enthusiastic on this occasion. For the most part they kept
right on with what they happened to be doing when the
General arrived—cooking, cleaning their arms and
accoutrements, or whatever else it might be. He was on horseback,
riding, as I remember, a small, white, pony-built horse, and
as he rode up into the circle of flickering light of camp fire
after camp fire to talk with the men, he made quite a marked
and notable figure. The conversation ran somewhat in this
line:</p>
          <p>“Well, boys, how are you?”</p>
          <p>“We are all right, General!”</p>
          <p>“They say there are lots of those fellows over the way there.”</p>
          <p>“Well, they can stay there; we ain't offerin' to disturb 'em.
We've had all the fighting we want just now; but if
<pb id="stiles224" n="224"/>
they ain't satisfied and want any more, all they've got to do is to
come over and get their bellies full.”</p>
          <p>“Suppose they do come, sure enough, boys. What are you going
to do with them?”</p>
          <p>“Why, just make the ground blue with 'em, that's all; just manure
this here man's land with 'em. We ain't asking anything of them, but if
they want anything of us, why, just let 'em come after it, and they can
get all they want; but they'll wish they hadn't come.”</p>
          <p>“Well, now, I can rely upon that, can I?”</p>
          <p>“You just bet your life you can, General. If we're asleep when they
come, you just have us waked up, and we'll receive 'em in good
style.”</p>
          <p>“Well, good-night, boys. I'm satisfied.”</p>
          <p>McLaws' “boys” had no occasion upon that field to vindicate
their own account of themselves. The enemy did not
attack, the river did fall, and we returned to our own side of the
Potomac, but not until the 13th of July. The day we got there, or
perhaps the day following, “Tuck,” the redoubtable wagon driver of
the old battery, had a memorable experience which he never tired of
telling.</p>
          <p>Tuck was a unique character. Up to the date of his enlistment his
horizon had been perhaps more contracted and his opportunities
fewer and lower than those of any other man among us. Naturally he
gravitated to the wagon; but the man made the position. He was so
quiet and steady and perfect in the discharge of its humble duties,
that I question whether there was another private soldier in the
battery as useful, or one more universally liked and respected, and
he was as loyal and devoted to the company and his comrades as
they were to him. He had a fine pair of mules, and his affection for
them amounted almost to a passion. Indeed, his entire outfit—mules,
harness and wagon—was always in better condition than any other
I ever saw in the army, and if there was forage or food, for man or
beast, to be had anywhere, Tuck was sure to get at least our share
for us.</p>
          <p>As above said, it was the very day we reached the soil of old
Virginia, or the day after, that Tuck, or Tucker,—I
<pb id="stiles225" n="225"/>
believe the latter was really his name,—was dragging along with his
wagon, through the mud and mist, considerably in rear of the
battery, grieving that his two faithful mules had gone supperless to
bed the last night and taken breakfastless to the road that morning,
when, glancing to the left, his eye lit upon a luxuriant field of grass
he was just passing, and there, right abreast of the wagon, was an
enticing set of draw-bars.</p>
          <p>On the instant he turned out to the side of the road, unhitched the
mules, and taking them by their long, strong halter reins—the best I
ever saw upon the harness of an army team—let down the bars and
led them into the field, and was enjoying their breakfast as much
perhaps as the mules were, when a fine-looking officer, with a rubber
cape over his shoulders, rode up to the fence and said in a kindly,
pleasant voice:</p>
          <p>“My man, I like that. I am glad to see you taking such good care
of your mules, and they like it, too. What a fine breakfast they are
making! They are fine mules, too!”</p>
          <p>Tuck's eyes and thoughts were on his mules. He did not look up
at his interlocutor, but answered sharply:</p>
          <p>“What, my mules? You bet they are fine! Marse Robert ain't got
no better mules in his army than these two.”</p>
          <p>“What are their names?”</p>
          <p>“This here gray one, he's named Dragon, and that 'ere black one,
his name's Logan. Dragon, he's a leetle the best of the two, but
either one of 'em's good enough.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, indeed, I can well believe that and I am glad to see you
taking such good care of this man's property, too; keeping your
mules in hand with the lines. I wish all the drivers in the army were
as careful of their teams and of other people's property as you are.
Now this is all right, but I wouldn't stay here too long. There are
some gentlemen in blue, back here on the road a little way; and—”</p>
          <p>“What's that! the damn Yankees coming? Come, Dragon, come,
Logan, we must git out o' this!”</p>
          <p>“Oh, I wouldn't be in quite such a hurry. There is no danger yet
awhile. Let them finish their breakfast. I only meant—”</p>
          <pb id="stiles226" n="226"/>
          <p>“No, sir; I ain't taking no chances. The infernal Yankees sha'n't
never git my mules! Come on here, Dragon and Logan,”—leading
them toward the bars,—“we must git out o' this, and mighty quick,
too!”</p>
          <p>As he got his pets out in the road and was hitching them up
again, Colonel Taylor and Colonel Marshall and the rest of General
Lee's staff rode up and reported to Tuck's friend and took orders
from him, and Tuck waked up to the fact that he had been talking
with Marse Robert himself for the last five minutes.</p>
          <p>“Great Scott!” said he, in relating his adventure, “I felt that I had
been more impudent than the devil himself, and I wanted to get out
o' sight as fast as ever I could; but I didn't feel like letting no
common man speak to me for two or three days after that.”</p>
          <p>There is a delicious sequel to this story, which seems too good to
be true, and yet I have every reason to believe it is as true as it is
good.</p>
          <p>When the final collapse came, Tuck, Dragon and Logan were
down in North Carolina, where they had been many a time before,
foraging for themselves and the rest of us—horses and men. The
returning train of heavily-loaded wagons, inadequately protected,
was attacked by Federal raiders. The shooting, plundering, and
burning was going on front and rear and rapidly approaching from
both directions. So Tuck halted his wagon, got out all the provisions
he could carry for himself and them, unhitched Dragon and Logan,
and took to the woods, and he kept going until he got so far away
that the braying of his companions could not be heard from the road.
Then he made himself comfortable by the side of a little stream and
awaited developments.</p>
          <p>The next day it rained and he kept close, but the day following
was bright and clear, and he took an early morning scout to “the big
road.” There was the blackened debris of burnt wagons, but there
had not been a track upon the road since the rain, and Tuck
concluded that the coast was clear. So he went back to his bivouac,
mounted Dragon and, leading Logan, returned to the road and took
the direction of Richmond.</p>
          <pb id="stiles227" n="227"/>
          <p>At last he emerged from the dank, sombre pine forest into a
clearing, where was a comfortable farm house, and not far from the
woods he ran upon an old fellow seated on the top rail of an old
Virginia snake fence, with his spinal column comfortably supported
by one of the cross stakes, a short-stemmed, blackened corncob
pipe in his mouth, his neglected, stubby beard bristling all over his
face, and his entire figure and bearing expressive of ill-temper and
despair.</p>
          <p>“Good morning,” said Tuck.</p>
          <p>“Mornin',” responded the old chap.</p>
          <p>“Seen anything of the Yankees?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, the infernal thieves cleaned me out day before yestiddy.”</p>
          <p>“What's that plow doin' standing in that 'ere furrow?”</p>
          <p>“Why, the damn Yankees stole the mules right out of it. Didn't
leave me a hide or hoof on the place.”</p>
          <p>“I've got a good pair of mules here,” said Tuck.</p>
          <p>“Well, go there to the gate, come right in and hitch up, and we'll
go snacks on the crap.”</p>
          <p>The bargain was closed as promptly as proposed. Tuck plowed
until the dinner horn blew. Then he and Dragon and Logan went to
the sound of it, as if they had been “bred and born” on the place.
Tuck watered and fed his mules at the stable and himself at the
house, touching his hat to the old man's pretty daughter as he
entered.</p>
          <p>In due course of time he married her, and he owns that farm
today.</p>
          <p>Thus the house of Tucker rode into home and fortune upon “my
mules,” which its illustrious founder swore “the infernal Yankees
sha'n't never git!”</p>
          <p>Some little time since, in a conversation with Mr. George Cary
Eggleston, he remarked that, years ago, perhaps during the war, I
mentioned to him an estimate of General Meade which I had heard
General Lee express, about the time of Meade's appointment to
succeed Hooker in command of the Army of the Potomac. I do not
now quite see how I could have overheard the remark precisely at
the time indicated, but I have no doubt the story, as far as Lee's
estimate of Meade is concerned, is essentially true. As the
<pb id="stiles228" n="228"/>
story goes, some one was congratulating Lee upon having “a
mediocre man like Meade” as his opponent, suggesting that he
would have an easy time with him. But Lee interrupted the speaker,
saying with emphasis that General Meade was the most dangerous
man who had as yet been opposed to him; that he was not only a
soldier of intelligence and ability, but that he was also a
conscientious, careful, thorough and painstaking man; that he would
make no such mistake in his (Lee's) front as some of his predecessors
had made, and that if he made any mistake in Meade's front he would
be certain to take advantage of it.</p>
          <p>It is noteworthy how exactly this estimate was fulfilled and
confirmed, not only at Gettysburg, but in the campaign of the
succeeding autumn upon Virginia soil, in which Meade showed
himself to be able and cautious, wary and lithe; incomparably
superior to Pope or Burnside, or even Hooker. In October, at Bristoe
Station, when we were attempting to outflank him, as we had done
Pope, he not only escaped by giving such attention to his “lines of
retreat” as the latter had boasted he would not give, but he actually
inflicted upon us a decided defeat, accentuated by the almost
unparalleled capture of five pieces of artillery; and that, when his
force engaged was inferior to ours. In November, at the <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">tête-de-pont</foreign></hi>
at Rappahannock Bridge, he wrote for us what Colonel Taylor calls
“the saddest chapter in the history of this army,” by snapping up
two brigades, of twelve or fifteen hundred men, and four pieces of
artillery, which had been exposed, by an arrangement of his lines
more nearly questionable perhaps than any other General Lee was
ever known to make. In December, at Mine Run, while he failed in his
main design of turning our flank and forcing us to abandon our
fortified line on the Rapidan, and so pushing us back on Hanover
junction, and while he got decidedly the worst of the fighting, yet he
succeeded in getting away without the overwhelming defeat we
hoped to have inflicted upon him; and, upon the whole, no preceding
Federal commander of the Army of the Potomac had made anything
like as good a showing in an equal number of moves against
their great Confederate opponent.</p>
          <pb id="stiles229" n="229"/>
          <p>Apropos of the time and the region in which the operations just
commented upon occurred—being the great battlefield of central
Virginia, threshed over for three years by the iron flail of war—Billy
sends me what he very justly terms “the most pathetic and
harrowing incident of my service in the Army of Northern Virginia.” I
give it substantially in his own words:</p>
          <p>“One day while we were encamped in the Poison Fields of
Spottsylvania County, Tom Armistead and I were summoned to
Captain McCarthy's quarters. We found him talking to a woman very
poorly but cleanly dressed, who seemed in bitter distress. The
captain ordered us to go with the woman and bury her child. We
went with her to her home, a small house with but two rooms. There
we found her mother, an aged woman, and the child, a boy of ten,
who had just died of a most virulent case of diphtheria. The father,
a soldier in some Virginia regiment, was of course absent, and of
neighbors there were none in that war-stricken country.</p>
          <p>“Armistead and I bathed and dressed the little body and then had
to rip planks off part of the shed room of the house to make
something to bury it in, tearing off the palings of the garden to get
nails, having no saw and being compelled to cut and break the
planks with an axe. Before we had finished the box the battery bugle
sounded <hi rend="italics">“Harness and hitch up.”</hi> We stayed long enough to finish
the box and place the body in it, but could not stay to dig the grave.
We had to leave these two poor women alone with the unburied
child.</p>
          <p>“There was not a farm animal, not even a fowl, on the place. How
these women and many others in the track of both those great
armies lived was then, and always has been, a mystery to me. War
truly is <hi rend="italics">hell</hi>; how utterly devilish are those who, by cruelty and
license, add to its horrors.”</p>
          <p>Another incident of this same period and locality occurs to me.</p>
          <p>One of the Georgia batteries of our battalion—“Frazier's,” as it
was called—was composed largely of Irishmen from Savannah— 
gallant fellows, but wild and reckless. The
<pb id="stiles230" n="230"/>
captaincy becoming vacant, a Georgia Methodist preacher, Morgan
Calloway, was sent to command them. He proved to be, all in all,
such a man as one seldom sees—a combination of Praise God
Barebone and Sir Philip Sidney, with a dash of Hedley Vicars about
him. He had all the stern grit of the Puritan, with much of the chivalry
of the Cavalier, and the zeal of the Apostle.</p>
          <p>No man ever gave himself such a “send-off” as Calloway did with
his battery. He gripped their very souls at the first pass.</p>
          <p>Not long after he took command the battalion spent a few days in
these Poison Fields of Spottsylvania. The very evening we arrived,
before we had gotten fixed for the night, a woman of the type of the
one above described by Billy came to battalion headquarters and
complained that one of the men in “that company over yonder”— 
pointing to where Calloway's guns were parked—had gone right into
her pig pen, before her very eyes, and killed and carried off her pig.</p>
          <p>The colonel directed me to look after the matter, and the woman
and I walked over to the battery and laid the complaint before
Calloway, who asked her whether she thought she could point out
the man. She said she could, and he ordered his bugler to blow “an
assembly.”</p>
          <p>When the line was formed he gave the command, “To the rear,
open order, march!” the rear rank stepping back two paces further to
the rear, and he and I and the woman started to walk down the front
rank; he, as was his wont when on duty, having his coat buttoned
to the chin and his sabre belted about his waist.</p>
          <p>When we had gotten a little more than half way down the line
some lewd fellow of the baser sort, <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="ita">sotto voce</foreign></hi>, made some improper
remark about the woman, and his comrades began to titter. With a
single sweep of his right arm, Calloway drew his sabre and delivered
his blow. The weapon flashed past my face and laid open the scalp
of the chief offender, who dropped in his tracks, bleeding like a
stricken bullock. There was a shuffle of feet moving to his aid.</p>
          <pb id="stiles231" n="231"/>
          <p>“Stand fast in ranks! Eyes front!” cried Calloway, the sabre
dripping with blood still in his sword hand. Needless to say, they
did stand, as if carved out of stone, while in absolute silence
Calloway, the woman, and I completed our inspection of the front,
and when about midway of the rear rank she, without hesitation,
confidently identified the thief. His manner and bearing under the
charge convicted him, and Calloway had him bucked and gagged
and sequestered his pay to reimburse the woman. He then gave the
order, “break ranks!” and sent the surgeon to attend the wounded
man.</p>
          <p>I never saw a company of men more impressed. Indeed, I was
myself as much impressed as any of them, and was at considerable
pains to catch the feelings and comments of the men.</p>
          <p>“Whew!” said a big fellow, who had been a leader in all the
lawlessness of the battery, “what sort of a preacher do you call
this? Be-dad! and if he hits the Yankees half as hard as he hit Dan,
it'll be all right. We'll have to watch him about that, boys. We'll get
his gait before long.”</p>
          <p>As several times remarked, I have not been able to determine
exactly when and where I rejoined the old battalion as its adjutant;
but since writing the preceding chapter I am satisfied it must have
been shortly after the battle of Gettysburg, and either at or before
we reached Hagerstown; as otherwise I should not have witnessed
McLaws' evening visitation to the camp fires of his division.</p>
          <p>It may be well here to say that our battalion was ordered to
Hanover junction in the autumn of 1863, about two months after our
return from Gettysburg, with the view of going with Longstreet's
corps to the West; but, either from lack of transportation or from
some other cause, we did not go, but passed some weeks on or near
the Central Railroad, gradually working our way up toward the main
body of the army again, and were sent, after Mine Run, to guard the
middle fords of the Rapidan.</p>
          <p>I have quoted Colonel Taylor as saying that the disaster at
Rappahannock Bridge was the saddest chapter in the history of the
Army of Northern Virginia, and I am confident
<pb id="stiles232" n="232"/>
General Lee felt it very keenly. Some weeks after we had begun our
winter's watch on the Rapidan, General Ewell, who was in command
of the forces picketing the stream from Clark's Mountain down,
received a message from General Lee that he would come down next
day, bringing two or three general officers with him, and wished
General Ewell with two or three of his artillery officers, to ride with
them along the lines. General Ewell notified Colonel Cabell and
myself to be at his headquarters next morning, where we met General
Lee, General Early, and Gen. John Pegram, and rode with them along
the hills skirting the stream, discussing chiefly positions for artillery,
until we came to a hill, over against Raccoon or Somerville Ford,
where we had an exceptionally fine view of the Federal camps across
the river.</p>
          <p>The party halted on the summit and General Lee was more stirred
than I had ever before seen him. He either referred expressly to
Rappahannock Bridge and the affair of the <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">tête-de-pont</foreign></hi>, or the
implied reference to it was perfectly clear. Sweeping the stretch of
the enemy's camps with his gauntleted right hand he said:</p>
          <p>“What is there to prevent our cutting off and destroying the
people in these nearer camps on this side of that hill, before those
back yonder on the other side could get to them to help them?”</p>
          <p>Early at once answered, as if the question had been propounded
to him alone:</p>
          <p>“This infernal river; how are you going to cross that without
giving warning?”</p>
          <p>“Ford it, sir; ford it!”</p>
          <p>“What are you going to do with your pneumonia patients?”
whined Old Jube with a leer.</p>
          <p>Thereupon Ewell and Pegram sided strongly with Early in
deprecating such an undertaking that winter season, though the
weather at the time was open and fine. General Lee said no more,
and I have never thought he seriously entertained such a purpose;
but he was evidently smarting under the slap in the face he had
received, and he panted for some opportunity to return the blow.</p>
          <pb id="stiles233" n="233"/>
          <p>While we continued to look at the Federal camps two horsemen
rode down to the other bank to water their horses. Pegram seemed
much interested and said he believed he would gallop down and
interview “those fellows.” As he
started, General Lee said, in a deep voice, “You'd better be
careful, sir!” Pegram was a superb horseman and splendidly
mounted, and I never saw a finer equestrian figure than
he presented as he dashed off down the hill, never making
an uneven movement in the saddle. When he reached the
flat, through which the river ran, the Federal horses
raised their heads, and their riders shaded their eyes with
their hands, gazing intently at the rapidly-approaching
horseman and striving to make him out. As he dashed into
the stream amid a cloud of spray, they advanced rapidly to
meet him, and we felt a shade of uneasiness; but the next
moment we saw that the meeting was not only friendly but
enthusiastic, and after the first fervors of the greeting had
subsided the three sat upon their horses in the middle of the
stream and had a conference so long that we actually tired
waiting. When Pegram returned he told us, with a glowing
countenance, that the troopers had belonged to his company
in the old army and that their hearts were in the same place
toward him. He was a noble gentleman, and no one suggested such
a thing as military information acquired or
divulged under such circumstances.</p>
          <p>I recall a trivial incident of Mine Run which may serve as an
introduction to what may prove of interest. I had been sent with a
message to Gen. William N. Pendleton, chief of artillery of the army,
and told only that he was on the lines. So I had to ride from one end
to the other while the artillery fire was heavy, and did not find the
General after all. But just as I got to the end of the lines I did find, a
little back of them, a fine tree full of ripe persimmons, the first I had
seen that autumn, in perfect condition for eating. I dismounted,
threw my bridle rein over the pommel of the saddle, climbed the tree
and gave it a good shake. Meanwhile several shells whistled not far
above my head and I
distinctly recall laughing to myself at the difference two
and a half years had wrought. Just after I was mustered
<pb id="stiles234" n="234"/>
into service I should have considered that I had made a narrow
escape from shells passing as near as these, and that it was little
less than profane to have so much as thought of persimmons
“under such solemn circumstances.”</p>
          <p>But my horse, “Mickey Free,” and I had come to a more practical
state of mind. We were badly in need of lunch—the persimmons would
furnish a very acceptable one, and it never occurred to either of us
that the shells constituted any serious obstacle to our gathering and
eating luncheon. I recall vividly how he raised his head and pricked
up his ears, watching where the persimmons fell thickest and going
there and gobbling them up with the greatest gusto. After I had
shaken off all that were ready to drop, I proceeded to gather my
portion, which I thought, under the circumstances, should be the
lion's share; but Mickey evidently thought differently. I can see the
dear old fellow now trotting ahead of me to the spots where the fruit
lay thickest, and as I tried to dart in and pick up my share, backing
his ears, wheeling his rear upon me and executing a sort of
continuous kick with one hind leg, just to bully me a little and
without any intention of really doing me harm. Many horses and
most dogs are very fond of persimmons, and Mickey and I had the
fullest and finest feed of them that morning at Mine Run that we ever
enjoyed during our army comradeship.</p>
          <p>I have always been fond of what we are pleased to term “the
lower animals,” particularly of horses and dogs, and have already
devoted several pages to the biographies of the only two dogs I was
intimately acquainted with during the war. I ask permission now to
say a few words about the horses, whose starvation and sufferings
and wounds and death I really believe used to affect me even more
than the like experience of my human fellow-beings; and this
because, as Grover said, at Ball's Bluff, the men “ 'listed ter git
killed,” and the horses didn't.</p>
          <p>Some of these sensitive creatures were mortally afraid of artillery
fire. I have seen the poor brutes, when the shells were flying low
and close above their backs, squat until their bellies almost touched
the ground. They would be perfectly
<pb id="stiles235" n="235"/>
satisfied during battle, or at least entirely quiet, if their drivers
remained with them, especially on their backs; and when the men
were compelled to absent themselves for a time and returned again
to their teams, I have heard the horses welcome them with whinnies
of satisfaction and content, and have seen them, under fire, rub their
heads against their drivers with confiding and appealing affection.</p>
          <p>And the poor animals loved not only their drivers but each other.
I have heard and seen a horse, whose mate was killed at his side,
utter an agonized and terrified neigh, meanwhile shuddering
violently, and have known a horse so bereaved persistently refuse
to eat, and pine away and die.</p>
          <p>A few horses, the grand progeny of Job's horse, may “mock at
fear * * * and say among the trumpets, ha! ha!” But it should be
remembered that Job's horse probably did not have artillery fire to
face. However, I have known horses which seemed to be thrilled
rather than terrified even by the thunder of the guns. Mickey was a
horse of this class, and I used to say of him that, however he might
be dragged out with fatigue, under fire he moved like a steam engine
on steel springs, and that any coward could be a hero on his back.
Even wounds had no power to daunt him. He was struck repeatedly
and very dangerously, but it never dampened his martial ardor at all.
He was withal a horse of great intelligence and sensibility, as stories
I have yet to tell of him will show.</p>
          <p>There were only two important movements of the Federal forces
in Virginia which intervened between Mine Run and the opening of
the great campaign of 1864, and neither of them requires extended
comment from me. The first was the pushing of a corps across the
Rapidan, at Morton's Ford, immediately in front of the Howitzers. I
cannot recall the exact date—though I think it was early in February
—or what corps it was; nor was the object or purpose of the
movement at all clear. It may have been with the view of
ascertaining whether General Lee had recently detached and sent
off to other fields any considerable bodies of troops; or it may have
been thought that the main body of his infantry was encamped so
far back of the lines that the artillery on
<pb id="stiles236" n="236"/>
the river and its small infantry support could be snapped up before
adequate reinforcement could reach them. But if such an opportunity
ever existed, the invaders did not act with vigor in availing
themselves of it. The Howitzers maintained a determined front, the
infantry arrived and poured into the works, and the Federals, after
suffering some loss, withdrew, leaving the object of the movement
shrouded in mystery, and returned across the river.</p>
          <p>I may be pardoned for relating in this connection an amusing
flurry of my good friend, General Ewell, which forced
me for a few moments into rather an awkward position.
The General was somewhat excited over the length of time
the troops took to enter the works after getting upon the
ground, and particularly over the performance of a stiff old
Georgia colonel, whose regiment was facing the works and
who was actually side-stepping it to the right, to clear the
right flank of another regiment that had just entered the
works, and this while the enemy was advancing up the slope
in our front, and there was not a man in the lines to our
right.</p>
          <p>The General was storming at the colonel, and I, sitting on my
horse near-by, could not repress a titter. Suddenly “Old Dick” turned
to me and exclaimed:</p>
          <p>“Mr. Stiles, for the Lord's sake, take that regiment and put it into
the works!”</p>
          <p>Somewhat startled, I asked, “Do you really mean that, General?”</p>
          <p>“Of course I do!”</p>
          <p>Putting spurs to my horse, I trotted down the line of the regiment,
calling out as I reached its right flank, “Right face, forward,
run—march!” In a moment or so I had the men in the works, and returning,
reached the General just as the old colonel got there and tendered his
sword. General Ewell declined to receive the sword, ordered him
back to his command, and turning to me said:— </p>
          <p>“Do you still insist, sir, that you don't know tactics enough to
justify your being promoted?”</p>
          <p>The other movement was what is generally known as “the
Dahlgren raid,” which started in three co-operating cavalry
<pb id="stiles237" n="237"/>
columns, under Kilpatrick, Dahlgren and Custer, about the last of
February, 1864, having Richmond for its objective, with the intention
to sack and burn the city and kill the prominent Confederate officials.
The history of the expedition is familiar. I did not come into personal
contact with it in any way, and it cannot therefore be said to fall
within the domain of reminiscence. If, however, the generally-accepted version
of the famous “Dahlgren orders” be correct,— 
which would seem to be beyond question,—then it would be mild
characterization to term them “infamous!”</p>
          <p>It is a pleasure in this connection to note that General Lee's
adjutant-general has put on record the statement that “The
disclaimer of General Meade was most candid and emphatic.”</p>

Attrition—Its Effect Upon the Spirit of Lee's Army—An Artilleryman of
That Army in Campaign Trim—Sundown Prayer-meetings—The Wilderness an

Jackson—Longstreet Struck Down.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>Without recanting the statement that Chancellorsville is the most
brilliant of Lee's single battles, I do not hesitate to say that in my
opinion—that is, if and so far as I am entitled to an opinion on the
subject—the campaign of 1864, from the Wilderness to Cold Harbor,
inclusive, is the greatest of all Lee's campaigns—incomparably the
greatest exhibition of generalship and soldiership ever given by the
great leader and his devoted followers.</p>
          <p>Manifestly, one of the indispensable elements in any estimate of
this campaign is the man now, for the first time, opposed to us. I do
not propose to enter upon any extended discussion or analysis of
General Grant's powers. In common with the majority of the more
intelligent soldiers of the Army of Northern Virginia, I thought and
think well of him as a soldier, both as to character and capacity. We
all felt that he behaved handsomely, both to General Lee and to his
men, at Appomattox, and that, later, in standing between Lee and his
leading officers and the threatened prosecutions for treason, he
exhibited strong manhood and sense of right. Many of us, too, have
heard of other instances in his career of a rough chivalry always
attractive to men.</p>
          <p>Just before the surrender, on my way to Petersburg as a prisoner
of war, I was standing on the roadside near General Custis Lee when
he was shocked by a report of the death of
<pb id="stiles239" n="239"/>
his mother. I reminded him that, at such times, the wildest rumors
were apt to be in circulation, and suggested his applying, by field
telegraph, to Grant for leave to go to Richmond to ascertain the truth.
He did so, and at once received leave, with transportation to
Richmond. Upon finding there was nothing in the rumor, he reported
promptly at the office of the provost marshal, but was there told that
orders had been sent by General Grant that General Custis Lee
should not be received as a prisoner of war, and he never succeeded
in getting back into prison or any sort of captivity, though he made
earnest efforts to do so.</p>
          <p>As to Grant's grit and determination, all his predecessors together
did not possess as much of these manly qualities, and we used to
hear fine tales, too, of his imperturbability; for instance, that soon
after he crossed the Rapidan in '64, when some one dashed up to his
headquarters and announced with great excitement the capture of his
pontoons, every one else seemed to be shattered; but Grant
deliberately removed his cigar from his mouth, blew a very fine
smoke wreath or ring, and said quietly, “If I beat General Lee I sha'n't
want any pontoons; and if General Lee beats me I can take all the
men I intend to take back across the river on a log.”</p>
          <p>As to his capacity and our estimate of it, we did not think much of
him as a strategist, but we did credit him with the vigor and
trenchancy of mind that cut right through to the only plan upon
which, as I believe, we ever could have been overcome—and the
nerve to adhere to that plan relentlessly, remorsely to the very end,
in spite of all the suffering and
shrinking and weeping of the people. That plan was the
simple but terrible one of <hi rend="italics">attrition</hi>. As Colonel Taylor says:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>If one hundred and forty thousand men are made to grapple in a death
struggle with sixty thousand men; of the former, twenty thousand should
survive the total annihilation of the latter, even though the price exacted for
such destruction be in the ratio of two to one. Behold the theory of the Federal
commander and an epitome of his construction of strategy, as exemplified on
the sanguinary field extending from the Wilderness to James River.</p>
          </q>
          <pb id="stiles240" n="240"/>
          <p>But there were two other subordinate or rather preparatory points
that were indispensable to the efficient working of this scheme, and
these also were settled by Grant, as we understood at the time,
before he would consent to take charge of the main Federal army,
the Army of the Potomac. These points were, <hi rend="italics">first,</hi> that he should
have all the men he wanted to fight the Army of Northern Virginia,
and to that end should control all the armies and levies of the Union,
as well as have access to all the recruiting grounds of the world; and
<hi rend="italics">second,</hi> that the Confederate armies should not be recruited from the
only ground from which they could possibly draw reinforcements— 
the military prisons of the North—and to this end there should be no
exchange of prisoners; that he did not wish to be reinforced from a
source that must give Lee man for man with him; that it would be
cheaper and more merciful in the end that Northern soldiers should
starve and rot in Southern prisons, the Confederate authorities, as
he well knew, not having the resources to prevent this result. And
so he held right on to—Appomattox.</p>
          <p>If any one deems this a shallow or weak or self-evident scheme,
then I for one do not agree with him. It is not the scheme or plan of a
great military genius, and it is one as to the moral justification of
which I feel serious question; but upon this basis, such as it is, we
all felt Grant's power, and I for one am willing to admit his greatness.</p>
          <p>So much for the new theory of the struggle and the iron-nerved
and iron-souled man who had now taken charge of its enforcement,
and at the same time of our old antagonist, the Army of the
Potomac.</p>
          <p>What effect, if any, did the new scheme, so far as it was divulged
or foreshadowed, have upon the spirits of our soldiery before the
first shot was fired? I find my comrades differ radically as to this—I
mean the more intelligent, observant and thoughtful of them, those
whose views upon such a subject should be worth most. Willy
Dame, one of the best men of the old battery,—No. 4 at the fourth
gun, now the Rev. William M. Dame, D. D., of Baltimore, Md.,—who
has written a charming reminiscence or personal narrative
<pb id="stiles241" n="241"/>
of this campaign, which ought to be in print, is emphatic in
stating that the same old familiar spirit of lighthearted jollity and
fun characterized the men of the battery, and of the commands they
encountered and passed on the 4th and 5th of May, as we all
poured from our winter quarters down into the Wilderness fight.</p>
          <p>Billy, on the contrary,—my Billy, who has already appeared
frequently in these reminiscences,—is of very different mind and
memory touching this point. His recollection is that he was deeply
impressed with the change, and as he had just made his way back
from furlough through the army,
and passed the night with an infantry regiment from his
own county that contained many of his former schoolmates
and friends and neighbors, he had enjoyed rather unusual
opportunities for testing the matter. He did not detect any
depression, or apprehension of disaster, or weakness of
pluck or purpose; but he says he did miss the bounding,
buoyant spirit, the effervescent outbursts, the quips, the
jests, the jokes, the jollities, such as had usually
characterized the first spring rousings of the army and the first
meetings and minglings of the different commands as they
shouted their tumultuous way to battle. He says that there seems
to have sifted through the ranks the conviction that the
struggle ahead of us was of a different character from any
we had experienced in the post—a sort of premonition of the
definite mathematical calculation, in whose hard, unyielding
grip it was intended our future should be held and crushed.</p>
          <p>Billy mentions as a fact, which tends to demonstrate that his
analysis of the views and feelings of the men is correct, that every
man in our battery, who was absent on furlough the 1st of May, '64,
returned instantly, some of them having just reached home. I cannot
forbear mentioning that Billy was one of these latter, and my
youngest brother, who had joined us from Georgia some months
before, another. Some of these men arrived before we left camp at
Morton's Ford; others walked many hours, following the solemn
sound of the firing, and found us in the midst of the sombre
Wilderness, and two at bloody Spottsylvania. One of these two, a
Petersburg boy, was delayed because of having fought
<pb id="stiles242" n="242"/>
at home one day under Beauregard against Butler. To this I may add
the fact that another man of the battery, wounded during the
campaign, apologized humbly to the captain for the imprudence
which led to his wound, because, as he said, he well understood
what the loss of one man meant to us now.</p>
          <p>Upon the whole, while not formally deciding, as the Supreme
Court of Texas recently did in a telegraph case,—as to the inherent
difference between “Willy and Billy,”—yet I am inclined to think in
this particular that Billy is right—that in the spring of 1864 there was
very generally diffused throughout the army a more or less definite
realization or consciousness that a new stage in the contest had
been reached and a new theory broached; the mathematical theory
that if one army outnumbers another more than two to one, and the
larger can be indefinitely reinforced and the smaller not at all, then if
the stronger side will but make up its mind to stand all the killing the
weaker can do, and will keep it so made up, there can be but one
result. Billy says the realization of this new order of things did not
affect the resolution of the men, but that it did affect their spirits. I
can only say I believe he is exactly correct.</p>
          <p>Willy Dame, in his reminiscences above mentioned, gives a
graphic account of the break up on the 4th of May of the winter
camp of the Howitzers at Morton's Ford, in the course of which he
presents this excellent picture of the full dress of a Confederate
artilleryman in campaign fighting trim:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>In less than two hours after the order was given, the wagon was
gone and the men left in “campaign trim.” This meant that each man
had one blanket, one small haversack, one change of underclothes,
a canteen, cup and plate of tin, a knife and fork, and the clothes in which he
stood. When ready to march, the blanket, rolled lengthwise, the ends
brought together and strapped, hung from left shoulder across under
right arm; the haversack—furnished with towel, soap, comb, knife and
fork in various pockets, a change of underclothes in the main division,
and whatever rations we happened to have in the other—hung on the
<pb id="stiles243" n="243"/>
left hip; the canteen, cup and plate, tied together, hung on the right;
toothbrush, at will, stuck in two button holes of jacket or in haversack;
tobacco bag hung to a breast button, pipe in pocket. In this rig, into
which a fellow could get in just two minutes from a state of rest, the
Confederate soldier considered himself all right and all ready for anything;
in this he marched and in this he fought. Like the terrapin, “all
he had he carried on his back,” and this “all” weighed about seven or
eight pounds.</p>
          </q>
          <p>It will be noted that I have prefaced this catalogue by the
expression “full dress.” If I may be allowed, I would criticise the list
as a little too full. I cannot recall ever having eaten out of a plate, or
with a knife and fork, or having owned any or either of these articles
while a private soldier, certainly not after the first few months of the
war. And even after I became an officer, as adjutant of the battalion,
I never carried plate, knife, or fork with me on my horse after the
campaign opened. Colonel Cabell and I often ate out of the same tin
cup or frying pan. Indeed, I carried nothing on my horse save a pair
of very contracted saddle pockets and the cape of my overcoat, and
Colonel Cabell carried his pockets, his overcoat, and an oil cloth.
We slept together, lying on his oil cloth, he wearing his overcoat
when cold, and both of us covered with my cape.</p>
          <p>Another feature of Willy Dame's account of the Howitzer
good-by to winter quarters, at the opening of the campaign of '64, is well
worthy of record. He says that the very last public and general act
of the men was, of their own account, to gather for a farewell
religious service,—Bible reading, singing of a hymn, prayer, words
of exhortation and cheer,—and that this meeting closed with a solemn
resolution to hold such a service daily during the campaign when practicable,
and as near as might be to the sunset hour, and then he adds:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>But however circumstanced, in battle, on the battle-line, in intervals of
quiet, or otherwise, we held that prayer hour nearly every day, at sunset,
during the entire campaign. And some of us thought and think, that the
strange exemption our battery experienced, our little loss in the
<pb id="stiles244" n="244"/>
midst of unnumbered perils and incessant service during that awful
campaign, was that in answer to our prayers the God of Battles “covered our
heads in the day of battle,” and was merciful to us, because we “called upon
Him.” If any think this is a “fond fancy,”<hi rend="italics"> we don't.</hi></p>
          </q>
          <p>Lee's ready acceptance of the gage of battle flung down by Grant,
his daring and unexpected attack upon him in the thickets of the
Wilderness, while it appeared to be the height of reckless audacity,
was really the dictate of the wisest and most balanced prudence. In
such a country the advantage of Grant's overwhelming
preponderance of numbers was reduced to a <hi rend="italics">minimum,</hi> and his great
parks of artillery were absolutely useless. Besides, to retire and fall
back upon an inner line was just what Grant desired and expected
Lee to do, and would have been in exact furtherance of Grant's plans.
In this instance, as usual, Lee's audacity meant the exercise of his
unerring military instinct and judgment.</p>
          <p>As just intimated, the Wilderness was essentially, yes, almost
exclusively, an infantry fight, and we of the artillery saw, in fact, next
to nothing of it, but hovered around its edge, thrilled and solemnized
by the awful roar and swell and reverberation of the musketry and
by the procession of wounded men and prisoners that streamed
past.</p>
          <p>The first incident of the march or the battle-field that impressed
itself upon my memory is that early on the morning of the 5th of
May, while riding ahead of the battalion, I came upon my old friend,
General Ewell, crouching over a low fire at a “cross roads” in the
forest, no one at the time being nigh except the two horses, and a
courier who had charge of them and the two crutches. The old hero,
who had lost a leg in battle, could not mount his horse alone and
never rode without at least one attendant, who always followed
close after him, carrying his “quadruped pegs,” or rather his tripod
pegs. The General was usually very thin and pale, unusually so that
morning,—but bright-eyed and alert. He was accustomed to ride a
flea-bitten gray named Rifle, who was singularly like him—so far as a
horse could be like a man. I knew Rifle well and noted that both he
and his master
<pb id="stiles245" n="245"/>
looked a little as if they had been up all night and had not had
breakfast.</p>
          <p>I have before mentioned the General's great kindness to me.
When we were alone he often called me “My child,” and he
embarrassed me by repeated recommendations for promotion. We
were captured very late in the war, in the same battle and about the
same time, and he not only honored and touched me greatly by
expressing on the field and in the presence of several general
officers, also prisoners, his high estimate of and strong affection for
me, but he wrote me in prison one or two kind letters giving me
earnest advice as to my immediate future.</p>
          <p>On this morning he asked me to dismount and take a cup of coffee
with him. He was a great cook. I remember on one occasion, later in
the war, I met him in the outer defenses of Richmond, and he told me
some one had sent him a turkey leg which he was going to “devil;”
that he was strong on that particular dish; that his staff would be
away, and I must come around that evening and share it with him. I
willingly accepted on both occasions, and on both greatly enjoyed a
chat with the General and the unaccustomed treat. On this
Wilderness morning, while we were drinking our coffee, I asked him
if he had any objection to telling me his orders, and he answered
briskly, “No, sir; none at all—just the orders I like—to go right down
the plank road and strike the enemy wherever I find him.”</p>
          <p>It is glory enough for any man to have been Stonewall Jackson's
trusted lieutenant. Ewell simply worshiped his great commander;
indeed, it was this worship that led him to the highest. He worshiped
Jackson, and yet they were not exactly kindred spirits. The following
little story, which I quote from Dr. McGuire, but which I heard many
times before reading it in print, well illustrates one of the points of
difference between them.</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>At the battle of Port Republic an officer commanding a regiment of Federal
soldiers and riding a snow-white horse was very conspicuous
for his gallantry. He frequently exposed himself to the fire of our men in
the
most reckless way. So splendid was this man's courage that General Ewell, one
of the most chivalrous gentlemen I ever knew, at some
<pb id="stiles246" n="246"/>
risk to his own life, rode down the line and called to his men not to shoot the
man on the white horse. After a while, however, the officer and the white
horse went down. A day or two after, when General Jackson learned of the
incident, he sent for General Ewell and told him not to do such a thing again;
that this was no ordinary war, and the brave and gallant Federal officers were
the very kind that must be killed. “Shoot the brave officers and the cowards
will run away and take the men with them!”</p>
          </q>
          <p>I do not say Jackson was not right, but I do say that in this
double picture dear Old Dick's is the most lovable.</p>
          <p>It is a little singular that though nominally attached to his
command longer than any other, yet I probably had less
acquaintance and association with General Longstreet than with any
other of the more prominent generals of the Confederate army in
Virginia. Indeed I do not recall ever having spoken to him or having
heard him utter so much as one word. True, he was several times sent
off on detached service, upon which we did not accompany him, and
while nominally of his corps we had just been for some five months
under Ewell's command; yet, after making allowance for all this, I
could not but feel that there must be something in the nature of the
man himself to account for the fact that I knew so little of him.
Colonel Freemantle, of the Cold Stream Guards, who wrote a very
charming diary entitled, I think, “Two Months in the Confederate
Lines,” says, however, if I rightly remember, that the relations
between Longstreet and his staff were exceptionally pleasant, and
reminded him more of those which obtained in the British service
than any others he observed in America. In this Wilderness fight I
was suddenly brought in contact with a scene which greatly affected
my conception of the man under the regalia of the general.</p>
          <p>It may not have been generally observed that Jackson and
Longstreet were both struck down in the Wilderness, just one year
apart, each at the crisis of the most brilliant and, up to the moment of
his fall, the most successful movement of his career as a soldier, and
each by the fire of his own men. I had been sent forward, perhaps to
look for some place where we might get into the fight, when I observed
an excited
<pb id="stiles247" n="247"/>
gathering some distance back of the lines, and pressing toward
it I heard that General Longstreet had just been shot down and was
being put into an ambulance. I could not learn anything definite as to
the character of his wound, but only that it was serious—some said he
was dead. When the ambulance moved off, I followed it a little way,
being anxious for trustworthy news of the General. The members of
his staff surrounded the vehicle, some riding in front, some on one
side and some on the other, and some behind. One, I remember,
stood upon the rear step of the ambulance, seeming to desire to be
as near him as possible. I never on any occasion during the four
years of the war saw a group of officers and gentlemen more deeply
distressed. They were literally bowed down with grief. All of them
were in tears. One, by whose side I rode for some distance, was
himself severely hurt, but he made no allusion to his wound, and I do
not believe he felt it. It was not alone the general they admired who
had been shot down—it was, rather, the man they loved.</p>
          <p>I rode up to the ambulance and looked in. They had taken off
Longstreet's hat and coat and boots. The blood had paled out of his
face and its somewhat gross aspect was gone. I noticed how white
and dome-like his great forehead looked and, with scarcely less
reverent admiration, how spotless white his socks and his fine gauze
undervest, save where the black red gore from his breast and
shoulder had stained it. While I gazed at his massive frame, lying so
still, except when it rocked inertly with the lurch of the vehicle, his
eyelids frayed apart till I could see a delicate line of blue between
them, and then he very quietly moved his unwounded arm and, with
his thumb and two fingers, carefully lifted the saturated undershirt
from his chest, holding it up a moment, and heaved a deep sigh. “He
is not dead,” I said to myself, “and he is calm and entirely master of
the situation—he is both greater and more attractive than I have
heretofore thought him.”</p>
          <p>Some years after the war I read in a newspaper a short paragraph
which brought this scene vividly to my mind. Longstreet, at the
Wilderness, was wounded in the shoulder,
<pb id="stiles248" n="248"/>
fighting Hancock's corps; Hancock had previously been wounded in
the thigh, fighting Longstreet's. One evening while Hancock was in
command in New Orleans, he and Longstreet entered Hancock's
theatre box together. The entire audience rose and burst into
enthusiastic cheers, and refused to be seated or to be quiet until the
two generals advanced together to the front of the box, when
Hancock said: “Ladies and <sic corr="Gentlemen">Genlemen</sic>—I have the pleasure of
presenting to you my friend, General Longstreet, a gentleman to
whom I am indebted for an ungraceful limp, and whom I had the
misfortune to wing in the same contest.”</p>
          <p>Both sides suffered severely in the Wilderness, but except
perhaps upon the basis of Grant's mathematical theory of attrition,
the Confederates got decidedly the best of the fighting. Next came
the race for Spottsylvania Court House, and the checkmate of
Warren's corps by Stuart's dismounted cavalry. Such were the
prominent features of the entire campaign. It was a succession of
death grapples and recoils and races for new position, and several
times during the campaign the race was so close and tense and
clearly defined that we could determine the exact location of the
Federal column by the cloud of dust that overhung and crept along
the horizon parallel to our own advance.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>At Spottsylvania Court House, when the artillery and infantry
arrived and took the place of the gallant cavalrymen, who had saved
the day and the place for us, the guns of our battalion, as I
remember, were the first to reach the field. As adjutant, I had ridden
with the old battery to its selected position, and, these guns in place,
had returned to the column and was aiding in locating another of the
batteries, when the fire upon the Howitzer position became so heavy
that I galloped back to see how they were faring and if they needed
anything. As I rode rapidly in rear of the first gun of the battery, at
which my youngest brother, Eugene, had been made a driver, I noted
that the fire had slackened considerably, but that one of his horses
had been killed; that he had very practically pulled the dead horse
around into proper position, and he and the driver of the other team
were fast constructing quite a passable earthwork over and about
him. Just as I observed this, “Genie” caught sight of me, and
springing up, shouted after me, in fine voice and good old Georgia
nursery phrase:</p>
          <p>“Bubba, Bubba, I wasn't scared a bit—not a bit!”</p>
          <p>A line of stalwart veteran infantry was lying down behind the
guns, and as the plucky, but uninitiated, boy shouted this
reassuring greeting, several of these seasoned old fellows raised up
partly and looked around, and one of them
<pb id="stiles250" n="250"/>
called out, “Where's that fellow that wasn't scared a bit? He must be
some greenhorn or fool!” And then there was a burst of laughter at
the lad's expense. But I shouted back to him that he musn't mind
them; that they were just guying him, and were glad enough to be
behind his gun and his dead horse, too.</p>
          <p>At one of the positions the Howitzers took on these lines I
witnessed a striking scene, or rather the climax of it—the rest was told
me shortly after I reached the guns.</p>
          <p>There was a tall, black-haired, pale-faced boy in the company,
named Cary Eggleston, a cousin, I think, of George Cary Eggleston,
whom he strongly resembled. He was No. 1 at the third gun; said to
be the best No. 1 in the battery, and even before his heroic end,
known to be a fellow of most gallant spirit. He was one of that small
class of men who really love a fight for its own sake. He was not yet
fully developed, and ordinarily appeared rather gangling and
loose-jointed, but it required only the thrill of action to inspire him and to
make his movements as graceful as they were powerful and effective.
His “manual of the piece” was really superb when his gun was hotly
engaged.</p>
          <p>At the very height of a fierce flurry his left arm was nearly
severed from his body by a fragment of shell. At that moment a
comrade, who had returned while on furlough and had walked in all
nearly forty miles to, reach us, came running up to his gun. The
disabled No. 1 handed him the rammer, saying:</p>
          <p>“Here, Johnny, take it! You haven't had any fun yet.” When he
had thus surrendered his scepter and appointed his own successor,
he had a crude tourniquet applied to his arm; but insisted upon
walking to the field hospital, refusing a litter or even a man to
accompany him.</p>
          <p>I had been with another of the batteries of the battalion, but
hearing the rapid firing about the Howitzer position, was galloping
down there, when I saw Eggleston walking out. He had his
unwounded side toward me, and I called to him to know where and
why he was going. He answered by turning his other side and
holding up the stump, from which his shattered arm hung by ragged
shirt sleeve and
<pb id="stiles251" n="251"/>
torn tendon, and then he shook the clenched fist of his sound arm
toward the Federal lines, shouting to me that he would soon be back
to fight them with that. The unconquerable boy died the following
evening.</p>
          <p>I have spoken several times of the “Howitzer position” in the
Spottsylvania lines. Up to the 12th of May I think only two of their
guns were on the main or front line, and even on the 12th the four
were not together. Prior to the 12th two rifles of this battery and two
of the Troupe Artillery were some distance back upon a hill, having
been so placed with a view of engaging certain of the enemy's
batteries to the relief of our front line, and of having a wider range
and sweep of the attacking lines and columns.</p>
          <p>One evening, about the 9th of May, I was riding into the position
of some of our guns on the front line and passing through a little
copse of woods, there being at the time quite a sharp musketry fire
on the lines, and bullets clinking against the resinous boles of the
pine trees about me, when suddenly my horse, Mickey Free, was
shot, the ball making a loud slap when it struck. He sprang aside, but
settled right down again to his course, and it was some little time
before I could find any trace of the shot. I soon discovered,
however, that the ball had cut into one of my saddle pockets, but not
through it, and there it was, inside. A moment later he was struck
again, and this time reared and plunged violently. Glancing around I
saw that the ball had entered back of my legs about the mid line of
his body one side and had come out about opposite on the other,
and, as he persisted in lying down and rolling, I concluded that the
poor fellow was mortally hurt, and sprang off, endeavoring to
remove saddle and bridle, which I finally accomplished, with some
difficulty and at some peril of being kicked or rolled upon. I looked at
him a few moments in great distress, but the fire becoming really
heavy, I threw saddle and bridle across my shoulder and toddled
into the works on foot.</p>
          <p>My recollection is that when the attack had been repulsed I
went back to see if Mickey was dead, or if I could do anything for
him, but that he had disappeared; that I could not track him far and
soon gave it up, concluding I would never
<pb id="stiles252" n="252"/>
see him again. I certainly laid down that night one of <hi rend="italics">“Lee's
Miserables,”</hi> as we used to term ourselves, after reading Victor
Hugo's great novel—a soldier edition of his works in Confederate
“sheep's wool paper” having been distributed largely throughout the
army the preceding winter. Judge of my surprise and delight at
learning, early in the morning, that Mickey had in some mysterious
way found our headquarters wagon and was being cared for there,
and that he did not seem to be contemplating immediate death, but
on the contrary had drunk copiously and eaten sparingly, as was a
Confederate artillery horse's duty to do. As soon as I could get off I
went back to see the dear old fellow, and there he was, as good as
ever, except that a rope appeared to have been drawn around the
lower part of his body, just under the skin, and a little back of the
proper line of the saddle girth. The Minie bullet had of course been
deflected, and had passed beneath the skin, half around his body,
without penetrating the cavity.</p>
          <p>My dear friend, Willy Dame, in his reminiscences already quoted,
says some very pleasant and complimentary things of “our old
adjutant.” These things I do not pretend to gainsay or deny. It
would be easy to deny and not hard, perhaps, to disprove them; but
motive is lacking. Why should I? The fact is, I shouldn't and I won't.
But there are other things, or at least there is one other thing he
says, and says elaborately, with date and circumstance,—the date is
the 10th of May—calculated to bring my gray hair into ridicule and
contempt, which, of course, I deny, even if I cannot disprove. The
difficulty of proving a negative is well understood. I certainly go as
far as this—I have no recollection whatever of such occurrence or
utterance as he mentions, barring the nasty performances of those
twenty-pounder Parrott shells. I recollect a good many of these quite
similar to what Willy describes. But here is what he says:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>Robert Stiles, the adjutant of the battalion, who had been until lately a
member of our battery and was very devoted to it and his comrades in it, had
come to the line to see how we were getting on, and gave us news of other
parts of the line. He, Beau Barnes, and others of us, were
<pb id="stiles253" n="253"/>
standing by our guns talking, when a twenty-pounder Parrott shell came grazing
just over our guns, passed on, and about forty yards behind us struck a pine
tree about two and a half to three feet in diameter. The shell had turned.
It struck that big tree sideways and cut it entirely off, and threw it from the
stump. It fell in an upright position, struck the ground, stood for an instant
and then came crashing down. It was a very creepy suggestion of what that shell
might have done to one of us. A few moments after, another struck the ground
right by us and ricochetted. After it passed us, as was frequently the case, we
caught sight of it and followed its upward flight until it seemed to be going
straight to the sky.</p>
            <p>Stiles said, “There it goes, as though flung by the hand of a giant.” Beau
Barnes, who was not poetical, exclaimed, “Giant be darned; there ain't any
giant can fling 'em like that!” He was right!</p>
          </q>
          <p>If the foregoing was not written with malicious intent to expose me
to the scorn of all sensible and practical people, then my belief is
that Willy Dame dreamed the absurd story; but if Barnes and I did
speak under the circumstances mentioned, and both are correctly
quoted, then I admit the redoubtable “Beau” had decidedly the best
of it, and I apologize humbly.</p>
          <p>The 10th of May, '64, was preeminently a day of battle
with the Army of Northern Virginia. I know, of course,
that the 12th is commonly regarded as the pivotal day, the
great day, and the Bloody Angle as the pivotal place, the
great place, of the Spottsylvania fights, and that for an hour
or so, along the sides and base of that angle, the musketry
fire is said to have been heavier than it ever was at any other
place in all the world, or for any other hour in all the tide
of time. But for frequency and pertinacity of attack, and
repetition and constancy of repulse, I question if the left of
General Lee's line on the 10th of May, 1864, has ever been
surpassed. I cannot pretend to identify the separate attacks
or to distinguish between them, but should think there
must have been at least a dozen of them. One marked
feature was that, while fresh troops poured to almost every
charge the same muskets in the hands of the same men met
the first attack in the morning and the last at night; and
so it was that the men who in the early morning were so full
of fight and fun that they leaped upon the breastworks and
<pb id="stiles254" n="254"/>
shouted to the retiring Federals to come a little closer the next time,
as they did not care to go so far after the clothes and shoes and
muskets—were so weary and worn and heavy at night that they
could scarcely be roused to meet the charging enemy.</p>
          <p>The troops supporting the two Napoleon guns of the Howitzers
were, as I remember, the Seventh (or Eighth) Georgia and the First
Texas. Toward the close of the day everything seemed to have
quieted down, in a sort of implied truce. There was absolutely no
fire, either of musketry or cannon. Our weary, hungry infantry
stacked arms and were cooking their mean and meagre little rations.
Someone rose up, and looking over the works—it was shading
down a little toward the dark—cried out: “Hello! What's this? Why,
here come our men on a run, from—no, by Heavens! it's the
Yankees!” and before any one could realize the situation, or even
start toward the stacked muskets, the Federal column broke over the
little work, between our troops and their arms, bayonetted or shot
two or three who were asleep before they could even awake, and
dashed upon the men crouched over their low fires—with cooking
utensils instead of weapons in their hands. Of course they ran. What
else could they do?</p>
          <p>The Howitzers—only the left, or Napoleon section, was there— 
sprang to their guns, swinging them around to bear inside our lines,
double-shotted them with canister and fairly spouted it into the
Federals, whose formation had been broken in the rush and the
plunge over the works, and who seemed to be somewhat massed
and huddled and hesitating, but only a few rods away. Quicker
almost than I can tell it, our infantry supports, than whom there were
not two better regiments in the army, had rallied and gotten to their
arms, and then they opened out into a V-shape, and fairly tore the
head of the Federal column to pieces. In an incredibly short time
those who were able to do so turned to fly and our infantry were
following them over the intrenchments; but it is doubtful whether
this would have been the result had it not been for the prompt and
gallant action of the artillery.</p>
          <pb id="stiles255" n="255"/>
          <p>There was an old Captain Hunter,—it seems difficult to
determine whether of the Texas or the Georgia regiment,—had the
handle of his frying pan in his hand, holding the pan over the hot
coals, with his little slice of meat sizzling in it, when the enemy broke
over. He had his back to them, and the first thing he knew his men
were scampering past him like frightened sheep. He had not been
accustomed to that style of movement among them, and he sprang
up and tore after them, showering them with hot grease and hotter
profanity, but never letting go his frying pan. On the contrary, he
slapped right and left with the sooty, burning bottom, distributing
his favors impartially on Federal and Confederate alike—several of
his own men bearing the black and ugly brand on their cheeks for a
long time after and occasionally having to bear also the captain's
curses for having made him lose his meat that evening. He actually
led the counter-charge, leaping upon the works, wielding and
waving his frying pan, at once as sword and banner.</p>
          <p>When it became evident that the attack had failed, I suggested to
the chaplain—who happened to be with the Howitzer guns,
perhaps for that sundown prayer meeting which Willy Dame
mentioned—that there might be some demand for his ministrations
where the enemy had broken over; so we walked up there and
found their dead and dying piled higher than the works themselves.
It was almost dark, but as we drew near we saw a wounded Federal
soldier clutch the pantaloons of Captain Hunter, who at that
moment was passing by, frying pan in hand, and heard him ask,
with intense eagerness: “Can you pray, sir? Can you pray?” The
old captain looked down at him with a peculiar expressing and
pulled away, saying, “No, my friend, I don't wish you any harm
now, but praying's not exactly my trade.”</p>
          <p>I said to the chaplain, “Let's go to that man.” As we came up he
caught my pants in the same way and uttered the same words: “Can
you pray, sir? Can you pray?” I bent over the poor fellow, turned
back his blouse, and saw that a large canister shot had passed
through his chest at such a point that the wound must necessarily
prove mortal,
<pb id="stiles256" n="256"/>
and that soon. We both knelt down by him, and I took his hand in
mine and said: “My friend, you haven't much time left for prayer, but
if you will say after me just these simple words, with heart as well as
lips, all will be well with you: ‘God have mercy on me, a sinner, for
Jesus Christ's sake.’ ”</p>
          <p>I never saw such intensity in human gaze, nor ever heard such
intensity in human voice, as in the gaze and voice of that dying man
as he held my hand and looked into my face, repeating the simple,
awful, yet reassuring words I had dictated. He uttered them again
and again, with the death rattle in his throat and the death tremor in
his frame, until some one shouted, “They are coming again!” and we
broke away and ran down to the guns. It proved to be a false alarm,
and we returned immediately—but he was dead, yes, dead and
half-stripped; but I managed to get my hand upon his blouse a moment
and looked at the buttons. He was from the far-off State of Maine.</p>
          <p>It was long before I slept that night. It had been an unparalleled
day. The last hour, especially, had brought together elements so
diverse and so tremendous, that heart and brain were overstrained in
attempting to harmonize and assimilate them. This was the first time
in all my career as a soldier that I had heard from a dying man on the
battlefield any expression that indicated even so much as a belief in
the existence of any other world than this.</p>
          <p>What did it all mean? When that Federal soldier and I had our brief
conference and prayer on the dividing line between the two worlds,
neither of us felt the slightest tremor of uncertainty about it. To both
of us the other world was as certainly existing as this, and infinitely
greater. Would I ever see him again? If so, would both of us realize
that our few moments of communion and of prayer had meant more
perhaps than all the struggles, that day, of the great embattled
armies? I went to sleep at last that night, as I shall go this night,
feeling that it all was and is too much for me, and committing myself
and all my perplexities to the One Being who is “sufficient for these
things,” and able to lead us safely through such a world and such
experiences.</p>
          <pb id="stiles257" n="257"/>
          <p>It is an interesting coincidence that on this very day, the 10th of
May, '64, at the point christened two days later as “The Bloody
Angle,” the Second Howitzers rendered a service even more
important and distinguished perhaps than the gallant conduct of the
First Company just recorded; a service which, in the opinion of
prominent officers thoroughly acquainted with the facts and every
way competent and qualified to judge, was deemed to have saved
General Lee's army from being cut in twain.</p>
          <p>There is one other feature or incident of the closing fight of the
10th of May which may be worthy of record, not alone because of its
essentially amusing nature, but also because of a very pleasant
after-clap or reminder of it later on. There were two men in the First
Howitzers, older than most of us, of exceptionally high character and
courage, who, because of the deafness of the one and the lack of a
certain physical flexibility and adaptation in the other, were not well
fitted for regular places in the detachment or service about the gun.
For a time one or both of them took the position of driver, but this
scarcely seemed fitting, and finally they were both classed as
“supernumeraries,” but with special duties as our company
ambulance corps, having charge, under the surgeon of the battalion,
of our company litters and our other simple medical and surgical
outfit. For this and other reasons, the elder of these two good and
gritty soldiers was always called “Doctor.”</p>
          <p>When the break occurred these two men, always on the extremest
forward verge of our battle line, were overwhelmed with amazement,
not so much at the irruption of the enemy, as at what seemed to be
the demoralized rout of the Georgians and Texans. They ran in
among them asking explanation of their conduct, then appealing to
them and exhorting them—the Doctor in most courteous and lofty
phrase: “Gentlemen, what does this mean? You certainly are not
flying before the enemy! Turn, for God's sake; turn, and drive them
out!” Then, with indignant outburst: “Halt! You infernal cowards!”
and suiting the action to the word, these choleric cannoneers tore
the carrying poles out of their litters, and sprang among and in front
of the fugitives, be-laboring
<pb id="stiles258" n="258"/>
them right and left, till they turned, and then turned with
them, following up the retreating enemy with their wooden spears.</p>
          <p>Some weeks later, after we had reached Petersburg, in the nick of
time to keep Burnside out of the town, and had taken up what
promised to be a permanent position and were just dozing off into
our first nap in forty-eight hours, an infantry command passing by,
in the darkness, stumbled over the trail handspikes of our guns and
broke out in the usual style:</p>
          <p>“Oh, of course! Here's that infernal artillery again; always in the
way, blocking the roads by day and tripping us up at night. What
battery is this, any way?”</p>
          <p>Some fellow, not yet clean gone in slumber, grunted out:</p>
          <p>“First Company, Richmond Howitzers.”</p>
          <p>What a change! Instantly there was a perfect chorus of greetings
from the warm-hearted Texans.</p>
          <p>“Boys, here are the Howitzers! Where's your old deaf man? Trot
out your old Doctor. They're the jockeys for us. We are going to
stay right here. We won't get a chance to run if these plucky
Howitzer boys are with us.”</p>
          <p>Billy tells me that he remembers, word for word, the last
crisp sentence Col. Stephen D. Lee uttered the morning he
complimented the old battery on the field of Frazier's Farm,
that he said, “Men, hereafter when I want a battery, I'll
know where to get one!” Two years later, at the base of
the Bloody Angle, General Ewell seems to have been of the
same opinion. He held our centre, which had just been
pierced and smashed and his artillery captured. He wanted
guns to stay the rout and steady his men, and he sent to the
extreme left for Cabell's Battalion. I do not mean that the
old battalion, or either of its batteries, was counted among
the most brilliant artillery commands of the army, but I do
claim that the command did have and did deserve the reputation
of “staying where it was put,” and of doing its work
reliably and well.</p>
          <p>The 11th had been a sort of off-day with us, very little business
doing; but the 12th made up for it. As I remember, it was yet early
on the morning of the 12th that we were
<pb id="stiles259" n="259"/>
sent for. We went at once, and did not stand upon the order of our
going, though I think two guns of the Howitzers led the column,
followed by two guns of Carlton's battery, the Troupe Artillery. If I
remember correctly, our other guns occupied positions on the line
from which they could not be withdrawn. As Colonel Cabell and I
rode ahead, as before mentioned in another connection, to learn
precisely where the guns were to be placed, we passed General Lee
on horseback, or he passed us. He had only one or two attendants
with him. His face was more serious than I had ever seen it, but
showed no trace of excitement or alarm.
Numbers of demoralized men were streaming past him and his
voice was deep as the growl of a tempest as he said: “Shame on you,
men; shame on you! Go back to your regiments; go back to your
regiments!”</p>
          <p>I remember thinking at the moment that it was the only time I ever
knew his faintest wish not to be instantly responded to by his
troops; but something I have since read
induces me to question whether he did not refer to some special
rendezvous, somewhere in the rear, appointed for the
remnants of the shattered commands to rally to. Be this as it may,
every soldier of experience knows that when a man
has reached a certain point of demoralization and until he has settled
down again past that point, it is absolutely useless to attempt to
rouse him to a sense of duty or of honor. I have seen many a man
substantially in the condition of the fellow who, as he executed a
flying leap over the musket of the guard threatening to shoot and
crying “Halt!”—called back, “Give any man fifty dollars to halt me,
but can't halt myself!”</p>
          <p>When we came back to our four guns and were leading them to
the lines and the positions selected for them, just
as we were turning down a little declivity, we passed again within a
few feet of General Lee, seated upon his horse on
the crest of the hill, this time entirely alone, not even a courier with
him. I was much impressed with the calmness and perfect poise of
his bearing, though his centre had just been pierced by forty
thousand men and the fate of his army trembles in the balance. He
was completely exposed to the
<pb id="stiles260" n="260"/>
Federal fire, which was very heavy. A half dozen of our men were
wounded in making this short descent. In this connection I have
recently heard from a courier—who, with others, had ridden with the
General to the point where we saw him—that, observing and
remarking upon the peril to which they were subjected, he ordered all
his couriers to protect themselves behind an old brick kiln, some one
hundred and fifty yards to the left, until their services were required,
but refused to go there himself. This habit of exposing himself to fire,
as they sometimes thought, unnecessarily, was the only point in
which his soldiers felt that Lee ever did wrong. The superb stories of
the several occasions during this campaign when his men refused to
advance until he retired, and, with tears streaming down their faces,
led his horse to the rear, are too familiar to justify repetition,
especially as I did not happen to be an eye-witness of either of these
impressive scenes.</p>
          <p>Our guns were put in at the left base of the Salient, and there, in
full sight and but a short distance up the side of the angle, stood
two or three of the guns from which our men had been driven, or at
which they had been captured. The Howitzers had two clumsy iron
three-inch rifles, and Captain McCarthy and I offered, with
volunteers from that company, to draw these captured guns back
into our lines, provided we were allowed to exchange our two iron
guns for two of these, which were brass Napoleons. This would
have given the battery a uniform armament and prevented the
frequent separation of the sections. There was not at the time a
Federal soldier in sight, and some of us walked out to or near these
guns without being fired upon. It might have been a perilous
undertaking, yet I think General Ewell would have given his consent;
but the officer to whose command the guns belonged protested,
saying he would himself
have them drawn off later in the day. If it ever could have been
done, the opportunity was brief; later it became impracticable, and
the guns were permanently lost.</p>
          <p>Barrett, Colonel Cabell's plucky little courier, rode almost into the
works with us, and we had left our horses with
him, close up, but in a position which we thought afforded
<pb id="stiles261" n="261"/>
some protection. In a few moments some one shouted that Barrett
was calling lustily for me. I ran back where I had left him and was
distressed to see my good horse, Mickey, stretched on the ground.
Barrett said he had just been killed by a piece of shell which struck
him in the head. The poor fellow's limbs were still quivering. I could
see no wound of any consequence about the head or anywhere else;
while I was examining him he shuddered violently, sprang up,
snorted a little blood and was again “as good as new.” As soon as
practicable, however, we sent Barrett and the three horses behind
that brick kiln back on the hill, or to some place near by of
comparative safety. I was afraid that Mickey, who seemed to have
“gotten his hand in,” might keep up this trick of getting “killed,” as
Barrett said, once too often. I may as well say right here that the
noble horse got safely through the war, but was captured with his
master at Sailor's Creek.</p>
          <p>When our guns first entered the works, or rather were stationed
on the line just back of the little trench, there seemed to be
comparatively few infantrymen about. One thing that pleased us
greatly was, that our old Mississippi brigade, Barksdale's, or
Humphreys', was supporting us; but it must have been just the end
of their brigade line, and a very thin line it was. We saw nothing of
the major-general of our division. General Rodes, of Ewell's corps,
was the only major-general we saw. He was a man of very striking
appearance, of erect, fine figure and martial bearing. He constantly
passed and repassed in rear of our guns, riding a black horse that
champed his bit and tossed his head proudly, until his neck and
shoulders were flecked with white froth, seeming to be conscious
that he carried Caesar. Rodes' eyes were everywhere, and every now
and then he would stop to attend to some detail of the arrangement of
his line or his troops, and then ride on again, humming to himself and
catching the ends of his long, tawny moustache between his lips.</p>
          <p>It had rained hard all night and was drizzling all day, and
everything was wet, soggy, muddy, and comfortless. General Ewell
made his headquarters not far off, and seemed
<pb id="stiles262" n="262"/>
busy and apprehensive, and we gathered from everything, we
saw and heard, especially from General Lee's taking his position so
near, that he and his generals anticipated a renewal of the attack at or
about this point. From the time of our first approach, stragglers from
various commands had been streaming past. I noticed that most of
them had their arms and did not seem to be very badly shattered, and
I tried hard to induce some of them to turn in and reinforce our thin
infantry line. But they would not hearken to the voice of the charmer,
charming never so wisely, and finally I appealed to General Rodes
and asked him for a detail of men to throw off a short line at right
angles to the works so as to catch and turn in these stragglers. He
readily assented and we soon had a strong, full line, though at first
neither Rodes' own men nor our Mississippians seemed to appreciate
this style of reinforcement.</p>
          <p>One point more, with regard to our experience at the left base of
the Salient, and we have done with the “Bloody Angle.” Every
soldier who was there, if he opens his mouth to speak or takes up his
pen to write, seems to feel it solemnly incumbent upon him to
expatiate upon the fearful fire of musketry. What I have to say about
the matter will doubtless prove surprising and disappointing to
many; but first let me quote Colonel Taylor's account of it, from
pages 130 and 131 of his invaluable work, so frequently referred to:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>* * * The army was thus cut in twain, and the situation was well calculated
to test the skill of its commander and the nerve and courage of the men.
Dispositions were immediately made to repair the breach, and troops were
moved up to the right and left to dispute the further progress of the assaulting
column. Then occurred the most remarkable musketry fire of the war—from the
sides of the Salient, in the possession of the Federals, and the new line
forming the base of the triangle, occupied by the Confederates, poured forth
from continuous lines of hissing fire air incessant, terrific hail of deadly
missiles. No living man nor thing could stand in the doomed space embraced
within those angry lines; even large trees were felled, their trunks cut in
twain by the bullets of small arms.</p>
          </q>
          <p>Every intelligent soldier, on either side, is aware of Colonel
Taylor's deserved reputation for careful and unprejudiced
<pb id="stiles263" n="263"/>
observation and investigation, and for correct and accurate
statement. General Fitz Lee, in his “Life of General Robert E. Lee,” at
p. 335, fully agrees with Colonel Taylor, saying: “The musketry fire,
with its terrific leaden hail, was beyond comparison the heaviest of
the four years of war. In the bitter struggle, trees, large and small,
fell, cut down by bullets.”</p>
          <p>Still, I am bound to say I saw nothing that approached a
justification of these vivid and powerful descriptions. Of course the
fire was at times heavy, but at no time, <hi rend="italics">in front of our position,</hi> did it
approximate, for example, the intensity of the fire during the great
attack at Cold Harbor, a few weeks later. One singular feature of the
matter is that we appear to have been at the very place where this fire
is said to have occurred, and at the very time; for we were sent for by
General Ewell, as I recollect, early on the morning of the 12th, and we
remained at the left base of the Salient and within sight of some of
the captured guns all that day and until the line was moved back out
of the bottom, to the crest of the little ridge above mentioned. The
only explanation I can suggest is that the fighting must have been
much hotter <hi rend="italics">further to the right.</hi></p>
          <p>It may be well just here to explain, while we cannot excuse, the
existence not alone of the great Salient of Spottsylvania, with its
soldier nickname of “Bloody Angle,” and its fearful lesson of
calamity, but also of other like faulty formations in our Confederate
battle lines.</p>
          <p>It was noticeable toward the close of the war what skilful,
practical engineers the rank and file of the Army of Northern Virginia
had become; how quickly and unerringly they detected and how
unsparingly they condemned an untenable line—that is, where they
were unprejudiced critics, as for instance, where fresh troops were
brought in to reinforce or relieve a command already in position. I
seem to hear, even now, their slashing, impudent, outspoken
comment:</p>
          <p>“Boys, what infernal fool do you reckon laid out this line? Why,
any one can see we can't hold it. We are certain to be enfiladed on
this flank, and the Yankees can even take us in reverse over yonder.
Let's fall back to that ridge we just passed!”</p>
          <pb id="stiles264" n="264"/>
          <p>But where troops had themselves originally taken position, it was
a very different matter. This was one point where Johnny was
disposed to be unreasonable and insubordinate—not to consider
consequences or to obey orders. He did not like to fall back from any
position he had himself established by hard fighting, especially if it
was in advance of the general line. So well recognized was his
attitude in this regard that it had well nigh passed into a proverb:</p>
          <p>“No, sir! <hi rend="italics">We fought for this dirt, and we're going to hold it.</hi> The
men on our right and left ought to be here alongside of us, and
would be if they had fought as hard as we did!”</p>
          <p>Of course, Johnny would not violate or forget the fundamental
maxim of geometry and war, that <hi rend="italics">a line must be continuous;</hi> that his
right must be somebody's left and his left somebody's right; but the
furthest he would go in recognition of the maxim was the
compromise of bending back his flanks, so as to connect with the
troops on his right and left who had failed to keep up. So this was
done, he did not seem to care how irregular the general line of battle
was. One cannot look at a map of any of our great battles without
being impressed with the tortuous character of our lines.</p>
          <p>I have myself heard a major-general send a message back to Army
Headquarters, by a staff officer of General Lee, that he didn't see why
his division should be expected to abandon the position they had
fought for just to accommodate General - - -, whose troops had fallen
back where his had driven the enemy. On that very occasion, if my
memory serves me, this selfish, stupid obstinacy cost us the lives of
hundreds of men.</p>
          <p>One word more in connection with the straightening of our lines.
Of course we moved after dark, and, as I remember, but a short
distance. After we got to our new position I discovered that I had lost
my pocket-knife, or some such trivial article of personal outfit, but
difficult to replace; so, contrary to Colonel Cabell's advice—he didn't
forbid my going—I went back, on foot and in the dark, to look or
feel for it. I had no difficulty in finding the spot where we had been
lying, and began to grope and feel about for the
<pb id="stiles265" n="265"/>
knife, having at the time an unpleasant consciousness that I was
running a very foolish and unjustifiable risk, for the Minies were
hissing and singing and spatting all about me.</p>
          <p>There was a man near me, also on his hands and knees, looking or
feeling for something. While glancing at the shape, dimly outlined, I
heard the unmistakable thud of a bullet striking flesh. There was a
muffled outcry, and the crouching or kneeling figure lay stretched
upon the ground. I went to it and felt it. The man was dead.</p>
          <p>In a very brief time I was back in our new position and not
thinking of pocket-knives.</p>

2d—Removal of Falligant's Lone Gun at Night.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>After feeling our lines, feinting several times, and making, on the
18th, what might perhaps be termed a genuine attack, Grant, on the
evening of the 20th, slid off toward Bowling Green; but although he
got a little the start of Lee, yet, when he reached his immediate
objective, Lee was in line of battle at Hanover Junction, directly
across the line of further progress. It is the belief of many intelligent
Confederate officers that if Lee had not been attacked by disabling
disease, the movements of the two armies about the North Anna
would have had a very different termination. Grant ran great risk in
taking his army to the southern bank of the river with Lee on the
stream between his two wings; it is fair to add that he seems to have
realized his peril and to have withdrawn in good time.</p>
          <p>General Lee's indisposition, about this time, was really serious.
Some of us will never forget how shocked and alarmed we were at
seeing him in an ambulance. General Early, in his address before
mentioned, says of this matter:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>One of his three corps commanders had been disabled by wounds at the
Wilderness, and another was too sick to command his corps, while
<pb id="stiles267" n="267"/>
he himself was suffering from a most annoying and weakening disease. In fact
nothing but his own determined will enabled him to keep the field at all; and it
was there rendered more manifest than ever that he was the head and front, the
very life and soul of his army.</p>
          </q>
          <p>It was about this date that General Lee, as I remember a second
time, broached the idea that he might be compelled to retire—an idea
which no one else could contemplate with any sort of composure;
happily, as soon as the disease was checked his superb physical
powers came to his aid, and he soon rallied and regained his
customary vigor and spirits.</p>
          <p>Perhaps no other position of equal labor and responsibility can be
mentioned, nor one which makes such drafts upon human strength
and endurance, as the command of a great army in a time of active
service. I recall during the Gettysburg campaign being equally
impressed with the force of this general proposition, and with the
almost incredible physical powers of General Lee. On two occasions,
just before and just after we recrossed the Potomac, I was sent upon
an errand which required my visiting army, corps, and division
headquarters, and, so far as practicable, seeing the respective
commanding officers in person. On the first round I did not find
General Lee at his quarters, and was told that he had ridden down
the road to the lines. When I reached the lines I heard he had passed
out in front. Following him up, I found him in the rain with a single
piece of horse artillery, feeling the enemy. My second ride was made
largely at night, and, as I remember, every officer I desired to see was
asleep, except at Army Headquarters, where I found Colonel Taylor
in his tent on his knees, with his prayer-book open before him, and
General Lee in his tent, wide-awake, poring over a map stretched
upon a temporary table of rough plank, with a tallow candle stuck in
a bottle for a light. I remember saying to myself, as I delivered my
message and withdrew, “Does he never, never sleep?”</p>
          <p>Again General Grant slid to the east, and we moved off upon a
parallel line. I think it was during this detour—or it may have been an
earlier or a later one—that I was sent ahead, upon a road which led
through a tract of country
<pb id="stiles268" n="268"/>
which had not been desolated by the encampments or the battles of
armies, to select a night's resting place for the battalion. Forests
were standing untouched, farm lands were protected by fences,
crops were green and untrampled, birds were singing, flowers
blooming—Eden everywhere. Even my horse seemed to feel the
change from the crowded roads, the deadly lines, the dust, the dirt,
the mud, the blood, the horror. We were passing through a quiet
wood at a brisk walk, when suddenly he roused himself and
quickened his gait, breaking of his own accord into a long trot,
his beautiful, sensitive ears playing back and forth in the unmistakable way
which, in a fine
horse, indicates that he catches sounds interesting and agreeable to
him. It was, perhaps, several hundred yards before we swung around
out of the forest into the open land where stood a comfortable farm
house, and there in a sweet and sunny corner were several chubby
little children chatting and singing at their play. Mickey, dear old
Mickey, trotted right up to the little people, with low whinnies of
recognition and delight, and rubbed his head against them. They did
not seem at all afraid, but pulled nice tufts of grass for him, which he
ate with evident relish and gratitude.</p>
          <p>If I remember correctly, it was the evening of the same day, after
Mickey and I had kissed and left the children, and I had found a
beautiful camping ground for the battalion—a succession of little
swells of land crowned with pine copses and covered with broomsedge,
with a clear, cool stream flowing between the hills; and after
the batteries were all up and located in this soldier paradise—guns
parked, horses watered and fed and all work done—I say, I think it
was after all this, that the bugles of each of the batteries blew such
sweet and happy notes as I never heard from any one of them
before, and then, while I was lying on the broomsedge, bathing my
soul in this peace, and Mickey was browsing near-by, over across
the stream, the Howitzer Glee Club launched out into a song, the
first they had sung since we broke camp at Morton's Ford, three
weeks before.</p>
          <p>As the song ceased and the day was fading into the twilight, I
caught, up the road, the low murmur of conversation and the rattle
of canteens, and following the sound with my eye, saw two
infantrymen, from a command that
<pb id="stiles269" n="269"/>
had followed us and camped further back from the stream, wending
their way to water. Just as they came fully within sight and hearing,
two of the Howitzer Club struck up “What are the Wild Waves
Saying?”—one of them, in a fine falsetto, taking the sister's part. As
the clear, sweet female voice floated out on the still evening air my
two infantrymen stood transfixed, one putting his hand upon the
other's arm and saying with suppressed excitement, “Stop, man;
there's a woman!” They were absolutely silent during the singing of
the sister's part, but when the brother took up the song they openly
wondered whether she would sing again. “Yes, there she is; listen,
listen!”</p>
          <p>And so, until the song was done, and they had waited, and it had
become evident she would sing no more—and then a deep sigh from
both the spell-bound auditors, and one of them, making use of the
strongest figure he could command, exclaimed, from the bottom of a
full heart, “Well, it beats a furlough hollow!”</p>
          <p>We almost began to hope that Grant had gotten enough. Even his
apparent, yes, real, success at the Salient did not embolden him to
attack again at Spottsylvania. He had retired without any serious
fighting at Hanover Junction or North Anna, and after feeling our
position about Atlee's, he had once more slipped away from our
front. Where was he going? What did he intend to do? Any one of
his predecessors would have retired and given it up long ago. Was
he about to do so?</p>
          <p>The fact is, Grant was waiting for reinforcements. He had been
heavily reinforced at Spottsylvania after the 12th of May, but not up
to the measure of his desires, or of his needs, either; for he really
needed more men—and more, and more. He needed them, he asked
for them, and he got them. He had a right to all he wanted. His
original contract so provided; it covered all necessary drafts. He
wanted especially Baldy Smith and his men from the transports, and
they were coming. They were stretching out hands to each other.
When they clasped hands, then Grant would attack once more;
would make his great final effort. When and where would it be?</p>
          <pb id="stiles270" n="270"/>
          <p>When Grant slid away from Lee at Atlee's, we felt satisfied that he
was, as usual, making for the south and east, so Hoke was ordered
toward Cold Harbor, and Kershaw (now our division general,
McLaws never having returned from the West) toward Beulah
Church. Colonel Cabell received orders on the evening of the 31st of
May, or early on the morning of the 1st of June, to make for the
latter point; but he was not upon the same road as Kershaw's
division, and our orders said nothing about joining it. They seemed
to contemplate our going by the most direct route, and we went—that
is, as far as we could. No infantry apparently had received any
orders to go with us, certainly none went, and we soon passed
beyond the apparent end of our infantry line, at least on the road we
were traveling. Very soon we reached a stout infantry picket, which I
interviewed, and they said there were no Confederate troops down
that road, unless perhaps a few cavalry videttes.</p>
          <p>I was on very intimate terms with my colonel, and I went to him
and suggested whether there was not danger in our proceeding as
we were, a battalion of artillery unaccompanied by infantry, out and
beyond the last picket post. The colonel was a strict constructionist,
and he shut me up at once by saying: “Stiles, that is the
responsibility of the general officer who sent me my orders. I am
ordered to Beulah Church and to Beulah Church I am going. This is
the nearest road.” I looked up at him in some little surprise, but said
no more; having fired, I now fell back on my reserves, in pretty fair
order, but slightly demoralized.</p>
          <p>My reserves were the officers and men of the battalion, all of
whom I think were fond of me. If I mistake not, Frazier's battery led
the column. I am certain it did a little later. Calloway, its
commanding officer, to whom we have already been introduced, was
one of the very best of soldiers, as the reader will soon be prepared
to admit. He was the first man I fell in with as I fell back, Colonel
Cabell and little Barrett, his courier, being ahead of the column.
Calloway asked me if I didn't think we were running some risk,
entirely unsupported as we seemed to be, and outside our lines. I told
him what had occurred, and he smiled grimly.</p>
          <pb id="stiles271" n="271"/>
          <p>Then I fell back further to the old battery. The column was pretty
well closed up that morning; everybody seemed to feel it well to be
so. I was strongly attached to the old company and particularly to
the captain, who was a magnificent fellow. It was early on a beautiful
summer morning, and we were again passing through a tract of
undesolated, undesecrated country—greenness, quiet, the song of
birds, the scent of flowers, all about us. Captain McCarthy was on
foot, walking among his men, his great arms frequently around the
necks of two of them at once—a position which displayed his
martial, manly figure to great advantage. I dismounted, one of the
fellows mounting my horse, and walked and talked and chatted with
the men, and particularly with the captain.</p>
          <p>He was altogether an uncommon person, marked by great
simplicity, sincerity, kindliness, courage, good sense, personal force,
and a genius for commanding men. He had been rather a reckless,
pugnacious boy, difficult to manage, impatient of control. The war
had proved a real blessing to him. It let off the surplus fire and fight.
Its deep and powerful undertone was just what was needed to
harmonize his nature. His spirit had really been balanced and gentled
and sweetened by it. He was not essentially an intellectual man, nor
yet a man of broad education, and he had under him some of the
most intellectual and cultivated young men I ever met, yet he was
easily their leader and commander; in the matter of control and for
the business in hand, “from his shoulders and upward, taller than
any of the people.” And these intellectual and cultivated men freely
recognized his supremacy and admired and loved him. He seemed to
be somewhat subdued and quiet that morning; even more than
ordinarily affectionate and demonstrative, but not cheerful or chatty.
Several of us noticed his unusual bearing and speculated as to the
cause.</p>
          <p>As the morning wore on and we were leaving our infantry further
and further behind, my uneasiness returned; and besides, I had
been away long enough from the colonel, so I remounted and rode
forward to the head of the column. He had been very emphatic in
repelling my suggestions, but
<pb id="stiles272" n="272"/>
I thought it my duty to renew them, and I did. He was even more
emphatic than before, saying he had been ordered to take that
battalion to Beulah Church, and he proposed to do it, and he even
added that when he wanted any advice from me he would ask it. I felt
a nearer approach to heat than ever before or after, in all my
intercourse with my friend and commander, and I assured him I would
not obtrude my advice again.</p>
          <p>I reined in my horse, waiting for Calloway, and rode with him at the
head of his battery. I had scarcely joined him, when Colonels Fairfax
and Latrobe, of Longstreet's staff, and Captain Simonton, of Pickett's,
dashed by, splendidly mounted, and disappeared in a body of woods
but a few hundred yards ahead. Hardly had they done so, when pop!
pop! pop! went a half dozen carbines and revolvers; and a moment
later the three officers galloped back out of the forest, driving before
them two or three Federal cavalrymen on foot—Simonton leaning over
his horse's head and striking at them with his riding whip. On the
instant I took my revenge, riding up to Colonel Cabell, taking off my
hat with a profound bow, and asking whether it was still his intention
to push right on to Beulah Church? Meanwhile, Minie balls began to
drop in on us, evidently fired by sharpshooters from a house a short
distance to our left and front. The Colonel turned toward me with a
smile, and said, in a tone that took all the sting out of his former
words, if any was ever intended to be in them: “Yes, you impudent
fellow, it is my intention, but let's see how quickly you can drive
those sharpshooters out of that house!”</p>
          <p>Scarce sooner said than done. I sprang from my horse. Calloway's
guns were in battery on the instant, I, by his permission, taking
charge of his first piece as gunner. Making a quick estimate of the
distance, I shouted back to No. 6 at how many seconds to cut the
fuse, and the shell reached the gun almost as soon as I did. A
moment—and the gun was loaded, aimed and fired; a moment more
and the house burst into flame. The shell from the other three guns
were exploded among the retiring skirmishers, who ran back toward
the woods; while from the side of the house nearest to us
<pb id="stiles273" n="273"/>
two women came out, one very stout and walking with difficulty, the
other bearing a baby in her arms and two little children following
her. Calling to the gunner to take charge of his piece, I broke for these
women, three or four of the men running with me. There was a fence
between us and them that could not have been less than four and a
half feet high, which I cleared, “hair and hough,” while the rest
stopped to climb it. I took the baby and dragged the youngest child
along with me, telling the other to come on, and sent the younger
woman back to help the elder. When the reinforcements arrived we
re-arranged convoys, I still keeping the baby. By the time we reached
the battery more of the guns were in action, shelling the woods, and I
became interested in the firing. The number fives as they ran by me
with the ammunition would stop a moment to pat the baby, who was
quite satisfied, and seemed to enjoy the racket, cooing and trying to
pull my short hair and beard. This thing had been going on for several
minutes, and I had not been conscious of any appeal to me, until one
of the men ran up, and, pulling me sharply around, pointed to the two
women, who were standing back down the hill, and as far as possible
out of the line of the bullets, which were still annoying us. There was
a rousing laugh and cheer as I started back to deliver the little infant
artilleryman to his mother. It turned out that the elder of the two
women was the mother of the other, and had been bedridden for
several years. We were exceedingly sorry to have burned their little
house, but some of the boys suggested that if the cure of the mother
proved permanent, the balance, after all, might be considered rather in
our favor.</p>
          <p>I do not recall the events of the next few hours with any
distinctness, or in any orderly sequence, nor how we got into
connection with our division, Kershaw's; but we did so without
serious mishap; so, perhaps, Colonel Cabell may have been more
nearly right than I after all. The first definite recollection I have, after
what I have just related, is of the breaking of Col. Lawrence M.
Keitt's big South Carolina regiment, which had just come to the army
and been entered in Kershaw's old brigade, and probably
outnumbered
<pb id="stiles274" n="274"/>
all the balance of that command. General Kershaw had put this and
another of his brigades into action not far from where we had burned
the house to dislodge the skirmishers. Keitt's men gave ground, and
in attempting to rally them their colonel fell mortally wounded.
Thereupon the regiment went to pieces in abject rout and threatened
to overwhelm the rest of the brigade. I have never seen any body of troops
in such a condition of utter demoralization; they actually groveled
upon the ground and attempted to burrow under each other in holes
and depressions. Major Goggin, the stalwart adjutant-general of the
division, was attempting to rally them, and I did what I could to help
him. It was of no avail. We actually spurred our horses upon them,
and seemed to hear their very bones crack, but it did no good; if
compelled to wriggle out of one hole they wriggled into another.</p>
          <p>So far as I recollect, however, this affair was of no real
significance. Our other troops stood firm, and we lost no ground. I
think none of the guns of the battery were engaged. Meanwhile the
three divisions of our corps—the First, since Longstreet's wounding,
under command of Major-General R. H. Anderson—had settled into
alignment in the following order, beginning from the left: Field,
Pickett, Kershaw. On the right of Kershaw's was Hoke's division,
which had been under Beauregard and had joined the Army of
Northern Virginia only the night before. The ground upon which our
troops had thus felt and fought their way into line was the historic
field of Cold Harbor, and the day was the first of June, 1864.</p>
          <p>In the afternoon a furious attack was made on the left of Hoke
and right of Kershaw; and Clingman's, the left brigade of Hoke, and
Wofford's, the right brigade of Kershaw, gave way and the Federal troops poured
into the gap over a
marshy piece of ground which had not been properly covered by
either of these two brigades. Both Field and Pickett sent aid to
Kershaw, and several of the guns of our battalion—I am not sure of which
batteries, though I think two
belonged to the Howitzers, came into battery on the edge of a peach
orchard which sloped down to the break,
<pb id="stiles275" n="275"/>
and poured in a hot enfilade fire on the victorious Federals, who,
after a manly struggle, were driven back, though we did not quite
regain all we had lost, and our lines were left in very bad shape.</p>
          <p>While Wofford was bending back the right of his line to connect
with Hoke, who, even with the aid sent him, had not quite succeeded
in regaining his original position, Kershaw's old brigade, which had
more perfectly recovered from its little contretemps, was pressing
and driving the enemy, both advancing and extending its line upon
higher and better ground, a feat it would never have been able to
accomplish but for the aid of one of Calloway's guns, which, under
command of Lieutenant Robert Falligalit, of Savannah, Ga., held and
carried the right flank of the brigade, coming into battery and fighting
fiercely whenever the enemy seemed to be holding the brigade in
check, and limbering up and moving forward with it, while it was
advancing; and this alternate advancing and firing was kept up until
a fresh Federal force came in and opened fire on the right flank, and
all of Falligant's horses fell at the first volley. The enemy made a
gallant rush for the piece, but they did not get it. It was in battery in a
moment, belching fire like a volcano, and very hot shot, too. The
brigade, whose flank it had held, now sprang to its defense, and after
a furious little fight the gun was for the present safe, and every one
began to dig and to pile up dirt.</p>
          <p>The brigade did not, however, advance one foot after Falligant's
horses were shot; but it was already considerably in advance of
Wofford's left, with which it was not connected at all, until the entire
line was rectified on the night of the 2d—nor was there at any time
a Confederate infantry soldier to the right of this piece, nor a
spadeful of earth, except the little traverse we threw up to protect
the right of the gun. It may just as well be added now that this lone
gun held the right of Kershaw's brigade line that evening and
night—it was getting dark when the extreme advanced position was
reached—and all the next day, and was moved back by hand the night
of the 2d of June. I have no hesitation in saying that in all my
experience as a soldier I never witnessed
<pb id="stiles276" n="276"/>
more gallant action than this of Lieutenant Falligant and his
dauntless cannoneers, nor do I believe that any officer of his rank
made a more important contribution than he to the success of the
Confederate arms in the great historic battle.</p>
          <p>Both sides anticipated battle on the 3rd, as it really occurred.
General Grant in his memoirs says in express terms, “The 2d of June
was spent in getting troops into position for attack on the 3d;” and
the “Official Journal” of our corps says, under date of June
3rd “The
expected battle begins early.” This journal also notes the weakness
of “Kershaw's Salient,” and that the enemy was aware of it, and was
“massing heavily” in front of it. Three brigades were sent to support
Kershaw—Anderson's, Gregg's, and Law's. We also set to work to
rectify the lines about this point. Gen. E. M. Law, of Alabama, is
probably entitled to the credit of this suggestion, which had so
important a bearing upon our success. He laid off the new line with
his own hand and superintended the construction of it during the
night of the 2d. The record of the 3d might have been a very different
one if this change had not been made. Under Colonel Cabell's
instructions and with the aid of the division pioneer corps, I opened
roads through the woods for the more rapid and convenient
transmission of artillery ammunition, and put up two or three little
bridges across ravines with the same view.</p>
          <p>While I was superintending this work, the fire at the time being
lively, I heard some one calling in a most lugubrious voice, “Mister,
Mister, won't you please come here!” I glanced in the direction of the
cry and saw a man standing behind a large tree in a very peculiar
attitude, having the muzzle of his musket under his left shoulder and
leaning heavily upon it. Supposing he was wounded, I went to him
and asked what he wanted. He pointed to the butt of his gun, under
which a large, vigorous, venomous copperhead snake was writhing;
and the wretched skulker actually had the face to whine to me,
“Won't you please, sir, kill that snake!” I knew not what to say to the
creature, and fear what I did say was neither a very Christian nor
a very
<pb id="stiles277" n="277"/>
soldierly response; but no one who has not seen a thoroughly
demoralized man can form the slightest conception of how repulsive
a thing such a wretch is.</p>
          <p>The headquarters of General Kershaw at Cold Harbor was close up
to the lines and just back of the position of some of our guns. It was
but a short distance, too, from where the caissons bringing in
ammunition turned to the right, on a road I had cut, running along the
slope of a declivity at the crest of which our guns were stationed,
some of them before and all of them after the lines were rectified. He
might have found a safer place, but none nearer the point of peril and
the working point of everything. The position, however, was so
exposed that he found himself compelled to protect it, which he did
by putting up a heavy wall of logs, back of which the earth was cut
away and pitched over against the face, which was toward the lines.
His quarters were thus cut deep into the hillside, and had besides,
above the surface and toward the enemy, this wall of logs faced with
earth. Thus he had a place where he and his officers could safely
confer and at a very short distance from their commands; but it was
after all a ghastly place, and very difficult and dangerous of
approach. All the roads or paths leading to it were not only swept by
an almost continuous and heavy fire of musketry, but I had to keep a
force of axe-men almost constantly at work cutting away trees felled
across the ammunition roads by the artillery fire of the enemy. Col.
Charles S. Venable, reputed to be one of the roughest and most
daring riders on General Lee's staff, later, professor of mathematics at
the University of Virginia, and chairman of the faculty,—told me he
believed this headquarter position of Kershaw's at Cold Harbor was
the worst place he was ever sent to. Colonel Cabell was necessarily a
great part of the time at these headquarters, and I also, when not
engaged at some special work, or with some of the guns, or on the
way from one to another. At Cold Harbor these journeys had to be
made on foot, and necessarily consumed a good deal of time, an
artillery battalion frequently covering, say, half a mile of the line.</p>
          <p>Up to the night of the 2d of June, when it was moved back, every
time Falligant's gun fired while I was at headquarters,
<pb id="stiles278" n="278"/>
General Kershaw would repeat his admiration of his
courage, and ask me to explain to him again and again the isolated
and exposed position of the piece, and then he would express his
determination that Falligant's gallantry and services should receive
their merited reward. Once, when I happened to be there, a soldier
from a South Carolina regiment in Kershaw's old brigade, one of
those supporting Falligant's gun, came in, reporting that his part of
the line was almost out of ammunition, and asking that some be sent
in at once. He may have had a written order, but at all events he
represented that the case was urgent; that they could not trust to
getting it into the line at some safe point and having it passed along
by hand, because it would take too long, and besides all the troops
were scantily supplied and it would never get to his regiment; and
lastly, because the officer who sent him had ordered him to bring it
himself. The man was intelligent, self-possessed, and determined. I
well remember, too, how pale and worn and powder-begrimed he
looked. He confirmed all I had said as to the position and services of
Falligant's gun, and was enthusiastic about him and his detachment.</p>
          <p>I told him I was going down there and would help him. Boxes of
ammunition were piled up in a corner of the cellar, as it might be
called, in which we were sitting, and we knocked the top from one or
more, and putting two good, strong oilcloths together, poured into
them as many cartridges as either of us could conveniently carry at a
pretty good rate of speed. We then tied up the cloths,
making a bag of double thickness and having two ends
to hold by. Together we could run quite rapidly with it,
and in case either of us should be killed or wounded, the
other could get along fairly well. We then took the course
I had already several times taken in
reaching the gun—that is, we went down behind Wofford's left flank,
and from that point ran across a field covered with scattering
sassafras bushes, to a point on Kershaw's line, a little to the left of
our gun. This route afforded the best protection, but after we left
Wofford's position the “protection” amounted to nothing. The
sharpshooters, had two-thirds of a circle of fire around the piece,
and
<pb id="stiles279" n="279"/>
they popped merrily at us as we stepped across the field, but they
never touched either of us; we got in safe and each of us “counted
a <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">coup</foreign></hi>,” as the French Canadian trappers used to say.</p>
          <p>After shaking hands with the infantry, hearing my plucky
comrade complimented on his quick and successful trip, and the
men draw their rations of powder and ball, I made my way to the
gun, told Bob and his gallant detachment what the General had said
about them, looked to their fortification and ammunition, and was
just about to take the perilous trip back again when the enemy
began to press us in a very determined way. There was heavy
timber immediately in front, and their mode of attack was to thicken
a skirmish line into a line of battle behind the trees, and then try to
rush us at very short range. The infantry ammunition had been
replenished just in time, but it must be remembered there was not an
infantry soldier to our right. If the woods had been as close upon
us in that direction they would undoubtedly have captured the
piece, but they did not relish coming out into the open.</p>
          <p>I was struck with the splendid fighting spirit of Campbell, the tall,
lean, keen-eyed, black-haired gunner of the piece; but he was
entirely too reckless, standing erect except when bending over the
handspike in sighting the piece, and not much “sighting” is done at
such short range. Every time the gun belched its deadly contents
into the woods Campbell would throw his glengarry around his
head and yell savagely. I cautioned him again and again, reminding
him that the other men of the detachment were fighting, and fighting
effectively, on their hands and knees. When his commanding officer
or I ordered him to “get down” he would do so for a moment, but
spring up again when the gun fired. Suddenly I heard the thud of a
Minie striking a man, and Campbell's arms flew up as he fell
backward, ejaculating, “O God! I'm done forever!” We lifted the poor
fellow around, across the face of the little work, under the mouth of
the piece, and Falligant kneeled by him and pressed his finger
where the blood was spouting, while I took the gunner's place at the
trail. Every time the gun
<pb id="stiles280" n="280"/>
was discharged I noticed how Campbell's face—which was almost
directly under the bellowing muzzle—was contorted, but he urged
me to keep up the fire, until finally, observing a sort of lull in the
fight, I proposed to cease firing and note the effect, and the poor
fellow said brokenly, “Well, if you think it's safe, Adjutant!” Then he
added, “Tell my mother I died like a soldier”—and he was gone.</p>
          <p>During this flurry one of the enemy bounded over the work and
landed right in among us; but he ran on toward the rear and brought
up in a sitting posture on a pile of earth one of the infantry had
thrown out of a hole he had dug to cook in—a sort of
safety-kitchen. The man's back was turned toward us, his elbows were on
his knees, and his head sunk in his hands. After Campbell's death,
as he was still sitting there, thinking he must be wounded, I
proposed to one of the men to run out with me and bring him back
into the work. We tried it, but he cast off our hands and we had to
leave him to his fate. In a few moments he was shot in the head and
tumbled in upon the cook in the kitchen—dead.</p>
          <p>The 2d of June, 1864, was the heaviest, the hardest-worked and
the most straining day of my life. Not only did I have my ordinary
duties of a day of battle to perform, but I had, in addition, to open
and to keep open roads for getting in ammunition, to bridge two or
three ravines, to visit Falligant's gun several times and to keep it
supplied with ammunition, which had to be passed along the
infantry line by hand for quite a long distance. When night came I
believe I was more nearly worn out than on any other occasion
during the entire war. Colonel Cabell insisted I should go back to our
headquarters camp, which was about midway between the lines and
the drivers' camp, and sleep; and, in view of what impended on the
morrow, I consented to do so. But first, and just before dark, I took
Calloway over all the obscure and confusing part of the road to
Falligant's gun, the road by which he was to bring it out later. I
omitted to say that General Kershaw highly approved our
determination to save that piece, if at all possible. I greatly disliked
not going with the party to fetch the gun out, but Calloway and
every one concerned insisted that I must not think of attempting
<pb id="stiles281" n="281"/>
it, fearing that I would utterly give way if I did so. So
I yielded, and after showing and explaining everything to
Calloway, I went back to camp and lay down.</p>
          <p>I had scarcely gotten to sleep when I had to get up to pilot an
officer who had important orders for General Kershaw, and had been
unable to find his headquarters. Once more I stretched out and
dozed off. How long I dozed or slept I cannot say, but I was
awakened by Calloway bending over me and saying, “Adjutant, I
never was so sorry about anything, but in those woods it is now as
dark as Erebus! Nobody but yourself can find and keep the road
you showed me, and I don't believe even you can do it.”</p>
          <p>The noble fellow was evidently much mortified and troubled at
being compelled to rouse me, but he well knew I had much rather
this should be done than that the chance of saving the gun should
be abandoned. So I got up and mounted Mickey, and off we
started.</p>
          <p>It was very dark. Just before reaching the point where the road
turned to the right along the slope of the hill, we found the gun
horses and drivers, Calloway and I passing
and directing them to follow us, and to keep absolutely quiet. I
experienced little difficulty in finding the road, having
superintended the cutting of it and being very familiar with
it, and we passed on over the little bridge, and were just passing
out from behind Wofford's left flank and heading for Kershaw's
line, when some one seized my bridle rein and abruptly stopped my
horse; at the same time asking who I was and what I intended to do,
and what I meant by bringing artillery horses through his lines
without his permission.</p>
          <p>The manner and tone of this address was irritating, but
suspecting who my interlocutor was and knowing something of his
temperament, I answered quietly that I was adjutant of Cabell's
Battalion of Artillery, and that the commanding officer of one of our
batteries was with me; that the gun out there, which had protected
this part of the line all day, belonged to his battery; that we proposed to save
it, and that we had
brought the horses for the purpose of hauling it off. I could see
nothing, but by this time my suspicion had become conviction and
I felt sure I was talking with General
<pb id="stiles282" n="282"/>
Wofford. He positively forbade the attempt, and did not seem
disposed to yield until my cousin, Col. Edward Stiles, of the
Sixteenth Georgia, of his brigade, who knew the General well, joined
us and suggested as a compromise that we should make the attempt
without taking the horses any further; to which I agreed, upon
condition that he would furnish me with, say, twenty men, to get the
gun off by hand, and that in the event of their failing I should then
make the effort with the horses, as we had General Kershaw's
positive orders to save the gun if possible.</p>
          <p>We got the men and started up the hill, leaving drivers and horses
to await our return. It was now absolutely dark. I remember putting
my hand before my face and being unable to see it. Calloway and I
rode side by side, inclining to the left, so as to guard against running
out into the enemy through the gap in the lines. There was absolute
stillness, save the soft tread of our horses' feet in the sandy soil. In a
few moments their heads rustled against dry leaves—the leafy screen
which the troops had put up to protect themselves from the baking
sun. We knew we were at the infantry line and turned to the right and
toward the gun. There was a good deal of smoke in the air from the
woods afire out in front, and we soon became conscious of an
insufferable odor of burning flesh. My horse being a rapid walker, I
kept a little ahead of Calloway, and very soon was stopped again, by
some one who spoke almost in a stage whisper. It turned out to be
the commanding officer of Kershaw's old brigade, and he, too,
forbade our attempt and ordered us back; but the direct authority of
his major-general satisfied him, and he begged only that we should
wait until his men could be thoroughly roused and ready to resist
any attack that might be made; adding that the poor fellows were
utterly exhausted by the unrelieved strain of the past thirty-six hours.
All true; yet it was fearful to contemplate the risk they ran in
sleeping. The colonel told us, too, what we already suspected, that
the odor which so offended our nostrils was that of human bodies
roasting in the forest fires in front. We plainly heard the officers
passing along the lines and rousing the men, and we feared the
enemy heard it,
<pb id="stiles283" n="283"/>
too; but preferred this risk to that of a sudden rush upon a
slumbering brigade just as we were drawing the gun off.</p>
          <p>Soon after we started again, my horse snorted and sprang aside. I
knew this meant we had reached the dead horses, and told Calloway
we were almost upon the gun. He dismounted, handing his bridle
rein to me, and I heard him enter the little trench and feel and fumble
his way along it for a few steps, and then heard him call, in a low
tone, “Falligant, Falligant!” Then I heard the sort of groan or grumble
a tired man gives out when he is half roused from a sound sleep, and
after that a low hum of conversation. Then Calloway came up out of
the trench, and, groping his way to me, said: “Adjutant, do you
know every man in that detachment was fast asleep and the enemy is
lying down in line of battle between here and that low fire out there!”
I said he must be mistaken, that I could toss a cracker into that fire.
He insisted he was right and urged me to dismount and go into the
trench and stoop till I could see under the smoke. I did so, and there,
sure enough, was a continuous line of blue which the flickering of
the flames beyond enabled me to see. My heart stopped beating at
the sight, but this was no time for indulgence of over-sensibility,
physical or emotional.</p>
          <p>As quietly and rapidly as possible we got everything ready for
fight or retreat. Our twenty men had brought their muskets and
Kershaw's brigade was up in the trench and on their knees. The gun
was backed out of the little work, limbered up, and the ammunition
chest replaced; some of the men took hold of the wheels and some
of the tongue, and the piece was soon moving after us, almost
noiselessly, along the sassafras field toward Wofford's line. In a few
moments we reached the goal, returning our thanks to the General,
and to my cousin and the sturdy, gallant men they lent us; the
horses were hitched up and we were rolling over the little bridges
and up to the new line and the position selected for this now
distinguished piece.</p>
          <p>I trust I am not small enough to indulge in any vulgar pride in my
part of the trying experiences of this day; yet I scarce recall another
day for which I so thank God, or which
<pb id="stiles284" n="284"/>
has had a greater influence on my life. Often, when depressed and
disposed to question whether there is, or ever was, in me the salt of a
real manhood, I have looked back to the first three days of June,
1864, and felt the revival of a saving self-respect and the
determination not to do or suffer anything unworthy of this heroic
past of which I was a part.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>There were two battles at Cold Harbor, one in '62 and one in '64.
In '62 the Confederates attacked and drove the Federals from their
position; in '64 the Federals attacked, but were repulsed with frightful
slaughter. It is undisputed that both McClellan's army and Grant's
outnumbered Lee's,—Grant's overwhelmingly,—and it is asserted
that the position occupied by the Federals in '62 and the
Confederates in '64 was substantially the same.</p>
          <p>We were in line of battle at Cold Harbor of '64 from the 1st to the
12th of June—say twelve days; the battle proper did not last perhaps
that many minutes. In some respects, at least, it was one of the
notable battles of history—certainly in its brevity measured in time,
and its length measured in slaughter—as also in the disproportion
of the losses. A fair epitome of it in these respects would be that in a
few moments more than thirteen thousand men were killed and
wounded on the Federal side and less than thirteen hundred on the
Confederate. As to the time consumed in the conflict, the longest
duration assigned is sixty minutes and the shortest less than eight.
For my own part, I could scarcely say whether it lasted eight or sixty
minutes, or eight or sixty
<pb id="stiles286" n="286"/>
hours—to such a degree were all my powers concentrated upon the
one point of keeping the guns fully supplied with ammunition.</p>
          <p>The effect of the fighting was not at all appreciated on the
Confederate side at the time. Why we did not at least suspect it,
when the truce was asked and granted to allow the removal of the
Federal dead and wounded, I cannot say, although I went myself
with the officers on our side, detailed to accompany them, on
account of my familiarity with the lines. I presume the ignorance,
and even incredulity, of our side as to the overwhelming magnitude
of the Federal losses resulted from two causes mainly—our own loss
was so trivial, so utterly out of proportion, and the one
characteristic feature of the fight on the Federal side was not then
generally known or appreciated by us, namely, that Grant had
attacked in column, in phalanx, or in mass. The record of the Official
Diary of our corps (Southern Historical Society Papers, Vol. VII.,
p. 503), under date of June 3, 1864, is very peculiar and is in part in
these words: “Meantime the enemy is heavily massed in front of
Kershaw's salient. Anderson's, Law's, and Gregg's brigades are there
to support Kershaw. Assault after assault is made, and each time
repulsed with severe loss to the enemy. At eight o'clock A. M.,
fourteen had been made and repulsed (this means, I suppose,
fourteen lines advanced).”</p>
          <p>This is obviously a hurried field note by one officer,
corrected later by another, in accordance with the facts known
to the writer, that is, to the officer who made the later note,
but not generally known at the time to the public. We suppose, however, it will
to-day be admitted by all that there
was <hi rend="italics">but one attack</hi> upon Kershaw up to eight A. M., and
that at that hour the order was issued to the Federal troops
to renew the attack, but they failed to advance; that this
order was repeated in the afternoon, when the troops again
refused to obey, and that at least some of Grant's corps
generals approved of this refusal of their men to repeat the
useless sacrifice.</p>
          <p>Here, then, is the secret of the otherwise inexplicable and
incredible butchery. A little after daylight on June 3, 1864,
<pb id="stiles287" n="287"/>
along the lines of Kershaw's salient, his infantry discharged their
bullets and his artillery fired case-shot and double-shotted canister,
at very short range, into a mass of men twenty-eight (28) deep, who
could neither advance nor retreat, and the most of whom could not
even discharge their muskets at us. We do not suppose that the
general outline of these facts will be denied to-day, but it may be as
well to confirm the essential statements by a brief extract from
Swinton's “Army of the Potomac,” p. 487:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>The order was issued through these officers to their subordinate
commanders, and from them descended through the wonted channels, but no
man stirred and the immobile lines pronounced a verdict, silent, yet emphatic,
against further slaughter. The loss on the Union side in this sanguinary action
was over thirteen thousand, while on the part of the Confederates it is
doubtful whether it reached that many hundreds.</p>
          </q>
          <p>To like effect, as to the amount and the disproportion of the
carnage, is the statement of Colonel Taylor, on page 135 of his
book, that:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>I well recall having received a report after the assault from General Hoke— 
whose division reached the army just previous to this battle—to the effect that
the ground in his entire front over which the enemy had charged was literally
covered with their dead and wounded; and that up to that time he had not had a
single man killed.</p>
          </q>
          <p>So much for the amount, the disproportion, and the cause of the
slaughter. A word now as to the effect of it upon the Federal leaders
and the Northern people. Is it too much to say that even Grant's iron
nerve was for the time shattered? Not that he would not have
fought again if his men would, but they would not. Is it not true that he
so informed President Lincoln; that he asked for another army; that,
not getting it, or not getting it at once, he changed his plan of
campaign from a fighting to a digging one? Is it reasonable to
suppose that when he attacked at the Bloody Angle or at Cold
Harbor, he really contemplated the siege of Petersburg and regarded
those operations as merely preparatory? Is it not true that, years later,
Grant said—looking back over
<pb id="stiles288" n="288"/>
his long career of bloody fights—that Cold Harbor was the only
battle
he ever fought that he would not fight over again under the same
circumstances? Is it not true that when first urged, as President, to
remove a certain Democratic officeholder in California, and later,
when urged to give a reason for his refusal, he replied that the man
had been a standard-bearer in the Army of the Potomac, and that he
would—allow something very unpleasant to happen to him—before he
would remove the only man in his army who even attempted to obey
his order to attack a second time at Cold Harbor? Is it not true that
General Meade said the Confederacy came nearer to winning
recognition at Cold Harbor than at any other period during the war?
Is it not true that, after Grant's telegram, the Federal Cabinet resolved
at least upon an armistice, and that Mr. Seward was selected to draft
the necessary papers, and Mr. Swinton to prepare the public mind for
the change? And finally, even if none of these things be true, exactly
as propounded—yet is it not true, that Cold Harbor shocked and
depressed the Federal Government and the Northern public more
than any other single battle of the war?</p>
          <p>A few words as to some of the prominent features, physical and
otherwise, of fighting in “the lines,” as we began regularly to do in
this campaign of '64, particularly at Cold Harbor. Something of this is
necessary to a proper understanding and appreciation of some of
the incidents that occurred there. And first, as to “the works” of
which I have so often spoken. What were they? I cannot answer in
any other way one-half so well as by the following vivid quotation
from my friend Willy Dame's “Reminiscences,” already referred to.
Says Mr. Dame:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>Just here I take occasion to correct a very wrong impression about the
field works the Army of Northern Virginia fought behind in this campaign.
All the Federal writers who have written about these battles speak about our
works as “formidable earthworks,” “powerful fortifications,” “impregnable
lines;” such works as no troops could be expected to take and <hi rend="italics">any troops</hi> should
be expected to hold.</p>
            <p>Now about the parts of the line distant from us, I couldn't speak so
certainly—though I am sure they were all very much the same—but
<pb id="stiles289" n="289"/>
about the works all along our part of the line I can speak with exactness and
certainty. I saw them, I helped with my own hands to make them, I fought
behind them, I was often on top of them and both sides of them. I know all
about them. I got a good deal of the mud off them on me (not for purposes of
personal fortification, however). Our works were a single line of earth about
four feet high and three to five feet thick. It had no ditch or obstruction in
front. It was nothing more than a little heavier line of “rifle pits.” There was
no physical difficulty in men walking right over that bank. I did it often
myself, saw many others do
it, and twice saw a line of Federal troops walk over it, and then saw them walk
<hi rend="italics">back</hi> over it with the greatest ease, at the rate of forty miles
an hour; i. e. except those whom we had persuaded to stay with us, and those
the angels were carrying to Abraham's bosom at a still swifter rate. Works they
could go over like that couldn't have been much obstacle! They couldn't have
made better time on a dead level.</p>
            <p>Such were our works actually, and still they seemed to “loom large”
to the people in front. I wonder what could have given them such an
exaggerated idea of the strength of those modest little works! I wonder if it
could have been the <hi rend="italics">men</hi> behind them! There wasn't a great many
of these men! It was a very thin gray line along them, back of a thin red line
of clay. But these lines stuck together, very hard, and were
very hard indeed to separate. The red clay was “sticky” and the men were just
as “sticky,” and as the two lines “stuck” together so closely, it made the whole
very strong indeed. Certainly it seems they gave to those who tried to force
them apart an impression of great strength.</p>
            <p>Yes, it must have been the <hi rend="italics">men!</hi> A story in point comes to my aid here. A
handsome, well dressed lady sweeps with a great air past two street boys. They
are much struck. “My eye, Jim, but ain't that a stunning dress?” Says Jim with a
superior air, “Oh get out, Bill, the dress ain't no great shakes; it's the woman
in it that makes it so killing!” That was the way with the Spottsylvania
earthworks. The “works wa'n't no great shakes.” It was the men in 'em that
made them so “killing.”</p>
            <p>The men behind those works, such as they were, had perfect confidence in
their own ability to hold them. And this happy combination of “faith” and
“works” proved as strong against the world and the flesh as it does against the
devil. It was perfectly effectual, it withstood all assaults.</p>
          </q>
          <p>The original intent of such “works” is to afford protection against
regular attack by the full line of battle of the opposite
side, advancing out of their works to attack yours. This, of course,
every one understands. But this is only an occasional and
comparatively rare thing. The constant and wearing feature of “the
lines” is the sharpshooting, which
<pb id="stiles290" n="290"/>
never ceases as long as there is light enough to see how to shoot;
unless the skirmishers or sharpshooters of the two sides proclaim, or
in some way begin, a temporary truce, as I have known them to do. I
have also known them to give explicit warning of the expiration of
such a truce.</p>
          <p>Sharpshooting, at best, however, is a fearful thing. The regular
sharpshooter often seemed to me little better than a human tiger
lying in wait for blood. His rifle is frequently trained and made fast
bearing upon a particular spot,—for example, where the head of a
gunner must of necessity appear when sighting his piece,—and the
instant that object appears and, as it were, “darkens the hole,” crash
goes a bullet through his brain.</p>
          <p>The consequence of the sharpshooting is the “covered-way,”
which, when applied to these rough and ready temporary lines,
means any sort of protection—trenches, ditches, traverses, piles of
earth, here and there, at what have proved to be the danger points,
designed and placed so as to protect as far as possible against the
sharpshooters. Only in regular and elaborate lines of “siege,” such
as we had later about Petersburg, is seen the more perfect protection
of regularly covered galleries and ways for passing from one part of
the line to another inside; just as, outside and on the face toward the
enemy, such elaborate and permanent lines of works are protected
by ditches, abattis or felled trees, friezes or sharpened stakes, to
make the “works” more difficult of approach, of access, and of
capture.</p>
          <p>One can readily understand, now, the supreme discomfort and
even suffering of “the lines.” Thousands of men cramped up in a
narrow trench, unable to go out, or to get up, or to stretch or to
stand, without danger to life and limb; unable to lie down, or to
sleep, for lack of room and pressure
of peril; night alarms, day attacks, hunger, thirst, supreme weariness,
squalor, vermin, filth, disgusting odors everywhere; the weary night
succeeded by the yet more weary
day; the first glance over the way, at day dawn, bringing the
sharpshooter's bullet singing past your ear or smashing through
your skull, a man's life often exacted as the price of a cup of water
from the spring. But I will not specify or
<pb id="stiles291" n="291"/>
elaborate further; only, upon the canvas thus stretched, let me paint
for you two or three life and death pictures of Cold Harbor of '64.</p>
          <p>The reader may recall our “Old Doctor,” the chief of our ambulance
corps, who helped to rally the Texans and Georgians on the 10th of
May at Spottsylvania, first exhorting them as “gentlemen,” then
berating and belaboring them as “cowards.” No man who was ever in
the Howitzers but will appreciate the grim absurdity of this man's
feeling a lack of confidence in his own nerve and courage; but he did
feel it. When the war broke out he was in Europe enjoying himself,
but returned to his native State, serving first in some, as he
considered it, “non-combatant” position, until that became
unendurable to him, and then he joined the Howitzers as a private
soldier; and that final flurry of the 10th of May was the first real fight
he ever got into. Hearing some one say just as it was over that it had
been “pretty hot work,” he asked with the greatest earnestness
whether the speaker really meant what he said, and when assured
that he did, he asked two or three others of his comrades, whom he
regarded as experienced soldiers, whether they concurred in this view
of the matter, and on their expressing emphatic concurrence, he
expressed intense satisfaction at having at last a standard in his
mind, and a relieving standard at that; saying that he had feared he
would disgrace his family by exhibiting a lack of courage; but if this
was really “hot work,” he felt that he would be able to maintain
himself and do his duty. The story is almost too much for belief, but it
is the sober truth and vouched for by gentlemen of the highest
character.</p>
          <p>I think it was the evening after the big fight at Cold Harbor that I
was sitting in the works, with one of the Howitzer detachments,
when the Doctor announced his intention of going to the spring for
water. I reminded him that it was not quite dark and the
sharpshooters would be apt to pay their respects to him; but he said
he must have some water, and offered to take down and fill as many
canteens as he could carry. His captain was present and I said no
more. He was soon loaded up and started off, stepping right up out
<pb id="stiles292" n="292"/>
of the trench on the level ground. I could not help urging him to take
the “covered way,” but he replied, “I can't do it, Adjutant. It is dirty;
a gentleman can't walk in it, sir.”</p>
          <p>Away he went, walking bolt upright and with entire nonchalance,
down the hill; to my great relief reaching the spring in safety, where
he was pretty well protected. In due time he started back, loaded with
the full canteens and having a tin cup full of water in his right hand. I
heard the sharp report of a rifle and saw the Doctor start forward or
stumble, and sprang up to go to his relief, but he steadied himself
and came right on up the hill without further attention from the
sharpshooters, and stepped down into the work. As he did so he
handed the captain the cup of water, in the quietest manner
apologizing for having spilled part of it, adding that he had met with
a trivial accident. The upper joint of his thumb had been shot away,
yet he had not dropped the cup. Then he turned to me and asked my
pardon for his disregard of my warning and his imprudence in
getting shot, protesting still, however, that it was very hard indeed
for a gentleman to walk in those filthy, abominable covered ways.</p>
          <p>The spring was perhaps the point of greatest power and pathos
in all the weird drama of “The Lines.” About this date, or very soon
after, a few of us were sitting in the part of the trenches occupied by
the Twenty-first Mississippi, of our old brigade,—Barksdale's, now
Humphreys',—which was supporting our guns. There had been a
number of Yale men in the Twenty-first—the Sims, Smiths,
Brandon, Scott, and perhaps others. A good many were “gone,” and
those of us who were left were talking of them and of good times at
Old Yale, when some one said, “Scott, isn't it your turn to
go to the spring?” “Yes,” said Scott, submissively, “I believe it is.
Pass up your canteens,” and he loaded up and started out. There
was a particularly exposed spot on the
way to water, which we had tried in vain to protect more perfectly,
and we heard, as usual, two or three rifle shots as Scott passed that
point. In due time we heard them again as he returned, and one of
the fellows said, “Ha! they are waking up old Scott, again, on the
home stretch.”</p>
          <p>The smile had not died upon our faces when a head appeared
above the traverse and a business-like voice called:
<pb id="stiles293" n="293"/>
“Hello, Company I; man of yours dead out here!” We ran around
the angle of the work, and there lay poor Scott, prone in the ditch
and almost covered with canteens. We picked him up and bore him
tenderly into the trench, and, as we laid him down and composed
his limbs, manly tears
dropped upon his still face. Each man disengaged and took his own
canteen from the slumbering water-carrier. We did not “pour the
water out unto the Lord,” as David did when the “three mightiest
brake through the host of the Philistines and drew water out of the
well of Bethlehem that was by the gate”—albeit, in a truer sense
than David spoke, this water was the very “blood of this man.”</p>
          <p>It was about six o'clock in the evening of one of the days that
followed close upon the great fight that there befell the
company the very saddest loss it had yet experienced. An order had
come to Captain McCarthy, from General Alexander, commanding
the artillery corps, directing that the effect of the fire of several
howitzers, which were operating as mortars, from a position
immediately back of the Howitzer guns, should be carefully
observed and reported to him.</p>
          <p>The captain, appreciating at once the responsibility and the peril of
the work, with characteristic chivalry, determined to divide it
between himself and one of the most competent and careful men in
the company. He was not the man to shrink, or slur over, or
postpone his own part in any duty, and immediately stationed
himself where he could thoroughly discharge it. He had taken his
stand but a few moments when he fell back among his men, his brain
pierced by a sharpshooter's bullet. The detachment sprang to his
aid, but too
late even to prevent his fall. His broad breast heaved once or twice
as they knelt about him, and it was all over. The men broke down
utterly and sobbed like children.</p>
          <p>We never found his hat. While his boys were still gazing at him
through their tears a Mississippi soldier came
working his way along the lines, from a point a hundred feet or more
to the right, holding in his hand a little piece of brass, and as he
approached the group said: “This here thing has just fell at my feet.
I reckon it belongs to some of you artillery fellows;” and then,
looking at the
<pb id="stiles294" n="294"/>
noble figure stretched upon the ground, he asked in the dry, matter-of-fact
soldier style, “Who's that's dead?” When we told him
Captain McCarthy, of the Howitzers, he said musingly: “McCarthy,
McCarthy; why, that's the name of the folks that took care o' me,
when I was wounded so bad last year. Well, here's the cannons from
his hat.” And so it was; his hat, as we suppose, had gone over the
works, and his badge of cross cannon, dislodged from it by the
shock, had fallen at the feet of a man who had been nursed back to
life by his mother and sisters in his boyhood's home.</p>
          <p>In a few moments his men bore him to where he could be placed
in an ambulance, and then all, save his cousin, Dan, afterwards
Lieutenant McCarthy, who went into Richmond with his body,
turned back to the lines with such choking of grief and heaviness of
heart as they had never before felt.</p>
          <p>It is seldom a man is so beloved or so deserves to be. I can truly
say I never heard him utter an evil word concerning any one, and
never heard from any one either adverse criticism or complaint of
him. A day or two before, on that very spot, he had shown what a
true hero he was. Just after the great repulse, and while a fearful fire
was pouring upon us from the Federal batteries and such of their
assaulting infantry as had succeeded in reaching their own works, a
poor wretch, who had fallen just outside our works, was shrieking
for help. The Captain, deeply stirred, cried: “Boys, I can't stand this.
I don't order any of you to accompany me; but, as I can't well
manage him alone, I call for one volunteer to go with me and bring in
that poor fellow.” Several volunteered, but Sergeant, afterwards
Lieutenant, Moncure said, “You can't go, boys; I am chief of this
piece,” and he and the Captain went right over the works, and,
picking up the man, brought him back inside, but be was dead before
they laid him down. He had been killed by the fire of his own friends.</p>
          <p>Such was death upon the lines; but let me show what all this meant
to the people at home. General Kershaw very willingly furnished Dan
an ambulance and a man from his old brigade to drive it, and the two
started on their melancholy journey. Counting the
necessary turn-outs in the road,
<pb id="stiles295" n="295"/>
which was badly cut up by army wagons, they had some twelve or
thirteen miles to travel, and it must have been after seven o'clock
before they started. Meanwhile, at the Captain's father's home, in the
northern part of the city, were his mothers and sisters, his father, an
aged man, suffering from a disease which had robbed him of the power
of speech and forced him to breathe through a tube, and a younger
brother, under military age, who was his father's constant attendant
and nurse, and who slept with him at night. This brother was roused
that night from his first nap by loud shouts on the street and a
rough, startling, disagreeable noise made, as he thought, by running
a stout stick backwards and forwards across the wooden palings of
the front fence. Going to the window the lad hesitated for a moment
to throw up the sash, the streets of a beleaguered city at night being,
of course, not entirely free from prowlers and disorder. What he saw
was a man holding a horse, from which he had evidently just
dismounted, and who had been making these noises for the purpose
of rousing the people in the house. As the sash went up the man
said: “Captain McCarthy was killed on the lines a while ago. If you
want his body you had better send for it to-night, or he may be
buried on the field.” As he said this, he remounted and was gone.</p>
          <p>The house was instantly in a turmoil, but the inmates soon
recovered reasonable balance, and in a short time the lad was off
after a horse and wagon for the sad errand. At first he could not
think where he might get one, but it soon occurred to him that he
had seen upon the streets within a few days a new wagon of “John
and George Gibson, Builders,” and he went to Mr. George Gibson's
house and waked him. Upon hearing the sad news, Mr. Gibson
kindly consented not only to let him have the wagon, but to go with
him to the lines. He added, however, that the horse and vehicle were
kept at a considerable distance from his house and that, as the night
threatened to be stormy, young McCarthy had better go home and
get some proper wraps and protections and meet him at an
appointed place and time. As the boy reached home, or soon after,
an ambulance drove up to the door
<pb id="stiles296" n="296"/>
and his Cousin Dan and the South Carolina soldier bore the
Captain's body into the house. As soon as they had deposited it and
helped the family to arrange it as they desired, Dan kissed his uncle,
aunt, and cousins, and was bidding them good-by, when the old
gentleman made signs for him to remain a moment and asked for
pencil and paper. When these were given him he wrote just these
words and handed them to Dan—“Since it was God's will to take
him, I am glad he died at his post.”</p>
          <p>Dan was back at his post by daylight, and sent word to the
Captain's two brothers, who were in another corps, when he would
be buried. These young men walked into town, attended the funeral,
and walked out again to their posts the same night, and in a very
short time the lad who had been his father's nurse was regularly
mustered into the company to which his elder brothers belonged.
Such was death, and also life, in the devoted city back of the lines.</p>
          <p>My younger brother was a great favorite in the company. As
before stated, he had been a sailor, and as we had come from New
England to Virginia, he was nicknamed “Skipper.” He had a beautiful
tenor voice and a unique repertoire of songs from almost every
clime and country. Whenever “Skipper” deigned to sing, “the
Professor,” the trainer of the Glee Club, would enforce absolute
silence throughout the camp, under penalty of a heavy battery of
maledictions.</p>
          <p>The day after Captain McCarthy's death, my brother, being in
almost the exact position the Captain occupied when killed, was
shot in the left temple, and fell just where the captain had fallen. I
was not present at the moment, but the boys reported that as they
bent over him, thinking him dead, he raised his head and said, “If
you fellows will stand back and give me some air, I'll get up!”— 
which he not only did, but walked out to the hospital camp, refusing
a litter. He also refused to take chloroform, and directed the
surgeons in exploring the track of the ball, which had crushed up his
temple and the under half of the socket of his eye, and lodged
somewhere in behind his nose. After they had extracted the ball and
a great deal of crushed bone, he declared there was something else
in his head which must come out. The surgeons
<pb id="stiles297" n="297"/>
told him it was more crushed bone which would come away
of itself after awhile; but he insisted it was something that did not
belong there, and that they must take it away immediately. They
remonstrated, but he would not be satisfied, and finally they probed
further and drew out a piece of his hat brim, cut just the width of the
ball and jammed like a wad into his head; after that he was much
easier. I omitted to say we never found his hat, either.</p>
          <p>He was blind in the left eye from the moment the ball struck him,
and became for a time blind in the other eye also. While in utter
darkness he sang most of the time, and I remember our dear mother
was troubled by a fancy that, like a mocking bird she once had that
went blind in a railroad train, he might sing himself to death. But he
recovered the sight of his right eye after a time, and the marvel is
that the left eye did not shrink away and was not even discolored.
The bony formation of the under-socket of the eye grew up and
rectified itself almost entirely, and a lock of his curly hair covered the
desperate-looking wound in the temple. It was a wonderful recovery.</p>
          <p>There was a gunner in Calloway's battery named Allen Moore, a
backwoods Georgian and a simple-hearted fellow, but a noble,
enthusiastic man and soldier. The only other living member of
Moore's family was with him, a lad of not more than twelve or
thirteen years; and the devotion of the elder brother to the younger
was tender as a mother's. The little fellow was a strange, sad,
prematurely old child, who seldom talked and never smiled. He used
to wear a red zouave fez that ill-befitted the peculiar, sallow-pallid
complexion of the piney-woods Georgian; but he was a perfect hero
in a fight.</p>
          <p>After the great repulse it looked for a time as if Grant had some
idea of digging up to or mining our position. We had all day been
shelling a suspicious-looking working party of the enemy, and
about sunset I was visiting the batteries to see that the guns were
properly arranged for night firing. As I approached Calloway's
position the sharpshooting had almost ceased, and down the line I
could see the figures of the cannoneers standing out boldly
<pb id="stiles298" n="298"/>
against the sky. Moore was at the trail adjusting his piece for the
night's work. His gunnery had been superb during the evening and
his blood was up.</p>
          <p>I descended into a little valley and lost sight of the group, but
heard Calloway's stern voice: “Sit down, Moore! Your gun is well
enough; the sharpshooting is not over yet. Get down!” I rose the
hill. “One moment, Captain! My trail's a hair's breadth too much to
the right,” and the gunner bent eagerly over the hand-spike. A
sharp report and that unmistakable crash of a bullet against a man's
head. It was the last rifle shot on the lines that night.</p>
          <p>The rushing together of the detachment obstructed my view; but
as I came up the sergeant stepped aside and said, “See there,
Adjutant!” Moore had fallen on the trail, the blood flowing from his
wound all over his face. His little brother was at his side instantly.
No wildness, no tumult of grief. He knelt on the earth, and, lifting
Allen's head on his knees, wiped the blood from his forehead with
the cuff of his own tattered shirt-sleeve and kissed the pale face
again and again, but very quietly. Moore was evidently dead, and
none of us cared to disturb the child.</p>
          <p>Presently he rose,—quiet still, tearless still,—gazed down at his
dead brother, then around at us, and breathing the saddest sigh I
ever heard, said: “Well, I am alone in the world!”</p>
          <p>The preacher-captain sprang to his side, and placing his hand on
the poor lad's shoulder, said confidently: “No, my child; you are not
alone, for the Bible says: ‘When my father and my mother forsake
me, then the Lord will take me up;’ and Allen was both father and
mother to you; besides, I am going to take you up, too; you shall
sleep under my blanket to-night.”</p>
          <p>There was not a dry eye in the group; and when, months
afterwards, the whole battalion gathered on a quiet Sabbath evening,
on the banks of Swift Creek, to witness a baptism, and Calloway, at the
water's edge, tenderly handed this child to the officiating minister, and
receiving him again when the ceremony was over, threw a blanket
about the little shivering form, carried him into a thicket, changed his
clothing, and then reappeared, carrying the bundle of wet
<pb id="stiles299" n="299"/>
clothes, and he and the child walked away, hand in hand, to camp— 
then there were more tears, manly, ennobling tears, and the sergeant
laid his hand on my shoulder and said, “Faith, Adjutant, the Captain
has fulfilled his pledge to that boy!”</p>
          <p>In one of the regiments of Kershaw's old brigade, which was
supporting our guns at Cold Harbor, were three young men,
brothers, whose cool daring in battle attracted our special
admiration. We did not know the names of these gallant fellows, but
had christened them “Tom, Dick, and Harry.” A day or two after the
great fight a fourth and youngest, a mere lad, who had been
wounded at the Wilderness, came on his crutches to visit his
brothers, and they had a hard time getting him safely into the trench.
We noticed they called him “Fred.” He was going home on what the
soldiers called “a wounded furlough;” that is, a furlough granted
because of a wound, to last until the man should be fit for service
again; and as the lines were quiet in the sultry noon, except, of
course, the spiteful sputter of the sharpshooters, all the men from
his neighborhood were soon busy painfully scribbling on scraps of
paper and in the cramped trenches, letters for Fred to carry home.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile, “Tom, Dick, and Harry” surrounded their pet, as he
evidently was; and indeed he was a lovely thing. We had not
specially noted that the other young men were gentlemen. In fact,
that did not so specially appear through the dirt and rags. We had
readily seen they were “men,” and that was what counted in those
days.</p>
          <p>But Fred—all the dirt was off of him, and the rags, too, and the
sunburn, and the squalor—they were all gone. The Richmond
ladies who had attended to his wounds in the hospital had seen to
his toilet as well, which was simple and strictly military, but of the
best material and fitted perfectly his perfect figure. His thin skin, his
blue veins, his small, finely-formed hands and feet, his beautiful
manners—everything, in fact—indicated that he was the scion of a
noble house, the flower of South Carolina chivalry. In short, he was
the most thoroughbred and aristocratic-looking thing any of us

<pb id="stiles300" n="300"/>
of us and in the midst of our surroundings, he glowed like a fair
seraph.</p>
          <p>After a while he warned the writers that the mail was about to
close and they must bring in their letters; that his “old leg” was
hurting him and he must be off. The men gathered around. His
haversack was filled with the priceless letters, head and heart
crowded to confusion with trite messages, inestimably precious to
those at home. He rose with a smile of weariness and pain, yet bright
anticipation, and, as he did so, said, “Well, let me take a good look at
those rascals over the way; for it will be a long time before I get
another chance.”</p>
          <p>“Look out, Fred!”</p>
          <p>Too late! The sharp shock of the bullet against the skull—he sprang up
wildly, his cap flew off and his brothers caught him
in their arms and laid him gently down. The home letters tumbled
out of the full haversack and were dabbled with the blood of the
postman; his brothers knelt about him, in a silent grief awful to look
upon, and heavy-hearted comrades gathered up each his blood-stained package
and gazed vacantly at it.</p>
          <p>During the great gathering of Confederate soldiers at the
dedication of the Lee Monument, in Richmond, I told this story of
his Cold Harbor lines and his old brigade to General Kershaw, when
Gen. Joseph E. Johnston happened to be sitting near. It was too
much for General Johnston. Tears started to his eyes and he
reproved me sharply for telling a story that had in it only dead,
unrelieved pain. He added that he must “take the taste of that thing
out of our mouths as quickly as possible;” and, as sharpshooting
seemed to be the theme, he would repeat to us a practical lecture on
that subject which he once heard delivered by an expert to a novice.</p>
          <p>He said it was during the Atlanta campaign that he was sitting in
a clump of laurel on the north face of a mountain, out beyond the
bounds of his own lines, sweeping with a glass the lines and camps
of Sherman's army, which were spread out before him upon the plain
below. He had been deeply absorbed and was suddenly startled by
hearing conversation in a low tone comparatively near him. He sat
<pb id="stiles301" n="301"/>
absolutely still and peered about, until, to his great relief, he saw two
gray-brown figures stretched out side by side on the leaves but a
little distance in front of him. One was a grizzled, fire-seamed veteran,
and the other a beardless youth, and the elder addressed the
younger, in substance, as follows:</p>
          <p>“Now, Charley, when you ain't in a fight, but just shootin' so; of
course you ought to get a fellow off by himself, before you let fly.
Then the next thing is to see what you need most of anything. If it's
clothes, why, of course, you choose a fellow of your own size; but if
it's shoes you want, you just pick out the very littlest weevil-eaten
chap you can find. Your feet would slide 'round in the shoes of a
Yankee as big as you are like they was in flat-boats. Why, no longer
ago than last evening I had drawed a bead on a fine, great big buck
of a fellow, but just as I was about to drop him I looked around and
found I didn't have no shoes. So I let him pass, and pretty soon here
come along a little cuss of an officer, and”—raising his right foot, as
the old general did his, by way of vivid recital and illustration— 
<hi rend="italics">“there's the boots.”</hi></p>
          <p>A word or two as to the volume, intensity, and effect of the fire at
Cold Harbor. So far as the Confederate fire is concerned, nothing
can be needed to supplement the fearful
record of the slaughter upon the Federal side. But now
as to the
Federal fire, and first, of artillery. I think the barn just back of the
positions of Manly's guns and two of the Howitzers' was Ellyson's.
It was cut down, cut up and scattered, and the very ground so torn
and ploughed by artillery
fire that it was really difficult, after the battle was over, to say just
where the barn had stood. Just back of this barn
trees were so constantly felled across the road opened for the
purpose of bringing in ammunition that it was necessary
to have axe-men constantly at hand, and they were chopping almost
continuously. Once or twice the falling trees and limbs actually
drove the division pioneer corps from the work and I was forced to
get a detail from the Howitzers to do the necessary chopping.</p>
          <pb id="stiles302" n="302"/>
          <p>As to musketry fire, I remember counting ninety odd bullet
holes through a “dog tent,” which was stretched immediately
back of Calloway's guns, and he walked backward and forward
between this tent and his pieces during the great attack. Though he
did not leave the field, he was wounded in several places, and his
clothes looked as if he had been drawn through a briar patch. His
field glasses were smashed by a bullet and the guard of his revolver
shot away. It is fair to say the same ball may have made two holes
through Calloway's little tent; but on the other hand, many balls may
have passed through the same hole.</p>
          <p>When we left Cold Harbor all our bronze guns looked is if they
had had smallpox, from the striking and splaying of leaden balls
against them. Even the narrow lips of the pieces, about their muzzles,
were indented in this way. One of the guns, I think of Manly's
battery, was actually cut down by musketry fire, every spoke of both
wheels being cut. Indeed, I had an extra wheel brought and
substituted for that which first became useless, and this also shared
the same fate. It is my desire and purpose to speak accurately,
and therefore I take occasion to say that I do not intend to imply that
all the spokes were completely severed and cut in two separate
parts. Some of them were and others were not, but these latter were
so frayed and splintered that the wheel would not stand straight and
could no longer be used as a wheel. Much of the other wood work
of this and other guns was badly split and splintered by musket
balls, and some of the lighter iron parts and attachments were shot
away.</p>
          <p>The particular gun referred to was finally rendered absolutely
useless for the rest of the fight. The men had worked it, for the most
part, upon their hands and knees. How many of them were killed and
wounded I do not recall;  but one lieutenant was killed and one
wounded, while directing, if I remember rightly, the fire of this gun
and the one next to it.</p>
          <p>After the fight it was necessary for some purpose to tip this gun,
when a quantity of lead, exactly how much I would not like to say,
but I should think more than a handful,
<pb id="stiles303" n="303"/>
poured out of the muzzle upon the ground. The gun carriage, with
two of its wheels, was carried into Richmond and hung up in the
arsenal as an evidence of what musketry fire might be and do. Dr.
Gaines, of Gaines' Mill, whom I knew very well, had the other wheel
carried to his house. I saw it there a few years later. The hub and tire
had actually fallen apart.</p>
          <p>A brief epitome of some of the salient features and results of the
campaign of 1864, from the Wilderness to Cold Harbor, inclusive,
may not be devoid of interest.</p>
          <p>The campaign covered, say sixty miles of space and thirty days of
time. General Lee had a little under 64,000 men of all arms present for
duty at the outset, and he put <hi rend="italics"><foreign lang="fre">hors de combat</foreign></hi> of Grant's army an
equal number man for man. Mr. Swinton, p. 482 of his “Army of the
Potomac,” puts Grant's loss at “above sixty thousand men;” so that
Grant lost in killed and wounded and prisoners more than a
thousand men per mile and more than two thousand men per day
during the campaign.</p>
          <p>Again, Lee had, as stated, at the start, present for duty, less than
64,000 men, and the reinforcements he received numbered 14,400
men; so that, from first to last, he had under his command in this
campaign, say 78,400 men; while Grant had at the start, present for
duty, 141,160 men, and the reinforcements he received numbered
51,000 men; so that from first to last he had under his command in
this campaign, say 192,160 men.</p>
          <p>Now, Grant's one desire and effort was to turn Lee's either flank,
preferably his right flank, and thus get between him and Richmond.
To accomplish this purpose, with his preponderance of numbers, he
might have left man for man in Lee's front, and at the same time
thrown an army of 77,000 to 114,000 on his flank, and yet he utterly
failed to get around or to crush that inevitable, indomitable flank.</p>
          <p>From what I have read and heard of Grant, and the opinion I have
formed of him, it is my belief that if this proposition had been put to
him he would have admitted candidly that he would not have dared
to leave man for man in Lee's front; that it would have been utterly
unsafe for him to do
<pb id="stiles304" n="304"/>
so—a statement I am certainly not prepared to dispute. Well, then;
he might have left two for one in front of Lee, and still have had free
from 13,000 to 36,000 men with which to turn his flank—and yet he
failed utterly to turn it.</p>
          <p>The figures here used are those of Col. Walter Taylor, and are
less favorable to Lee than those of most of the Confederate
authorities upon the war. General Early, for example, says that Lee, at
the outset, had less than 50,000 effectives of all arms under his
command.</p>
          <p>It is not my purpose to accentuate this contrast in any unfair or
unpleasant way, and yet an intelligent soldier of the Army of
Northern Virginia, who fought at Chancellorsville in 1863, and again
from the Rapidan to Cold Harbor in 1864, cannot but set opposite to
the picture just sketched that of Lee holding the front of Hooker's
92,000 with “scant 14,000 muskets,” while with about one-third (1-3)
his numbers he utterly crushed the right flank and rear of Hooker's
great host. It should not be forgotten in this connection, and in
endeavoring to form a just estimate of Lee's operations throughout
this campaign of '64, that in the death of Jackson, Lee had lost his
great offensive right arm, to which, at Chancellorsville and
theretofore, he had looked to carry into execution his confounding
strategies and his overpowering, resistless attacks.</p>
          <p>This last suggestion was made as bearing upon a just and
balanced view of the campaign in general, as well as an estimate of
the ability displayed by Lee in the conduct of it. I ask leave to submit
one other reflection of like general bearing, as well as tending to
explain and relieve what may be regarded as adverse criticism of
Grant. I said the soldiers of the Army of Northern Virginia did not
generally consider Grant as a great strategist or maneuverer. His
friends have entered for him a plea by way of confession and
avoidance of this negative indictment—a good, sound plea. We
cannot demur to it, and the Court of Impartial History will never
strike it out as immaterial or improper, nor record a verdict that it is
false.</p>
          <p>I have not before me just now General Badeau's life of his chief,
but in it he, in effect, says that Grant did not
<pb id="stiles305" n="305"/>
maneuver against the Army of Northern Virginia, because he found
maneuvering of no avail against that army. Other Federal generals
have made in substance the same remark. Maneuvering differs from
fighting as a force in
war, in this, that fighting is purely physical, while maneuvering gets
in its work largely upon the moral plane. Its most deadly and
disastrous effect is wrought by the destruction of confidence;
confidence of the out-maneuvered general in himself and in his army,
of the out-maneuvered army in itself and in its general.</p>
          <p>In the case of Lee's army none of these consequences followed,
when, for example, its huge adversary overlapped it upon
one flank or upon both; or even turned its flank and
took it in reverse—a thing which actually happened at least once in
this campaign, when Hancock, on the 10th of May, at Spottsylvania,
marched clean and clear around our left flank, and even, for a time,
drove us in the fighting there. The men in our line fully appreciated
what was happening, and yet there was not the slightest trepidation.
Billy chanced to be standing near two intelligent infantry soldiers who
were listening to and looking at the steady progression of the fire
and the smoke of the fight, further and further in our rear, and quietly
discussing the situation. At a sudden swell of musketry one of them,
removing his pipe from his mouth and spitting upon the ground,
said, “Look here, Tom, if those fellows should get much further
around there we would be in a bad fix here; we'd have to get out of
this.”</p>
          <p>“Law, John!” said his friend, “Marse Robert'll take care of those
fellows. He knows just what to do.”</p>
          <p>So we all felt, and if he had deemed it best and so ordered, we would have
fought just as steadily in two lines, back to
back and facing both ways.</p>
          <p>Two days later the gallant Hancock made further and, if possible,
higher proof of the soundness of Grant's plea,
and of the steadfast, indomitable courage of the Army of Northern
Virginia, when after bursting through its center with 40,000 men and
taking and holding the “Bloody Angle,” embracing, perhaps,
counting both sides, approximately two miles of its line, and
capturing the infantry and
<pb id="stiles306" n="306"/>
the artillery that defended it, he yet found himself unable to advance
one foot beyond the point where the first impulse had carried him, in
the darkness and surprise, and he encountered, across the base of
the salient and at each extremity of the captured line, troops as
staunch and sturdy and unconquerable as any he had ever met in
battle.</p>
          <p>It is this quality or condition, or habit of mind and conduct, of
which different Federal officers have spoken under different names,
in expressing their high estimate of the Army of Northern Virginia. It
is this which General Hooker terms “discipline,” in his remarkable
testimony before the Committee on the Conduct of the War, already
quoted, in the course of which, speaking of Lee's army, he said “* * *
that army has by discipline alone acquired a
character for steadiness and efficiency unsurpassed, in my
judgment, in ancient or modern times.”</p>
          <p>It has been said, and it may be true in a certain sense, to the
honor and glory of the private soldiers of that immortal army, that
the army made the general and made for him his world-wide fame;
that General Lee throughout his great career wielded an unrivalled
weapon, a weapon of perfect temper and of finest edge,—but it has
also been said, and it is also true, perhaps in a yet higher sense, that
the general made the army; that the weapon was wielded by an
unrivalled swordsman, a swordsman of dauntless courage and of
matchless skill.</p>
          <p>We are free to admit that, in our view, the explanation of all this is
to be found largely in the fact that the relation
between our general and our army was constant and permanent,
undissolved and indissoluble; that we grew to be, as
it were, one body dominated by one great inspiring soul;
and that we came to look with wonder, not unmixed with
pity, upon the contrasted condition of the opposing Federal army,
with generals jealous of and plotting against each other, and the
Government forever pulling down one and putting up another. Nor
are we small enough to be unappreciative of the manhood which
could and did, even under such unfavorable circumstances, exhibit
the loyalty and courage which the Army of the Potomac exhibited
upon many a hard-fought field.</p>

          <head>FROM COLD HARBOR TO EVACUATION OF RICHMOND AND
PETERSBURG</head>
          <argument>
            <p>Grant's Change of Base—Petersburg Proves to Be His Immediate Objective— 
Lee Just in Time to Prevent the Capture of the City—Our
Battalion Stationed First in the Petersburg Lines, Then Between the

Artillery and Ordered to Chaffin's Bluff—The Battalion There

Trend of the Confederacy—“A Kid of the Goats” Gives
a Lesson in Pluck.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>The repulse at Cold Harbor marked a crisis in the campaign. If
Richmond was to continue to be Grant's immediate objective, there
was but one thing for him to do, and that was to fight,—to renew
his attack upon Lee's lines. He was as close to Richmond as he could
get by the old process of sliding southward and eastward. Every foot of further
progress in that
direction would be progress away from the goal. He must decide,
then, between another effort to force his men to the imminent deadly
breach and the abandonment of Richmond as his immediate
objective. It took him nine days to decide, and then he folded his
tents, like the Arabs, and silently stole away—at night, the night of
June 12th.</p>
          <p>He was just in time. It was not Lee's habit to give his
adversary the choice of moves, especially if he took long to choose.
He seldom abandoned the initiative—that is,
where at all practicable for him to retain it. He had only seemed to
abandon it this time. It would have been, even for him, an
astounding piece of audacity, with his worn and wasted little army,
to march out from his intrenchments and attack Grant's
overwhelming numbers, yet he had determined to do this very thing.
On page 37 of his address, so often quoted, General Early says:</p>
          <pb id="stiles308" n="308"/>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>Notwithstanding the disparity which existed, he was anxious, as I know, to
avail himself of every opportunity to strike an offensive blow; and just as
Grant was preparing to move across James River, with his defeated and
dispirited army, General Lee was maturing his plans for taking the offensive;
and in stating his desire for me to take the initiative with the corps I then
commanded, he said: “We must destroy this army of Grant's before he gets to
James River. If he gets there it will become a siege, and then it will be a mere
question of time.<corr>”</corr></p>
          </q>
          <p>It was the startling intelligence of Hunter's operations in the
Valley which prevented the contemplated movement against Grant. It
became necessary to detach, first Breckenridge, and then Early, to
meet this new peril threatening Lee's communications. As Early's
corps was to have led the attack, and because it was worse than
hopeless to attack at all with his army thus seriously reduced, Lee
was compelled to abandon his cherished plan, and Grant retired
unmolested from Lee's front on the very night that Early received his
orders to move at three o'clock next morning for the Valley; so close
and critical was the sequence of events in these later days of the
struggle.</p>
          <p>When we waked on the morning of the 13th and found no enemy
in our front we realized that a new element had entered into this
move—the element of uncertainty. Thus far, during the campaign,
whenever the enemy was missing we knew where, that is, in what
direction and upon what line, to look for him; he was certainly
making for a point between us and Richmond. Not so now—even
Marse Robert, who knew everything knowable, did not appear to
know what his old enemy proposed to do or where he would be most
likely to find him.</p>
          <p>I remember I went across to the Federal works and was
surprised to see what a short distance they were from ours, and how
enormous and elaborate they looked in comparison. I have been all
over the opposing lines at Cold Harbor since the war,—so far as
they remain undisturbed,—and this latter impression has been
confirmed and strengthened. At some points it really seems as if the
Federal army had anticipated attack from every point, except the
skies, and fortified against them all.</p>
          <pb id="stiles309" n="309"/>
          <p>I have little or no recollection of our search for Grant, except that
there was nothing about it calculated to make an impression—that it
seemed rather a slow, stupid affair. Of course we crossed the
Chickahominy, and then we worked down toward Malvern Hill. I am
not even sure, however, whether we left the vicinity of Cold Harbor
on the 13th or waited a day or two in that neighborhood. We did not
cross the James River, I think, until the night of the 17th but from that
time everything seemed to have waked up, and though we saw no
enemy, yet we knew where he was, and that Petersburg was his
immediate objective and not Richmond, nor any point on James
River.</p>
          <p>We made a rapid all-night march, which was a very trying one, on
account of the heat and the heavy dust which covered everything
and everybody and rendered breathing all but impossible. We
stopped an hour or so to rest the horses—we did not so much regard
the men—and arrived in Petersburg in the early morning, our division
and our battalion being among the first of Lee's troops to arrive.
We were just in time to prevent Burnside from making an assault,
which would probably have given him the city. General Beauregard
had made admirable use of the scant force at his command and had
successfully repulsed all previous attacks, but he did not have a
garrison at all adequate to resist the countless thousands of Grant's
main army, which had now begun to arrive, and which seems to have
been deterred from the assault by the knowledge of our arrival.</p>
          <p>The whole population of the city appeared to be in the streets and
thoroughly alive to the narrow escape they had made. Though we
had done nothing save to come right along, after we found out
where to come, they seemed to be
overflowing with gratitude to us. Ladies, old and young, met us at
their front gates with hearty welcome, cool water, and delicious
viands, and did not at all shrink from grasping our rough and dirty
hands. There is nothing more inspiring to a soldier than to pass
through the streets of a city
he is helping to defend, and to be greeted as a deliverer by its
women and children. He would be a spiritless wretch
<pb id="stiles310" n="310"/>
indeed who could not be a hero after passing through a scene like
this. Grant's men did not seem to yearn for close contact with us
immediately after such an experience, and they did wisely to defer
that pleasure.</p>
          <p>We were not at once placed upon the lines, and some of us
witnessed scenes yet more intense when a command passed through
the streets which had in it what was left of several companies
originally recruited in Petersburg. Every now and then along the line
of march some squalid, tattered fellow, with dust-begrimed and sweat-stained
face, would dart out of the column, run up the steps to the
pillared porch of a fine old mansion and fling his arms about some
lovely, silver-haired matron, and fairly smother her with kisses; she
fervently returning his embrace, and following him with her blessing
as he hurried to catch up with the command and resume his place in
the ranks.</p>
          <p>My recollection is that we were placed in the works about
noon and remained only a few hours, never firing a shot nor
seeing an enemy; and then followed an experience unparalleled
since we left Leesburg in the spring of '62.  Our
guns were withdrawn late in the night and we passed back
through Petersburg, recrossed the Appomattox River, and
were stationed on the lines, between that and the James,
near the Dunn house, the Howitzers quartered in the house;
and there the battalion remained from say the 20th of June,
1864, until the 2d of April, 1865, <hi rend="italics">without ever so much as
firing a shot or being fired at by an enemy, </hi>except that I
have an indistinct recollection of our taking a rifled gun, I
think of Manly's battery, a little in advance and to the left
of our regular position, and taking a shot or two at the
astronomer or observer in General Butler's tower.  This
was really a little hard on that gentleman, as I am confident
he never did us any harm; but then I am equally confident
we did not do him any. On the contrary, we gave
him a little respite from his high and exalted position and
his exhausting observations.</p>
          <p>I said the experience was unparalleled. I refer of course to our being
placed in such a safe and easy position. Both the preceding winters
we had passed upon the advanced picket
<pb id="stiles311" n="311"/>
line of the army—while most of the artillery was quartered on the
railroad in comfortable winter camps. We were not responsible for
being now, as it were, “mustered out of service;” yet we could not
repress a vague feeling that, somehow, we were not doing our full
duty. Especially was this feeling intensified when, a few months later,
Mahone's division, which had been manning a very trying part of the
Petersburg lines, was brought over between the Appomattox and the
James to relieve Pickett's, which was sent north of the James. We
thought we had before seen men with the marks of hard service upon
them; but the appearance of this division of Mahone's, and
particularly of Finnegan's Florida brigade, with which we happened
to be most closely associated, made us realize, for the first time, what
our comrades in the hottest Petersburg lines were undergoing. We
were shocked at the condition, the complexion, the expression of the
men, and of the officers, too, even the field officers; indeed we could
scarcely realize that the unwashed, uncombed, unfed and almost
unclad creatures we saw were officers of rank and reputation in the
army. It was a great pleasure, too, to note these gallant fellows,
looking up and coming out, under the vastly improved conditions in
which they found themselves.</p>
          <p>Some time, I think in December, '64,—strange as it may appear, I
am not certain of the date,—I was promoted to be major of artillery,
and ordered on duty with the battalion of heavy artillery at Chaffin's
Bluff, on the north side of the James River, about ten or twelve miles
below Richmond, and about a mile below Drewry's Bluff, which was
on the south side. There were batteries of heavy guns on the shore
at both these points, the battalions manning them being also armed
with muskets, and our iron-clads were anchored in the river about
and between the two land batteries. These iron-clads were manned
by a body of marines and seamen under command of Admiral
Tucker. At the close of the campaign proper of 1864 all the troops
manning the defenses of Richmond who were not strictly of the
Army of Northern Virginia were under command of Lieutenant-General Ewell,
who was in charge of the Department of Richmond. The
<pb id="stiles312" n="312"/>
heavy artillery battalions on the river—the Chaffin's Bluff battalion
among them—and the local troops manning the parts of the line
adjacent thereto constituted the division of Gen. Custis Lee, eldest
son of Gen. Robert E. Lee, a man of the highest character and an
officer of the finest culture and a very high order of ability. He did
not have a fair opportunity during the war, President Davis, of
whose staff he was a member, refusing to permit him to go to the
field, though he plead earnestly to do so. He was a most sensitive
and modest gentleman, and would have rejoiced to command even a
regiment in his father's army. After he was sent to the field, in the
modified way in which he was sent near the close of the war, he more
than once told me that every time he met one of his father's veteran
fighting colonels he felt compromised at having the stars and wreath
of a major-general on his collar.</p>
          <p>When I first went to Chaffin's, Colonel Hardaway, of the Field
Artillery of the Army of Northern Virginia, was in command, but, as I
remember, he left very soon. Some time before the end, Major
Gibbes, who had served with our battalion (Cabell's) during a part of
the campaign of '64, was sent there, and of course ranked me; but for
a considerable time I was in command of the post and of the
battalion, and of course was greatly interested in becoming
thoroughly acquainted with my duties and my men.</p>
          <p>They were splendid soldiers in external appearance and bearing. I
had never seen anything approximating to them in the field. Their
dress-parades, inspections, reports, salutes, bearing in the presence
of officers and on guard, were wonderfully regular, accurate, and
according to the drill and regulations. The mint, anise, and cumin
were most scrupulously tithed; but the weightier matters of the
soldier law,—patriotism, devotion, loyalty, fidelity, courage,
endurance,—how as to these? Perhaps the first day I was in command
the sergeant-major and acting-adjutant brought me his report, which
I looked over and found very satisfactory—until I came to the added
foot-note, that a first lieutenant and several non-commissioned
officers and men had “disappeared” the preceding day while on a
“wood detail” down the river.</p>
          <pb id="stiles313" n="313"/>
          <p>I recalled the adjutant and asked him what that entry meant. He
seemed surprised and did not answer promptly. Changing the form of
the question, I asked if it was possible it meant what it seemed to
mean, and he replied that it did. I made him sit down and tell me all he
knew of the matter, in the course of the conversation sending for his
book of reports and examining them for some time back. I saw no
entry quite so shocking as the report of the day, but found that
entries of like character were not infrequent; that every few days
these details were sent down the river to get wood and were in the
habit of meeting emissaries sent by the enemy for the purpose, who
offered them every inducement to desert; that these inducements
were embodied also in printed circulars, one of which was shown me.
I was horrified, and in the course of the next day or two made a
careful investigation into the character and condition of the
command, the result of which was anything but satisfactory.</p>
          <p>I hardly knew what to do, but, through the acting-adjutant who
turned out to be an excellent fellow and a trustworthy, useful, and
promising officer, I was enabled to secure a conference of the best
officers of the battalion, and in a long interview to secure their
confidence and co-operation, and we set to work together to change
the condition of things. I ingratiated myself, too, with the men by
doing away with a number of petty orders and regulations which
were annoying and burdensome, and instituting in their place a few
which were really important. Among other things I, of course, did
away with this down-the-river wood-detail.</p>
          <p>It is not worth while to particularize further. Suffice it to say, I
endeavored to impress upon the men three things: first, that I
already knew a great deal about them and expected and intended to
know them thoroughly; second, that
I was in command of them and expected and intended to be obeyed
implicitly; and third, that I was their friend and expected and
intended to do the very best I could for them in every way. I will only
add that I was deeply stirred, and put my whole heart and soul into
the matter and into my
<pb id="stiles314" n="314"/>
men, and that my efforts ultimately effected more than I had even
dared to hope; particularly in the line of securing the respect and
confidence and friendly regard of the men. The greatest difficulty
was encountered in the fact that not a few of the officers were utterly
worthless, and I determined to get rid of these, but as to this was
compelled to move slowly.</p>
          <p>One other measure adopted certainly ought to be mentioned.
There were a good many Christian men in the command, but they
seemed to have little or no social or public religious life. I had these
assembled for special, informal conference with the commanding
officer. I talked with them, in a general way, about the condition of
the command, and asked their interest and assistance in doing
everything possible to improve it and tone it up, and gave notice
that I would myself, whenever it was practicable, conduct a simple
religious service on Sunday evenings in our log church, to which all
were invited, but none would be compelled to attend. I believe this
little service conduced as much as any other means or measure to
such success as attended my efforts.</p>
          <p>I had but two unpleasant collisions with the men. One was a
simple, though aggravated, case of open disrespect to some
announcement or order having to do with the new order of things,
and which was read at dress-parade. This I punished on the spot,
and severely, and we never had any repetition of it. The other was a
more complicated and troublesome affair.</p>
          <p>The weather was very cold, and after I put a stop to the wood-detail
down the river, the men began cutting some of the standing
timber upon and back of the bluff; but orders were sent me by
competent authority forbidding this, and these orders were duly read
at dress-parade and also posted. I did the best I could to provide
wood, but the supply was inadequate, and the men really suffered. I
explained how much I regretted the situation and added that I fared
and should fare no better than they. I was compelled, of course, to
have fire in the adjutant's office, where writing must be done; but I
should have none in my house except when they had it in their
houses and no more wood than
<pb id="stiles315" n="315"/>
they had, and I urged the observance of the regulation against
cutting wood on the bluff, to which special importance seemed to be
attached by the authorities.</p>
          <p>The men were resentful and rebellious about this regulation
against felling trees. My order stopping the river wood-detail was the
obvious consequence of the disgraceful action of their comrades,
and that they did not seem to resent. But, one cold night, soon after
my special utterance about the preservation of the timber, while lying
awake in bed—very likely from cold—I heard the regular blows of two
axes upon a tree. I got up, dressed, and armed myself, and made my
way through the snow, guided by the sound, until I was close upon
two men who were chopping at a large tree which was about toppling
to its fall. I waited until it did fall and then came suddenly upon them.
They started to run, but I ordered them to halt, impressing the order
with my revolver, and adding that I knew them both. I reminded them
that they could not possibly plead ignorance of the order and asked
how they thought I ought to punish them, to which, of course, they
made no response. I then expressed deep sympathy with them;
adding that, though it would break up discipline to allow sympathy
with suffering to excuse flagrant violation of orders, yet as it was the
first offense, and they were so entirely in my power, and seemed to
admit the truth and force of all I had said, I had determined to take no
further notice of the matter. They thanked me profusely and were
about to return to their quarters, but I ordered them to remain and cut
up the tree for use; but that, of course, it should be divided among
the command or distributed by the quartermaster with his other
wood. I exacted from them a promise not only not to fell any more
trees themselves, but to do all in their power to put a stop to tree-cutting
by others. The two men told this story around the battalion,
with considerable amplification and adornment. It seemed to make an
unexpectedly strong and favorable impression and was one of the
definite things that aided the accomplishment of my intense desire to
<hi rend="italics">get hold</hi> of my men.</p>
          <p>Of course I greatly missed my old life, and especially its congenial
and often charming companionship. This life
<pb id="stiles316" n="316"/>
was comparatively solitary, but it was after all a life of greater power,
a life that meant more, and I was becoming deeply absorbed in it. I
felt more and more what a tremendous thing it was to have almost
absolute power over men and to be in a position where I could well-nigh
mould them to my will. Billy came over to see me after I had
gotten pretty well under way in my work, and seemed thoroughly to
agree with me about it; though it was shocking to him to be brought
into contact with soldiers of such a stamp and standard as I have
described.</p>
          <p>Colonel Hardaway's old battalion was composed of as fine
material as any in General Lee's army, and I did not wonder that he
preferred to return to it. Just before or just after we abandoned our
lines, General Alexander requested that both Major Gibbes and
myself should be sent to him, one to serve in Hardaway's battalion
and one in Haskell's. But Gen. Custis Lee, commanding our division,
declined to give up both of us, and as Gibbes ranked me, he had the
choice and went to Hardaway, while I remained with my Chaffin's
Bluff battalion, not only in command, but the only field officer
connected with it.</p>
          <p>I recall but one incident of these lines worth relating. After the
loss of Fort Harrison in September, '64, our picket line was retired
and the enemy's advanced, in front of the fort; but nearer the river
we still held our old line, and upon it a wooded knoll which
commanded a full view of the enemy's main line, and so was very
important to us and our tenure of it correspondingly annoying to
them. The Federal lines at this point were manned by negro troops.</p>
          <p>One evening, sitting on the knoll and looking toward Fort
Harrison, several hundred yards distant, I observed the negro picket
near the intersection of our old picket line and theirs, walking his
beat upon our line, instead of theirs, and so coming directly toward
me. Then he took his return beat toward the fort, but when he came
again he extended his beat further in my direction, and another man
followed him. So the next time there were three of them upon our
line, and I divined their purpose, which was by moral pressure, as it
were, to crowd us back from the knoll.</p>
          <pb id="stiles317" n="317"/>
          <p>I had only two men with me, but I dispatched one to General
Custis Lee, with a brief note of explanation, asking that fifty men be
sent me immediately. Meanwhile I mounted my remaining man on our
old picket line, faced toward Fort Harrison, and ordered him to walk
rapidly—I walking at his side—just inside the little curtain of earth.</p>
          <p>When the negroes saw us coming they turned back and I could
see the one nearest us was trembling as he heard our steps
approaching. When we came close upon him he turned, his face
actually ashy, and holding his gun in both hands horizontally, he
obtruded it toward us, at the same time backing away and saying:</p>
          <p>“ 'Tain't my fault. Officer ob de day tell me to come up dis way.”</p>
          <p>Noticing this revelation, but not remarking upon it, I picked up a
billet of wood and laid it across the top of the little work, between my
man and the negro, saying, “If that negro steps across that piece of
wood, shoot him; and if he steps off the line, on either side, shoot
him.”</p>
          <p>This broke up the little scheme. The negroes retired beyond the
intersection of the lines and I never saw one of them pass it again.</p>
          <p>During the seven months from September, '64, to March, '65,
inclusive, no intelligent man could fail to note the trend and progress
of events. The defeat of Hood, the fall of Atlanta, the unfortunate
expedition into Tennessee, the march of Sherman southward through
Georgia to the ocean, his march northward through the Carolinas to
Goldsboro, the fall of Savannah, of Charleston, of Wilmington—all
these and other defeats, losses, and calamities had left to the
Confederacy little save its Capital and the narrow strips of country
bordering on the three railroads that fed it. Of course I was—we all
were—thoroughly aware of this, and yet, though it may be difficult
now to realize it, we did not even approximate the failure of heart or
of hope. One of our dreams was that Lee, having the inner line,
might draw away from Grant, concentrate with Johnston, and crush
Sherman, and then, turning, the two might crush Grant. Yet we relied
not so much on any special plans or hopes,
<pb id="stiles318" n="318"/>
but rather upon the inherently imperishable cause, the inherently
unconquerable man. Fresh disaster each day did not affect our
confidence. We were quite ready to admit, indeed we had already
contemplated and discounted anything and everything this side of
the ultimate disaster; but that—<hi rend="italics">never!</hi></p>
          <p>This was emphatically my position. I well remember that after the
evacuation and on the retreat,—indeed but one day before Sailor's
Creek,—by permission, I left the line of march for an hour or so, to
see my mother, who was refugeeing in Amelia County, at the
country home of a prominent gentleman of Richmond, beyond
military age, who, when he
saw me, exclaimed:</p>
          <p>“Ah, Bob, my dear boy; it is all over!”</p>
          <p>“Over, sir?” said I, with the greatest sincerity; “over?
Why, sir, it has just begun. We are now where a good many of us
have for a good while longed to be: Richmond gone, nothing to take
care of, foot loose and, thank God, out of those miserable lines! Now
we may be able to get what we have longed for for months, a fair fight
in an open field. Let them come on, if they are ready for this, and the
sooner the better.”</p>
          <p>One very inclement day in the early spring of '65 I was leaving
Richmond, about four or five o'clock in the evening,
for the long, dreary, comfortless ride to Chaffin's Bluff. I cannot
recall ever having been so greatly depressed. I passed
Dr. Hoge's church and noticed the silent women in black streaming,
with bowed heads, from all points, toward the
sanctuary, and longed intently to enter with them; but I could not,
as it would detain me too long from my post. Every face was pale and
sad, but resolute and prayerful; while every window in the church— 
nay, every one in the doomed city—was shuddering with the deep
boom of artillery.</p>
          <p>I passed on down Main street and, where the terraced Libby Hill
Park now is, then a rough, unsightly place, I observed a little kid
cutting some unusual capers on the brink of a precipitous bluff. He
was evidently trying to force himself to make the perilous leap to the
street below, but shrank from the test. Two or three times he trotted
back a little
<pb id="stiles319" n="319"/>
from the brow, and ran forward; but he would swerve upon the very
brink, and then would stand, first upon his hind legs and then his
fore, and shake his pretty head, and bleat and b-a-a. At last he went
back farther, and coming on at prodigious speed, tried as before to
stop himself on the edge, but failed, and passing clear of the brow
and of all obstacles and projections, he did light, sure enough, in the
level street, and though a little shaken up, yet seemed to feel that he
had done a big thing and that all his troubles were behind him.</p>
          <p>The game little fellow curvetted and danced and pranced around
the very feet of my horse, seeming to strive to arrest my attention
and to say to me: “Do you not see—the jumping-off place is not the
end of all things? Never say die! If you must leave your present
position and jump off, do it like a man and make the best of it. The
end is not yet.”</p>

          </argument>
          <p>Not many weeks later, on Sunday, the 2d of April, I stood almost
all day on our works overhanging the river, listening to the fire about
Petersburg, and noting its peculiar character and progression. I made
up my mind what it meant, and had time and space out there alone
with God and upon His day to commit myself and mine to Him, and to
anticipate and prepare for the immediate future. Late in the afternoon
I walked back to my quarters, and soon after, George Cary Eggleston,
who was then in a command that held a part of the line near us,
dropped in. He tells me now that I asked him then what effect he
thought it would have upon our cause if our lines should be broken
and we compelled to give up Petersburg and Richmond; and that he
declined to answer the question because, as he said, the supposed
facts were out of the plane of the practical, and would not and could
not happen. Now, years afterwards, recalling the peculiar expression
and manner with which I propounded this interrogatory, he asks
whether I had then received any
official information, and I answer in the negative—no, none
<pb id="stiles321" n="321"/>
whatever. Up to the time Eggleston left my camp for his I knew
nothing beyond what my tell-tale ears and prescient soul had told
me.</p>
          <p>Indeed, we went into our meeting that night without any other
information; but I had directed the acting-adjutant to remain in his
office and to bring at once to me, in the church, any orders that
might come to hand. Our service was one of unusual power and
interest. I read with the men the “Soldier Psalm,” the ninety-first, and
exhorted
them, in any special pressure that might come upon us in the near
future—the “terror by night” or the “destruction * * * at noon-day”— 
to abide with entire confidence in that
“Stronghold,” to appropriate that “Strength.”</p>
          <p>As I uttered these words, I noticed a well-grown, fine-looking
country lad named Blount, who was leaning forward, and gazing at
me with eager interest, while tears of
sympathy and appreciation were brimming his eyes. The door
opened and the adjutant appeared. I told him to stand a moment
where he was, and as quietly as possible told the
men what I was satisfied was the purport of the paper he held in his
hand, and why I was so satisfied. And then we prayed for the
realization of what David had expressed in that Psalm—for faith, for
strength, for protection. After the prayer I called for the paper and
read it over, first silently and then aloud, gave brief directions to the
men and dismissed them—first calling upon such officers and
noncommissioned officers as had special duties to perform in
connection with the magazines, etc., to remain a few moments. The
men were ordered to rendezvous at a given hour, and to fall in by
companies on the parade, and the company officers
were ordered to see that they brought with them, only what was
absolutely necessary, and a brief approximate list was given of the
proper campaign outfit. But the poor fellows had been many months
in garrison, and it was maddening
work, within a short and fixed time, to select from their motley
accumulations what was really necessary in the changed
conditions ahead of us.</p>
          <p>The orders were, in general, that the men of the fleet and of the
James River defenses should leave the river about
<pb id="stiles322" n="322"/>
midnight of the 2d of April, exploding magazines and ironclads, and
join the Army of Northern Virginia in its retreat. Orders such as these
were enough to try the mettle even of the best troops, in the highest
condition, but for my poor little battalion they were overwhelming,
well-nigh stupefying. The marvel is that they held together at all and
left the Bluff, as they did, in pretty fair condition. A few months
earlier I question whether they would have been equal to it.</p>
          <p>I said they left in pretty fair condition, and so they did, except that
they had more baggage piled upon their backs than any one brigade,
perhaps I might say division, in General Lee's army was bearing at
the same moment. I could hardly blame them, and there was no time
to correct the folly; besides, I knew it would correct and adjust itself,
as it had done pretty well by morning.</p>
          <p>The explosions began just as we got across the river. When the
magazines at Chaffin's and Drury's Bluffs went off, the solid earth
shuddered convulsively; but as the ironclads—one after another— 
exploded, it seemed as if the very dome of heaven would be
shattered down upon us. Earth and air and the black sky glared in the
lurid light. Columns and towers and pinnacles of flame shot upward
to an amazing height, from which, on all sides, the ignited shells flew
on arcs of fire and burst as if bombarding heaven. I distinctly
remember feeling that after this I could nevermore be startled—no, not
by the catastrophes of the last great day.</p>
          <p>I walked in rear of the battalion to prevent straggling and, as the
successive flashes illumined the darkness, the blanched faces and
staring eyes turned backward upon me spoke volumes of nervous
demoralization. I felt that a hare might shatter the column.</p>
          <p>We halted at daylight at a country cross-road in Chesterfield to
allow other bodies of troops to pass, the bulk of my men lying down
and falling asleep in a grove; but seeing others about a well in the
yard of a farm house over the way, I deemed it best to go there to
see that nothing, was unnecessarily disturbed.</p>
          <p>I sat in the porch, where were also sitting an old couple, evidently
the joint bead of the establishment, and a young
<pb id="stiles323" n="323"/>
woman dressed in black, apparently their daughter, and, as I soon
learned, a soldier's widow. My coat was badly torn, and the young
woman kindly offering to mend it, I thanked her and, taking it off,
handed it to her. While we were chatting, and groups of men sitting
on the steps and lying about the yard, the door of the house opened
and another young woman appeared. She was almost beautiful, was
plainly but neatly dressed, and had her hat on. She had evidently
been weeping and her face was deadly pale. Turning to the old
woman, as she came out, she said, cutting her words off short,
“Mother, tell him if he passes here he is no husband of mine,”
and
turned again to leave the porch. I rose, and placing myself directly in
front of her, extended my arm to prevent her escape. She drew back
with surprise and indignation. The men were alert on the instant, and
battle was joined.</p>
          <p>“What do you mean, sir?” she cried.</p>
          <p>“I mean, madam,” I replied, “that you are sending your husband
word to desert, and that I cannot permit you to do this in the
presence of my men.”</p>
          <p>“Indeed! and who asked your permission, sir? And pray, sir, is he
your husband or mine?”</p>
          <p>“He is your husband, madam, but these are my soldiers. They and
I belong to the same army with your husband, and I cannot suffer
you, or any one, unchallenged, to send such a demoralizing message
in their hearing.”</p>
          <p>“Army! do you call this mob of retreating cowards an army?
Soldiers! if you are soldiers, why don't you stand and fight the
savage wolves that are coming upon us defenseless women and
children?”</p>
          <p>“We don't stand and fight, madam, because we are soldiers, and
have to obey orders, but if the enemy should appear on that hill this
moment I think you would find that these men are soldiers, and
willing to die in defense of women and children.”</p>
          <p>“Quite a fine speech, sir, but rather cheap to utter, since you very
well know the Yankees are not here, and won't be, till you've had
time to get your precious carcasses out of the way. Besides, sir, this
thing is over, and has been for some
<pb id="stiles324" n="324"/>
time. The Government has now actually run off, bag and baggage,— 
the Lord knows where,—and there is no longer any Government or
any country for my husband to owe allegiance to. He does owe
allegiance to me and to his starving children, and if he doesn't
observe this allegiance now, when <hi rend="italics">I need him,</hi> he needn't attempt it
hereafter when <hi rend="italics">he wants me.</hi>”</p>
          <p>The woman was quick as a flash and cold as steel. She was
getting the better of me. She saw it, I felt it, and, worst of all, the men
saw and felt it, too, and had gathered thick and pressed up close all
round the porch. There must have been a hundred or more of them,
all eagerly listening, and evidently leaning strongly to the woman's
side.</p>
          <p>This would never do.</p>
          <p>I tried every avenue of approach to that woman's heart. It was
congealed by suffering, or else it was encased in adamant. She had
parried every thrust, repelled every advance, and was now standing
defiant, with her arms folded across her breast, rather courting
further attack. I was desperate, and with the nonchalance of pure
desperation—no stroke of genius—I asked the soldier-question:</p>
          <p>“What command does your husband belong to?”</p>
          <p>She started a little, and there was a slight tinge of color in her face
as she replied, with a slight tone of pride in her voice:</p>
          <p>“He belongs to the Stonewall Brigade, sir.”</p>
          <p>I felt, rather than thought it—but, had I really found her heart?
We would see.</p>
          <p>“When did he join it?”</p>
          <p>A little deeper flush, a little stronger emphasis of pride.</p>
          <p>“He joined it in the spring of '61, sir.” <ref targOrder="U" id="ref4" n="4" rend="sc" target="note4">*</ref></p>
          <p>Yes, I was sure of it now. Her eyes had gazed straight into mine;
her head inclined and her eyelids drooped a little now, and there was
something in her face that was not pain
<note id="note4" n="4" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref4"><p>*The Stonewall Brigade was, of course, not so named until after the first
battle of Manassas, and it did not exist as an organization after May, 1864; but
men who had at any time belonged to one of the regiments that composed it
ever after claimed membership in the brigade. Among soldiers of the Army of
Northern Virginia, and yet more among their families and friends, once of
“The Stonewall Brigade,” always of that immortal corps.</p></note>
<pb id="stiles325" n="325"/>
and was not fight. So I let myself out a little, and turning to the men,
said:</p>
          <p>“Men, if her husband joined the Stonewall Brigade in '61, and
has been in the army ever since, I reckon he's a good soldier.”</p>
          <p>I turned to look at her. It was all over. Her wifehood had
conquered. She had not been addressed this time, yet she answered
instantly, with head raised high, face flushing, eyes flashing— </p>
          <p>“General Lee hasn't a better in his army!”</p>
          <p>As she uttered these words she put her hand in her bosom, and
drawing out a folded paper, extended it toward me, saying:</p>
          <p>“If you doubt it, look at that.”</p>
          <p>Before her hand reached mine she drew it back, seeming to have
changed her mind, but I caught her wrist, and without much
resistance, possessed myself of the paper. It had been much
thumbed and was much worn. It was hardly legible, but I made it out.
Again I turned to the men.</p>
          <p>“Take off your hats, boys, I want you to hear this with uncovered
heads”—and then I read an endorsement on application for furlough,
in which General Lee himself had signed a
recommendation of this woman's husband for a furlough of special
length on account of extraordinary gallantry in battle.</p>
          <p>During the reading of this paper the woman was transfigured,
glorified. No Madonna of old master was ever more sweetly radiant
with all that appeals to what is best and holiest in man. Her bosom
rose and fell with deep, quiet sighs; her eyes rained gentle, happy
tears.</p>
          <p>The men felt it all—<hi rend="italics">all.</hi> They were all gazing upon her, but the
dross was clean purified out of them. There was not upon any one of
their faces an expression that would have brought a blush to the
cheek of the purest womanhood on earth.</p>
          <p>I turned once more to the soldier's wife.</p>
          <p>“This little paper is your most precious treasure, isn't
it?”</p>
          <p>“It is.”</p>
          <pb id="stiles326" n="326"/>
          <p>“And the love of him whose manly courage and devotion won
this tribute is the best blessing God ever gave you, isn't it?”</p>
          <p>“It is.”</p>
          <p>“And yet, for the brief ecstasy of one kiss, you would disgrace
this hero-husband of yours, stain all his noble reputation, and turn
this priceless paper to bitterness; for the rear-guard would hunt him
from his own cottage, in half an hour, a deserter and a coward.”</p>
          <p>Not a sound could be heard save her hurried breathing. The rest
of us held even our breath.</p>
          <p>Suddenly, with a gasp of recovered consciousness she snatched
the paper from my hand, put it back hurriedly in her bosom, and
turning once more to her mother, said:</p>
          <p>“Mother, tell him not to come.”</p>
          <p>I stepped aside at once. She left the porch, glided down the path
to the gate, crossed the road, surmounted the fence with easy grace,
climbed the hill, and as she disappeared in the weedy pathway I
caught up my hat and said:</p>
          <p>“Now, men, give her three cheers.”</p>
          <p>Such cheers! O God! shall I ever again hear a cheer which bears a
man's whole soul in it?</p>
          <p>No Confederate soldier who was on and of that fearful retreat can
fail to recall it as one of the most trying experiences of his life. Trying
enough, in the mere fact that the Army of Northern Virginia was
flying before its foes, but further trying, incomparably trying, in lack
of food and rest and sleep, and because of the audacious pressure of
the enemy's cavalry. The combined and continued strain of all this
upon soft garrison troops, unenured to labor and hardship and
privation and peril, can hardly be conceived and cannot be
described. Its two most serious effects were <hi rend="italics">drowsiness and
nervousness.</hi> We crossed and left James River at midnight on
Sunday, were captured at Sailor's Creek about sundown on the
Thursday following, and I think rations were issued to us that night by
our captors. I do not say there was only one, but <hi rend="italics">I recall only one
issue of</hi>
<pb id="stiles327" n="327"/>
<hi rend="italics">rations between these limits,</hi> and we were marching all day and, as I
remember, a large part of every night.</p>
          <p>The somewhat disorganized condition of the troops and the
crowded condition of the roads necessitated frequent halts, and
whenever these occurred—especially after nightfall—the men would
drop in the road, or on the side of it, and sleep until they were roused,
and it was manifestly impossible to rouse them all. My two horses
were in almost constant use to transport officers and men who had
given out, especially our doctor, whose horse was for some reason
unavailable. Besides, I preferred to be on foot, for the very purpose
of moving around among the men and rousing them when we
resumed the march. With this view I was a good part of the time at
the rear of the battalion; but notwithstanding my efforts in this
respect, individually and through a detail of men selected and
organized for the purpose of waking the sleepers, we lost, I am
satisfied, every time we resumed the march after a halt at night—men
who were not found or who could not be roused.</p>
          <p>The nervousness resulting from this constant strain of starvation,
fatigue, and lack of sleep was a dangerous thing, at one time
producing very lamentable results, which threatened to be even more
serious than they were. One evening an officer, I think of one of our
supply departments, passed and repassed us several times, riding a
powerful black stallion, all of whose furnishings—girths, reins, etc.,— 
were very heavy, indicating the unmanageable character of the horse.
When he rode ahead the last time, about dark, it seems that he
imprudently hitched his horse by tying his very stout tie rein to a
heavy fence rail which was part of the road fence. Something
frightened the animal and he reared back, pulling the rail out of the
fence and dragging it after him full gallop down the road crowded
with troops, mowing them down like the scythe of a war chariot.
Someone, thinking there was a charge of cavalry, fired his musket
and, on the instant, three or four battalions, mine among them, began
firing into each other.</p>
          <p>I was never more alarmed. Muskets were discharged in my very
face, and I fully expected to be shot down; but
<pb id="stiles328" n="328"/>
after the most trying and perilous experience, the commanding
officers succeeded in getting control of their men and getting them
again into formation. But while we were talking to them, suddenly the
panic seized them again, and they rushed in such a wild rout against
the heavy road fence that they swept it away, and many of them took
to the woods, firing back as they ran. A second time the excitement
was quieted and a third time it broke out. By this time, however, I had
fully explained to my men that we had just put out fresh flankers on
both sides of the road, that we could not have an attack of cavalry
without warning from them, and that the safe and soldierly thing to
do was to lie down until everything should become calm. I was much
pleased that this third time my command did not fire a shot, while the
battalions in our front and rear were firing heavily. A field officer and a
good many other officers and men were killed and wounded in these
alarms, just how many I do not believe was ever ascertained.</p>
          <p>When we next halted for any length of time, during daylight, I
formed my men and talked to them fully and quietly about these
alarms, explaining the folly of their firing, and impressing upon them
simply to lie down, keep quiet, and attempt to catch and obey
promptly any special orders I might give. I complimented them upon
their having resisted the panicky infection the last time it broke out,
and felt that, upon the whole, my men had gained rather than lost by
the experience.</p>
          <p>On Thursday afternoon we had descended into a moist, green
little valley, crossed a small stream called Sailor's Creek, and,
ascending a gentle, grassy slope beyond it, had halted, and the men
were lying down and resting in the edge of a pine wood that crowned
the elevation. A desultory fire was going on ahead and bullets began
to drop in. I was walking about among the men, seeing that
everything was in order and talking cheerfully with them, when I
heard a ball strike something hard and saw a little commotion around
the battalion colors. Going there, I found that the flag-staff had been
splintered, and called out to the men that we were beginning to make
a record.</p>
          <pb id="stiles329" n="329"/>
          <p>Next moment I heard an outcry—“There, Brookin is killed!”—and
saw one of the men writhing on the ground. I went to him. He seemed
to be partially paralyzed below the waist, but said he was shot
through the neck. I saw no blood anywhere. He had on his roll of
blankets and, sure enough, a ball had gone through them and also
through his jacket and flannel shirt; but there it was, sticking in the
back of his neck, having barely broken the skin. I took it out and said:
“Oh, you are not a dead man by a good deal. Here,”—handing the
ball to him,—“take that home and give it to your sweetheart. It'll fix
you all right.” Brookin caught at the ball and held it tightly clasped in
his hand, smiling faintly, and the men about him laughed.</p>
          <p>Just then I heard a shell whizzing over us, coming from across the
creek, and we were hurried into line facing in that direction, that is,
<hi rend="italics">to the rear.</hi> I inferred, of course, that we were surrounded, but
could not tell how strong the force was upon which we were turning
our backs.</p>
          <p>I remember, in all the discomfort and wretchedness of the retreat,
we had been no little amused by the Naval Battalion, under that old
hero, Admiral Tucker. The soldiers called them the “Aye, Ayes,”
because they responded “aye, aye” to every order, some times
repeating the order itself, and adding, “Aye, aye, it is, sir!” As this
battalion, which followed immediately after ours, was getting into
position, and seaman's and landsman's jargon and movements were
getting a good deal mixed in the orders and evolutions,—all being
harmonized, however, and licked into shape by the “aye, aye,”—a
young officer of the division staff rode up, saluted Admiral Tucker,
and said: “Admiral, I may possibly be of assistance to you in getting
your command into line.” The Admiral replied: “Young man, I
understand how to talk to my people;” and thereupon followed “a
grand moral combination” of “right flank” and 
“left flank,”
“starboard” and “larboard,” “aye, aye” 
and “aye, aye”—until the
battalion gradually settled down into place.</p>
          <p>By this time a large Federal force had deployed into line on the
other slope beyond the creek, which we had left not long since; two
or three lines of battle, and a heavy
<pb id="stiles330" n="330"/>
park of artillery, which rapidly came into battery and opened an
accurate and deadly fire, we having no guns with which to reply and
thus disturb their aim. My men were lying down and were ordered
not to expose themselves. I was walking backward and forward just
back of the line, talking to them whenever that was practicable, and
keeping, my eye upon everything, feeling that such action and
exposure on my part were imperatively demanded by the history and
condition of the command and my rather peculiar relations to it. A
good many had been wounded and several killed, when a twenty-pounder Parrott
shell struck immediately in my front, on the line,
nearly severing a man in twain, and hurling him bodily over my head,
his arms hanging down and his hands almost slapping me in the face
as they passed.</p>
          <p>In that one awful moment I distinctly recognized young Blount,
who had gazed into my face so intently Sunday night; and but for
that peculiar paralysis which in battle some times passes upon a
man's entire being—excepting only his fighting powers—the
recognition might have been too much for me.</p>
          <p>In a few moments the artillery fire ceased and I had time to glance
about me and note results a little more carefully. I had seldom seen a
fire more accurate, nor one that had been more deadly, in a single
regiment, in so brief a time. The expression of the men's faces
indicated clearly enough its effect upon them. They did not appear
to be hopelessly demoralized, but they did look blanched and
haggard and awe-struck.</p>
          <p>The Federal infantry had crossed the creek and were now coming
up the slope in two lines of battle. I stepped in front of my line and
passed from end to end, impressing upon my men that no one must
fire his musket until I so ordered; that when I said <hi rend="italics">“ready”</hi> they must
all rise, kneeling on the right knee; that when I said <hi rend="italics">“aim”</hi> they must
all aim about the knees of the advancing line; that when I said <hi rend="italics">“fire”</hi>
they must all fire together, and that it was all-important they should
follow these directions exactly, and obey, implicitly and instantly,
any other instructions or orders I might give.</p>
          <pb id="stiles331" n="331"/>
          <p>The enemy was coming on and everything was still as the grave.
My battalion was formed upon and around a swell of the hill, which
threw it farther to the front than any other command in the division,
so that, being likely first to meet the enemy and having received no
special orders, I was compelled, as to details, to shape my own
course. The Federal officers knowing, as I suppose, that we were
surrounded and appreciating the fearful havoc their artillery fire had
wrought, probably entertained the hope that we would surrender— 
some of them, as I remember, having their white handkerchiefs in
their hands and waving them toward us as if suggesting that course,—and yet
they never ceased their advance upon our position, nor
sent forward a flag of truce, nor even made any demand or call upon
us to surrender; nor, so far as I know or believe or have ever heard,
were any white flags or indications of surrender exhibited anywhere
in our lines. I do not recall any exact parallel to these circumstances.</p>
          <p>I dislike to break the flow and force of the narrative by repeated
modifying references to recollection and memory; but it is not safe
for a man, so many years after the event, to be positive with regard to
details, unless there was special reason why they should have been
impressed upon him at the time. I will say, then, that my memory
records no musket shot on either side up to this time, our skirmishers
having retired upon the main line without firing. The enemy showed
no disposition to break into the charge, but continued to advance in
the same measured and even hesitating manner, and I allowed them
to approach very close—I should be afraid to say just how close— 
before retiring behind my men, who, as before stated, were lying
down. I had continued to walk along their front for the very purpose
of preventing them from opening fire; but now I stepped through the
line and stationing myself about the middle of it, called out my orders
deliberately—everything being in full sight of both parties, and the
enemy, as I have every reason to believe, hearing every word.
<hi rend="italics">“Ready!”</hi> To my great relief, the men rose, all together, like a piece of
mechanism, kneeling on their right knees and their faces set with an
expression that meant—everything. <hi rend="italics">“Aim!”</hi> The musket barrels fell to
an almost
<pb id="stiles332" n="332"/>
perfect horizontal line leveled about the knees of the advancing
front line. <hi rend="italics">“Fire!”</hi></p>
          <p>I have never seen such an effect, physical and moral, produced by
the utterance of one word. The enemy seemed to have been totally
unprepared for it, and, as the sequel showed, my own men scarcely
less so. The earth appeared to have swallowed up the first line of the
Federal force in our front. There was a rattling supplement to the
volley and the second line wavered and broke.</p>
          <p>The revulsion was too sudden. On the instant every man in my
battalion sprang to his feet, and, without orders, they rushed,
bareheaded and with unloaded muskets, down the slope after the
retreating Federals. I tried to stop them, but in vain, although I
actually got ahead of a good many of them. They simply bore me on
with the flood.</p>
          <p>The standard-bearer was dashing by me, colors in hand, when I
managed to catch his roll of blankets and jerk him violently back,
demanding what he meant, advancing the battalion colors without
orders. As I was speaking, the artillery opened fire again and he was
hurled to the earth, as I supposed, dead. I stooped to pick up the
flag, when his brother, a lieutenant, a fine officer and a splendid-looking
fellow, stepped over the body, saying: “Those colors belong
to me, Major!” at the same time taking bold of the staff. He was shot
through the brain and fell backward. One of the color guard sprang
forward, saying: “Give them to me, Major!” But by the time his hand
reached the staff he was down. There were at least five men dead and
wounded lying close about me, and I did not see why I should
continue to make a target of myself. I therefore jammed the color staff
down through a thick bush, which supported it in an upright
position, and turned my attention to my battalion, which was
scattered over the face of the hill firing irregularly at the Federals,
who seemed to be reforming to renew the attack. I managed to get my
men into some sort of formation and their guns loaded, and then
charged the Federal line, driving it back across the creek, and forming
my command behind a little ridge, which protected it somewhat.</p>
          <p>I ran back up the hill and had a brief conversation with General
Custis Lee,—commanding the division, our brigade
<pb id="stiles333" n="333"/>
commander having been killed,—explaining to him that I
had not ordered the advance and that we would be cut off
if we remained long where we were, but that I was satisfied
I could bring the battalion back through a ravine, which
would protect them largely from the fire of the enemy's artillery,
and reform them on the old line, on the right of the
naval battalion, which had remained in position. He expressed his
doubts as to this, but I told him I believed my
battalion would follow me anywhere, and with his permission I would
try it. I ran down the hill again and explained
to my men that, when I got to the left of the line and shouted
to them, they were to get up and follow me, on a run and
without special formation, through a ravine that led back to
the top of the hill. Just because these simple-hearted fellows
knew only enough to trust me, and because the enemy was
not so far recovered as to take advantage of our exposure
while executing the movement to the rear and reforming,
we were back in the original lines in a few moments—that
is, all who were left of us.</p>
          <p>It was of no avail. By the time we had well settled into our old
position we were attacked simultaneously, front and rear, by
overwhelming numbers, and quicker than I can tell it the battle
degenerated into a butchery and a confused mêlée of brutal personal
conflicts. I saw numbers of men kill each other with bayonets and the
butts of muskets, and even bite each others' throats and ears and
noses, rolling the ground like wild beasts. I saw one of my officers
and a Federal officer fighting with swords over the battalion colors,
which we had brought back with us, each having his left hand upon
the staff. I could not get to them, but my man was a very athletic,
powerful seaman, and soon I saw the Federal officer fall.</p>
          <p>I had cautioned my men against wearing “Yankee overcoats,”
especially in battle, but had not been able to enforce the order
perfectly—and almost at my side I saw a young fellow of one of my
companies jam the muzzle of his musket against the back of the head
of his most intimate friend, clad in a Yankee overcoat, and blow his
brains out. I was wedged in between fighting men, only my right arm
free. I tried to strike the musket barrel up, but alas, my
<pb id="stiles334" n="334"/>
sword had broken in the clash and I could not reach it. I well
remember the yell of demoniac triumph with which that simple
country lad of yesterday clubbed his musket and whirled savagely
upon another victim.</p>
          <p>I don't think I ever suffered more than during the few moments
after I saw that nothing could affect or change the result of the
battle. I could not let myself degenerate into a mere fighting brute or
devil, because the lives of these poor fellows were, in some sense, in
my hand, though there was nothing I could do just then to shield or
save them. Suddenly, by one of those inexplicable shiftings which
take place on a battle-field, the fighting around me almost entirely
ceased, and whereas the moment before the whole environment
seemed to be crowded with the enemy, there were now few or none
of them on the spot, and as the slaughter and the firing seemed to be
pretty well over, I concluded I would try to make my escape. By the
way, I had always considered it likely I should be killed, but had
never anticipated or contemplated capture.</p>
          <p>I think it was at this juncture I encountered General Custis Lee,
but it may have been after I was picked up. At all events, selecting
the direction which seemed to be most free from Federal soldiers and
to offer the best chance of escape, I started first at a walk and then
broke into a run; but in a short distance ran into a fresh Federal force,
and it seemed the most natural and easy thing in the world to be
simply arrested and taken in. My recollection is that General Lee
asked to be carried before the Federal general commanding on that
part of the line, who, at his request, gave orders putting a stop to the
firing, there being no organized Confederate force on the field. Thus
ended my active life as a Confederate soldier, my four years' service
under Marse Robert, and I was not sorry to end it thus, in red-hot
battle, and to be spared the pain, I will not say humiliation, of
Appomattox.</p>
          <p>I must, however, mention an incident to which I have already
briefly referred, to which it would perhaps have been more delicate
not to refer at all; but the reader of this chapter can scarcely have
failed to perceive that one of the most deeply-stirring episodes in
my soldier-life was the struggle
<pb id="stiles335" n="335"/>
I made to lift my battalion out of the demoralization in which I found
it; to make my men trust and love me, and to rouse and develop in
them the true conception of soldierly duty and devotion, courage
and endurance.</p>
          <p>Looking back upon the teeming recollections of this first and last
retreat and this final battle of the Army of Northern Virginia, amid all
the overpowering sadness and depression of defeat, I already felt the
sustaining consciousness of a real and a worthy success; but it is
impossible to express how this consciousness was deepened and
heightened when General Ewell sent for me on the field, after we were
all captured, and in the presence of half a dozen generals said that he
had summoned me to say, in the hearing of these officers, that the
conduct of my battalion had been reported to him, and that he desired
to congratulate me and them upon the record they had made.</p>

the Controlling Military Authorities of the Confederacy Ignored

Himself Without Authority to Confer Such Promotion or
Distinction—Contrasted Spirit and Practice of the Federal Authorities and Armies— 
Grotesque Absurdity of an Elective Roll of Military Honor.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>If asked what I regarded as the most fatal mistake of the
military authorities of the Confederacy, I should unhesitatingly
answer—their utter and amazing <hi rend="italics">failure to appreciate the
distinctive inspiration of the soldier, the informing spirit of an
army.</hi> That spirit, that inspiration, is best expressed in the one
word “Promotion”—promotion on the spot, “on the field;”
instant, responsive, rapid promotion.</p>
          <p>I do not deny the existence of other great principles and
forces, fundamental and formative, in the life of the soldier. On
the contrary, I thoroughly believe in and appreciate them, and
shall take pleasure in pointing them out at the last chapter of
this work; but I do say that the great element of progress and
development in the military is the desire for <hi rend="italics">promotion,</hi> or at
least, for honorable <hi rend="italics">distinction</hi> in the profession.</p>
          <p>I do not hesitate to say the soldier cannot be highly
developed without this influence. The true soldier is ever
looking for opportunities to earn promotion or distinction, and
the true general ever on the lookout to reward men who have
well earned the one or the other. This is the way—I
<pb id="stiles337" n="337"/>
am willing to say, the only way—to make a soldier or an army
and to develop both to the highest point of effectiveness.</p>
          <p>Probably the greatest master of the art of war, in ancient or
modern times, was the first Napoleon, and his army —if not the
best that ever marched or fought—certainly reached a height
of resistless power that alarmed and for a time dominated
Europe.</p>
          <p>It is well known how largely he made use of and relied upon
the element we are now considering, and which we may as
well characterize plainly as the <hi rend="italics">love of glory.</hi> Countless stories
are told illustrating how he stimulated this natural desire, until it
became the one passionate thirst of his soldiers. They enjoyed
the privilege of unrestrained access to him at all times, and he
encouraged them to address him as “Sire.”</p>
          <p>In one of his greatest battles he occupied a commanding
height from which, mounted on his favorite war horse and
surrounded by a magnificent staff, he overlooked the drawn
fight that hung in the balance on the plain below; striving
through the battle smoke, to analyze the field and to determine
where to deliver his final blow. He was sitting deep in the
saddle and deeply absorbed, when a young infantry soldier,
from one of his favorite corps, pressed through the gorgeous
uniforms and prancing steeds of the staff until pale, haggard,
bloody, powder-begrimed, he reached the Emperor's side, and
slapping his hand smartly upon his thigh, pointed eagerly to a
particular part of the field and said: “Sire, send a strong column
<hi rend="italics">there,</hi> and the day is ours!”</p>
          <p>Napoleon, startled from his reverie, turned and looked upon
the hatless, breathless, but inspired boy; then breaking into a
smile of appreciation and delight, and shaking his finger at him,
burst out: “You little devil! Who told you my secret? Go back
to your regiment, sir!”</p>
          <p>The column was hurled upon the weak point the two
Napoleons had detected; the victory was won, and the victor
rode over to the spot where the fatal thrust had been made— 
and there, just where the head of the French column had
pierced
<pb id="stiles338" n="338"/>
the hostile line, lay that peerless youth with a bullet through his
brain, but the light of battle and of victory glorifying his
countenance. The Emperor turned pale and reeled in his
saddle, but quickly recovering, gazed yearningly at the dead
hero, and with bitter emphasis exclaimed, “But for that
accursed bullet, there lies a Marshal of France!”</p>
          <p>Another illustration occurs to me.</p>
          <p>On a rapid march through an unfamiliar region the head of
his column halted on the bank of a river, and the Emperor,
turning to the ranking engineer officer present, demanded to
know its width. The colonel said he could not tell; but the
Emperor instantly replied:</p>
          <p>“But I must know.”</p>
          <p>“The instruments are in the rear, sire. I cannot tell without
the instruments.”</p>
          <p>“I said nothing about instruments; I asked the width of this
river, and I must be told.”</p>
          <p>“Sire, no one can tell without the instruments,” said the
colonel.</p>
          <p>At this moment a young lieutenant of engineers stepped
forward and saluted, saying:</p>
          <p>“Sire, I think I can tell you, near enough for all practical
purposes, the width of the stream.”</p>
          <p>“Tell me then, sir!”</p>
          <p>The lieutenant advanced to the edge of the water and faced
the other shore. Drawing down the visor of his cap until it just
cut the further brink, he turned his head—taking care to keep his
chin at the same level—until the cap brim struck the bank
they were on. Then, again addressing the Emperor, he said:</p>
          <p>“Sire, let them measure the distance from here to yonder
barn and you will have approximately the width of the
river.”</p>
          <p>Recognizing the resource and quickness of the young
officer, Napoleon ordered an immediate exchange of rank,
making the lieutenant a colonel and the colonel a lieutenant,
on the spot.</p>
          <p>These incidents require not one word, by way either of
explanation or of emphasis. It is easy to see, indeed
<pb id="stiles339" n="339"/>
would seem impossible not to see, how such instant,
responsive, public recognition and reward of merit and of
service must inspire and develop an army.</p>
          <p>What I mean to assert is that the Confederate military
authorities—that is, the governing authorities—did absolutely
nothing, in this general direction; that we did not have, as
General Hooker and other Federal generals testified, material
originally inferior which we toned up by admirable training and
discipline; but, on the contrary, that the material of our armies,
the bulk of our rank and file was as fine as the world ever saw,
as full of military capacity and aptitude and ambition, and that
we steadily toned down this superb material, by habitual neglect
of what is most essential to the development of the soldier.</p>
          <p>It is needless to say that the Army of Northern Virginia was
under a leadership in the field as developing and uplifting as
soldiers ever followed; but, with this exception, all things were
against us. The controlling military authorities seem to have
relied entirely upon the patriotism and character of the
individual men, and did nothing to make them soldiers, or to
make the aggregation of them an army. Any one of us might
perform prodigies of valor, no one ever noticed it; or exhibit the
most decided and even brilliant capacities for command or
advancement, the advancement or command might never
come.</p>
          <p>Take the case of Lieutenant Falligant at Cold Harbor already
mentioned. Our battalion report set forth his splendid conduct in
detail; General Kershaw, commanding our division, was full of
enthusiastic admiration, and promised—and I have no doubt
fulfilled his promise—to press Falligant's promotion; yet no
notice was ever taken of the matter. If Falligant had done in
Napoleon's army precisely what he did in the Army of
Northern Virginia I have no doubt he would have been
decorated on the field and promoted to be full colonel of
artillery. He was a second lieutenant when he rendered his
superb service at Cold Harbor, '64. If I mistake not, he was a
second lieutenant at Appomattox.</p>
          <p>I think it was at Suffolk that a private soldier in one of the
regiments of the Confederate force investing the place
<pb id="stiles340" n="340"/>
proposed and, alone and single-handed, executed a brilliant and
daring plan, which completely rid the investing force of the
galling fire of sharpshooters concealed in tall, dry grass on the
other side of a deep stream.</p>
          <p>This gallant and ingenious fellow, when the wind was
blowing from our side toward the enemy's, procured a long,
thick plank, with which he entered the water, lying breast down
on one end of the plank, which of course inclined the other end
upward, making a sort of protection for him and especially for
his head. Thus equipped, he paddled across the stream to a
point projecting out toward our shore, and where the dry
grass stood high above water so deep that the sharpshooters
could not approach near it, and there, and as far up and down
the stream as he could venture, he set fire to the grass.
The flames spread rapidly, and the daring incendiary, taking
advantage of the flight and confusion of the sharpshooters,
swam safely back to our side of the stream.</p>
          <p>The force was entirely relieved from the annoying and
destructive fire, but their heroic deliverer was, as usual,
overlooked and neglected.</p>
          <p>I am not sure that the Federal military authorities fully
recognized the principles we have been discussing, but they
certainly contrasted very strongly with ours in this respect.</p>
          <p>After the battle of Chickamauga Longstreet sent to
Richmond a number of Federal flags captured by his men in
the engagement, in charge of a party consisting of several
private soldiers, two or three non-commissioned officers, and a
lieutenant or two, who had specially distinguished themselves
in the capture of the banners. They were met at the depot by a
negro with a one-horse wagon, into which the captured
banners were dumped, and in which they were hauled to the
Capitol—and the men received transportation back to the army. Of course
they were laughing-stocks to their fellows, and felt the deep
sting of the lesson that gallant conduct is a matter beneath
notice.</p>
          <p>About the same time I read in the Northern papers an
account of the reception accorded a similar party of Federal
soldiers, sent upon a like errand, to Washington. As
<pb id="stiles341" n="341"/>
I remember, they were received by the full Cabinet, assembled
in the War Department. The line officers were made majors
and colonels, the non-commissioned officers received
commissions, and the privates had the chevrons of sergeants
and corporals sewed upon their coatsleeves. Of course they
returned to their army, themselves heroes and inspirers of
heroic deeds among their comrades.</p>
          <p>When I was captured and passed through Grant's army I
felt as if I had entered a new world. The non-commissioned
officer who was first to reach me, as we were walking to find
the Federal officer commanding on that part of the line, rattled
off to me his military history, which was at his tongue's end.</p>
          <p>“Major,” said he, “you've helped me to my shoulder
straps. You make the fifth field officer I've been the first man
to reach; twice my hand has been first on captured cannon.
You see that man yonder? He's a private soldier still, because
he hasn't the mind or education to make an officer, and he
knows it and don't want a commission; but look at his medals
and decorations. There ain't a general officer in the corps but
touches his hat to him.”</p>
          <p>And so it seemed to be with all the men I saw. Each
appeared fully aware of the amount of good conduct laid up to
his credit, and yearning for opportunity to win further distinction.</p>
          <p>There was nothing approximating this in our service. I can
truly say,—and thousands of my old comrades can say with
me,—I never saw or heard of a medal or a ribbon being pinned
on a man's jacket, or even so much as a man's name being
read out publicly in orders for gallantry in battle. With some of
us, at least, it would have gone far to atone for having nothing
put inside our stomachs if we had had a red ribbon or some
such thing pinned outside our jackets. Not only did I never see
or hear of a promotion on the field, but I do not believe such a
thing ever occurred in any army of the Confederacy, from the
beginning to the end of the war. Indeed, I am confident it never
did; for, incredible as it may appear, even Lee himself did not
have the power to make such a promotion. On page 147 of his
book, Colonel Taylor, the Adjutant-General of his army, says:</p>
          <pb id="stiles342" n="342"/>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>General Lee should have been supreme in all matters touching the
movements and <sic corr="discipline">dicipline</sic> of his Army; whereas, under the law and the
regulations of the Department of War made in conformity thereto, he had
not even the power to confer promotion on the field of battle.</p>
          </q>
          <p>I have myself heard other prominent Confederate leaders
complain of their utter powerlessness in this regard, and it is
generally understood that Jackson more than once threatened
to resign if he should be further interfered with in “putting
down one and setting up another” of the officers and men of
his command.</p>
          <p>In short, the error and defect upon which I am commenting
was too glaring to be denied, but I have heard it apologized for
upon the ground that deeds of gallantry were so common in the
Confederate armies and especially in the Army of Northern
Virginia, that they could not with propriety be recognized or
rewarded as “distinguished.” This is worse than absurd. No
matter how high the average, some men and some deeds
necessarily rose above it. Besides, men were sometimes
promoted for gallantry in our service, and even in Lee's
glorious army; but the point is, the promotion lagged and
followed afar off—so far that, before the tardy recognition
came, men had forgotten the heroic deeds that forced it, and
the effect was almost, if not altogether, lost.</p>
          <p>May I be pardoned for referring to my personal experience
in this regard, amongst the bitterest of my life. I was
recommended for promotion for conduct at “The Salient,” that
is, “The Bloody Angle,” of Spottsylvania, of the 12th of May,
'64; and the promotion came, but <hi rend="italics">more than six months later,</hi>
and then the commission gave me rank, <hi rend="italics">not from the date of
the engagement,</hi> but from <hi rend="italics">the date of its issue;</hi> nor was there
upon its face the slightest reference to or connection with the
glorious 12th of May. I do not think I was ever so disappointed
and indignant. I never saw the commission again; my
recollection is that I tore it to tatters. I presume it is, in part at
least, to the delay in issuing this commission that I am indebted
for the additional wrong that my name is not mentioned in the
only published list, so for as I know of the field officers of the
Confederate armies.</p>
          <pb id="stiles343" n="343"/>
          <p>If anything were needed to accentuate the dismal failure of
the military authorities of the Confederacy, in the general field
of the inspiration and development of the soldier, it would be
abundantly supplied by the remarkable record of the only
attempt they ever made, so far as I am informed, in that
direction. This attempt was embodied in an Act of the
Congress of the Confederate States, approved October 13, 1862,
and several orders of the Adjutant and Inspector-General's
office: No. 93, of November 22, 1862; No. 31, of October 3, 1863,
and No. 64, of August 10, 1864—all to be found in War Records,
Series I., Vol. xxx., Part 2, Reports, pages 532 and 533.</p>
          <p>The title of the Act is promising, and is as follows: “An Act
to authorize the grant of medals and badges of distinction, as a
reward for courage and good conduct on the field of battle;”
but the outline of the scheme is grievously disappointing.</p>
          <p>“The President,” and not the general commanding in the
field, was authorized to confer the medals and badges; so that,
even without the distinct reference in the orders to “the regular
channels,” it is obvious that, in practical operation, the plan
would fail utterly of that rapid, responsive recognition and
reward wherein consist the life and power of decoration and
promotion “on the field.”</p>
          <p>Again, the Act provided for conferring “a badge of
distinction upon one private or non-commissioned officer of
<hi rend="italics">each company,</hi> after <hi rend="italics">every signal victory</hi> it shall have
assisted to achieve.” Thus, by reason of the number to be
decorated, the decoration would, of necessity, cease to be a
distinction, and the scheme must, as it did, break down of its
own weight, to say nothing of its other inherent defects.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the most glaring of these was the mode of selecting
the men who were to be recipients of the badges. It is
expressly provided in the Act that: “The non-commissioned
officers and privates of the company who may be present on
the first dress-parade thereafter (that is, ‘after every signal
victory’) may choose, by a majority of their votes, the soldier
best entitled to receive such distinction.” Could there be
devised a more shocking travesty upon the essential
<pb id="stiles344" n="344"/>
law and character of military promotion or reward and the
appropriate mode of conferring it? Such promotion or
recognition means, of course, and exclusively, recognition or
promotion from above; by the determination, that is, of one's
superior or commanding officer. To substitute in place of this
the ballot of one's fellows is a monstrous perversion—so
monstrous as to be incredible but for the absolute proofs we
have submitted. It was bad enough to provide for election to
military office; but to elect the bravest man in the command is
an incongruity still more extreme.</p>
          <p>And yet there is one feature of this remarkable statute even
more exaggerated and grotesque. The entire scheme had been
delayed a year or more because of the difficulty or expense of
procuring the medals and badges, and an elective “Roll of
Honor” was the ingenious substituted device of some one to
bridge over the difficulty. In the order of August 10, '64, it was
provided that: “Should more than one soldier hereafter be
selected by a company as equal in merit, the name to be
entered upon the roll will be determined by lot.” The
imagination staggers at the task of picturing the scene where
two elected heroes proceeded to draw straws to determine
which of the twain should be enrolled among the immortals.</p>
          <p>Was there ever enacted by a legislative body, or carried into
effect by an executive office, a more utterly impotent scheme
or as grim a farce? It seems almost beyond belief, but there it
is, in black and white; and it was actually put into operation in
some of our armies. It may have been to some extent
operative in the Army of Northern Virginia; but I have yet to
meet a soldier of that army who claimed the honor of having
had his name entered upon this Elective Roll of Honor, this
Roll of Elected Heroes, or who had even so much as heard of
such a roll, although it was expressly ordered that the roll be
read “at the head of every regiment in the service of the
Confederate States.”</p>
          <p>I say again, the invention of such a scheme only accentuates
the pitiful failure of the Confederate military authorities to put
into operation the noble, healthful, inspiring law and practice of
<hi rend="italics">genuine military recognition and promotion</hi>
<pb id="stiles345" n="345"/>
<hi rend="italics">on the field.</hi> And I say further, that I believe this failure had
as much to do with the failure of our cause as any other—yes,
even more than any and all other forces and influences, save
and except, perhaps, the overwhelming material force arrayed
against us.</p>

During the War—Demoralizing Influence of Earth-works—Attrition
and Starvation—Lack of Sleep <hi rend="italics">vs.</hi> Lack of Food—Night Blindness in
the Army of Northern Virginia—Desertions from the Confederate
Armies—Prison Life—DeForest Medal—Gen. Lee's Hat.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>Some years ago, during the discussion of the pension
legislation of Congress, the following statements, substantially,
were published at Washington in <hi rend="italics">The National Tribune</hi> of May
16, 1889. We do not vouch for their accuracy, but there is
truth enough in the figures to make them valuable, and power
enough to startle the thoughtful reader.</p>
          <p>The article asserts that the Federal force invading the South
from '61 to '65 was fully twice as large as was ever put
afield by any other modern nation, and that it contested more
battles, did more fighting, and lost more in killed and wounded
than all the armies of modern Europe in the last three-quarters
of a century, that is, since the close of the Napoleonic wars in
1815.</p>
          <p>It states that 2,320,272 men served an average of three
years during our war; that no other war of the century has
lasted so long or been filled with such continuous and
sanguinary fighting; that 2,261 battles and skirmishes were
fought, many of them more destructive of human life than any
other battles in modern history; that over 400,000 men lost
their lives in the struggle—that is, double the number of the
entire army of Great Britain, 143,000 more than that of
Austro-Hungary; more than Napoleon arrayed against the
coalition of England, Russia, Prussia, Sweden and
<pb id="stiles347" n="347"/>
Spain; and twice as many as he had when he began his
Waterloo campaign. The article closes with these words:</p>
          <p>“Our war lasted nearly seven times as long as the Franco-Prussian
struggle, and we lost over six times as many killed on
the field of battle as the Germans lost in overrunning the whole
of France.”</p>
          <p>As I understand, the above figures represent the numbers
and losses of the Federal armies alone. If so, what a story they
tell of the fighting power of the little Confederacy, cut off from
the world in its death grapple, opposing the great hosts of the
Union with less than one-third their numbers and meeting,
among the overwhelming myriads of its foes, more imported
foreigners than the entire number of the native soldiers of the
South.</p>
          <p>In my account of the campaign of '64, especially of
Spottsylvania and Cold Harbor, in noting our first real
experience of fighting “in the trenches” and behind “works,” I
failed to mention its tendency to demoralize the men.</p>
          <p>The protection of a little pile of earth being in front of a man
and between him and his enemy, his natural tendency is to stay
behind it, not only as to part, but as to the whole of his person.
I have more than once seen men behind such a line fire their
muskets without so much as raising their heads above the
curtain of earth in front of them; fire, indeed, at such an
inclination of their gun-barrels upward as to prevent the
possibility of hitting an enemy, unless that enemy were
suspended in the sky or concealed in the tree tops.</p>
          <p>So greatly did this desire to fight behind protection increase
that I have seen men begin digging every time the column
halted, until their commanding officers declared that any man
caught intrenching himself without orders should be punished
severely. It is fair to say that, after a while the better men of
the army, at least, learned to use without abusing the vantage
ground of earth-works.</p>
          <p>In commenting upon Grant's theory and plan of <hi rend="italics">attrition,</hi> I
should have added that one feature of it was to turn loose upon
our armies and our homes the twin giant of <hi rend="italics">starvation.</hi></p>
          <pb id="stiles348" n="348"/>
          <p>Especially was this the case after Sherman started through
Georgia and our communications began to be cut by Federal
raiding parties in all directions. Some time ago, I do not
remember just how long, Mr. George Cary Eggleston, in a
graphic paper upon the campaign of '64, wrote in a very
feeling and original way of the pains and pangs of hunger,
and how deeply they depressed and deteriorated his entire
being. I take no issue with him as to this statement, and yet, to
me, even greater suffering and deterioration came from lack
of sleep. I do not know that I have ever suffered more,
physically and mentally, than from intense desire and demand
of my whole being for deep, unbroken sleep, combined with
inability to get more than a snatch at a time, which was almost
worse than none at all. Such was frequently our experience,
especially upon night marches and during long-continued
battle.</p>
          <p>I am inclined to think my unusual muscular strength saved
me from that general giving way which, in the case of most
men, follows quickly upon lack of sufficient food; but on the
other hand, I seemed to be peculiarly susceptible to the
suffering, even torture and almost madness, which
accompanies or follows lack of sleep. I believe it was
Napoleon who defined a soldier to be a man who could eat
and sleep in one day for three. My army experience inclines
me to say that a better definition could scarcely be framed, at
least on the purely physical side.</p>
          <p>Perhaps the most peculiar and striking fact or feature of the
physical condition of General Lee's army during the latter half
of the war was night blindness—the men affected being
unable to see after sunset, or a little later.</p>
          <p>I do not know what proportion of the men were so affected,
but it is safe to say that thousands were. Many of them were
as good and true men as any in the service; indeed, I have
seen men led by the hand all night in order to go into battle
with the command in the morning.</p>
          <p>The doctors tell us that these symptoms were to be
accounted for as among the expressions of an anaemic and
scorbutic condition, which condition resulted from lack of
proper and sufficient nutrition. It would be interesting to know
<pb id="stiles349" n="349"/>
to what extent, if at all, the Federal armies were so affected.
There may have been investigations and reports embodying this
and other points of interest with regard to the matter, but, if so,
I have never seen them. Indeed, my purpose is merely to
record the fact, which I believe to be for the most part
unknown even to the intelligent public of this generation.</p>
          <p>There is one feature of our Confederate struggle, to which I
have already made two or three indirect allusions, as to which
there has been such a strange popular misapprehension that I
feel as if there rested upon the men who thoroughly understand
the situation a solemn obligation to bring out strongly and
clearly the sound and true view of the matter. I refer to an
impression, quite common, that <hi rend="italics">the desertions from the
Confederate armies, especially in the latter part of the war,
indicated a general lack of devotion to the cause</hi> on the
part of the men in the ranks.</p>
          <p>On the contrary, it is my deliberate conviction that Southern
soldiers who remained faithful under the unspeakable pressure
of letters and messages revealing suffering, starvation, and
despair at home, displayed a heroism and devotion well-nigh
superhuman.</p>
          <p>The men who felt this strain most were husbands of young
wives and fathers of young children, whom they had supported
by their labor, manual or mental. As the lines of communication
in the Confederacy were more and more broken and
destroyed, and the ability, both of county and public authorities
and of neighbors, to aid them became less and less—the
situation of such families became more and more desperate,
and their appeals more and more piteous to their only earthly
helpers who were far away, filling their places in “the thin gray
line.” Meanwhile the enemy sent into our camps, often by our
own pickets, circulars offering our men indefinite parole, with
free transportation to their homes.</p>
          <p>I am not condemning the Federal Government or military
authorities for making these offers or putting out these
circulars; but if there ever was such a thing as a conflict of
duties, that conflict was presented to the private soldiers of
<pb id="stiles350" n="350"/>
the Confederate army who belonged to the class just
mentioned, and who received, perhaps simultaneously, one of
these home letters and one of these Federal circulars; and if
ever the strain of such a conflict was great enough to unsettle
a man's reason and to break a man's heart strings, these men
were subjected to that strain.</p>
          <p>Ask any Confederate officer who commanded troops during
the latter part of the war and who was loved and trusted by his
men. He will tell you of letters which it would have seared
your very eyeballs to read, but that they could not be read
without tears—letters in which a wife and mother, crazed by
her starving children's cries for bread, required a husband and
father to choose between his God-imposed obligations to her
and to them and his allegiance to his country, his duty as a
soldier; declaring that, if the stronger party prove recreant to
the marriage vow, the weaker will no longer be bound by it; that
if he come not at once, he need never come; that she will
never see him again nor recognize him as her husband or the
father of her children.</p>
          <p>In order that it may be seen that I am not drawing an
imaginary or exaggerated picture, I quote from page 145 of
Colonel Taylor's “Four Years with General Lee”—a passage
which, by the way, I had not read until after I had penned the
foregoing upon this topic. Says Colonel Taylor:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">
            <p>A few words in regard to this desertion. The condition of affairs
throughout the South at that period was thoroughly deplorable. Hundreds of
letters addressed to soldiers were intercepted and sent to the Army
Headquarters, in which mothers, wives and sisters told of their inability to
respond to the appeals of hungry children for bread, or to provide proper
care and remedies for the sick; and in the name of all that was true, appealed
to the men to come home and rescue them from the ills which they suffered
and the starvation which threatened them. Surely never was devotion to
one's country and to one's duty more sorely tested than was the case with
the soldiers of Lee's army during the last year of the war.</p>
          </q>
          <p>Many a noble officer, reading such a letter with a poor
fellow of his command at nightfall, has realized how entirely
inadequate was the best sympathy, advice, and comfort he
<pb id="stiles351" n="351"/>
could give; and when at next morning's roll-call that man
failed to answer to his name, has felt far more of pity than
of condemnation. Soldiers would not prevent the departure of a
comrade who was known to have received such a letter.
Officers of courts-martial, compelled by sense of duty to order
the execution as a deserter of a man absent without leave
under such circumstances, have confessed to me that they
shuddered, as if accessories before the fact to <hi rend="italics">murder.</hi></p>
          <p>Some years ago, cowering under a great rock on the edge of
the Aletsch glacier, in an Alpine thunder-storm, with Prof. (Sir
John) Tyndall, Lady Tyndall, and my brother-in-law, Professor
Newton, of Yale University, I related a story which was told
me by Dr. Hunter McGuire and other eye-witnesses, of
Jackson's agonized suffering, yet refusal to interfere with a
death sentence imposed by a court-martial, under
circumstances such as I have described. Lady Tyndall
shuddered and averted her face; but her husband, perceiving
that she did so, said with emphasis:</p>
          <p>“My dear, awful as it was, Jackson was right;” then, turning
to me, he added, “Mr. Stiles, God never made a greater or a
righter human soul than Stonewall Jackson. No, sir, I do not
believe it within the power—even of the Lord God Almighty— 
to make one!”</p>
          <p>In this general connection I cannot but refer with pride to the
unshaken condition and magnificent record of my old battery,
even on that fearful retreat from Richmond, and up to and at
the very end. The evening before Sailor's Creek we passed
them on the road near Amelia Court House, and I was
delighted to find their condition about as good as I ever saw it,
and their mettle quite as high. They were better supplied than
we, and, for the last time, I plundered Billy's haversack for a
morsel of food.</p>
          <p>As I have always understood, and believe to be true, they
went down and passed into history, with the immortal Army of
Northern Virginia, with all their men, save two, present for
duty, or honorably accounted for.</p>
          <p>There are several minor and personal matters, more or less
connected with my army experience, which I have been
specially requested to touch upon. One of these is my prison
<pb id="stiles352" n="352"/>
life. It may be that I shall deem this worthy of more
extended notice hereafter, so that for the present I shall
confine myself to one or two points.</p>
          <p>When it was proposed to release the field officers at
Johnson's Island, in the summer of 1865, I was one of those
called upon by the prison authorities to aid in the preparation of
the numerous requisite “papers,” and when, long after midnight,
I handed in my batch, Major Lee, the courteous and kindly
commandant of the post, when he had looked them over, said
they were all right, except that I had been guilty of just such an
omission as he would undertake to say had never before
occurred, in like circumstances—that is, I had forgotten to
prepare any paper for my own release.</p>
          <p>I assured him that he was mistaken, that I certainly had not
overlooked my own case, and he hastily ran through his pile of
papers again.</p>
          <p>“Yes, Major,” said he, “I am right. There are no papers here
for you.”</p>
          <p>“True,” said I, “but you did not say there were no papers for
me, but that I had forgotten to prepare any. In this you are in
error. I did not forget—I never proposed to write any paper
for myself—you see, I am not going to leave just yet. I have
taken a great fancy to you and I propose to stay with you a
while longer.”</p>
          <p>The commandant at first seemed to regard the matter as a
joke; but when he found I really did not propose to submit any
papers for my own release, he began to fear I had lost my mental
balance, and sent me to my quarters, sending the post-surgeon
after me, to see whether I was in normal condition. I assured
the doctor, and he saw for himself, that I
was perfectly sound in mind and body, and he so reported.</p>
          <p>The next day, as soon as the prisoners had left, Major Lee sent
for me, and I explained to him that the oath demanded of us
entered into the domain of my convictions and feelings, requiring
me to swear in substance that I abandoned the “heresy of
secession,” and regarded and would continue to regard the United
States with patriotic devotion. I contended that the Government
had nothing to do with the exercise of my intellect or affections,
that I could not
<pb id="stiles353" n="353"/>
myself voluntarily control their operations or conclusions; that I
would never take an oath of the character of that demanded,
and did not feel disposed to take any oath whatever under
duress and imprisonment; that, in fact, I questioned whether an
oath exacted under such circumstances was legally valid; but
that I preferred not to subject myself to the moral strain of
toning down and whittling away the obligation of any oath I
might take; that, indeed, as the war was, or seemed to be,
practically over, with no organized Confederate force in the
field, I ought to be released upon indefinite parole not to take up
arms against the United States; but that I was willing to accept
a brief parole, say of thirty days, conditioned at the expiration of
that time to take the simple oath of allegiance or leave the
country; that as at present advised and inclined, I would join any
nation, or government, or people under Heaven even the
Hottentots—to fight against the United States, if there was a
fair chance of success; but if allowed to go out and mingle
freely with the people of the South, and especially of Virginia,
for a short time, and to see for myself that they had, as he
assured me, given up all purpose and hope of independence, I
might then be able to take the simple oath of allegiance
intelligently and honestly, and in case I did so might well prove a
better, that is, a more reliable, citizen than some who had raised
no such question of conscience.</p>
          <p>Major Lee was very kind and considerate. He attempted at
first to reason me out of my position and, failing in that, said he
would incorporate the substance of what I had said in his
report to the Government, and ask my release on parole; which
he did, but the application was refused. He then suggested that
perhaps I could formulate my own position more clearly and
strongly than he had done, and said he would forward any
paper of that character I might prepare, and he furnished me
with writing materials for the purpose. Of course, with my
comrades all departed, there was a great calm, a melancholy
stagnation in “the prison pen,” and I revelled for days, almost
weeks, in applying my little knowledge of law and my large
sympathy with “general principles” to the preparation of paper
after paper on the laws of war, as related to my case, and
bearing on my
<pb id="stiles354" n="354"/>
application to be released on parole. Suffice it to say these
papers were all endorsed by Major Lee, “Respectfully
forwarded approved”—and all backed by the Commissary-General
of Prisoners, “Respectfully returned disapproved.”</p>
          <p>At last, however, Mrs. A. D. Egerton, a noble lady of
Baltimore, and my sister,—having managed in some way to get
hold of one of these papers, weeks after I had been removed
from Johnson's Island and incarcerated in a stone casemate in
Fort Lafayette, in New York Harbor,—secured an interview
with the Secretary of War, and Mr. Stanton endorsed the
paper with his own hand.</p>
          <p>“Let this young officer have any parole he asks, conditioned,
at its expiration, to take the oath or <hi rend="italics">go back to
prison.</hi>”</p>
          <p>The big-brained, terrible man cut right through to my half-formed
purpose of going to Maximilian—and he did not
propose to leave any such loop-hole in the net in which the
Government at the time held me fast. It is a pleasure to record
this incident, to the honor of a man who gave few opportunities
to the people of the South for kindly words or feelings.</p>
          <p>The iron door of my cell opened to these dear ladies,
armed with this “ukase of the Czar,” and I walked forth a
free man once more—that is, in a modified sense. This
was, I think, in October, '65. At the expiration of my brief
parole, being satisfied that the fond dream of Confederate
independence was ended forever, I took the simple oath of
allegiance to the United States, sadly turned my back upon the
only great thing in my life, and dropped into the
undistinguishable mass of “The People.”</p>
          <p>Another matter of a personal nature, which I mention by
special request, is the post-collegiate history of the DeForest
gold medal, which I had the honor to take in the class of '59, at
Old Yale, and the formative influence it exercised upon my
after life.</p>
          <p>In 1859, when I took the medal, the die for it had not been
cast, and the trustees or managers of the fund were advised
that they were legally compellable to melt up ten gold eagles,
or, at least, a hundred dollars' worth of gold, in the general form
of a medal, and to have engraved upon
<pb id="stiles355" n="355"/>
it the legend prescribed in the legal instrument of donation. My
recollection is the medal was a long time reaching me and
when it came it was in this “questionable shape.” I carried the
lump of gold in my pants pocket for months and as the mighty
conflict drew on and I grew more moody and unhappy, I
walked much alone, and used occasionally to shy my golden
disc at cats and other objects, until the inscription became
battered and defaced beyond recognition.</p>
          <p>It was probably after my return from New York in the
spring of '61 that one of my uncles, a cotton manufacturer from
Northern Georgia, was sitting one evening with the family in
our parlor in New Haven and I was filliping the great round
piece of yellow metal up to the ceiling, when he asked what it
was, and I answered:</p>
          <p>“A lump of gold.”</p>
          <p>“Nonsense, Bob,” said “Uncle B.” “What is it, really?”</p>
          <p>“It is really a piece of gold, Uncle. If you doubt it, examine it
and see for yourself!”—tossing it to him.</p>
          <p>“Why, I really believe it is gold. How did you come by it,
boy, and what are you going to do with it?”</p>
          <p>When I explained, my uncle said:</p>
          <p>“Well, it is certainly good for nothing now as a medal. We
don't know what is coming upon us; you'd better let me take it
South and put it in cotton for you.”</p>
          <p>“All right,” I replied; “only let me first have a piece clipped
off to make a breast-pin for mother;” which was done next
morning. The little pin was made, my mother wore it for years,
my sister has it now and my little daughter is to have it. “Uncle
B.” took the three-quarter moon of gold with him, and I cannot
recall ever thinking of it again until the fall of 1865, just after I
was released from prison.</p>
          <p>I was on the border line of Albemarle and Orange Counties
Virginia, helping my brother Randy to harvest a little corn crop,
which he had cultivated on shares, after getting, out of prison in
the spring. It was toward the gloaming and I was seated on a
pile of corn, which we were anxious to finish that night. A
solitary horseman came riding across the open country from the
direction of the railroad, evidently an ex-Confederate
cavalryman, and as we all, in those
<pb id="stiles356" n="356"/>
days, seemed to have a sort of intuitive knowledge of each
other's whereabouts, I was not surprised when he rode close
to us, tossing a letter upon the corn pile as he passed, and
saying:</p>
          <p>“I was at Gordonsville, Bob, and hearing you were in these
parts, I asked for you at the office. That's all there was.”</p>
          <p>I thanked him and he rode on. When it got too dark to work
I threw a fodder stalk on the smouldering fire and opened my
letter. It contained the account of my cotton merchant, and not
only his account but his check for $350, balancing the same.</p>
          <p>It was the one moment of my life when I seemed to be
possessed of boundless wealth.</p>
          <p>I had on my old Confederate uniform,—indeed these were
the only clothes I had,—but I walked to the University that
night and entered the law class next morning, under that prince
of men and of teachers, John B. Minor. I had no resources
whatever outside of my little fairy-story fortune, and I really do
not see how, without it, I could have resumed and completed
my professional studies.</p>
          <p>I had shared my capital to some extent with my brother, and
about the time I began to be seriously troubled again with the
ever-pressing question of ways and means, entering my almost
barren room one day after lecture, I found on my table an
envelope addressed to me and inside of it $75 in greenbacks,
and—written in a hand with which I was not familiar, and
entirely without date or signature—the words, “From an old
friend of your father.”</p>
          <p>About the time this second supply of bread and water the
ravens had brought was exhausted, at the minimum rate of
college expenses, another envelope, addressed in the same
hand, was left in the same place, and inside of it $75 more, but
not even the scrape of a pen accompanying it. I have never
heard so much as one word that shed any light upon the
identity of the kind donor, and this aggregate of $150 is the only
money I owe to-day.</p>
          <p>My sister Josephine, who, with Mrs. Egerton, procured my
release from prison, was quite intimate with General
<pb id="stiles357" n="357"/>
Lee's family and a great favorite with the General. She is
consequently something of an heiress in interesting mementoes
of him given her by his own hand.</p>
          <p>She has a lock of his hair and one of Traveler's, a star from
his coat collar, the wooden inkstand, which he used generally in
our war, and, if I mistake not, in the Mexican War also, and the
remains of a pound of tea he gave her, asking that we should
make tea from it the first time we were fortunate enough to
have a family reunion. She has also the General's parade hat,
or rather she and I have committed this to the keeping of the
Confederate Museum in Richmond. The circumstances
connected with this latter gift are strongly characteristic.</p>
          <p>My sister had been spending the morning at the General's
residence, 707 East Franklin Street, Richmond, Va., sitting most
of the time with the ladies of the family in Mrs. Lee's room.
The General was preparing for a trip somewhere, and was
leisurely packing his trunk, that is, after the ladies had done
what they could to aid him—and every now and then he
would enter the room where they were bringing in his hand
something which he thought would interest them. In one of
these incursions he brought a wide-brimmed drab or gray-brown
felt hat, saying:</p>
          <p>“Miss Josie, has your father a good hat?”</p>
          <p>My sister replied that she really did not know, as we had not
seen him for some time.</p>
          <p>“Well,” said the General, “I have two good hats, and I don't
think a good rebel ought to have two good articles of one kind
in these hard times. This was my dress-parade hat. Take it,
please, and if your father has not a good hat give him this one
from me.”</p>
          <p>Father would not wear the hat, deeming it too sacred a thing
for common use; but after the General's death, by permission of
his daughters, who were present, I wore it at two of our great
Confederate reunions, with my dear old Confederate jacket,
and I need scarcely say was the object of more intense interest
than ever in my life, before or since. I made bold, too, to have
my photograph taken with the hat on—of course, the jacket,
also,—as a sort of heirloom for my family.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XXVI</head>
          <head>ANALYSIS OF THE SOLDIER-LIFE</head>
          <p>My story is told. If it has failed to interest and to stir you
deeply, the fault is in the telling. And yet I cannot but hope that,
in spite of feeble and inadequate portrayal, the great outlines of
the picture have so impressed themselves upon you that you
are ready to admit the life of Marse Robert's boys, from '61 to
'65, to have been a higher and greater life than you had
imagined.</p>
          <p>It would seem as if this must be so, if you have credited the
writer with a fair average of intelligence and
conscientiousness. I can well understand, however, that,
without reflecting upon me in any offensive sense, some of
those who have done me the honor to read these
reminiscences may feel that I have unconsciously and very
naturally idealized my comrades of the long ago and the vivid
life we lived together in our golden youth.</p>
          <p>It is difficult to meet such a suggestion. I believe the
strongest and most satisfactory way to meet it and, at the same
time, the fittest way to end this book, will be to close with an
analysis of the Soldier-Life, from which it will appear how
natural and normal it is, that elements and forces, such as
characterize that life, should produce men and deeds and
scenes and incidents such as I have endeavored to portray
in the foregoing pages.</p>
          <p>It is also, just now, specially to be desired that the
essential character and training of the military life should be
better and more generally understood. However we may differ
as to the advisability of the new career of foreign complication
and conquest upon which this country seems to have
entered, and which has resulted and must necessarily result in
such an expansion of its military establishment, yet we
<pb id="stiles359" n="359"/>
must all agree that it is well the growing multitudes of young
 men who are entering and to enter the military service should
have high and clear conceptions of that great life to which they
have devoted themselves—a life, by the way, which,
notwithstanding the horrors that often attended it, grew upon
me every day I lived it; and to which, if the war had resulted in
the establishment of the Southern Confederacy, I should have
consecrated myself with whole-hearted devotion.</p>
          <p>It will not be forgotten that I claim for the Army of Northern
Virginia some peculiar characteristics, as well as a fuller and
finer development of the soldierly character in general, because
of the circumstances under which that army fought, and
especially the leader, whose banner it followed; but, after all,
the heroic story I have told is in no small degree the normal
product and outcome of a grand system of physical, mental and
moral training, which has been little understood and grossly
misconceived and misrepresented.</p>
          <p>What, then, is the training and what are the formative
elements and forces of the Soldier-Life? I answer:</p>
          <list type="simple">
            <item>The essential character of the Soldier-Life is “Service;”</item>
            <item>Its every employment, its all-pervading law, is “Duty;”</item>
            <item>Its first lesson—Obedience unquestioning;</item>
            <item>Its last lesson—Command unquestioned;</item>
            <item>Its daily discipline—Accountability unceasing;</item>
            <item>Its final burden—Responsibility unmeasured;</item>
            <item>Its every-day experience—Hardships, Perils, Crises unparalleled;</item>
            <item>Its social atmosphere—Freedom from Social Shams;</item>
            <item>Its compensation—Fixed Pay;</item>
            <item>Its inspiration—Promotion from Above.</item>
          </list>
          <p>If you have measured these elements as I have mentioned
them, there can be little need of elaboration or of argument.
The compact analysis makes ample impression at
<pb id="stiles360" n="360"/>
once of theoretical soundness and of practical power. Beyond
a doubt these are the essential elements and forces of the
military life; they are such as must of necessity be unceasingly
operative, and their influence in the development of character
can scarcely be exaggerated. Let us briefly consider them.</p>
          <p>The essential character of the soldier-life is “Service.”</p>
          <p>Can this be questioned? When a man enters the military
profession, whether as an officer or a private soldier, by that
very act he is cut off from the pursuit of his personal aims and
purposes and devoted to the service of his country. Thereafter
he has no home, no farm, no workshop, no business. He knows
no self-directed future, attempts nothing, expects nothing, for
himself. Every man outside the army regards him, and he
regards himself, as a man relieved, separated from the
entanglements and opportunities of the business world, and
consecrated to a service which may at any time demand the
sacrifice even of his life. Our English Bible, upon this, as upon
so many practical phases of our human experience, rings
wondrous true. Wrote the great apostle: “No man that warreth
entangleth himself with the affairs of this life; that he may
please him who hath chosen him to be a soldier.”</p>
          <p>The keynote which inspires and dominates and regulates all
this life of “Service” is the single, simple majestic law of
“Duty.” No employment of the soldier is too trivial and none
too great to be included in this all-embracing term and
regulated by this all-pervading law.</p>
          <p>Descriptive names and phrases express and impress
conceptions, and thus frequently constitute a sort of connecting
link between causes and effects, principles and results.
“Service;” “the service;” “entered the service;” “discharged
from the service;” “promoted for gallant and meritorious
service:” “Duty;” “on duty;” “off duty;” “present for duty;”
“absent from duty;” “shot to death for absence from
duty”—how many times, during the four years from '61 to '65,
do you suppose I read, wrote, uttered, heard these and kindred
expressions? Is it not clear that, by his everyday's experience
and intercourse, this one great figure—his
<pb id="stiles361" n="361"/>
life a “service,” its employment “duty”—is burned in upon the
soldier's soul?</p>
          <p>In the light of these principles, and of his lifelong training, we
gain a new conception of that sublime sentence in General
Lee's letter to his son, “Duty is the sublimest word in the
English language;” and of that groan of his mighty soul in the
crisis and agony of defeat, “It is my duty to live.”</p>
          <p>The first lesson of the soldier-life is unquestioning
Obedience.</p>
          <p>No one will deny the justness of the analysis here.
Undeniably, the first lesson of the soldier's life, logically and
chronologically, is obedience. There is no department, no
business, no station, in which instant, implicit, blindfold
obedience is so vital to safety and success, or enforced by such
terrible sanctions. In military matters hesitation is disobedience,
disobedience is mutiny, mutiny is death.</p>
          <p>The principle of the soldier's obedience is the principle of
<hi rend="italics">obedience,</hi> a principle very little understood and very much
contemned in this day and land. It is this: authority is to be
obeyed, not because it commands what is right, but because it
has the right to command. One under rightful authority is
therefore absolved from responsibility as to the policy or
propriety or consequences of the command; his sole dignity, as
well as duty, is to obey with unquestioning alacrity. This
principle is not palatable to the republican sovereigns of this
country, yet it is a principle notwithstanding—not exclusive, nor
of universal application, but it has its place, and, in its place, is
of vital importance. It is the principle on which God governs the
world, the father his family, the soldier his subordinates; and it
has other, many other, applications.</p>
          <p>Its direct antagonism is <hi rend="italics">“higher law,”</hi> that is, a law higher
than the commands of rightful authority; in other words,
authority is to be obeyed, not because it has the right to
command, but because it commands what is right. This
principle, too, has its applications, but it is not applicable to a
subordinate under rightful authority. The harmony between the
two is found, I think, in a limitation upon the principle of
obedience. We pass from the law of obedience
<pb id="stiles362" n="362"/>
to the higher law when, but only when, the command is so
palpably and grossly wrong that the authority can no longer be
rightful and subjection to it no longer endured. This is the right
of <hi rend="italics">revolution,</hi> and is applicable by way of exception to every
human relation and authority.</p>
          <p>The soldier, however, has very little sympathy with the right
of revolution, or any modification of or exception to the law of
unquestioning obedience. His theory and practice in this regard
find apt illustration in the reply of General Jackson to the
brigade commander who gave excellent reasons for having
modified the order of march: “Sir, you should have obeyed the
order first and reasoned about it afterwards. Consider yourself
under arrest.”</p>
          <p>The last lesson of the soldier-life is unquestioned Command.</p>
          <p>The analysis of the life and its lessons is not original with
me; it is at least nineteen hundred years old, and rests on the
authority of one who was a superb development of the most
military nation of history, that grand old Roman centurion
whose interview with the Son of God is perhaps the most
striking of the Gospel narratives. Said he: “I also am a man set
under authority, having under me soldiers, and I say unto one,
Go, and he goeth; and to another, Come, and he cometh.” Here
are the two great correlative lessons of the life, obedience and
command, and both are absolute. This is the soldier, not
ashamed to obey, not afraid to command; knowing how to
render, and thus learning how to exact, obedience.</p>
          <p>The daily lesson of the life is unceasing Accountability.</p>
          <p>The soldier breathes, as it were, an atmosphere of
accountability. His daily routine is made up of inspections and
reports. What he is, what he has, what he does, his person, his
possessions, his conduct, are constantly passing under a
scrutiny so searching that nothing escapes, however; trivial,
and all must conform to unvarying “Regulations.”
This is perhaps the most prominent and impressive feature of
the life. I need not enlarge upon it. The fact is patent— 
can its influence be doubted? Apart now from your impression
<pb id="stiles363" n="363"/>
as to what the soldier is, what ought he to be as the result
of such training? Can you conceive of anything tending more to
develop regularity, reliability, promptness, accuracy, even in the
smallest details?</p>
          <p>In the upper grades of the soldier-life, mark how this
accountability is retained and developed into Responsibility,
which, in the case of the commander-in-chief, becomes
absolutely awful, unmeasured and unmeasurable.</p>
          <p>Responsibility! I had almost said no other human being can
have any adequate conception of the meaning of the term.
Responsible for what? For the lives of his followers, for the
future of their bereft families; but it is not life or death, not
victory or defeat alone, that trembles in the balance of his
battles. It is the life and honor of his country, the weal or woe
of millions yet to be. He orders the charge, and liberty and
destiny and history flicker in the gleam of his bayonets.</p>
          <p>The experiences of the life are unparalleled Hardships,
Perils, Crises.</p>
          <p>It would be superfluous to enlarge upon these, the most
external and palpable features of a soldier's life, so shortly after
a war which has overspread a continent and filled a land with
veterans. Nor will we stay to prove what no one will deny, that
robustness of character, dauntless determination, courage that
saves from, if it does not hide, a multitude of sins, and a
composure and balance of soul that no excitement can disturb,
no terror overwhelm, are the legitimate fruits of the soldier
training.</p>
          <p>The social atmosphere of the soldier-life is Freedom from
Social Shams.</p>
          <p>The unconventionality and candor of student life are
proverbial, and yet, though I stepped from the hearty, ideal
student life of Old Yale into the ranks of the Confederate
soldiery, it was not long before I felt that I had never before
realized how unstudied, unconventional, and absolutely sincere
human life could be. It was almost startling, the degree to
which I knew other men, my comrades, and felt that I was
known by them. All the little shams, insincerities, and
<pb id="stiles364" n="364"/>
concealments of ordinary society disappeared; until, for the
first time in our lives, we seemed to be stripped bare of the
disguises under which we had therefore been accustomed to
hide our real characters, not only from the world in general and
from our most intimate associates and companions, but even
from ourselves.</p>
          <p>It was this which imparted to the religious life of the army a
power and thrill unattainable, even unapproachable, in ordinary
life. So close did men get to each other that I experienced no
difficulty and no embarrassment in conversing with every man
in the company on the subject of personal religion, and in these
conferences have often felt that I was playing upon a naked
human soul, between whom and myself there was absolutely
no barrier and no screen. It was an experience thrilling and
tremendous indeed. In view of it, I have more than once
remarked that if my Maker should reveal to me that I had but a
short time to live, and should permit me to choose a position in
which I could accomplish most for the regeneration of my
fellow-men, I should unhesitatingly say, “Let me be an officer
in an army, in a time of active service.”</p>
          <p>The compensation of the soldier-life is Fixed Pay.</p>
          <p>The importance and influence of this feature cannot be
estimated until you have answered this question: What is the
most demoralizing of all human desires and pursuits? I know
not how you will better answer than in the words of Holy Writ;
for the wisdom of God has embodied the answer in a proverb,
“The love of money is the root of all evil.” And the context is
most impressive! “They that will be rich fall into temptation and
a snare, and into many foolish and hurtful lusts, which drown
men in destruction and perdition.” A proposition thus enunciated
needs no enforcement, and no one will contend that this terrific
indictment is less true or less applicable to-day than when the
noble apostle warned his “son Timothy” against this the greatest
of all the lures of the tempter. And, so surely as opportunity
makes temptation, the soldier, looking securely to his sufficient
but fixed compensation, having his undivided services
demanded and paid for by his country, and being
<pb id="stiles365" n="365"/>
consequently unable to devote himself to any lucrative
employment, must be in great measure protected against the
debasing passion of avarice.</p>
          <p>The inspiration of the life is Promotion from Above.</p>
          <p>Evidently the soldier's compensation is not the inspiration of
his calling: and it is perhaps more true of him than of any other
man that his chief inspiration is honorable advancement in his
profession. Call it love of glory, if you please; even at that it is
almost infinitely more elevating and ennobling than love of
money, which is the ruling motive of much the larger part of
mankind, certainly in this age and land. But the soldier does not
call it love of glory. He is no moral philosopher or theorist; he is
a practical man, and his inspiration, that of which he talks and
dreams, that for which he serves and strives, is all embodied in
one word—<hi rend="italics">promotion.</hi> This is “the life of the service.” So
peculiarly true is this, that the soldier's progress has well-nigh
appropriated the term “promotion,” as the soldier's life has
appropriated the title “service.”</p>
          <p>But it is not the desire for promotion, however inspiring, to
which I wish chiefly to ask your attention, but rather the
peculiar law of military promotion, namely, that it is <hi rend="italics">promotion
from above.</hi> Before you estimate the importance of this feature,
let me ask you another question: What is the second great
demoralizing influence of our age, and particularly of our
country? I have not here the Word of God for answer; but in
these days of unblushing demagogism I am sure of your
concurrence when I say, it is flattery and service of the mob,
cowardly concession to it, in order to secure promotion <hi rend="italics">from
below.</hi> I mean no reflection upon the right or principle of suffrage;
but the practice of suffrage, and the means commonly resorted
to to control it for personal ends, are at once a menace to free
government and a degradation of the candidate and the voter.
No honest man can now pass through a political contest without
being disgusted, if happily he be not also surprised, at the means
employed against him.</p>
          <p>The true soldier knows nothing of such contests or
influences. He never dreams of promotion by any other power
<pb id="stiles366" n="366"/>
than that of his superiors, or on any other ground than gallant
and meritorious service. No! the soldier's principle, the soldier's
inspiration, is promotion <hi rend="italics">from above,</hi> and it cuts off a world of
temptation and demoralization thus to lift a man's eyes and
efforts <hi rend="italics">up</hi> for personal elevation and advancement.</p>
          <p>We have finished our review of the root forces of the
Soldier-Life. Where will you find principles of greater power
for the development of character?</p>
          <p>Is it objected that the soldier, as we see him in actual life to-day,
fails to exhibit any close conformity to these elevated
principles and lofty ideals? I answer that the like failure
marks the embodiment among men of the principles and ideals
of every lofty life—even of our holy religion. But balanced
men do not on this ground question either the truth and beauty
of these principles and ideals, or the sincere adoption of them
by the followers of the Christ, or their moulding influence for
good upon those who adopt them.</p>
          <p>Is it objected further that, only the highest class of recruits
could be expected to appreciate the philosophy of such a
system? True, but the same is true of every high vocation— 
that only a few choice souls thoroughly grasp the inner
philosophy, the root principles, the formative forces of the
calling to which they have devoted their lives. But it is also true
that intellectual appreciation, however much to be desired, is
not indispensable to the operation and the moulding power of
formative forces such as we have discussed. A young man
who enters the military service and is subjected to its discipline
and training may not have intellectual life and interest enough
even to inquire what it is that is making a new man of him;
notwithstanding, being compelled to conform his conduct to the
regulations and to live the strenuous life we have just sketched,
new habits will gradually be formed and the new man will
unconsciously be made.</p>
          <p>A touching and beautiful illustration of the justness of this
soldier analysis, and the character-moulding power of its
principles, occurred the first time I made use of it in public
<pb id="stiles367" n="367"/>
speech, applying it in that instance to a great soldier of the
Confederacy, and showing how the mould prefigured the man.
At the close of the address the son of another and one of the
very greatest of our Confederate leaders, who had fallen in
battle early in the war, pressed his way to my side, saying, with
the deepest feeling: “Major, you have, in
a very just sense, introduced my own father to me to-day. I
have always admired the majestic outline of his perfect
manhood, but never until I heard you just now have I realized
where his qualities came from, nor sympathized, as I should
have done, with my father's almost passionate love and
reverence for his profession. It is all clear to me now.”</p>
          <p>I am not a blind enthusiast. I admit that the almost enforced
idleness of the camp in time of peace, the absence of women
and children and the lack of other refining and elevating
influence of home, are blemishes in the life of the soldier.
Nevertheless, I think we may, in the light of our analysis, begin
to comprehend why great soldiers—Sir Philip Sidney, Henry
Havelock, Hedley Vicars, Chinese Gordon, Stonewall Jackson,
Robert Lee—have exhibited an almost unrivaled elevation,
strength, and perfection of character, both as men and as
Christians. The late Dr. T. De Witt Talmage never penned a
truer or a stronger paragraph than the following:</p>
          <p>“The sword has developed the grandest natures that the
world ever saw. It has developed courage—that sublime
energy of the soul which defies the universe when it feels
itself to be in the right. It has developed a self-sacrifice which
repudiates the idea that our life is worth more than anything
else, when for a principle it throws that life away as much as to
say, ‘It is not necessary that I live, but it is necessary that
righteousness triumph.’ There are thousands among the
Northern and Southern veterans of our Civil War who are
ninety-five per cent. larger and mightier in soul than they would
have been had they not, during the four years of national agony,
turned their back on home and fortune, and at the front
sacrificed all for a principle.”</p>
          <p>In the light of all this, we begin also to understand why the
writers of the Sacred Canon make use of the life of the
<pb id="stiles368" n="368"/>
soldier more frequently perhaps than of any other, as a
figure of the Christian life. Nor can it do harm in this
connection to note that when the Son of God “marveled” at
a Roman soldier's <hi rend="italics">faith,</hi> pronouncing it the greatest he had
found on earth, the man himself traced this faith to the
teachings of his military life, saying substantially, with us— 
I have learned <hi rend="italics">as a soldier</hi> the two great lessons of subjection
and supremacy, of obedience and command; do you but
issue the order, “Speak the word only, and my servant shall
be healed.”</p>
