        <head>PREFACE.</head>
        <p>THE narrative contained in the following pages is
substantially a correct account of prison life in the Old
Capitol during the period specified. The story of each
prisoner is recorded in the narrator's own words and
style, as far as is practicable. A change has of course
been made in all names, except those of Mrs. Surratt
and her daughter. Many trivial matters and events have
been noticed, as they serve to show the petty
annoyances to which prisoners were subjected, and
which contributed to render imprisonment in the Old
Capitol “durance vile,” in its most literal signification.
Written soon after the occurrence of the events which
it relates, the style of this little work is necessarily
hurried, its only object being the portrayal of <hi rend="italics">one</hi> of
the many phases of Southern suffering.</p>

        <div2 type="chapter">
          <head>CHAPTER I.</head>
          <argument>
            <p>Arrest of Mr. and Mrs. Windsor—Trip to Washington— 
First view of the Old Capitol—Conversation with the
Superintendent—Interview with Mrs. Windsor.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>IT was the morning of the 6th of April, 1865,
that the following paragraph in the day's paper
caught my eye:</p>
          <p>“Yesterday afternoon, Mr. Windsor and wife
were arrested and conveyed to the Carrol Prison.
Mrs. Windsor is the sister of Major-General B., of
the Confederate Army, and a native of Baltimore,
where her family still reside.”</p>
          <p>The notice shocked me exceedingly, as I had
left my friend but a few days before, just
recovering from severe sickness, and I knew the
risk and danger to her of any great excitement.
<pb id="lenox12" n="12"/>
My first impulse was immediately to go to her. I
did not hope to procure her release, but thought I
might obtain permission to see her, and learn the
cause of her incarceration. I found on consulting
my watch, that I should be obliged to wait for the
train leaving Baltimore the ensuing morning at
seven. But the day was not lost, for I busied
myself in preparing such articles as I judged would
be acceptable under the circumstances.</p>
          <p>
Seven A. M., found me at the depot, with my
basket, etc. I took the cars and arrived in
Washington at the usual time.</p>
          <p>
My first visit was to a lawyer, whose advice I
needed in  regard to obtaining a pass to visit my
friend. He strongly opposed my desire, and
begged me by all means to return home, for such
was the excitement in the city, that no one was
safe from arrest. I assured him I had no fears on
that score, as I had done nothing to provoke the
hostility of the Government; and, besides that, I
was much too insignificant to attract
<pb id="lenox13" n="13"/>
notice. Seeing I was not to be moved, he advised
me to try and obtain a pass through H., the
Superintendent of the prison, whom he represented
as a rough but kind-hearted man. If H. was
absent, or if he refused to admit me, then I would
be obliged to see the Judge Advocate at the War
Department, and request a passport. Thanking him
for his kindness, I left to try the effect of woman's
eloquence on the rough customer with whom I had
to deal.</p>
          <p>“Carrol Prison” and the “Old Capitol” are
adjoining houses, situated on a hill in rear of the
present Capitol. They occupy the whole length of
a square in front, with wings extending each side,
so that there is about half a square of ground in the
centre.  The Old Capitol contained Confederate
soldiers, prisoners of war, while Carrol—main
building—was devoted to the use of such
unfortunate females as aroused either the ire or
suspicion of the Government, with the occasional
addition of a Southern Governor, and cotton-planter, prisoners of state.
One wing of
<pb id="lenox14" n="14"/>
the building was appropriated to the family of H.,
and the other contained, for the most part, horse
thieves, fraudulent contractors, unlucky blockade-runners, and a variety
of nondescripts; in short, a
company more numerous than select. Such was
Carrol Prison, on my first arrival.
</p>
          <p>On reaching the top of the steep hill, I saw
before me the long row of tall buildings with many
windows, all of which were secured with iron bars
similar to those which protect the windows of a
jail. The casements were devoid of glass, except
in one room, and the wing occupied by H. Before
the row of buildings, and also opposite, paced the
guard with measured step. Occasionally a forlorn-looking creature would
approach the barred
window, and look with longing gaze on the grass
and trees opposite, which were now tinted with
the green of spring.</p>
          <p>
I approached the first soldier I saw, and said, 
“Will you please to tell me where Carrol Prison
is?” The only answer I received was a jerk of
<pb id="lenox15" n="15"/>
the thumb over his shoulder. Supposing he meant
by the action that I was to go farther on, I did so,
and encountering a chap of some sixteen years,
whose nasal twang betrayed his nationality, I
made the same inquiry of him.
</p>
          <p>“Carrol Prison? That's it, where you see the
men standing at the door. Want to see somebody
there?”</p>
          <p>
“Yes,” I replied; “I wish to see Mr. H.”</p>
          <p>
“Guess you can't see him; but spozen you
might as well try.”</p>
          <p>
As that was what I fully intended doing, I
walked on to the door indicated, which was about
midway the square.</p>
          <p>
I entered a wide hall, with benches on both
sides, one of which was occupied by soldiers off
duty, principally Dutch, who were discussing the
merits of favorite officers, and boasting their own
deeds of valor, in a lingo which I suppose they
regarded as English. All I could understand was,
“Dat vat dey gits for fighting mit Siegel,” which
seemed to be the burden and
<pb id="lenox16" n="16"/>
refrain of the whole conversation. Seated on the
opposite bench, I had a fine opportunity of
studying the physique of these valiant defenders,
and also of exercising my own patience.</p>
          <p>
At length I heard voices in the room
opposite,—and now the door is opened, and a lady
and gentleman leave, being escorted to their
carriage by a man of middle height, very stout,
with florid complexion, dark hair, somewhat gray,
and eyes that twinkled incessantly—in fact he
reminded me of pictures of  “Santa Claus,” except
on a smaller scale. I immediately concluded that
this person was the one I sought. Controlling my
nervousness as well as I could, I mustered
sufficient courage on his return to the building to
say:</p>
          <p>
“Can I see Mr. H. for a few moments?”</p>
          <p>
“Certainly, madam; I am he; walk in.” Saying
which, he threw open the door of the room I had
before noticed. I entered, and found myself in a
large room with no furniture, except 
<pb id="lenox17" n="17"/>
a few chairs, 
and in one corner a large upright desk, at which a 
man sat writing, stopping every now and then to 
thrust a bundle of papers into one of the numerous 
pigeonholes.</p>
          <p>
“Well, madam,” said H., “and what can I do for
you?”</p>
          <p>
“I ascertained that you have in your custody a
prisoner, Mrs. Windsor, whom I am extremely
anxious to see, and I have come here for the
purpose of requesting an interview.”</p>
          <p>
“Have you a pass, madam?”
</p>
          <p>“No, sir, but I understood you had the authority
to admit visitors.”</p>
          <p>
“Then you understood a very wrong thing, and
whoever told you that, knew nothing about it.”
</p>
          <p>“But,” I persisted, “do you never allow visitors
without a pass?”</p>
          <p>
To this question I had no answer, but a shrug
of the shoulders. While this conversation was
progressing, the men from the other rooms had
<pb id="lenox18" n="18"/>
collected, and were listening. At length H. said,</p>
          <p>
“Where are you from, madam?”</p>
          <p>
“Baltimore, at present, sir.”</p>
          <p>
At that he uttered a low whistle, and remarked
in an undertone, “Hot-bed of Secessionists;” then
to me:</p>
          <p>
“Of what State are you a native?”</p>
          <p>
“Virginia,” I replied, drawing myself up a little.
Another whistle, and silence.
</p>
          <p>“Any relation to the prisoner?”</p>
          <p>
“First cousin, sir.”
</p>
          <p>At that he stooped down, picked up a stick
which was lying on the floor, and began to 
“whittle.” I began to grow impatient:</p>
          <p>
“Am I to see my friend, or not, sir?”</p>
          <p>“Ever taken the oath of allegiance, madam?”</p>
          <p>
“No, sir.”</p>
          <p>
“Any objection to doing so, madam?”</p>
          <p>
“Yes, sir.”</p>
          <p>
“Why, madam?” all this time not taking his
eyes off the stick, or changing his attitude.
</p>
          <pb id="lenox19" n="19"/>
          <p>
“Because, sir, I have been paroled, and if my
word is not sufficient, neither would my oath be.”</p>
          <p>
Another low whistle; then, “That's true,
madam; but there is where I have the advantage
of you Christians. I can swear to any thing—it
makes no difference—ha! ha! ha! Who paroled
you?”</p>
          <p>
“General Butler.”
</p>
          <p>He looked up as if astonished.
</p>
          <p>“Are you loyal, madam?”</p>
          <p>
“Perfectly,” I answered, returning the steady
look, at which he had recourse to the stick again,
and remained silent.
</p>
          <p>“Well, sir,”said I, at last, “what are you going
to do?”
</p>
          <p>He did not answer for several minutes, and
then said, slowly and hesitatingly, as if speaking
more to himself than to me:</p>
          <p>
“If I was only sure of your loyalty, you see;”
then stopped, and, looking up from the stick, asked
abruptly:</p>
          <p>
“What is your name?”
</p>
          <pb id="lenox20" n="20"/>
          <p>
“Maria Miller,” I replied. I expected the next
question to be, “Who gave you this name?” but it
was only,</p>
          <p>
“Any relation to the Dr. Miller of this city?”
</p>
          <p>“No, sir.”
</p>
          <p>“Well, then, I guess I may as well let you see
your cousin, if”—stopping again, and looking me
full in the face—“you are sure you are loyal.”
</p>
          <p>“Why, sir, can you doubt it, when I tell you I
have been paroled by General Butler?”</p>
          <p>
He made no reply, but called out, “Nelson!”
</p>
          <p>A man, tall and lank, with sandy hair and
beard, answered the summons.
</p>
          <p>“Here, take this basket”—pointing to mine -
“and if, on inspection, it proves to be all right, give
it to Mr. Windsor, room No. 10, second floor, and
tell Mrs. Windsor she is wanted downstairs.”
</p>
          <p>Nelson took the basket and departed, and H.
also. I drew a chair towards me, and took my
seat, awaiting the arrival of my friend. In the
mean time, several men in citizens' clothes
<pb id="lenox21" n="21"/>
came in; two of them sat near me, while one
walked up and down the room. I immediately
surmised that these “gentlemen” were government
detectives, nor was I mistaken.</p>
          <p>
After the lapse of some fifteen or twenty
minutes, my friend appeared, conducted by
Nelson. She was very much agitated, and her first
words were, “What on earth induced you to come?”—not very flattering, considering the trouble I
had taken.
</p>
          <p>“I came to see you. As soon as I read of your
arrest, I determined to see you, if possible, and
ascertain what was best to be done.”
</p>
          <p>“Oh, you will never get out of this place again,”
said Mrs. Windsor, wringing her hands.
</p>
          <p>“Stop,” said I; “this will never do.” I took her
hand in mine, but I had no sooner done so than the
man I mentioned before, stopped and stood
opposite, watching us closely.
</p>
          <p>“Just see that detective, how he is watching
us,” whispered my friend.“Oh, go; please go.”
</p>
          <p>“Just listen to me,” said I.“You are
<pb id="lenox22" n="22"/>
frightened out of your wits, and imagine all sorts 
of things. Now, I want you to tell me how you 
came here, and what I can do to help you.”
</p>
          <p>“I cannot tell you while those men are by, and
please let go my hand, or they will think I am
giving you something.”</p>
          <p>
“Oh, that's it, is it? Well, I will relieve their
anxiety,” at the same time opening my hand, so the
man watching could see I had nothing in it, which
little manoeuvre on my part seemed to satisfy him,
for he walked into the next room.
</p>
          <p>“Now you can tell me,” said I, moving my
chair, so as to turn my back partly towards the
other two.
</p>
          <p>“I really do not know what the charges are
against us, except that Ned, our man-servant,
reported that Mr. Mallory, from Richmond, had
been staying at our house, and that, I believe, led
to our arrest.”</p>
          <p>
“How utterly absurd.”</p>
          <p>
“Yes; but I will tell you how the mistake
originated. Do you remember the young man,
<pb id="lenox23" n="23"/>
Robert Mallory, that Mr. Windsor had as tutor for
the boys, years ago, and who afterwards went to
Richmond?”</p>
          <p>
“Certainly I do.”
</p>
          <p>“Well, it happened one day at dinner, a
gentleman at our house was asking about him, and
Ned, who was waiting, heard the conversation,
and I suppose confounded the two men; at any
rate, a few days after that, Ned was dismissed for
some misdemeanor, and the following day his
mother went to see Mr. Windsor's sister-in-law,
and told her she was afraid Ned was going to get
us into trouble, as he had been to Colonel Foster
and told him Mr. Mallory had been staying at our
house.”</p>
          <p>
“It seems to me,” said I, “that this can be very 
easily disproved.”</p>
          <p>
“But I am so afraid of being sent to the
Massachusetts' Penitentiary,” said my friend,
crying afresh.
</p>
          <p>“Is there any thing you are uneasy about?”
said I.</p>
          <pb id="lenox24" n="24"/>
          <p>
“Yes; do you remember brother Harry sending 
us the photographs of Will. Gordon and himself?”
</p>
          <p>“Those you sent me? I have them both now
at home; you asked me to keep them for you,
which I have done.”</p>
          <p>
“Oh, why have you not burned them?”
</p>
          <p>“Because you did not tell me to, and as they
came by flag of truce, I see no harm in keeping
them.”</p>
          <p>
“But Will.'s has on the back, ‘Mrs. Windsor,
with the compliments of Will. Gordon, 15th Va.
Cav.’ ”</p>
          <p>
“What of that?”</p>
          <p>
“Will., it seems, came over lately. He ran the
blockade and was captured, and is now in the Old
Capitol. They accuse him of being a spy, and
intend hanging him. If they find that photograph
with my name on it, they will be sure to accuse
me of harboring him, and then we will be sent to 
the penitentiary for life.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox25" n="25"/>
          <p>“But surely the date on the picture will show
that it was not sent recently.”</p>
          <p>
“There is no date on it that I can remember;
besides, it would be no proof to the authorities.”</p>
          <p>
I began to be a little uneasy.</p>
          <p>
“If I could only have those pictures burnt,”
said Mrs. Windsor, “I should rest contented.”</p>
          <p>“Then I will go back immediately and burn
them.”</p>
          <p>
“You cannot, they will never let you go;
besides, they must have the photographs by this
time.”</p>
          <p>
“I will attempt it, at any rate. But how shall I
let you know if I succeed? Let me think. I have it
now. I will get permission to send you a telegram,
and if I have destroyed the pictures I will say,
‘Arrived safely—found all well;’ but if the
detectives have them, I will say, ‘Arrived safely— 
mother not so well.’  Will that answer?”
</p>
          <p>“Capitally,” said my friend, her face brightening.</p>
          <pb id="lenox26" n="26"/>
          <p>At that moment Mr. Nelson made his
appearance to inform me that the time was up,
and I had to go; but before doing so, I said,
</p>
          <p>“Mr. Nelson, is there any objection to my
sending a dispatch for my friend? I wish to assure
her of my safe arrival at home, and also of the
condition of her mother, about whom she is
uneasy.”</p>
          <p>
“Certainly not, madam.”</p>
          <p>
“If you will give me your address, sir, I shall
be obliged.”
</p>
          <p>He immediately went to the desk and wrote, 
“Jas. A. Nelson, Superintendent, Carrol Prison.”
</p>
          <p>“I shall send the telegram to you, sir, to be
delivered to Mrs. Windsor.”
</p>
          <p>“Very well, madam. I will attend to it.”</p>
          <p>Turning to my friend, I bade her good-bye, and
betook myself to the depot.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER II.</head>
          <argument>
            <p>Return to Baltimore—Destruction of the
photographs—Followed by Detectives—Another trip to
Washington—First visit to the Judge Advocate's office—Scene at
the Judge Advocate's office the following day—Dennis Ryan's
story—The dead Confederate.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>I HAD a cold, bleak ride to Baltimore, and
although it was the express train, yet it seemed to
me to move slowly, such was my impatience. On
our way we passed the car containing the remains
of President Lincoln, bound for Baltimore. When I
reached the city, I found every place closed, and
flags and crape in any quantity fluttering in the
breeze. My fear was that there would be no
conveyance at the depot, but I was mistaken, for
notwithstanding the manifest grief, I found that
business was still attended to. I jumped into the
first carriage I saw, and told the man to drive quickly 
to No. 33—Street, 
<pb id="lenox28" n="28"/>
my heart beating rapidly,
the meanwhile, every time I thought of the probable 
fate of the unfortunate photographs, for I had no 
more fancy for a Massachusetts Penitentiary than had 
my friend.</p>
          <p>I reached my boarding-house in safety, and the
first thing I did, was to open my album, where, to
my great relief, I saw the pictures of both   Harry
and Will., in undisturbed serenity, gazing at me
with open-eyed wonder, as I tore them ruthlessly
from their fastenings, and striking a match
consigned them to the flames. I drew a long
breath as I saw them gradually turn to ashes. And
now I made ready to send the dispatch, but on
arriving at the office to my great discomfort found
it closed. Of course there was but one thing to
do—wait—but that, under the circumstances, was
very difficult.</p>
          <p>The next day I was more successful, and
congratulated myself on executing the business so
satisfactorily. But, alas! “the best laid plans,” etc. I
discovered afterwards that the 
<pb id="lenox29" n="29"/>
telegram never reached 
its destination. Whether it was owing to our being 
overheard by the watchful detectives, or whether 
Nelson's mind misgave him, I am not able to say.
</p>
          <p>I had been at home a week or ten days without
hearing from my friends, or having anything occur to
alarm me. The whole country was in an intense
state of excitement, hunting Booth and his
accomplices. Nothing was thought or talked of, but
the one great event. It was at this juncture that I
determined to pay a second visit to Washington,
and endeavor to effect the release of my friends.
Had I really understood the true state of affairs, I
would have known how futile all efforts at that
time would have been. My gentlemen friends did
their utmost to dissuade me; but having no very high
opinion of masculine moral courage, I determined
to take the matter in my own hands and go. I had
noticed on my previous visit to Washington, and
ever since my return, I had been followed in my
walks by persons whom I supposed 
<pb id="lenox30" n="30"/>
to be detectives. 
Conscious of my own rectitude, the matter gave me 
little or no concern, except the feeling of annoyance 
at being watched.</p>
          <p>
On my arrival at Washington, I found the
excitement, if anything, intensified—soldiers on
guard in every direction—news boys shouting 
“Extras”—men loafing at corners, talking in loud
tones, and gesticulating violently—and parties of
boys and half-grown men, parading the streets,
crying, “death to murderers and traitors,” 
“vengeance,” etc., etc. I made my way as fast as I
could to my friend the lawyer, and told him my
plan, which was, to see the Secretary of War and
lay the matter of my friends' arrest before him, and
ask their release. I told him I had proof of their
innocence, and it was those proofs I wished to
have examined. My friend endeavored to dissuade
me, assuring me that no one was safe, that he had
heard the best Union men in New York say, that
nothing would induce them to go to Washington
during 
<pb id="lenox31" n="31"/>
the excitement. I replied that it might be unsafe
for gentlemen, but surely no woman ran any risk;
at any rate there were none who seemed willing
to help my friends now, and I was determined to
do all I could.</p>
          <p>
I next proceeded to the Carrol Prison and
inquired, as before, for Mr. H., but learned to my
vexation that he was absent. I then asked to see
Nelson, and on his making his appearance said, 
“Can you not allow me to see Mrs. Windsor?”
</p>
          <p>“No,” he answered gruffly.
</p>
          <p>“When will Mr. H. return?”</p>
          <p>
“Can't say; may-be to-night; may-be not for a
week.”</p>
          <p>
Here was a damper; but I said, </p>
          <p>
“Will you take my 
basket and empty it? it is for Mrs. Windsor, you know.”
</p>
          <p>He picked up the basket and took it with him,
returning in a few moments.
</p>
          <p>“To whom must I go to get a pass?” said I.
</p>
          <p>“Judge Advocate, War Department.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox32" n="32"/>
          <p>“Thank you. Will you be kind enough to tell
my friends I came, but was not allowed to see
them?”</p>
          <p>“No, I'll not; do you suppose I have nothing
else to do, but run on errands?”
</p>
          <p>I answered nothing, but, taking my basket, left
with a heavy heart. Suddenly it struck me I could
let the Windsors know I had been there, in spite of
Nelson. So I walked down to the end of the
square, slowly, as if my empty basket was very
heavy; then crossed on the opposite side, and
walked leisurely along, putting my weight down,
every now and then, as if to rest. The guard on
that side took me, I suppose, for some one coming
from market, for he just glanced at me and passed
on.</p>
          <p>
My friends' room I knew was a front one, so I
was pretty sure they would see me from their
window; nor was I mistaken. Mrs. Windsor told
me afterwards what a relief it was, for, not
receiving the telegram, she had taken it for
granted that I was in prison.</p>
          <pb id="lenox33" n="33"/>
          <p>I now proceeded to the Judge Advocate's
office, which was located near the War
Department. Passing through the unwashed
crowd, I asked the way of the messenger at the
door. He pointed up the flight of steep narrow
steps, and said, “Second floor, to left.” On
reaching the top of the dark stairway, I saw an
open door, which I entered, and found myself in a
large room, with about half-a-dozen men busily
writing, and some three or four reading the papers.
On repeating my question, a man showed me into
a front room, and informed me that the officer was
then at the Old Capitol, but was expected in half an
hour.
</p>
          <p>“Very well. I will wait,” said I.</p>
          <p>
I looked around the room to see what there
was of interest. Nothing at all; the furniture just
such as I had seen in the public offices, except
that this had the advantage of being new. I soon
became tired of waiting and staring about, and was
wishing for the paper a man near me seemed 
reading. I suppose this 
<pb id="lenox34" n="34"/>
thought induced me to raise
my eyes to his face, and as I did so, I perceived 
he was not reading, but watching me. His face 
was so strangely familiar, that it startled me. The 
man, on seeing my look of surprise, immediately 
turned his back and commenced reading. Just 
then I heard a carriage drive to the door, and 
looking out, I caught a glimpse of an officer in 
uniform, who quickly ascended the stairs, and 
entered the room where I was.</p>
          <p>
“The Judge Advocate, I presume,” said I,
rising from my seat.</p>
          <p>
He bowed.</p>
          <p>
“I have come to request permission to visit a
relation now confined in the Carrol Prison,” I said,
in a tremulous voice.</p>
          <p>
“The name?” he asked.</p>
          <p>
“Mrs. Windsor.”</p>
          <p>
“I have no knowledge of any such prisoner.”</p>
          <p>
“Yes, sir, she and her husband have been
there for the past ten days.”
</p>
          <p>“On what charge?”</p>
          <pb id="lenox35" n="35"/>
          <p>I related to him what I had heard about the
servant. He listened attentively.
</p>
          <p>“Are your friends loyal?”</p>
          <p>
“Undoubtedly.”</p>
          <p>“Then give yourself no uneasiness; it will all
be arranged in a few days.”</p>
          <p>
“I thought of going to see the Secretary of
War, and asking him for my friends' release.”</p>
          <p>
“That is not at all necessary. <hi rend="italics">I</hi> have charge
of the prisoners, and can open the doors to any.
Besides that, the Secretary is so full of business
now, arresting conspirators, that he would
not, in all probability, listen to you. A visit to him
would be useless.”
</p>
          <p>“Can you not give me a pass into the prison?
I came over from Baltimore this morning, and
wish to return to-night.”</p>
          <p>
“Well, no; I can hardly do that to-day, as I shall
be obliged to see the record at the Carrol first;
but if you can remain until to-morrow, and come
here at twelve, I will give you a pass.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox36" n="36"/>
          <p>“Very well, sir, I will do so;” and I began
moving towards the door, when he said:</p>
          <p>“Wait one moment; I wish to make memoranda 
of what you have told me;” saying which,
he walked from the fire by which we had been
standing to his desk opposite. He was quite a fine
looking man—that is, tall and well proportioned,
but with a slight stoop in the shoulders, which
convinced me he had not had a military education,
although he tried to impress me with the contrary
idea. Another peculiarity which struck me was, the
similarity of color in his hair, beard, and <hi rend="italics">buttons.</hi> His
face was full, and his eyes small and very light
blue, but exceedingly bright. I had a fine
opportunity of studying his face as he sat at the
desk and wrote; but I could discover nothing,
except that he was very much elated at the
position he occupied, and wished to make the most
of it—a pardonable vanity, I thought, in one who
had before the war been nobody.</p>
          <p>He scratched off a few lines, and then, turning 
<pb id="lenox37" n="37"/>
to 
me, bowed very politely, which I considered
as a hint to leave, and did so, with a lightened and
hopeful heart. What a kind man, thought I, the
Judge Advocate is! I wondered indeed that my
friends in Baltimore should have opposed my visit
to Washington, when I had already been so
successful. I sounded his praises to my friend at
whose house I was staying, until she too placed
him on a high pedestal, and we said, “Now if the
<hi rend="italics">other</hi> officials were only like <hi rend="italics">him</hi>.” Alas, “Will you
walk into my parlor, said the spider to the fly,” etc.</p>
          <p>
After a restless night of unrefreshing sleep, I
arose, and waited as patiently as I could the time
appointed for my second interview. At length
twelve o'clock drew near, and as my watch
pointed to the hour, I entered the Judge
Advocate's office. A disappointment was in store
for me—the Judge Advocate was not there. The
room was crowded with men and women, all
having an anxious, distressed expression of
countenance. Among the persons, I recognized a
<pb id="lenox38" n="38"/>
former acquaintance, who told me she had come
from a great distance to try and procure the
release of her brother-in-law, who was dying of
consumption in the Old Capitol. He was a
Confederate soldier, whose campaigns were now
ended, and whose one longing was to die at home.
An old man with snow-white hair, which hung
down on his shoulders, also attracted my attention,
as he walked restlessly up and down the room.
Seeing I was looking at him, he approached and
said in an excited tone:</p>
          <p>
“Madam, I hope you have no one you love
confined yonder,” pointing toward the prison
building.</p>
          <p>
“Yes, sir; I have two very dear relations.”</p>
          <p>
“Then, God pity you, and help them;” saying
which he continued his walk for a few moments,
then stopped again and said: “Madam, I have a
daughter there, a school-girl, hardly in her teens,
an only child, and her mother dead. I have been
here day after day, trying to see my darling, and
every day been refused admittance.” The 
<pb id="lenox39" n="39"/>
tears
rolled down his cheeks, and wiping them off,
he added: “Excuse me, madam; I am an old man,
with but little of life before me, and my lot is a
hard one.”</p>
          <p>
I made no reply, and he continued his walk.
Another group that attracted my attention, was a
poor Irish woman, with two children, one four
years of age and the other twelve months. The
mother was miserably clad, and looked in the last
degree wretched, as she tried to quiet the fretful
child. I went up to her and said:</p>
          <p>
“Your little baby seems to be sick.”</p>
          <p>
“And indade he is, ma'am.”
</p>
          <p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
          <p>
“I've come all the way from New York,
ma'am, to try and see the father.”</p>
          <p>
“Ah, where is he?”</p>
          <p>
“In the Carrol, I thinks they call it, ma'am.”</p>
          <p>
“Is he a soldier?”</p>
          <p>
“Agin' his will, ma'am, and I'll just tell yees.
You see the conscript come round, and the first
<pb id="lenox40" n="40"/>
thing Dennis (that's the father) knowed he was
marched off and 'listed. They said the city would
pay money to the families of them as went for
soldiers, and so it did for a while, ma'am, but not as
much as the father made by his work. I got on well,
although my heart was a'most broked in two. That
was in the spring, you see, ma'am, and I got work,
and a lady took Mary, the biggest; so I had only
meself and Brian to take care of, and Dennis would
send us money every little while. But when the cold
came, I did not hear from Dennis, and me strength
began to fail, and thin when I went for the city
money, they told me the 'propration have all gone,
and there was no more. And thin you see, lady, I
was took sick, and Tim—him in me arms—was
born. We would all have died of the cold and
hunger, if it had not been for the kind people Mary
lived with. But what does the child do, ma'am, but
write to the father, as how we was all starvin'; and
thin Dennis wrote me a letter saying as how he
could not stand it, 
<pb id="lenox41" n="41"/>
but meant to desert and take us 
all to Canada. His money had been stole from the 
office that he sent us, and get away he would. Oh, 
ma'am, before I could get the letter answered, 
begging him not to try it, the news came that he had 
deserted, been caught, and put in prison. And now 
I'm trying to see him. Some people gave me money 
to come on, and I'm come, you see, ma'am and 
brought Tim—who has never seen his father—in case,
ma'am, you know—”</p>
          <p>
That was her story. Poor thing! I afterwards
learned that Dennis Ryan met the deserter's fate!
</p>
          <p>All this depressed me so much, that I determined to 
leave the building, and walk around until the Judge 
Advocate arrived, knowing I would be attended to 
last, being the latest comer. As I was passing out, 
the man with the familiar face came forward, and 
said,</p>
          <p>
“Do not leave, ma'am; the Judge Advocate told 
me to tell you he would soon be back.”</p>
          <p>
“I am only going to walk until he does come, and 
can attend to my business.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox42" n="42"/>
          <p>It was half-past one before I saw the carriage
drive up, and then I stood near the door and
watched the departure of the applicants. When
Miss A. came down, I went to her and said:
</p>
          <p>“I hope you have been successful in your
brother's case.”</p>
          <p>
“Dead! dead and buried! and I now go to tell
his heart-broken wife,” she said, bursting into
tears. Yes, he had died in prison, passed from
life's conflict to eternal rest, with none but
strangers near.</p>
          <p>
Last of all came the old man, who seeing me
said: “I hope you'll be more successful than the
rest of us.”
</p>
          <p>“How is that?” I answered.</p>
          <p>
“Not a pass allowed—not one.”</p>
          <p>
Hearing this, I hesitated on going in, when the
same man who had spoken to me before said:</p>
          <p>
“The Judge Advocate says he is waiting for
you.”</p>
        </div2>

          </argument>
          <p>THAT decided me, and I followed the messenger.</p>
          <p>
“Well,” said the Judge Advocate on seeing
me, “I was afraid you thought I had forgotten
you, and that you had gone away.”
</p>
          <p>“Oh, no,” I replied; “but knowing how many
others were before me, I was taking a little walk
while I awaited your leisure.”</p>
          <p>
He opened a drawer and took out a bundle of
papers, and looking carefully over them, drew out
what appeared to be a letter.</p>
          <p>
“Sit down, will you.” I did so, he wheeling his
arm-chair around, so as to be facing me.</p>
          <p>
“I have inquired concerning your relations
<pb id="lenox44" n="44"/>
at the Old Capitol, and find that they are charged with
grave offences—<hi rend="italics">very</hi> grave offences”—said he,
trying to look severe.</p>
          <p>
“Indeed,” said I; “you astonish me.”
</p>
          <p>
“Yes. Is this your handwriting?” showing me the
outside of a letter directed to “Miles R. Windsor,” and
watching me the while.</p>
          <p>I took it in my hand, and replied,
</p>
          <p>“No, sir, it is not.”</p>
          <p>
“It is post-marked Baltimore, you see.”</p>
          <p>
“So I see, sir; but that is no sign I wrote it.”</p>
          <p>“I think you said your name was Anne, did you
not?”</p>
          <p>
“No, sir, I never told you what it was, as you did
not ask me; but I tell you now—it is Maria—Maria
Miller.”</p>
          <p>
“You live at No. 40, --Street, Baltimore, I think
you said?”</p>
          <p>
“No, sir, I did not say it; for I do not live
there.”</p>
          <p>
“Did you ever live in that street?”</p>
          <p>
“Two years ago I did.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox45" n="45"/>
          <p>“And at No. 40?”
</p>
          <p>“No, sir; never.”
</p>
          <p>“Are you loyal?” looking at me closely.</p>
          <p>
“My loyalty is above suspicion.”</p>
          <p>
“What have you been in the habit of writing to
Mr. Windsor about?”
</p>
          <p>“I have never written to him on any subject.”</p>
          <p>
He shrugged his shoulders. “Is not this your
signature?” opening the letter, and pointing to the
bottom of the page, where I saw Anne Clarke.<sic>”</sic></p>
          <p>
“No, sir, it is not.”</p>
          <p>
“Do you recognize the handwriting?”</p>
          <p>“No, sir.”
</p>
          <p>“Do you know a person of that name?”</p>
          <p>
“No, sir.”</p>
          <p>
“Are you sure you did not write it?”</p>
          <p>
“Perfectly.”</p>
          <p>“Have you any of your writing with you?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, sir,” saying which I opened my pocket-book
and took out a pencilled note and handed 
<pb id="lenox46" n="46"/>
it to him.“If you compare the two, you will see
there is no resemblance; or, if you will dictate any
portion of that letter, I will write it here, at your
desk.” He did neither.“Will you let me read that
letter?” said I.</p>
          <p>
“No; I will read it to you.” Then he began:</p>
          <q direct="unspecified">

                <div1 type="letter">

my grief and dismay. To think that after all we
should have failed, and now there is no hope.
After all the blood shed, and Southern soil steeped
in tears, and the god-like Lee humiliated and
forced to surrender in spite of his many victories.
How can we ever bear up? All is lost. What is left
to us but submission and slavery? I am beside
myself with grief, and hardly know what I write.
When I remember how hopeful I was but a short
time since, and now—but I can say no more, my
heart is too full. Let me hear from you soon. Your

          <p>
Between every sentence he would pause a
<pb id="lenox47" n="47"/>
moment and look fixedly at me. On finishing, he
said:
</p>
          <p>“What do you think of that?”
</p>
          <p>I smiled as I answered, “A very foolish and
high-flown letter.”</p>
          <p>
“And do you mean to say, madam, that
those are not your sentiments?”</p>
          <p>
“I do.”</p>
          <p>
“How did <hi rend="italics">you</hi> feel, madam, at Lee's
surrender?”</p>
          <p>
“Very glad that the fighting was ended, sir.”</p>
          <p>
“Do you mean to say you were not sorry?”</p>
          <p>
“I was sorry for the suffering I knew would
ensue.”</p>
          <p>
“And now you have the assurance to sit there
looking me in the face, and saying, not only that
you did not write this letter, but also that you do
not know who did.”
</p>
          <p>“Sir, I am ready to take an oath to that effect.”</p>
          <p>
“And do you suppose I do not see through
<pb id="lenox48" n="48"/>
that letter? Do you think that I believe for one moment
that this”—holding out the letter—“refers to the
defeat of Lee? No, that is used only as a blind, and you
know what this letter means as well as I do.”</p>
          <p>
I remained silent for a moment, and then said, “I
see that you do not believe my protestations, but you
have it in your power to prove whether my words are
true or false. Your detective force, if it be as effective as
represented, can ascertain my place of abode, and also
that of the author of this letter.”
</p>
          <p>He said nothing for a short time, and then turning
to me with a satanic leer—for I can call it nothing else—he
asked,
</p>
          <p>“Are you <hi rend="italics">very</hi> anxious to see your friends at the
Carrol?”</p>
          <p>
“Certainly I am; did I not come here for that purpose?”
</p>
          <p>He wheeled his chair around to his desk and wrote
something on a slip of paper. I held out my hand for it,
but he motioned me back, and 
<pb id="lenox49" n="49"/>
beckoning to the 
man I had so often seen, gave it to him, and said 
to me impatiently, “Now go, go,” which I was only 
too glad to do.</p>
          <p>I left the building, with the man at my side.
We had walked several squares without a word,
when I asked, “Where are you going to take
me?”</p>
          <p>
“To 14th Street, the Provost Marshal's.”</p>
          <p>“Does he give the papers?”</p>
          <p>
“No.”</p>
          <p>
“Does he have to sign them?”</p>
          <p>
“No.”</p>
          <p>
“Is that a pass the Judge Advocate gave
you?”</p>
          <p>
“No.”</p>
          <p>
Then it flashed across me!</p>
          <p>
“Am I arrested?”
</p>
          <p>“So they say.”
</p>
          <p>And that was the paper he wrote, consigning
me to prison! I looked up at the man, and suddenly
it occurred to me where I had seen him.
He was the detective who stood opposite on my 
<pb id="lenox50" n="50"/>
visit to the Carrol, the first time; he it was who
followed me down to the cars, over to Baltimore,
and when I went out there; and in short, dogged
my steps everywhere, and was now taking me to
prison!</p>
          <p>
On realizing my position, my first impulse was
a mad desire to run for my life, but second
thoughts prevailed, and convinced me of the utter
folly of any such act.</p>
          <p>
It was a long walk to the Provost Marshal's,
but we reached it at last, though we could not get
near the building, on account of the crowd. The
detective on asking “What's the matter?” was
answered by some one—</p>
          <p>
“That d---d assassin has been captured, and is
now in the office.”
</p>
          <p>“Do you mean Booth?”</p>
          <p>
“Yes, who else? I tell you what, sir,” the man
went on to say, “we liked to have made an end of
him, what with stones and sticks.”
</p>
          <p>“It would be a pity to cheat the hangman.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox51" n="51"/>
          <p>
“No fear of that; but who have <hi rend="italics">you</hi> got there—a
prisoner?”</p>
          <p>
The man nodded.</p>
          <p>
“One of the conspirators?” asked the other,
stepping back a few paces, in order to obtain a
better view of me.
</p>
          <p>“I don't know,” replied the detective.</p>
          <p>
By this time the crowd had greatly increased,
and instead of being on the outside, as at first, the
press had forced me nearly to the centre. I began
to be very much frightened, especially as I could
not help hearing the remarks of those around, and
seeing the looks of hatred turned to the door,
through which they expected the prisoner to be
brought.
</p>
          <p>“I say,” said a burly negro, “they keep us
waiting a long time, and I must have a lick at him,”
on which he stooped down and picked up a large
stone lying at his feet.</p>
          <p>
“Faith, and he's catched at last, the murderin' 
villian,” remarked an Irish woman, with a baby in
her arms.</p>
          <pb id="lenox52" n="52"/>
          <p>“What is all this fuss about, Pete?” asked a
new addition to the mob.</p>
          <p>
“Whar you bin all de time, Milly, not to know
we's got de man what killed de President, an' de
Cabinet, an' Gen'l Grant, an' de War Department,
an' all de rest?”</p>
          <p>
At this moment an officer stepped to the door
and said: “I request that this assembly will quietly
disperse—the prisoner within is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> Booth, and
as good citizens”—at this the negroes
hurrahed—“and as good citizens,” he repeated, “I
beg that no violence may be attempted. If this
crowd remains ten minutes longer, I shall be
obliged to call out the guard, and maintain order at
the point of the bayonet.” He took out his watch,
and I need hardly add, that at the end of five
minutes the mob had disappeared, although
unwillingly, with grumblings and shaking of fists.
An ambulance was now brought up, and a tall man
with head and face swathed in bandages was led
out, supported by two soldiers, placed in the
ambulance, and driven rapidly away.</p>
          <pb id="lenox53" n="53"/>
          <p>These scenes, as may be supposed, did not
tend to quiet my nerves, but I resolved, if possible,
to show no sign of fear, lest it might be mistaken
for evidence of guilt; and as I did not know how
aggravated an offence I might be charged with, it
would require all my strength to maintain my self-
possession and presence of mind under the
trying circumstances.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>THE detective went before and I followed. The room we
entered was large, divided midway by a railing, three feet high,
with a gate in the centre. He opened the gate, and pointed to a
dilapidated sofa, on which I took my seat. He went to the
farther end of the room and whispered something to an officer
who was writing. The communication seemed to have a marked
effect, for he immediately laid down his pen, frowned, leaned
forward with elbows on his desk, supporting his chin, and
treated me to the most prolonged stare it was ever my fate to
endure. On finishing his scrutiny, he motioned to a man
<pb id="lenox55" n="55"/>
near him, and opening a table-drawer handed him a package,
containing, as I afterwards saw, about one hundred
photographs. This man deliberately took his seat, and
proceeded leisurely to compare my physiognomy with these
pictures. I felt no uneasiness at this, for never having had
sufficient moral courage to see myself “as others see me,” I
had hitherto steadfastly refused to comply with the wishes
of partial friends, in having my photograph taken.</p>
          <p>
About forty pairs of eyes were now fixed upon me, for
the room was filled with men. I drew my thick veil down,
and taking a paper from my pocket, pretended to read until
that ordeal was over. (I discovered afterwards that the paper
was upside down.)
</p>
          <p>
At length it <hi rend="italics">was over</hi>, and the man who brought me
there was about leaving, when I asked, “Are you returning to
the Judge Advocate's office?”</p>
          <p>
“Yes, ma'am.”</p>
          <p>
“Will you take him a message for me?”</p>
          <pb id="lenox56" n="56"/>
          <p>“Yes, ma'am.”
</p>
          <p>“I wish you to present my compliments, and
say I am exceedingly obliged to him for permission
to visit the Carrol, and I will never forget his kindness.”</p>
          <p>The man bowed gravely, as became a
detective, while the others who were standing
around looked at each other and laughed.</p>
          <p>
It was now after three, and I was very tired
and hungry, for my excitement had been so intense
in the morning that I could eat no breakfast. Half
an hour passed, and still no notice was taken of
me. I seemed to have been forgotten, and now my
imagination began to run riot. I found myself
painting my future in the most dismal colors, while
before me loomed that Massachusetts
Penitentiary, an account of which, with the
treatment of the inmates, I had read a few weeks
previous. I was wondering what kind of hard labor
would be given me, and how I would stand the
shower-bath, to which refractory convicts were
subjected, for refractory I knew I 
<pb id="lenox57" n="57"/>
should be. Then, 
too, there was the solitary confinement in cells, 
cold and damp, the very thought of which made 
my blood run cold, and set me shivering. I began 
to feel wild, and the silence of the room oppressed 
me more and more.</p>
          <p>
A slight noise at the door aroused me. Another
prisoner—a tall, lank man, loosely jointed, with
long thin hair, smooth face, and sallow complexion.
He was dressed in a suit of faded Confederate
gray, and taking a seat on the other end of the
sofa, he surveyed the room and its inmates for
some moments, whistling softly to himself.
Allowing his eyes to rest upon me, and perceiving
that I was regarding him also, he drew near, and in
a low tone began a conversation.</p>
          <p>
“Prisoner?” he asked inquiringly.</p>
          <p>
“Yes,” I responded; “you are too, I presume.”</p>
          <p>
“I should rather think I was,” he answered.</p>
          <p>
“A Confederate soldier?” I asked.</p>
          <p>
“No, a poor d---l of a trader. How came <hi rend="italics">you</hi>
here?” he asked, suddenly.</p>
          <pb id="lenox58" n="58"/>
          <p>“I don't know,” answered.
</p>
          <p>“Well, that's queer,” he returned, musing; then 
placing his hands upon his knees and leaning
forward, he said, waxing confidential, “The way of
it was this: I happened to know one of the officers
on General -----'s staff, whom I got to introduce me
to the General, who furnished me with a permit to
trade South, and a free pass through his lines.”</p>
          <p>
“Very kind in him,” answered I.</p>
          <p>
“Do you think so?” he asked, chuckling; “do
you suppose he <hi rend="italics">gave</hi> them to me?” with a grin.
</p>
          <p>“Yes,” I answered.</p>
          <p>
“Well he just didn't, then; I paid five hundred dollars 
down, and so much per cent. off profits.”
</p>
          <p>“Did you make much by this employment?” I asked.</p>
          <p>
“Didn't I! You see I bought goods on this side, 
mostly pins, needles, and such like, then took
them South, and sold them for treble what I gave
for them.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox59" n="59"/>
          <p>“Were you paid in Confederate money?”
</p>
          <p>“Catch me! no, indeed. Gold, greenbacks
mostly, but sometimes I had to take their paper;
but I got rid of it as soon as I could.”</p>
          <p>
“Were you not suspected by both sides of
being a spy?” I asked.</p>
          <p>
“No, both sides thought I belonged to them,
and as I wanted to keep in with both, I lied to both;” 
at which speech he laughed heartily, as if he had
done a very smart thing.</p>
          <p>
I was disgusted, but he, not noticing it, went
on:</p>
          <p>
“General—— accused me of not sharing profits
fairly, and I know he has had me arrested,
thinking I will pay heavily to be released; but he'll
find himself mistaken there, for I'll not pay the first
red; and more than that, I'll tell the whole affair—how <hi rend="italics">he</hi> bought the surgical instruments and
medicines which I took over—see if I don't!”</p>
          <p>
But he had no time to finish, for a man stepped
up, and touching him on the shoulder, 
<pb id="lenox60" n="60"/>
said, “Come.”
He arose and left me, to my great relief, and I 
could not help wishing, as I watched his 
retreating form, that he might receive his deserts; 
for what was he, but a vampire fattening on the 
miseries of others! I never knew what became 
of him.</p>
          <p>
Again the room relapsed into silence, save
the scratch of pens that were constantly in motion. 
But the Yankee trader had effectually banished the 
Massachusetts Penitentiary, and I was in better 
spirits. At half-past four, by my watch, the detective 
returned, and coming up, said,</p>
          <p>
“You will go with me, if you please.”</p>
          <p>
I arose, only too glad to get out of that place.
The fresh air revived me, and I felt more
courageous. After walking several squares I
asked,</p>
          <p>“Where are you taking me?” </p>
          <p>“To prison,” he
answered.</p>
          <p>“To the Old Capitol?” I asked again.</p>
          <p>“No; Carroll”</p>
          <pb id="lenox61" n="61"/>
          <p>“Will you let me stop and send a telegram to
my friends in Baltimore?”</p>
          <p>
“No.”
</p>
          <p>“But you can go with me, and read what I
send—they will be wretched about me at
home.”</p>
          <p>
“Can't do it.”</p>
          <p>
I walked in silence a short distance.</p>
          <p>
“Will you let me stop at a friend's house, and
leave word where I am going?”</p>
          <p>
“No.”</p>
          <p>
“Just three words?” I pleaded.
</p>
          <p>“No.”</p>
          <p>
Another silence.</p>
          <p>
“May I stop and buy a tooth-brush, and comb,
and a brush?”</p>
          <p>
“No.”</p>
          <p>
“But I must have them.”</p>
          <p>
“Can't.”</p>
          <p>
“I <hi rend="italics">will</hi>, though.” And before the man could
stop me, I walked into a store, and bought the
articles. We had by that time neared the prison
buildings, and I was so wearied with my long
<pb id="lenox62" n="62"/>
walk of nearly two miles, that I could not ascend
the steep hill.</p>
          <p>
“Indeed,” said I, “I must rest”—and took my
seat on the ledge of stone which supports the iron
railing surrounding the Capitol grounds. The man
made no answer, but leaned against a tree, gazing
seemingly at vacancy, though in reality noticing 
everything. And this, by the way, I have often
noticed as a peculiarity of this class of persons;
whether it is done for the purpose of throwing
others off their guard or not, I cannot say.</p>
          <p>
As I sat there on those stones I glanced around
me. It was a lovely evening, near sunset; the trees
were just coming into bud, the tips of delicate
green contrasting beautifully with the sombre
brown and gray of the branches. Crocuses of all
colors decked the Capitol grounds, while on a bush
near a solitary bird warbled its vesper hymn. It
seemed to me I took in the whole aspect of nature
at once; and then arose within a longing, no words
can express, 
<pb id="lenox63" n="63"/>
for home and friends. “Perhaps, after 
all,” thought I, “this man may have no right to convey
me to prison.” So I said,</p>
          <p>
“You tell me you are taking me to the Carrol. By 
what authority do you act?”</p>
          <p>
He opened his coat, and on the inside I saw a
metallic ring, and on it, engraved in large letters, 
“U. S. Detective.” There was no disputing that. If I
sat there much longer, I was sure I should burst
into tears, and <hi rend="italics">that</hi> I resolved not to do, if possible;
so I arose and said, “I am ready to proceed;” and
in a short time the prison was reached.</p>
          <p>The man entered the room where I had seen my 
friend on my first visit, and there we found Nelson.</p>
          <p>
“Here,” said my conductor, pointing to me, and
handing Nelson a slip of paper.</p>
          <p>
“What, you here!” said Nelson; “didn't
expect that. Come with me.” Saying which he
went before me into another room, in which a
little dapper man sat at a desk writing, while a
<pb id="lenox64" n="64"/>
chap in lieutenant's uniform was lolling on a sofa,
his legs swinging over one of the arms.</p>
          <p>
“Mr. C., another of Uncle Sam's boarders,”
said Nelson, with a grin.</p>
          <p>
The meek little man looked up and said, “Take
a seat, please; I will attend to you directly,” putting
the slip of paper which Nelson handed him to one
side.</p>
          <p>
I sat down and waited. On finishing his writing,
Mr. C. turned to me and said, “You will please
answer the following questions,” taking down a
large book resembling a ledger, and opening it
about mid-way.</p>
          <p>
“Your name?”</p>
          <p>“Maria Miller.”</p>
          <p>
“Of what State are you a native?”
</p>
          <p>“Virginia.” </p>
          <p>
“Your age?”</p>
          <p>
“Twenty-four years.” </p>
          <p>
“Where from now?”
</p>
          <p>“Baltimore.”</p>
          <p>
“What is your profession?”</p>
          <pb id="lenox65" n="65"/>
          <p>“Have none.”
</p>
          <p>“Engaged in any business?”
 </p>
          <p>
“No.”
</p>
          <p>“Where were you arrested?”</p>
          <p>
“In Washington.”</p>
          <p>
 “Any relation to General ------, of the rebel
 army?”</p>
          <p>
“First cousin.”
 </p>
          <p>
“That will do, madam.”</p>
          <p>
All of these answers were duly recorded in the
huge book; but as he continued writing, I looked
over and saw, “Height, five feet,” “rather slender,”
“pale complexion,” “gray eyes, large,” “also large
nose,” “small mouth and white teeth,” “hair light
and curly.”</p>
          <p>“You can sit down, madam,” said he, handing
me a chair, on which I took my seat, while the
lieutenant surveyed me with a lazy, sleepy look,
out of his half-open eyes.</p>
          <p>
After the lapse of about twenty minutes,
Nelson returned, saying,
</p>
          <p>“Now, madam, follow me.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox66" n="66"/>
          <p>He led me through an empty room and a dark
passage, into a large yard, down one side of which
he passed, then into another passageway, with a
staircase, at the top of which some women were
standing. Midway the passage was a door, before
which stood a soldier on guard. Nelson motioned
him aside, threw the door wide open, and said,
“Walk in.” I entered, and such a room! The
apartment was large, and divided from the room in
front by folding-doors, which were locked, and 
barred on the other side. Two windows without 
blinds opened on a large yard, in which a number 
of men were walking for exercise, while others 
were cutting wood. Beneath the windows was an 
area, in which stood four barrels, containing kitchen 
and other refuse matter. The room was one mass of 
dirt; spiderwebs hung in festoons from the ceiling,
and vermin of all kinds ran over the floor. The
walls had been papered, but dampness had caused
most of it to fall off, while all over that which was
left were great spots of grease. The fireplace 
<pb id="lenox67" n="67"/>
had
in it a half-burned log, resting on a pile of ashes, 
and surmounting all was a filthy wooden bucket. 
The furniture consisted of an iron bedstead, 
pillows, and mattress of straw, a pair of sheets, 
and a brown blanket. Between the windows stood 
a small table, on which was a stone jug containing 
water, and a tin cup. A tin basin was on the floor. 
One wooden chair completed the inventory.</p>
          <p>
The last-named article was placed near the
open window, and on it was seated a young girl, of
about sixteen years of age. She had a startled look,
and I saw  was afraid of me, for in those prisons
so many are spies that one never feels safe. I also
mistrusted her, and there we sat for some twenty
minutes, without a word. At length I asked,</p>
          <p>
“How long have you been here?”</p>
          <p>
“Since Monday,” she answered. It was now Friday.</p>
          <p>
“Have you been alone?” I asked.
</p>
          <p>“Yes,” she replied.</p>
          <pb id="lenox68" n="68"/>
          <p>“I suspect I saw your father to-day. Is he
an old gentleman with long white hair?”
</p>
          <p>“Oh yes,” she answered, clasping her hands;“
that's father,” and began to cry.“Please tell me
where you saw him.”</p>
          <p>
“At the Judge Advocate's office,” I replied; “he 
was trying to get a pass to see you, but was
refused. I heard him tell a lady he had been there
every day, but without success. He also said he
had written to you.”</p>
          <p>
“I never received a single letter,” she interrupted.</p>
          <p>
“He said, too,” I added, “that he had sent you
in a basket daily, containing food.”</p>
          <p>
“I had some cake brought me once by Mr. Nelson, 
but when I asked him who sent it, he gave me no 
answer.”</p>
          <p>
Seeing that I still had my bonnet and my winter
cloak on, she said, “You had better take your
things off, for they will not let you go.”
</p>
          <p>“That is true; but where shall I put them?” I
asked, looking around inquiringly.</p>
          <pb id="lenox69" n="69"/>
          <p>“Do you see that big nail above where my
bonnet hangs?”</p>
          <p>
“Yes,” I answered, “but I cannot reach it.”
</p>
          <p>“Move the table and stand on it,” she said.</p>
          <p>
I did so, and brushing away the spiders with
the end of my parasol, hung my cloak and bonnet.</p>
          <p>
“What is your name?” I asked, presently.</p>
          <p>
“Mary ----- ”</p>
          <p>
“Mine is Maria Miller.”</p>
          <p>
“Did my father look well?” she inquired.</p>
          <p>
“Yes; only anxious and worried.”</p>
          <p>
“It is <hi rend="italics">so</hi> hard!” she exclaimed, bursting into tears.</p>
          <p>
“Here is to-day's paper. Would you like to read it?”</p>
          <p>
She took it eagerly, and was soon absorbed in its 
contents.</p>

          </argument>
          <p>IN a short time the door was opened, and
Nelson appeared, with two men carrying an iron
bedstead similar to the one already in the room,
which they placed opposite. After a while, the
straw bed and pillow were brought in; but imagine
my feelings when I saw great splotches of blood
on the mattress, and also on one end of the pillow!
</p>
          <p>“I can never sleep on that,” I mentally
ejaculated, and turning my head toward the yard, I
saw two men beating and shaking a faded brown
blanket, from which arose clouds of dust. In a
short time Nelson appeared again, with a pair of
coarse unbleached cotton sheets, and the identical
blanket I had seen shaken. The sheets were new,
that was a comfort.</p>
          <pb id="lenox71" n="71"/>
          <p>“Mr. Nelson,” I asked, “may I see my cousin, Mrs. 
Windsor?”</p>
          <p>
“Oh no, none of that now. You'll not see her
any more.”</p>
          <p>
“May I send and ask her for a towel?”</p>
          <p>
“Yes,” he answered.</p>
          <p>
“Whom shall I send?”</p>
          <p>
“That's more than I know,” he replied, and
going out, shut the door and locked it.</p>
          <p>
“Is not this outrageous?” exclaimed Mary,
handing me the paper. I took it, and read the
paragraph to which she pointed. It was an
insulting notice of Mrs. Surratt and her family.</p>
          <p>“Do you know Mrs. Surratt?” asked I.</p>
          <p>
“Yes; and she is as kind and good a woman
as ever lived.”</p>
          <p>
At this moment a negro woman entered, with a
brass candlestick, three matches, and a piece of
candle, which she put on the table, and taking the
bedding from the floor, proceeded to spread it.</p>
          <pb id="lenox72" n="72"/>
          <p>“Do you know which is Mrs. Windsor's room?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Yes; No. 10,” she replied.</p>
          <p>“Mr. Nelson says I can get a towel from her.
Will you ask her, if you please? Tell her it is
for her cousin.” The woman made no answer,
but went on with her work as if she had not
heard me.</p>
          <p>My stand at the window had become disagreeable, 
for the room being on the first floor, those 
walking in the yard could look directly in, and 
the consciousness of being stared at was anything 
but pleasant. I withdrew, thinking to seat myself 
on the bed which was placed opposite, and in a less 
conspicuous position than the one I occupied. I 
drew near, and happening to cast my eyes towards
it, I thought I saw something moving. I went quite 
close, and scanning the blanket, saw—not one alone, 
but hundreds of creeping things innumerable!—Seizing one corner
with the tips of my fingers, I 
drew it off and threw it as far as I could;
<pb id="lenox73" n="73"/>
and there it lay while I was in prison, and there I left it.</p>
          <p>It was now dark, and the gas was lighted in the yard. 
The men, on a call from the guard, returned to their 
rooms. The lights were so arranged as to show the 
interior of the first floor rooms, with just enough of 
shadow to suggest all sorts of phantoms to the nervous
or timid. At eight, the door was again unlocked, and 
two negro women entered, with waiters containing 
our supper. It consisted of two small coffee-pots, 
holding about two cups of liquid, a yellow delf bowl 
with about one table-spoonful of brown sugar resembling
molasses, half a cup of milk, two slices of wheat bread, 
made out of black-looking flour, a little pat of butter. 
We had each a yellow delf mug, with blue rings, a 
pewter spoon (mine had only a small piece of handle,) 
an iron knife and fork; Mary's knife was without
a handle, and my three-pronged fork was reduced to 
one, the others being broken, one short off and the 
other half way. The plates
<pb id="lenox74" n="74"/>
were delf-ware also. Had anything been clean,
I could have eaten; but the plates were streaming 
with dirty dish-water; mugs ditto; knives, forks, 
and spoons sticky and black to the last degree; 
sugar full of ants, with a slight sprinkling of flies. 
The coffee was a decoction of tobacco and 
rhubarb,<hi rend="italics"> I</hi> think.</p>
          <p>The women set the waiters down, and one of 
them handing me the towel, for which I had 
asked, both left the room without a word. We 
lighted our bit of candle, and looked at the 
<hi rend="italics">viands</hi> lying before us.</p>
          <p>“It is useless,” said I, turning away; “I cannot eat.”</p>
          <p>“Neither can I,” said Mary; “but I have some of 
the cakes father sent, and we will eat those.” She 
went to the nail on which her shawl hung, and 
untying the corner, took out about three dozen 
little sugar-cakes . Although stale, they were very 
acceptable, at least to me. After satisfying our 
appetites, we tied up again in the shawl what 
was left.</p>
          <pb id="lenox75" n="75"/>
          <p>“Had we not better put our light out?” asked Mary.</p>
          <p>
“Why?” said I.</p>
          <p>“Because it saves the candle, and should we get 
frightened in the night, we will have a light. For 
the past three nights I have done so, and in the 
morning I hide the matches and candle, in case 
I should like to have a light to burn all night.”</p>
          <p>We put out our candle, and I sat by the window, 
while Mary walked up and down the room. As 
we had but one chair, we took it by turns, for I 
could not make up my mind to approach either 
bed again. It became very oppressive as the 
darkness deepened; and the tread of the sentry, 
as he passed and repassed every moment between 
the windows, had in it something so weird, that 
I almost shuddered. At nine, Nelson unlocked 
the door and threw it open. Beside him stood two 
men, one in officer's uniform, the other a 
private; the latter held in his hands pen and ink 
and a large book, such as accounts are
<pb id="lenox76" n="76"/>
kept in. Nelson advanced a few steps into the
room, held his candle above his head and looked 
all around; then turning to the officer, said, “All 
right, two in here.” The man who held the book 
then wrote something, after which the door was 
shut again, locked, and the men passed on. This 
performance was repeated each day, at nine in 
the morning, and the same hour in the evening. 
After nine in the evening, the prisoners were 
supposed to be in their rooms until the same 
hour the next morning . After evening inspection, 
the prison was left in charge of a lieutenant—a 
mere boy—and the guard.  Some nights, 
however, the Board of Inquiry would sit until 
daylight; in such case, a prisoner was liable to 
be summoned any hour.</p>
          <p>I was now excessively wearied, both mentally 
and bodily; the air of the room had become 
still more offensive as night advanced. A warm 
still rain was falling, but did not seem to purify 
the atmosphere. I  leaned my head first on my
hands, and then on the ledge of the window-sill,
<pb id="lenox77" n="77"/>
trying in vain to rest. I was too exhausted 
either to speak or think. At length I fell into a 
troubled sleep, and was awakened by the morning's 
sun shining on my head. Mary, whom I 
left walking the floor, was asleep on the foot of 
her bed. I could not realize at first where I 
was; but one glance at the surroundings recalled 
all that had occurred. It was too soon for the 
prisoners to assemble in the yard, and 
as I did not wish to disturb poor Mary, I kept 
my seat at the window in order to dry my 
hair, which was wet with the night's rain;
and that I might examine more closely the yard.</p>
          <p>I saw that we were inclosed on three sides 
by a strong board fence, some twelve feet in 
height, on the top of which was a platform 
sufficiently wide for two men to pass, and which
overlooked the yard. On this paced the sentinel 
day and night. The fourth side of the yard was 
occupied by one wing of the building, the 
upper stories of which were appropriated to
<pb id="lenox78" n="78"/>
prisoners, whom I could see moving about 
behind the iron bars. The lower or ground floor 
seemed to contain coal or lumber, as far as my 
view extended. I was told afterwards that the
rear end was a sutler's store, where the daily 
papers were to be had for twenty-five cents, and
other such luxuries in like proportion. The fence 
was whitewashed, as was the building also. The 
yard was entirely destitute of grass, shrub, tree, 
or any green thing whatever, and the wind, 
which had risen with the sun, drove clouds of 
dust into the room I occupied, and which was 
greatly increased when the men began their 
monotonous walk. In fact, I never saw the day 
when the dust was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> flying, except during a 
hard rain and just after one. There was no 
relief from the dead white of the walls—not a 
tree was in sight, although I afterwards stood on 
a chair at the window and foolishly tried to see 
over and beyond the inclosure. My eyes began 
to ache—there was no shutting out the glare, 
day or night.</p>
          <pb id="lenox79" n="79"/>
          <p>Seeing that my companion was now awake, 
I asked,</p>
          <p>“How do we get water?”</p>
          <p>“Call to the guard standing at the door, and 
hand him the jug.”</p>
          <p>I did so, and he took it, and calling another 
man told him to bring the water, which he did.
Fortunately the lower part of one window was 
boarded, and the window-sill sufficiently deep to 
hold the tin basin; that was the only place in 
the room which could not be seen from the yard; 
there we made our toilet and said our prayers.</p>
          <p> “Where is your towel, Mary?” I asked.</p>
          <p> “I haven't any.”</p>
          <p> “Why, how do you manage, then?”</p>
          <p>“I dry my face wit with my hands as well as I
can, then sit in the sun and comb my hair with
my fingers.”</p>
          <p>I need hardly add, that after that I shared 
with her comb, and brush, and towel.</p>
          <p>Between eight and nine, breakfast was brought 
in, being a repetition of the last evening's  supper.
<pb id="lenox80" n="80"/>
It was placed on the table in silence. I do not 
know whether the servants were forbidden to
hold communication with us or not. We certainly 
were afraid to speak to them, if they were not 
to us. Being in the pay of government, we 
supposed they were spies, and would repeat
everything they heard, good, bad, or indifferent. 
The breakfast was removed in half an hour, 
untasted, as had been the previous evening's meal. 
Our cakes still held out, we eating as few as 
possible, hoping to make them last until we should 
receive another supply. They were not a very 
substantial breakfast, but were decidedly better 
than nothing.</p>

          <p>“The other rooms are much nicer than this, 
but <hi rend="italics">we</hi> are in close confinement.”</p>
          <p>“Why?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“I don't know,” she replied; “but you see 
how we are guarded, a soldier before our door, 
and one walking in front of our window.”</p>
          <p>“Is it not so up-stairs?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“No, the prisoners are allowed to walk all 
about, and even to exercise in the yard.”</p>
          <p>“How do you know so much?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Why, I've been here before.”</p>
          <p>“Indeed!” I said, but asked no more questions,
<pb id="lenox82" n="82"/>
 thinking she might not like to answer. In the 
course of the morning Nelson came in, and I
mustered courage to ask,</p>
          <p>“Why am I kept in close confinement?”</p>
          <p>“Who, <hi rend="italics">you</hi>? Why, you are to be hung.”</p>
          <p> “Ah, indeed! Well, I should not be surprised, 
for they have as much right to hang me as to place
me here.”</p>
          <p>He made no answer, but, going out, slammed 
the door and locked it, <hi rend="italics">of course.</hi></p>
          <p>I began to feel the effects of my sitting up all 
night, and found I would be obliged to lie down,
notwithstanding what I had seen. With Mary's 
assistance I turned the bedding over, and after a 
careful search, lay down. I soon went to sleep, 
and did not awaken until nearly three, when the 
servants were bringing in dinner. This was soup 
day, and that article of diet was served in the 
same mugs I had seen before, they doing double 
duty. We had some kind of meat—I could not 
tell what—and four parboiled potatoes, two for 
each of us.  We declined the dinner, as we had
<pb id="lenox83" n="83"/>
the other meals, falling back on our supply of cakes.</p>
          <p>“Mary,” said I, “let us see if we cannot fasten our 
door on the inside; then we will not be afraid
to sleep at night.”</p>
          <p>We both went to it, but were disappointed in finding 
every fastening gone; even the knob had been 
taken off, leaving a hole the size of a silver dollar 
(if any recollect that coin). We could see how strong 
the lock on the other side was, by the width of the 
bolts. We had to content ourselves as we were, at 
the mercy of any who chose to enter. Mary's fear of
me had by this time worn off; and seeing that, I 
asked about her arrest, of which she gave me the 
following account:</p>
          <p>“I had just come from school, and father, not 
keeping  house himself, wished to place me in 
some nice quiet family. A friend recommended Mrs. 
Surratt; he  accordingly sent me there. It was at 
night that we were all arrested, taken to the 
Provost Marshal's office, and kept there until
<pb id="lenox84" n="84"/>
nearly morning. But I suppose you saw all about 
<hi rend="italics">that</hi> part in the papers.”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” I answered; “but were you not terribly 
frightened?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, indeed we were. Anna Surratt was going 
to a little party, and had just begun to dress, and I
was helping her, when we were sent for to come 
into the parlor, in which were Mrs. Surratt and 
several strange men, one of whom stepped up and 
said we were all arrested, and must go with them. 
Mrs. Surratt asked them to wait a few moments, 
and she knelt down and prayed, the men taking off 
their hats while she did so. She then arose, saying she 
was ready. They put us in an ambulance and drove to 
the Provost Marshal's, as you know.  There, poor 
Anna liked to have gone wild; her mother said 
all she could to calm her, but she is so excitable 
and hysterical that no one could do anything with 
her. She asked the officer how he <hi rend="italics">dared </hi>accuse 
her mother of helping Booth? Just about day, 
they brought us here, and put us in the rooms
<pb id="lenox85" n="85"/>
up-stairs. We were allowed to walk about, and 
were not locked in, even at night. We were 
there three days, at the end of which time I was 
released. I thought all my trouble was ended, 
but last Monday night I was at a Fair given for
the benefit of St. ---- Church, when a man came 
in and asked for me; some one pointed me out 
at the table where I stood. He then took me 
aside, and told me I was wanted at the Provost
Marshal's office, but only for a few moments. I 
sent for Father W., to whom the man told the
same story; so I had to go. At the Provost 
Marshal's they began to ask me all sorts of questions, 
about things of which I had never even heard, 
and finding I did not answer as they wished, 
an officer asked me, ‘if Mrs. Surratt had not 
made me take an oath not to tell anything?’
Then they put me in the ambulance, and I soon 
found they were not taking me to the Fair. I 
began to suspect that they were bringing me 
here, so I turned to the detective and said:</p>
          <p>“ ‘Sir, I always like to commend myself to our
<pb id="lenox86" n="86"/>
Lord, and, if you have no objection, will do so now.’</p>
          <p>“ ‘I have no objection, certainly not,’  he answered.</p>
          <p>“I knelt down in the ambulance, and making 
the sign of the cross, placed myself under our Lord's
protection. They brought me here, and put me in 
this room. I was terribly frightened at being alone, 
and all night long I walked up and down; I would not 
have gone to sleep for anything in the world.”</p>
          <p>“What prisoners were up-stairs with you?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Only a Mrs. Johnson, who has been here 
for some time, and a Mrs. Jones with a little 
baby, who was brought some weeks before,” 
she replied; and then added, “A good many
have come since; I have seen three taken up 
this week.”</p>
          <p>It was now afternoon, and I was still so 
wearied, that I lay down again. I was just 
about closing my eyes, when, on turning them
<pb id="lenox87" n="87"/>
toward the door, I saw that some one was looking 
in through the hole I have mentioned before. It
was the soldier on guard. Whether he was 
ordered to have an eye on the prisoners, or not, 
I do not know; but if he <hi rend="italics">had</hi> received any such 
command, I can testify to its literal fulfilment; 
for, until relieved from duty, there he was, 
watching us continually. We constantly stopped 
up the hole with a piece of the newspaper I had 
brought with me, and which was just as
pertinaciously pushed out with the point of the 
bayonet. I am not naturally a vindictive or 
cruel woman, but I think, had I dared to punch 
the end of my parasol in that staring, fishy eye,
I would have experienced the most intense 
satisfaction. That <hi rend="italics">eye</hi> drove all sleep away; it 
exerted an influence the opposite of mesmeric; it 
was impossible to resist its fascination, for I 
could look at nothing else.</p>
          <p>I arose, went to the window, and for the first 
time scanned the faces of those who passed and
repassed. Among them I recognized an acquaintance; 
<pb id="lenox88" n="88"/>
he gave me a peculiar look, and I smiled. 
Seeing I remembered him, he watched until
the guard turned his back, then managing 
to get just in front of the window, said, “I saw 
your cousin, Mrs. Windsor, to-day.”</p>
          <p>I waited until he passed again, and then 
asked, “Is she well?”</p>
          <p>To this I received no answer, and the guard 
near the window looked in very suspiciously,
but I was leaning my chin on my hand, gazing 
innocently at the white-washed fence. I did not
attempt anything of the kind again, as I had no 
fancy for a Yankee bullet—the orders being to 
shoot any prisoner holding communication without 
permission. My kind friend, fearing, I suppose, 
some imprudence on my part, changed his walk 
to another portion of the yard.</p>
          <p>And now let me speak a word in regard to 
prison rules. They were exceedingly strict, but 
no prisoner was ever told what they were; therefore 
one was in constant danger of breaking them 
through ignorance—the first intimation of
<pb id="lenox89" n="89"/>
his transgression being the whiz of a bullet 
uncomfortably near.</p>
          <p>One afternoon I was more than usually 
oppressed by the foul air of our room, and turning 
to Mary, said, </p>
          <p>“I am going to see how far I can lean out of 
the window; the wind seems to be blowing at 
the side, perhaps I can catch a breath of fresh 
air; I am almost suffocated.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, for heaven's sake stop! you will certainly 
be shot; we are not allowed even to place our
hands on the iron bars, for fear we might be 
making signs to those without.”</p>
          <p>That put a stop on my part to further efforts 
for obtaining fresh air. One night I asked and
received permission to extend my head beyond 
the window sill—the officer ordering the guard 
not to fire, for which I was most sincerely grateful.</p>
          <p>Saturday night we supped on the cakes again, 
and there were only enough left for a very scanty
breakfast:  still we hoped that 
<pb id="lenox90" n="90"/>
more might be 
sent to us. After supper was brought in, I 
noticed that one of the women seemed disposed 
to linger, which she did, on some pretence, until 
the other left the room; then turning to me 
she said in a low tone,</p>
          <p>“So, miss, I've found you out now.”</p>
          <p>“What do you mean?” I asked, thinking I might 
be suspected of some Guy Fawkes plot. “I never
saw you before,” I added, looking her full in the face.</p>
          <p>“Never mind that, miss, I've found you out, and 
I am to have an eye on you.”</p>
          <p>“Very well,” I replied, and turned my back, on 
which she knocked at the door, and the guard
allowed her to pass. After evening inspection, I 
proceeded to retire, for I felt as if I would never 
be rested again, or relieved of the aches and pains 
consequent upon overfatigue. The nights were very 
cold, such as we often experience in early spring. 
Not being able to close the window or to have a 
fire, I really suffered. Fortunately, I had on winter
clothing 
<pb id="lenox91" n="91"/>
and had also brought with me my thick 
cloak, which in a measure answered as a substitute 
for the condemned blanket; but nothing could 
prevent my taking violent cold, which continued for 
some weeks, until, indeed, I had become accustomed 
to that manner of life. Such sleep as I obtained by 
snatches was not, as may be supposed, very refreshing; 
every morning I was awakened by the sunlight which 
streamed across my face.</p>

            <p>Sunday—Destruction of Commissary Stores—Dinner—
Unsuccessful attempt to communicate with my friends—
Terribly frightened—Outside supplies cut off.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>IT was Sunday—a lovely, balmy Spring day,
reminding one of the beautiful outside world, 
from which I was so entirely cut off. I sat on 
the edge of my straw bed, and listened to the 
sound of distant church bells, as they rung the 
faithful to early prayers. It was very quiet in 
the prison-yard, except the incessant tramp of
the guard; that never stopped or wearied, day 
or night. I counted the chiming bells, listening 
as one after another caught the musical tone, 
and sent it on to the next. At length they died 
away; and now the daily round of prison-life 
began. Breakfast time again, and again  untied 
the end of our shawl, containing our few 
remaining stale cakes, when lo and behold! we
<pb id="lenox93" n="93"/>
found a small hole, and our cakes nearly gone—gnawed 
through by mice and roaches! Mary and I just 
looked at each other without speaking. At 
length I exclaimed,</p>
          <p>“Oh, how did it happen?”</p>
          <p>“I will tell you,” replied Mary; “we forgot to 
hang the shawl up last night, but left it on the 
chair.”</p>
          <p>“That is true,” said I, “for I found it on the 
back of the chair this morning.”</p>
          <p>
There was no help for it; so we had to go 
without our breakfast. I seated myself on the 
bed, and taking a little pocket-manual of prayers, 
which I had with me, endeavored to compose 
my thoughts sufficiently to read. It was a great 
effort, for now the church bells began to sound 
again, in a perfect chorus, tantalizing one with
memories of out-door life, from which we 
seemed so far away. None can tell the desolate 
feeling which at times overwhelms those immured in
close confinement. I read my little book through
and through, until my eyes ached. Mary had
<pb id="lenox94" n="94"/>
her rosary, which seemed a consolation. 
Outside our room there was no recognition 
of the sacred day.</p>
          <p>I had heard nothing of my friend up-stairs, 
and did not dare ask. Then, too, I was 
tormented with anxiety for those at home; 
I had not been able to convey to them either 
line or message, my paper and writing materials
having been taken from the basket I brought, 
and never returned. Knowing how wretched 
my friends would be at my prolonged absence 
and silence for—I had expected to return to 
Baltimore the same day that I came over—I
determined if possible to write. Calling to 
the guard, through the hole in the door, I said,</p>
          <p>“Can you not tell Mr. Nelson I wish to see
him?”     </p>
          <p>He made no answer, but I heard him say to a 
soldier in the yard, “Tell Mr. Nelson, 
somebody wants him in the confined prison, 
will you?” The man went, and I waited, one, 
two, three hours, and still Mr. Nelson did 
not come.</p>
          <pb id="lenox95" n="95"/>
          <p>The women now brought in the dinner, and 
as that meal was set on the table, both Mary 
and I gazed upon it with hungry eyes, but 
lacking courage to partake.</p>
          <p>“Come, Mary,” I said, “this will never do; 
we will starve to death at this rate; suppose 
we try one of these potatoes?”</p>
          <p>We each took one, peeled it, and began to
eat. They were perfectly raw, being only 
warmed on the outside; there was a pinch of salt 
in a saucer, but as it had been formed into a 
conglomerate with gravy or something else, 
it was not very inviting. The bread was both dirty 
and stale.</p>
          <p>As the women were carrying out the dinner,
I said, “Will you please ask Mr. Nelson to step here?”</p>
          <p>“Haven't time,” was the answer.</p>
          <p>I made another attempt with the guard, who
sent a second messenger. I became desperately
impatient as minutes lengthened into hours
and still Nelson did not appear. I walked the
<pb id="lenox96" n="96"/>
floor until nearly night, listening to every 
sound, when at length I heard his loud voice 
asking,</p>
          <p>“Who wants me?”</p>
          <p>Afraid he would pass by, I went to the door and
called, “<hi rend="italics">I </hi>wish to see you, Mr. Nelson.”</p>
          <p>The lock was turned, and he entered and said, 
“Well!”</p>
          <p>“I wish to know if I may be allowed to write a 
letter—a few lines to my friends at home.”</p>
          <p>“Certainly,” he replied.</p>
          <p>“But I have no paper or writing materials.”</p>
          <p>“Of course not; prisoners never have,” he
returned.</p>
          <p>“Then how am I to write?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Oh, we furnish these things from the office. 
You can write eight lines. Give the letter to me 
at inspection, and I will send it.”</p>
          <p>I thanked him, and seeing him about to leave,
added, “The writing materials—how am I to get them
from the office?”</p>
          <p> “I will bring them to you.”</p>
          <p>But he did not that day, nor the next day,
<pb id="lenox97" n="97"/>
nor any day, although I constantly reminded 
him. Whether it was really an oversight on his 
part, or whether he had orders to the contrary, 
I am not able to say; all I know is, that I was 
not allowed to write a line, or send or receive a 
message, during the whole period of my 
incarceration. One thing I constantly noticed, and
that was, they seldom refused any request, <hi rend="italics">in words,</hi>
thereby tantalizing the poor prisoner until all hope
departed. Truth was utterly ignored, and I have 
known the most barefaced falsehoods to be told 
without the least hesitation on the part of officials.</p>
          <p>Sunday night we went supperless to bed. I lay
down, leaving poor Mary pacing the floor, 
which she did constantly. I begged her to try and 
sleep, but after a while she asked if she might 
come and lie beside me. Of course I consented, 
although the bed was rather narrow to accommodate 
two. I covered her in the blanket, and putting my 
arm around her, she soon fell asleep, and to my 
astonishment I followed her example.</p>
          <pb id="lenox98" n="98"/>
          <p>How long we slept I do not know, but suddenly we
both started up and listened. Presently we heard a long
drawn “Oh,” proceeding apparently from the cellar
beneath us.</p>
          <p>“What on earth is it?” said Mary under her breath,
and shaking like a leaf.</p>
          <p>“I don't know,” I answered, just as much frightened; 
“let us call the guard.”
“Oh, no,” she returned; “better not.”</p>
          <p>Again we heard the sound, but it seemed not of
pain but weariness.</p>
          <p>“Mary,” said I, “I will get up and light our candle.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, please do not leave me, I am so afraid,” she
replied, holding me tight.</p>
          <p>“We will go together then; but let us take our shoes
off first, and throw them across the room to drive 
away the mice and roaches.”</p>
          <p>We did so, and after a few moments arose, still
clinging to each other, and groped our way to the
shawl hanging at the farther end of the room, 
in the corner of which our candle-ends and
<pb id="lenox99" n="99"/>
matches were tied. We soon struck a light; and 
picking up our shoes returned to the bed again.
We did not attempt to lie down, but sat on the 
edge, listening to every sound—every now and 
then speaking in a whisper to each other. As 
soon as one piece of candle would burn down, 
we would light another—day beginning to dawn 
just as the last piece flickered, flared up, and 
went out. We heard nothing after we had the
light. It was not until several days had elapsed 
that we discovered the cause of our alarm, viz.: 
a large gray cat, which had accidentally been 
locked in the cellar beneath us. Meanwhile, we 
dreaded the approach of night.</p>
          <p>Monday following, when Nelson made his
appearance, I asked,</p>
          <p>“Can we not have a light to burn all night?”
  </p>
          <p>“What's that for?” he answered.</p>
          <p>“Because we are afraid,” I said.</p>
          <p>“What! if the guard is outside?”</p>
          <p>“We are as afraid of him as anything else,” said
Mary.</p>
          <pb id="lenox100" n="100"/>
          <p>“Nonsense,” returned Nelson.“No, you can't have a
light,” going out and shutting the door.  </p>
          <p>Imagine how we felt!</p>
          <p>Our candle seemed shorter than usual to our eyes.
We thought we would extinguish it, and relight it in an
emergency. We put it out, taking it on the bed with us,
but soon found that it attracted the mice and roaches to
such a degree, that we determined to light it, and let it
burn out. Nothing occurred to disturb us that night, so
we might have slept quietly, had our fears permitted.</p>
          <p>Mary and I had exhausted all topics of conversation
at the end of a few days, and would sit for hours
perfectly silent. We had no more cakes, but managed to
sustain ourselves by eating such food as looked
cleanest, of that which was sent us. Nelson said one
night to Mary,</p>
          <p>“A basket has been sent you, and as soon as
inspected, will be brought in.”</p>
          <p>We were in high glee and expectation, but,
<pb id="lenox101" n="101"/>
alas! were doomed to disappointment, for no 
basket gladdened our longing eyes. At length,
two days after, Mary said:</p>
          <p>“Mr. Nelson, the basket you spoke of has never
been sent in.”</p>
          <p>“Indeed!” he replied, “then it must have contained
contraband articles;” and that was all we ever saw or
heard of our expected treat.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="chapter">

          </argument>
          <p>Now we had another source of annoyance, and that
was, our meals were allowed to remain in our room all
day. The food was never taken away, except to bring in
another supply; consequently, our room was swarming
with flies in the day, and with vermin at night; the only
advantage was, that the mice and the roaches which at
one time ran on our beds, now preferred the table, where
there was more tempting food. Three days had elapsed
without change or variety, except some new faces
among the prisoners in the yard, when one day we heard
something falling on the floor, and looking round saw
some chocolate drops and other bits of candy, 
evidently thrown in by a kind-hearted
<pb id="lenox103" n="103"/>
prisoner. We were about to pick them up,
when, looking towards the door, I saw the eye 
of the guard at the hole, and calling my 
companion's attention to it, we resumed our former
positions. Shortly after we beheld the roaches, ants,
etc., making way with our candy, to their evident
satisfaction.</p>
          <p>Another day the guard at our door unlocked it, 
and threw in “Harper's Weekly,” “New York
Herald,” and a dime novel, called the “Trapper's 
Bride.” We never knew who sent them, but 
supposed some prisoner bribed the guard to 
throw them in to us. How eagerly they were
read, and how often, even to the advertisements, 
it is impossible to state. They seemed a link
between us and the outer world. Will I ever 
forget “The Trapper's Bride?” I think not, 
although, as I now recall it, it was merely a mass 
of improbable incidents told in a lingo intelligible, 
perhaps, to the class of persons for whom it was
originally written, but beyond my comprehension,
leaving my mind in bewildering doubt as to
<pb id="lenox104" n="104"/>
whether the bear ate “the bride,” or “the bride” ate the
bear. However, it answered to while away the heavy
hours, and was very welcome.
“Harper's Weekly” contained the usual number of
interesting stories, “to be continued,” just as one is
dying to know if “the man” succeeded in making his
escape, hoping it might contain hints applicable to a
forlorn “Carrol prisoner.” The “New York Herald,”
 with pages of political quarrels,  accusing “Mr. B. 
of plundering the treasury, and Mr. C. of buying up 
votes, and Mr. D. of being a turncoat, bought up by 
the highest bidder,” altogether showing an awfully 
depraved state of morals among the “Herald's” 
acquaintances, and which that immaculate sheet felt 
in duty bound to hold up for public abhorrence and 
detestation. Then, too, were several pages of most 
delicious mysterious advertisements, such as “the 
man in green spectacles call at No. 94;” “Susie, he is 
on your track;” “the body of an unknown man in gray 
pants and blue jacket, found floating in the dock, a 
letter in cipher 
<pb id="lenox105" n="105"/>
clasped in his hand,” etc., etc.  I read 
the notices over and over, imagining events and causes 
to correspond. But after a few days I wearied of this 
occupation, and my imprisonment pressed harder and 
harder upon me. I knew my friends at home would 
make every effort to ascertain where I was, and I 
was in constant dread lest another one should be 
brought to that terrible place.</p>
          <p>And now we had a second midnight scare. Mary
and myself had just fallen asleep, when we heard rather
loud talking between the guard in front of our door and
two men. The latter were saying, “Now, you let us pass, 
there's a good fellow.”</p>
          <p>“In faith, no, ye's can't go in,” the guard replied.</p>
          <p>“But we just want to call upon the ladies,” continued 
the men, who, we now discovered, were very 
much intoxicated.</p>
          <p>“An' me to be screwed up by the thumbs tomorrow. 
I tell ye's agin,<hi rend="italics"> no</hi>.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox106" n="106"/>
          <p>“Here's our permit,” said one of the men, and
through the hole in the door we saw him hand a piece
of paper to the guard.</p>
          <p>“Divil a bit can I read,” said the guard; “and permits 
or no, ye'll not git in to-night, an' if ye'll take a
frind's advice, ye'll go out of this before I help ye's out
with the pint of the bayonit.”</p>
          <p>The men then retired, uttering maledictions against
the obstinate Irishman.</p>
          <p>Mary and myself had kept perfectly still during this
dialogue, but I think one could almost have heard the
beating of our hearts as we sat on the edge of our bed
listening, and hardly daring to breathe. The night wore
away without further incident, and if any two ever 
rejoiced to see the dawning of day, I think those two were 
Mary and myself. It was positively forbidden to admit 
liquor into the prison building, yet I venture to say, there 
was any amount of drunkenness among the male prisoners. 
I saw enough of it myself, but it was only after inspection 
was
<pb id="lenox107" n="107"/>
over for the night. How the spirit was obtained I 
do not know, but suppose the guards were no more 
invulnerable to bribes, etc., than—others. We were 
never disturbed in a like manner again; indeed, our 
case appeared to excite general sympathy, judging 
from the kind looks directed towards us by the 
prisoners in the yard. Perhaps our would-be visitors 
were afterwards ashamed of the part they played on 
the occasion.</p>
          <p>I had not as yet seen H. Mary told me she heard
he had gone for John Surratt, and no one knew when
he would return. I was very anxious to see him, as he 
was the civil head of the prison, and nothing could be 
done without his sanction. I may here mention, that 
this prison was under both civil and military rule, 
and, as usual in such cases, the two authorities were 
continually clashing. The antagonism was manifested 
by General ------ sending in prisoners during H.'s 
absence, whom the latter would dismiss on his return.
Being conscious of my own innocence, no wonder
I looked eagerly for the arrival of the only person
<pb id="lenox108" n="108"/>
who had authority to release me, or to mitigate the
severity of my imprisonment.</p>
          <p>I began to feel the want of exercise terribly, although
I walked up and down the room for hours; still it 
had not the same effect as one-half hour in the air 
and sunshine. I had been nearly two weeks in prison, 
when late one night a vehicle was driven into the yard. 
We went to the window and saw an ambulance 
standing in the shadow of the building; then we 
distinctly heard the clanking of iron, and in a moment 
or two after, a man with hands and feet manacled 
was helped out by two soldiers and led into the 
building. We sat at the window the greater part of 
the night, hoping to overhear something which would
give us a clew as to who the prisoner was, or at least
where from; but no word was uttered, either when the
man was brought in or afterwards. Everything was done
so silently in this building, and surrounded with such an
air of mystery, that we were kept in a constant state of
nervous excitement.</p>
          <pb id="lenox109" n="109"/>
          <p>“I think it must be John Surratt,” said Mary, “and Mr. 
H. has returned.”</p>
          <p>She was right in the latter conjecture, for the next
day H. made his appearance on his usual tour of
inspection. Seeing me, he said,</p>
          <p>“Why,<hi rend="italics"> you</hi> here! how comes that?”</p>
          <p>“Indeed,” said I, “that is just what <hi rend="italics">I</hi> wish to know.”</p>
          <p>“Well, let us hear about it,” he said, taking a seat
on my bed.</p>
          <p>I then gave him the account written here, and for
the first time my fortitude forsook me, and I burst into
tears.</p>
          <p>“Mr. H.,” I added, “do you think I would have
come to Washington, and have gone to the
Departments, had I been guilty? You, as a detective,
know that such would not be the course of one who
had rendered herself obnoxious to the Government.”</p>
          <p>“No,” he answered in a musing manner; and then,
as if speaking to himself more than to me, said, 
“there's some mistake.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox110" n="110"/>
          <p>“Can I not see my friend up-stairs,” I asked
anxiously. “I am suffering in this horrible room.”</p>
          <p>“I'll look and see what the charges are first,” he
replied, rising.</p>
          <p>“Oh, please come back,” I cried, “and tell me;” for,
remembering how often Nelson had disappointed me, I
was fearful that H. meant to treat me in the same way.
He turned and said,</p>
          <p>“I will come back, yes, in half an hour or so, and if
you <hi rend="italics">can</hi> see your friend, you certainly <hi rend="italics">shall</hi>.”</p>
          <p>Here was a drop of comfort. Half an hour or 
three-quarters passed, and I heard H. say in the 
passage, “D--n it, no sooner is my back turned, 
than they fill the prison with people who have no 
business being here.” Opening our door, he said, 
“Yes, you can see your friend, but not yet awhile. 
I have to take you past the guards, and have not 
time to do it now, but will this afternoon.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox111" n="111"/>
          <p>I thanked him, but he did not listen.</p>
          <p>A few moments after I witnessed a strange scene 
among the prisoners in the yard. The hearty 
laughing (an unusual occurrence) first attracted 
me, and looking out I saw H., armed with a huge 
stick, chasing one of the prisoners, who seemed 
hardly to know which way to run, until seeing the 
outer entrance open, he darted through—H. after 
him. In a few moments H. returned, out of breath, 
and throwing the stick back on the wood pile 
said, “Let me catch him here again, and I'll serve 
him the same way,” at which the men laughed and 
clapped their hands, those who had caps throwing 
them in the air. I afterwards heard that on looking 
at the record H. saw that the man was detained on 
a mere pretence, and he being an old friend of 
his (H.'s), he took this strange method of effecting 
his release. The military authorities were highly 
indignant at the occurrence, but H. only laughed, 
and went his way.</p>

            <p>Allowed to visit my cousin—Return at nine with 
supplies—Disappointment—Rainy day in prison—Another
arrival—Mrs. Thomas's story—Mary's 
disgust.    </p>
          </argument>
          <p>THAT afternoon H. came, true to promise, and
unlocking the door, threw it open, and said,</p>
          <p>“Now, madam, come with me.”</p>
          <p>I cannot express my feelings as I saw the exit before me,
although I was only going to another part of the prison. 
I sprang toward the door, from which the guard now 
stepped aside, and following H. up the narrow, dirty 
steps, saw at the top a crowd of strange but sympathizing 
faces watching my ascent, while a little behind them stood 
my cousin, trying to master her agitation. At the sight of 
her tearful face, I outstripped my guide, and the women 
dividing on either side, my cousin stepped forward to 
meet me, when we fell into each other's arms 
<pb id="lenox113" n="113"/>
sobbing—the women around joining from sympathy,
and then each came up and shook me by the hand.</p>
          <p>I entered my cousin's room, which was a small one
over the passage. As a great favor, Mr. Windsor was
allowed to remain with his wife. I found they were
permitted many privileges, such as having clothes sent
in from outside, and baskets of all kinds of provisions,
as well as china, glass, etc.; in fact they were keeping
house on a small scale, independent of prison fare; all
of which was allowed through the efforts of a friend
who had the necessary influence. Mr. Windsor had the
daily papers sent to him, also. The room fronted the
Capitol grounds—how beautiful and refreshing was the
sight of green trees and grass to my aching eyes! I felt
as if I should never tire looking at them. Time passed
rapidly, as my friends and myself talked over our
different experiences. While with them, the servant
woman who had given me such a fright before, came in
and said,</p>
          <pb id="lenox114" n="114"/>
          <p>“I'm glad to see you here, miss.”</p>
          <p>“Thank you,” I answered.</p>
          <p>After she left, my friend said,</p>
          <p>“When I ascertained you were down-stairs, 
Mr. Windsor told that woman to attend to your 
comfort and he would fee her for it.”</p>
          <p>“She told me she had found me out; and not
understanding what she meant I was very much
frightened.”</p>
          <p>“Yes, she told us  ‘you was 'fear'd of her, and
she was 'fear'd of you.’ We thought it best not 
to attempt anything of the kind again.”</p>
          <p>I sat with my friends until inspection, taking 
tea with them. I really enjoyed that meal, and, 
on leaving, took quite a supply of nice things to 
my fellow-prisoner, whom I had last seen looking 
after me with wistful, mournful eyes. At 
nine P. M. I accompanied Nelson past the guards, 
and returned to my prison. I found poor Mary 
in very low spirits, but the little supper soon
wrought a change. That was the first hearty 
meal we had taken since my imprisonment. I
<pb id="lenox115" n="115"/>
also brought her the daily papers, which were
a great treat.</p>
          <p>The next day H. did not come, so I remained
down-stairs. On asking Nelson for him, I was 
told he was away, and would be absent for some 
time. I was greatly disappointed, thinking I 
could not visit my friends until his return. 
Three days passed without any incident, except 
that I saw among the prisoners the man who had 
been so badly beaten on his arrest. The bandages 
were still around his head, and he looked very
pale, as if he had been sick.</p>
          <p>In the afternoon it began to rain violently. 
None can tell the depressing effect of a
steady rain on those confined in a dingy, dirty
room, with nothing of interest to relieve the
monotony; even the yard was deserted by all 
save the guards, who, muffled in great-coats, 
with capes turned over their heads, endeavored 
to protect themselves against the pitiless storm. 
It was on such an evening as this, just before 
gas-light, that I caught a glimpse of a woman, her
<pb id="lenox116" n="116"/>
clothes all bedraggled with rain and mud, 
her head protected by nothing but a worsted 
scarf, which was also tied around her neck, and 
from which the rain was running in little streams. 
I had just time to see this much, when 
Nelson unlocked our door, and the poor wet
creature entered.</p>
          <p>She looked around for one moment, then seating
herself on my bed, began to cry and wring 
her hands, as if in agony. It was some time 
before I could make her listen to a word, but at 
last I succeeded in persuading her to take the 
wet scarf off her head. She had on a calico 
dress, which was but little protection against the
rain. She sat still now, only crying quietly, 
wiping her eyes occasionally on her apron. The 
men soon brought in and made up her bed, as 
they had done mine, on my arrival. She ate quite 
heartily at supper, not being affected with the 
<hi rend="italics">squeamishness</hi> experienced by Mary and myself.</p>
          <p>After she had finished, she turned to me, and 
said, “I hain't been to town before for thirteen
<pb id="lenox117" n="117"/>
years; to be sure I hain't seen much;” then 
looking at the eatables she remarked, “I s'pose 
to-morrow we'll have hot bread and coffee; I 
hain't been used to cold.”</p>
          <p>“We get the same every day,” I answered.</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">In</hi>-deed!” she replied.</p>
          <p>Then after a pause I asked, “How came you here?”</p>
          <p>As if glad of an opportunity to tell her story, 
she began, and told the following, without pause
or punctuation of any kind, or altering the tone 
of her voice, which was rather low and nasal:</p>
          <p>“You see my name's Thomas—wife of Jim 
Thomas of—---- county; all the neighbors knows 
us. My husband he farms, raises splendid 
peaches, reckon you'se seen 'em in the Washington
Market?” looking towards me.</p>
          <p>“Perhaps I have,” I replied, as she waited for 
an answer.</p>
          <p>“Well, Jim come in one day, and says he,
‘Nancy,’ says he, ‘they <hi rend="italics">do</hi> say the President's
 killed.’ ‘<hi rend="italics">In</hi>-deed!’ says I; ‘Yes,’ says he, ‘and
<pb id="lenox118" n="118"/>
I believe it's true, for the almanac sed this was
a-going to be a most unfortunate year, an' so it
'pears.’ At that, Jim looked study into the
kitchen fire, and seemed worrited like. Now,
Jim—he's a very curous kind o' man, and I
knowed the more questions I asked, the less he'd
answer, so I jes' went on and fixed breakfast, and
waited till Jim was ready to tell me. After a
while, sure enough, he sets to, and give me the
whole account, jes' as he read it in the paper at
the store. Well, it 'pears like it sorter 
dumbfounded me, but after a while, says I, ‘Jim,’ 
says I, ‘I do hope an' truss the man what killed 
the President won't be a-comin' this way.’ ‘I think
they must a-ketched him by this time,’ says Jim.
We talked some time longer, and then Jim went
back to work. After I had finished work in the
kitchen, I took my sewing an' sot down near the
front door, but it 'pears like as if I couldn't get
the matter out o' my head, and I jes' kep' on 
a-jumpin up and looking up and down the road.
Well, I hadn't been there more'n an hour or so,
<pb id="lenox119" n="119"/>
when I seen a great dust a-comin' down the
road; the first thing that struck me was that the 
cows had got out, and I looked again and seen 
something a-shining in the sun; then, says I to 
myself, ‘them shiny things ain't cows' horns; 
they've got no call to shine that a-way;’ and 
with that I put my specs on, and then I see <hi rend="italics">sich</hi>
a sight as my two eyes never rested on before. 
Yes, 'twas the soldiers, and them shiny things 
was the guns. I was so taken aback, like, at the 
sight, that if they had rode up then and axed
me if I killed the President, I believe I should a sed 
‘Yes.’ But before they got up to me my senses 
had come back. And now they come so nigh I 
could see their faces, and who <hi rend="italics">do</hi> you 'spose was 
a-leadin' of 'em? Why, our nigger boy, Bob; 
it's as true as I am a-sittin' here. ‘Well,’ says I, 
‘Bob, you're in fine company.’ He helt his head
shamed, like, while the cap'n he got off his horse,
and, says he, ‘I've come to know about that lame
man as was here a few days ago.’ ‘What lame 
man?’ says I. ‘You know well enough,’ says
<pb id="lenox120" n="120"/>
he. ‘Who told you there was any lame man 
here?’ says I.  ‘Him,’ says he, a-pointing with 
his thumb over his shoulder at Bob. ‘You 
oudacious nigger,’ says I to Bob, ‘what lie is 
that you've been a-tellin'?’ Now, Bob was a
half-witted boy, and you couldn't 'pend upon him 
for nothin'; for when he seen you wanted him to 
say anything, he'd say it, no matter if it was true 
or not, and he seen the cap'n wanted him to say 
a lame man had been there. Bob made no answer. 
‘Cap'n,’ says I, ‘jes' let me to speak to Bob, will 
you?’ ‘Certainly,’ says he. ‘Now, Bob,’ says I, 
‘jes' you take yourself off that horse and come here.’ 
He done it, and says I, ‘Bob,’ says I, ‘did you tell 
the cap'n that a lame man had been  here?’ ‘Yes,’ 
says he, ‘and there has.’ ‘When?’ says I. ‘Day 'fore 
yesday,’ says he. ‘Who was it?’ says I. ‘Mr. Spencer; 
him as walked with a stick,’ says he. ‘Well,’ says 
I, ‘Bob, I always knowed you was a great fool, but I 
vow you beat all. Cap'n,’ says I, ‘Mr. Spencer <hi rend="italics">was </hi>
here that day, and last night too, for that;
<pb id="lenox121" n="121"/>
he's our next neighbor, and has been lame from 
a horse kick ever since we knowed him.’ ‘Well, 
old lady,’ says the cap'n, ‘you'll have to go 
along with us.’ ‘Where to?’ says I. ‘Oh, jes' 
a little way to see the colonel,’ says he. ‘I 
don't like to go without my husband,’ says I. 
‘He's there now,’ says the cap'n. As good luck 
would have it, Mrs. Simkins—John Simkins's 
wife—she come over jes' then, so I asked 
her to lock the house and tend to things, which 
she promised she would. They drove what they 
call a avelanche up, and I got in. And now it
begun to rain awful. Well, they driv' and driv', 
and bimeby I seen a whole parcel of houses, 
and, thinks I, this certainly must be town, and 
sure enough it was. Jes' before dark, they 
stopped before a tall brick house, where they 
told me to get out. The room was full of men, 
but Jim wan't there. One of the men then come up
and told me I was to go with him, and he brought 
me here.”</p>
          <p>“Did you walk all the way?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Every step on it; we had a umberill, but the
<pb id="lenox122" n="122"/>
wind blowed so hard we couldn't raise it, that's 
how I got so wet.”</p>
          <p>From the time Mrs. Thomas came in until she was
released, did I have to listen to a daily 
repetition of her experience, of which she never 
tired, and was consequently the greatest bore. 
Suggest any subject you pleased, and she would 
invariably get back to her arrest. Mary would beg 
me in despair, “For heaven's sake make the woman 
hold her tongue,” but I was unequal to the task. 
That night she lay down and slept in all her wet 
garments; after which I expected to see her 
violently ill, but to my great surprise she 
experienced no injurious effects, and next 
morning ate a hearty breakfast, although she had 
neither hot bread nor coffee.</p>

            <p>Interview with Nelson—Second visit to my 
cousin—Her room—An account of her arrest—
“Anna Clark”—Description of Mr. H.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>ANOTHER Sunday, and H. was still absent. But I
determined to try my persuasive powers on Nelson,
and sending for him, asked,</p>
          <p>“Can I not go up-stairs to my cousin's room?”</p>
          <p>“Oh, yes.”</p>
          <p>“Did Mr. H. leave any orders about it?” said I.</p>
          <p>“Yes, he said you were to go up every day, if 
you wanted to.”</p>
          <p>“And you never told me all this time!” I exclaimed.</p>
          <p>“How long can I stay?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“All day, until evening inspection.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox124" n="124"/>
          <p>“Will you be kind enough to tell the guard?”</p>
          <p>He opened the door and said, “Guard! this 
lady is allowed to pass up and down stairs 
between morning and evening inspection, 
unmolested, and you see that the order is passed 
on to the relief.”</p>
          <p>The guard gave me a good look, so as to 
identify me I suppose, and I then bounded up 
the stairs and in a few moments entered my 
friend's room.</p>
          <p>I now took a survey of the apartment, which I 
had not leisure to do on my first visit. It had 
one window (barred of course,) the upper sash 
gone, and the lower containing I think two panes 
of glass. Near the door was a small wood-stove, 
and near it a wooden chair similar to the one 
down-stairs. Behind the door stood a small table 
containing a tin basin and a jug of water; on
either side of the room was an iron bedstead, 
and a wooden bench between them. The window-sill 
was quite deep, and served as a shelf to hold 
china, glass, etc. Under the little table was
<pb id="lenox125" n="125"/>
a basket of clothes. Bonnet, shawl, and hat were 
hung on nails behind the door, which stood open 
all day. The room was a paradise compared to the 
one I occupied. I found that several of the men 
in the other part of the prison were permitted 
to visit in this, provided they had acquaintances; 
the passes being good for a week or more. Every 
day some two or three would come in and bring the 
prison news from the other side. I saw that all 
the doors had lock and key to them, and there was 
no guard stationed in that passage. The rooms, 
except my cousin's, were quite large, and at that
time each contained four inmates, whose 
acquaintance I afterwards made. The floor above 
was unoccupied, with the exception of a large 
closet, a receptacle for blankets, sheets, and 
other miscellaneous articles; this was unlocked, 
as were also the other rooms.</p>
          <p>On asking my cousin for an account of her arrest,
she related as follows:</p>
          <p>“Two days after your visit, I was lying on the 
<pb id="lenox126" n="126"/>
sofa one morning, feeling very weak and badly;
Mr. Windsor was down-stairs in his office. Hearing
a voice in the hall, I looked up, and as I did 
so a man entered, dressed in citizen's clothes. 
Advancing toward me, he said inquiringly, ‘Mrs. 
Windsor?’</p>
          <p>“ ‘Yes,’ I answered, ‘what do you wish?’</p>
          <p>“ ‘I am very sorry, madam, but I have to go over
this house to search it.’</p>
          <p>“ ‘By what authority do you thus intrude on the
privacy of my home?’</p>
          <p>“ ‘By this, madam,’ showing me on the inside of 
his coat the badge of a detective.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Very well, sir, but I must accompany you, as 
my silver and other valuables are all exposed.’</p>
          <p>“ ‘You can do so; I am responsible for everything,’
he replied.</p>
          <p>“ ‘I wish my husband to be summoned,’ I said.</p>
          <p>“ ‘I cannot allow that, madam; there must be no
communication.’</p>
          <p>“We then proceeded all over the house, I
<pb id="lenox127" n="127"/>
unlocking store-room, closets, pantry, every place,
indeed, about the building, and insisting that he 
should examine every nook and cranny, much to his 
disgust; but I was determined, since he came to 
search the house, searched it should be. On 
looking out of the window, I saw the yard was 
filled with soldiers. The detective took possession 
of every piece of paper on which there was any 
writing, even my private correspondence. On 
returning to the parlor I said, </p>
          <p>“ ‘I hope you are satisfied that there is nothing
concealed, and now may I be allowed to ask what 
you expected to find.’</p>
          <p>“He did not answer my question, but said,
</p>
          <p>
“ ‘I shall be obliged to take you to the Provost
Marshal's office, but I assure you, you will be 
detained there but a few moments.’</p>
          <p>“ ‘May I be allowed to lock up my plate and other
valuables?’</p>
          <p>“ ‘Certainly, but it is unnecessary, as I am 
going to place a guard of soldiers in the house, 
and I will be responsible for everything.’</p>
          <pb id="lenox128" n="128"/>
          <p>“Nevertheless I <hi rend="italics">did</hi> lock up such things as I could
think of at the time, although I left much exposed
which I never expect to see again. All the while I 
was busy about this, the man did not leave me. 
Having finished, I proceeded to array myself in 
bonnet and cloak.</p>
          <p>“ ‘Is not my husband to accompany me?’ I asked.</p>
          <p>“ ‘He is already at the office,’ the man answered.</p>
          <p>“I was about to leave the room, when fortunately
my eyes rested on my watch, and also my gold 
thimble, which was lying near. I took them both, 
tying the thimble in a corner of my handkerchief. 
I was now very much fatigued, for it was the first 
day I had been up since my illness. I went a few 
steps and then said, ‘I can walk no farther; I 
have been very sick, and am not able to go on.’</p>
          <p>“The man stopped and looked at me doubtingly. I
suppose I must have looked sick enough even to
convince a detective, for he called one of
<pb id="lenox129" n="129"/>
the guard, and ordered him to bring an ambulance,
which he did. In a few moments I was placed in 
it, and driven to the Provost Marshal's.</p>
          <p>“I took a seat and looked everywhere for Mr.
Windsor, but he was evidently not there. 
Imagine, if you can, my intense anxiety. It was
half-past ten when I was arrested and brought 
to the office, and there I sat by myself until 
after three, at which time Mr. Windsor arrived.
It seems he had gone out soon after breakfast,
and had not returned until the hour for dinner, 
when to his great astonishment he saw the house 
surrounded by soldiers, and he was arrested and 
brought to the provost Marshal's office. We did
not remain there long, but were summoned to
follow a detective, from whom Mr. Windsor soon
ascertained that we were coming here. The man
endeavored to make us walk, but Mr. Windsor
would not hear of it; so he very unwillingly
stopped a car, into which we all entered 
and were brought here, where we have been 
ever since.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox130" n="130"/>
          <p>“I wish,” said I, “you would give me some
account of that ‘Anna Clarke’ and her letter, 
which letter I was accused of writing.”</p>
          <p>“I knew but little about her,” said my friend.
“She was introduced to us by an acquaintance, 
spent the day and returned to Baltimore the 
same evening. A short time after, Mr. Windsor 
received that letter, which he deemed both 
unnecessary and dangerous to answer. It was 
lying on the table with others, and of course 
fell into the hands of the detective, and I
suppose was laid before the Bureau of Military
Justice.”</p>
          <p>Just then a gentleman came to the door and said,
“Mr. Windsor, I have just parted with a friend 
of yours—a fellow-prisoner—Mr. William 
Gordon. He told me to present his regards to 
both of you, and ----.”</p>
          <p>“Gordon, Gordon,” said Mr. Windsor, interrupting 
him, and putting his hand to his head as if 
trying to remember who it could be, then added, 
“Is he the son of old Parson Gordon of 
Georgetown?”</p>
          <pb id="lenox131" n="131"/>
          <p>“Indeed, I do not know, sir,” the man answered.</p>
          <p>“Well, if he <hi rend="italics">is</hi> the son of my old friend, Parson
Gordon, tell him I am very glad to hear of him, 
but if he is <hi rend="italics">not</hi> the <sic>parson's</sic> son, say
to him he 
has made a mistake—we are not the Windsors 
with whom he is acquainted.”</p>
          <p>Will. Gordon took the hint, as he was not the 
son of a <sic>parson</sic>, and never sent any more such 
imprudent messages to his friends. But one 
Sunday, shortly after, he applied for permission 
to preach to the prisoners in the Carrol yard, 
and to our great relief the paper was returned 
to him with “request not granted,” written across 
the back. H. showed us this. H. very often came 
into that part of the prison, and would sit an 
hour at a time in the different rooms, laughing 
and talking with the inmates. He was very fond of 
a joke, but at the same time, through all his 
pleasantry you felt that he always had an eye to 
business, and if you uttered an unwary word, he 
would seize upon it and follow 
<pb id="lenox132" n="132"/>
it up.  He 
professed to be an unbeliever, but had the
Bible by heart; it seemed to me he was never at 
a loss for a quotation. He was not much in my 
cousin's room; indeed, we were rather afraid of 
him, and never encouraged any conversation, 
except when it was necessary.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>Mr. Windsor before the Board—Mrs. Surratt—
The “Prince of Detectives”—An incident—The 
Board of Inquiry.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>ONE morning, while in my cousin's room, the guard
came up and said,
“Mr. Windsor, you are wanted by Colonel -----.”</p>
          <p>He immediately rose, and taking leave of us 
followed the guard. It frequently happened that 
those summoned by the Board never returned—whether they were
released or conveyed to another 
prison, was left to conjecture. One always
therefore prepared for the worst, took leave of
friends, and carried with him such necessary 
articles as he could. Mrs. Windsor was weeping 
bitterly at the departure of her husband, when a 
lady entered the room. She was apparently about 
forty years of age, a tall commanding 
<pb id="lenox134" n="134"/>
figure, rather stout, with brown hair, blue
eyes, thin nose, and small, well-shaped mouth,
denoting great firmness. This lady was Mrs. 
Surratt.</p>
          <p>She took her seat beside my weeping cousin, put
her arm around her and drew her head on her 
shoulder; then she talked to her in the most 
consoling manner, and though my cousin had
never seen her before the imprisonment, she was 
as tender and kind as if she had been an old 
friend. There was a calm, quiet dignity about 
the woman, which impressed me before I even 
knew who she was. She mingled very little with 
the other prisoners, unless they were sick or 
sorrowful; <hi rend="italics">then</hi>, I may truly say, she was an
angel of mercy. After that day I saw her 
often; she would come in and read the daily 
papers.</p>
          <p>On one occasion, I remember, one of the papers
contained an outrageous account of herself and
household, aspersing both her character and
reputation. We endeavored to withhold the
<pb id="lenox135" n="135"/>
paper from her, but she insisted on reading it.
I watched her closely while doing so, and for an 
instant a flush of womanly indignation overspread 
her pale countenance at the insult. After she had 
read it all, she laid down the paper, and, 
clasping her hands, raised her eyes to Heaven and 
said, “I suppose I shall <hi rend="italics">have</hi> to bear it.”</p>
          <p>That was the only time I ever knew her to make 
any allusion to her sufferings. I did not see 
her smile the whole time we were together. She 
rather avoided conversation, and never uttered 
one word of reproach or virulence against those 
by whose authority she was imprisoned. She 
always retained her self-possession, and was 
never in the least degree thrown off her guard. 
H. frequently spent hours talking with her, 
endeavoring—as we were told—to entrap her
into some incautious expression, which would 
enable him to discover where her son, John 
Surratt, was concealed. But in this—smart 
detective as he was—she foiled him. If she 
knew, she locked the knowledge in her own heart so 
<pb id="lenox136" n="136"/>
closely, that even he—that “prince of 
detectives,” as he called himself,—was unable 
to wrest it from her.  Sometimes H. would say to 
her, after he had been absent looking for Surratt, 
“Well, madam, we have at last captured your son, 
and a hard time we had finding him; how did you 
ever hit on so snug a hiding-place.” But she was 
too wary to be misled by such a statement, and H. 
failed to obtain the twenty-five thousand dollars,
generously offered by the Government for Surratt's
apprehension.</p>
          <p>I cannot omit relating one incident in connection
with Mrs. Surratt. One day, a woman, apparently a
prisoner, was brought in. She circulated freely 
among the inmates, and was very talkative, 
generally selecting the assassination as her 
subject. She was also very confidential, and would 
relate marvellous conversations which she had with 
H. and other officials, under the seal of secrecy. 
After awhile the woman was taken very sick, and 
kind Mrs. Surratt, as usual, took charge of her,
and ministered to her necessities. The 
<pb id="lenox137" n="137"/>
woman
recovered, and one day, in a moment of impulse, when 
her heart was filled with gratitude, she threw 
herself on her knees before Mrs. Surratt and said, 
“Oh, Mrs. Surratt, when they offered me the 
twenty-five hundred dollars, to find out, I did
not know what to do. I was penniless, and—”</p>
          <p>“Never mind now,” said Mrs. Surratt, interrupting
and raising her from her knees, “we will talk of
something else.”</p>
          <p>The woman made no further allusion to the matter,
and shortly after left the prison.</p>
          <p>Let me now return to Mr. Windsor. He had been
summoned to appear before the Board, and on 
entering the room was questioned closely by 
Colonel ---- as regarded his occupation, associates, 
amusements, etc., but it was all to no purpose. 
The answers to the interrogations were given boldly 
and unhesitatingly, there being nothing which Mr. 
Windsor was either ashamed or afraid to acknowledge.</p>
          <p>From the multiplicity of questions, and the 
<pb id="lenox138" n="138"/>
ingenuity 
evinced in cross-examinations by the officers of 
Military Justice, it must have been a sore trial 
to them, if, after exhausting every means to 
entrap the unwary, their efforts were to prove 
unsuccessful. But guilty or innocent, it was no 
light matter to be summoned before a body of men 
whose interest it was to convict, not to acquit. 
When one remembered the large rewards offered by 
Government to all who furnished evidence 
prejudicial to the prisoner, it was not surprising 
that witnesses were readily found to testify to 
anything, however improbable. Therefore it was, 
that a summons before the Board was regarded as a 
farewell to either liberty or life.</p>
          <p>As the footsteps of the officer and guard would
draw near, I have seen the pallor of death 
creeping on cheek and lip, all fearing that the 
next sound they would hear would be their names 
called, to appear before that terrible tribunal, 
and then, as the footsteps would recede, and we 
felt that for a few hours longer we were safe, 
a fervent “thank God,” would burst from
<pb id="lenox139" n="139"/>
each one of us, as the fearful anticipations for 
that day would be ended.</p>
          <p>The idea of obtaining justice in the course of
military trial, was something beyond the 
anticipations of the most sanguine. It required but 
slight insight into the manner of conducting these 
“so called” examinations and trials, to convince 
even the most prejudiced that the conviction of
each one who had the misfortune to fall into the
clutches of this stupendous power, was the object 
to be attained. Had the examinations been fair
and impartial, the innocent would not have shrunk 
from investigation, feeling assured that the more 
rigid the examination the better for him. It was 
the effort made to induce the prisoner not only 
to implicate himself, but others, even strangers 
whose names were then heard for the first time.
It was things such as these that made one tremble
before that Board. Every sigh of emotion 
was noticed, recorded officially, and used against 
the prisoner. Alas for the Bureau of Military 
<hi rend="italics">Justice!</hi></p>
          <pb id="lenox140" n="140"/>
          <p>Mr. Windsor was detained half an hour, at 
the expiration of which, we had the heartfelt 
satisfaction of seeing him return. He was notified 
that his examination was not concluded, and that 
he was again to appear before the Board in a few 
days, but the summons never came. As days and 
even weeks passed without the dreaded call, we 
regained our wonted cheerfulness, and began to 
hope, either that the matter was forgotten, or that 
in the press of business it had been indefinitely
postponed. Certain it is, we took care not to 
inquire regarding the delay, and were heartily 
thankful for the respite, as we then supposed it.</p>
          <p>I now spent every day with my friends, returning 
at night to my own apartment. I felt less 
reluctance at leaving Mary, as she had another 
companion in the person of Mrs. Thomas. I 
ascertained with regard to Mary, that she was 
detained in prison as a witness, to be summoned 
when Mrs. Surratt's trial came on. Fearing she 
might be influenced by that lady, they had placed
her in the lower room, in order to prevent any
<pb id="lenox141" n="141"/>
communication between them. I told Mary what 
I had heard, and it gave her great relief, for the 
poor child was dreading all kinds of terrible things.</p>

            <p>Mrs. Johnson—The Confederate prisoner—His 
illness—Subsequent discoveries—Mrs. 
Surratt's kindness—Death and burial of 
Confederate—Mrs. M.—Another alarm.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>AMONG the prisoners up-stairs was a Mrs.
Johnson, before alluded to. She was a tall 
woman, with light hair and eyes, who said and 
did pretty much what she pleased. She was 
very witty, and quick at repartee. Nothing 
seemed to damp her spirits, and to fear she was
a stranger. She had been in prison a long time, 
eighteen months in all, having been first arrested 
for carrying dispatches for the Confederate 
Government to persons in Canada. After a 
year's imprisonment, she was released, on 
condition that she would not cross the Potomac 
again, to which she readily assented. But, alas!
the spirit of adventure was not subdued, and at
<pb id="lenox143" n="143"/>
the end of six months, relinquishing her position 
as nurse in a Confederate hospital, she wended
her way back to Washington. It seems H. had 
been in Richmond the winter she was there, and
she had been very kind to him. He then told 
her if she should ever be in need and he could
help her, to call upon him, and he would do so. 
She went to Washington, and knowing that H.
would certainly discover she was there, she 
determined to put a bold face on the matter, and 
go directly to his house, and ask for him. He 
happened to be at home, and she was ushered in.
H. was so much surprised, that he raised his 
hands and exclaimed,</p>
          <p>“Mrs. Johnson! what on earth brought you
here?”</p>
          <p>“Well, Mr. H.,” she answered,  “I was very much 
in want of clothes; I could get none in Richmond, 
and, as you told me if I needed help to apply to 
you, I have come to ask you to lend me twenty-five 
dollars.”</p>
          <p> “Why, Mrs. Johnson,” replied H., “were you
<pb id="lenox144" n="144"/>
not released on the express condition that you would
never return?”</p>
          <p>“Yes; but you see I was compelled to,” she replied.</p>
          <p>“Well, madam,” said H., handing her the twenty-
five dollars, “my advice to you is to leave this city as
soon as possible.”</p>
          <p>“That I intend to do,” she answered; “but which
route had I better take—that through lower Maryland, or
the one by the chain bridge?”</p>
          <p>“The one by the chain bridge,” said H.</p>
          <p>“Now, you see,” said Mrs. Johnson in telling us, “I 
knew H. well enough to be <hi rend="italics">sure</hi> that be would have
his detectives on the look-out if I went the route he
designated; so to avoid them I determined to take the
other. I did so, and fell into the trap laid for me; for as
H. has since told me, <hi rend="italics">he</hi> felt sure I would not go by the
chain bridge because he advised it, therefore he was
ready for me on the other road.”</p>
          <p>“Have you been here ever since?” I asked.</p>
          <pb id="lenox145" n="145"/>
          <p>“Ever since, and expect to be sent to the
Massachusetts Penitentiary, as I hear most of 
us are to be,” she answered.</p>
          <p>Her room had glass in the windows, and she said
to Nelson:</p>
          <p>“Mr. Nelson, I do <hi rend="italics">wish</hi> you would have the
windows in my room washed.”</p>
          <p>“They are clean enough,” answered Nelson.</p>
          <p>
“No, they are not,” she returned; “indeed, they are
so dirty that my friends across the street cannot
distinguish the signs I make to them, and I must have
the windows washed;” which speech incensed Nelson
very much.</p>
          <p>But on one occasion she came near paying dearly
for her boldness. She was standing at a window
overlooking the yard where the prisoners were 
exercising, and seeing an acquaintance among them, 
she very imprudently waved her handkerchief, which 
she had no sooner done, than one of the guards deliberately 
raised his piece, took aim, and fired. Fortunately for her, 
he was not a good marksman, and the bullet struck a
<pb id="lenox146" n="146"/>
little below the window-sill, and there it is to this day.
She did not move from the window, or appear in the
least frightened, but she was very angry. She never
attempted a like manoeuvre again, to my knowledge.
She was very fond of gazing out of the front windows
which overlooked the street. One morning as she did
so, a poor wounded Confederate was being brought in;
he glanced up, and seeing her standing there, he raised
his hands and cried, “Mother! mother!”</p>
          <p>“Poor boy,” she replied, “he takes me for his mother. 
I am not your mother, but I will try and supply
her place to you.”</p>
          <p>After a short time spent in wondering who the
young soldier could be, the circumstance passed from
our minds. Late that afternoon H. appeared at Mrs.
Johnson's door and said, “Mrs. Johnson, your son is in
the hospital, and wishes to see you.”</p>
          <p>The poor mother rushed down, and there, indeed, 
was her child, a lad of about seventeen, lying on one of
the hospital cots. He had entered 
<pb id="lenox147" n="147"/>
the Confederate
army at sixteen, and his mother had not seen him 
since until now. He had recognized her as she stood 
at the window. At first Mrs. Johnson was allowed 
to be with her son daily; his wound was not a
serious one, and it was thought he would recover, until
typhoid symptoms manifested themselves, after which
he gradually grew worse. He constantly craved food,
such as the prison did not afford; that which was
brought him he could not eat, and therefore pined and
wasted away—his mother declaring all the while that the
prison authorities were starving her child to death. She
became so much excited about it, that she was forbidden
to go to the hospital, and her place beside the boy was
taken by Mrs. Surratt. One day he insisted that if he
could have a small piece of chicken and a cup of coffee
he would recover; neither were to be had in the prison,
but the next day Mrs. Windsor had a partridge sent
her,  which she gave to Mrs. Surratt for young
Johnson. It came too late; the poor fellow was too
<pb id="lenox148" n="148"/>
ill to eat it. That night he died in Mrs. Surratt's arms—his
mother being allowed to see him just at the last.</p>
          <p>He was buried from the prison, and surely there
never was a sadder funeral. The body was placed in a 
common pine coffin, and taken to the lumber room in 
the wing of the building, before mentioned, and
laid across two barrels, in a room dimly lighted by a
cellar window. A few of us were permitted to be present,
and there, in that dark and gloomy place, the priest read
the burial service. Young Johnson was remarkably 
handsome, and his pale face, in its peaceful beauty,
surrounded by a halo of golden hair, contrasted
strikingly with the hard and repulsive accessories. No
one but the mother was allowed to follow his remains to
the grave, and even she had a guard of soldiers with
her, thus denying the indulgence of privacy to her
sacred grief. Mrs. Johnson seemed to recover in a few
days her usual spirits, but every night, before retiring,
she would fold the torn and faded “jacket of 
<pb id="lenox149" n="149"/>
gray,”
worn by the youthful soldier, and place it tenderly 
beneath her head.</p>
          <p>Mrs. Johnson had been so long in the prison, that
she knew the history of all the females who had been
confined there. Among others, she gave us an account
of a Mrs. M., from Western Virginia.</p>
          <p>It seems she had two sons in the Confederate army,
in consequence of which she and her husband were
brought to the Old Capitol, their house in Virginia burnt
to the ground, and everything laid waste. She was soon
taken sick with typhoid fever, and died in prison,
separated from her husband and friends; Mr. M. was
released in the winter and died from exposure; one son
was killed in battle; the other survived the war. On the
surrender of Lee, finding his home in ruins, and his
family dead, intense hatred took possession of him, and
he became a bushranger, vowing vengeance against
the enemies of his country. Shortly after, he killed a man
in Federal uniform, was apprehended, tried by
<pb id="lenox150" n="150"/>
court-martial, condemned, and hung; and thus passed
away the whole family.</p>
          <p>Among the prisoners in the yard, was one who
attracted my attention and aroused my sympathy. He
was a tall man, seemingly middle aged, dressed in
Confederate uniform, very pale and thin, like one in the
last stages of consumption, and with a countenance the
most woe-begone, I think, I ever beheld. Be the day
warm or cold, he always had on a gray overcoat, and
stood away from the other prisoners, in the sunshine. I
never saw him walk about, or exchange a word with any
one. After awhile I missed him, and a few days
subsequent was informed that there had been a death
in the other part of the building. Whether it was the
Confederate or not, I never knew. I have many times
thought of him since, and wondered what his past life
could have been, to have left such traces of sorrow
and dejection.</p>
          <p>We had no more frights at night, until sometime
after Mrs. Thomas became our room-mate.
<pb id="lenox151" n="151"/>
One night at half-past two, we heard a great knocking
at our door, and the guard unlocking it. I sprang up and
asked,</p>
          <p>“Who is there?”</p>
          <p>“An officer,” was the answer.</p>
          <p>“What do you wish?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“I wish to see Mary L.”</p>
          <p>“Wait, she is asleep. I will awaken her.”</p>
          <p>“Mary,” said I, shaking her, “are you awake?”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” she answered.</p>
          <p>“Now,” I said in a whisper, “be on your guard as to
what you say to this officer.”</p>
          <p>She went to the door with me, and the officer
asked,</p>
          <p>“Are you Mary L.?”</p>
          <p>“Yes; what do you want with me?”</p>
          <p>“Do you know Mrs. Callan?” he asked.</p>
          <p> “No,” answered Mary.</p>
          <p> “Are you sure?” persisted he; “think a moment.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox152" n="152"/>
          <p>“I tell you I do not know her.” </p>
          <p>“Where does she go to church?” he said.</p>
          <p>“To St. ----,” replied Mary.
 </p>
          <p>“Who is her father confessor?” he asked. </p>
          <p>“Indeed, I do not know, I never asked her.”</p>
          <p>The man remained silent a few moments, as if
irresolute, then saying, “That will do,” left, the guard
locking the door again. We were never able to find out
the purport of that visit; it seemed still more strange
when we heard that Mrs. Callan's husband was among
the prisoners, and it would have been easy to have
obtained from him the desired information. My idea was
that they expected to ascertain something by
questioning Mary, just aroused from sleep, hoping to
find her thrown off her guard. If such was the intention,
it was baffled. That was the last time our slumbers were
disturbed “officially.”</p>

            <p>The “French Actress”—Prison quarrels—Miss Lewis—The
servant-girls—Mrs. Jones's story.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>AND now was brought in a lady, rather fancifully, 
but fashionably, attired, with a profusion of plumes 
in her bonnet. Her manner was that of a  tragedy queen, 
to which she was probably entitled, as she was Madame 
S., a French actress. She had been associated with Booth 
on the stage, consequently was supposed by the astute 
authorities to be an accessory, if not a participant, in the
President's assassination—the poor creature insisting 
all the time that it was a “meestake.” The trouble was, 
what to do with her, or where  to put her, as the prison 
was full. She was taken first to one room, then to another, 
she positively asserting at each, that she “would not
 go in there,” and that “her husband was <hi rend="italics">one</hi>
Federal officer, and he would have her <hi rend="italics">release</hi>.”
<pb id="lenox154" n="154"/>
The matter was at last decided by accommodating her
in one of the office rooms, which was vacated for that
purpose. In a few days she was “release”—the only
fortunate one; and with envious eyes, we watched her
retreating form, as she walked calmly and collectedly
out of the prison and down the street; as if she had
only been acting a part in a drama on the stage, instead
of a tragedy in real life.</p>
          <p>Very few were released from prison in those sad
days, and if any were so happy, their places were
almost immediately supplied by others. One would suppose 
that persons associated as the prisoners were, in a 
common fate, would be on the best of terms; but such 
was not the case. Frequently there would be quarrels in 
which each party would accuse the other of being a 
“Federal spy”—the greatest insult which could be offered. 
The differences were always healed after a while, and the 
opponents on as amicable a footing as if nothing of the 
kind had occurred. Mrs. Johnson and a Miss Lewis
<pb id="lenox155" n="155"/>
averaged about three friendly days in the week; the 
remainder they were not speaking to each other.</p>
          <p>Miss Lewis had been imprisoned for not draping
her mother's house in mourning, on the death of
President Lincoln. She said she had not the material for
doing so, on which the authorities kindly furnished it at
Government expense, and were so obliging as to hang it
for her. No sooner had they left the premises, than the
black hangings disappeared. Three times were they
replaced, and three times did they disappear. Miss
Lewis not giving satisfactory reasons, and it being a
calm day, it was impossible to attribute this disregard of
a nation's grief to a freak of the wind. There was but
one solution of the mystery, and that was, that Miss
Lewis, in the absence of officials, had removed the
obnoxious black. Such was in reality the case,
consequently that estimable lady was transferred from
her mother's <sic corr="domicile">domicil</sic> to that of benignant Government.</p>
          <pb id="lenox156" n="156"/>
          <p>Mrs. Lewis immediately employed a lawyer,
and endeavored by every means in her power to
obtain her daughter's release, but in vain. The
lawyer, Mr. B., of Washington, came to the prison
to see his client, and was informed that “the
prisoners confined there were not allowed to
employ lawyers.” He then requested permission
to see Miss Lewis, but was again told that “none
but relatives were admitted;” so the matter
ended, leaving Miss Lewis in a state of indignation, 
and amazement also, as she had a faint recollection 
of a document called the Constitution, which 
guarantees certain rights to the citizen, however 
humble. She had yet to realize that <hi rend="italics">that</hi> instrument 
had become a myth; “military necessity,” so called, 
occupied its place.</p>
          <p>Among the other prisoners on that floor were two servant 
girls, in durance vile for insulting a lady of color, or, as 
they phrased it, for “laughing at her.” It seems this lady 
was weeping bitterly over the wash-tub, at the President's 
decease; and these two girls, seeing her great grief,
<pb id="lenox157" n="157"/>
advised her, in a friendly way, to pay a visit to the
White House, where she would have an opportunity of
imprinting a farewell kiss with her “alabaster lips.” On
the strength of which the lady in question reported the
girls as wanting in respect for the memory of the
departed, and in order to quicken their blunted
sensibilities, they were conveyed to a place of
seclusion, where they would have ample time for
reflection and mourning. But alas! such is the
perversity of human nature, these two misguided girls
could not take that view of the matter, and spent all
their time in carrying on desperate flirtations with the
soldiers on guard, judging from the notes which came
fluttering down the baluster. They were the only
prisoners who seemed to regard the whole affair as a
good joke.</p>
          <p>In the same room with them was a Mrs. Jones, who
had a young infant. She was a sorrowful, pale-faced
woman, the wife of a Confederate soldier, who had
been killed in battle. This was her story:</p>
          <pb id="lenox158" n="158"/>
          <p>“We lived near the town of Fredericksburg, when
the war began. John had a little bit of ground that we
worked, and what with chickens and eggs that we sold
to the town people, we managed to get on well enough.
After awhile the war broke out, but John did not join the
army then, he was too weakly, being subject to a misery
in his back. We lived at the place till just before the
battle at Fredericksburg; then John got kind of uneasy,
and we moved all our things—what we <hi rend="italics">could</hi> move—up 
to Orange, where John was raised, and where his folks
live. We shut up our house, giving the key to a
neighbor who was going to stay in those parts. Well,
the battle was fit, and after it was all over, John
thought he'd just go and see after our house. I begged
him not to, but he would; and if you please to b'lieve
me, the Yankees had been there and took everything
we left, and then burnt the house down; and the only
showin' we had for it, was the key. John he come back
awful riled, and said he, ‘Wife, I can't stand it no longer,
but
<pb id="lenox159" n="159"/>
I'm going to jine.’ I felt mighty bad, but still I didn't say
nothing, for I'd not be the woman to stand against a
man's notion of right; so I held my tongue. ‘Yes,’ says
John, ‘I'll jine, and this day too;’ with that he goes
where Captain -----'s company was and did jine. Well, he
come back, and I worked hard to get him ready, though
I could hardly work for the crying; but John never
knowed that; and when he went away he kissed me and
said I was a ‘brave woman, a real soldier's wife.’ John
stayed in the army two years, and at the end of that
time he got a bad wound, and was discharged. After
staying at home a year, and me nursing him, he got
well, and nothing must do but he <hi rend="italics">would</hi> go back to the
army. Sure enough he went, and just the very last battle
he got shot through the head and was killed. In a little
while after that the baby was born, and I made up my
mind I would go to see my mother, who lived in
Maryland. Everybody told me not to go, but you see I
was too weakly to work, and all the people about in
those parts 
<pb id="lenox160" n="160"/>
was poor, and I couldn't live on them, so I
just made up my mind that I would leave. I had no child 
but Johnanna, and I thought I could get through. I got 
what things I had and put them in an old carpet-bag, and 
went to Fredericksburg, and from there to the crossing-place,
where I found two ladies who were just going to cross
too. We got into the boat at night, and went over. The
baby was taken sick, so I had to stop at a house for
three days. As I was about to go to mother's, some
soldiers come up, and finding I didn't have no pass,
they took me up and brought me here, where I have
been ever since;” and the poor creature began to weep bitterly.</p>
          <p>“How did you get the money to pay your expenses?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Why, you see, John had laid up a little before the war, and 
after he jined the army, he told me if anything happened 
to him, I was to take the money and go back to mother, 
and I was not to use it for anything else. I had ten dollars 
left when the soldiers took me, but they got it
<pb id="lenox161" n="161"/>
 all, and
everything else but a few of the baby's clothes.”</p>
          <p>“Did you never get anything back again?”</p>
          <p>“No, indeed, not a single thing, and the baby does want 
clothes so bad.”</p>
          <p>“Does your mother know where you are?”</p>
          <p>“I don't know. I sent her a letter, but I reckon she
never got it; if <hi>she</hi> had she would have come on, or
sent sister. She does not live near any town, so
sometimes the letters don't get to her till they are right
old. When any of the neighbors goes in, if they thinks
of it, they asks for her letters at the office, and then
when they gets a chance, they sends them to her.”</p>
          <p>“That is bad, for you may not hear for a long time.”</p>
          <p>“Yes,” she said, “and sometimes the postmaster
keeps the letters in his pocket, and when he goes out,
nobody can find him.”</p>
          <p>Just then, H. made his appearance, and put an end
to our conversation.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>The “ducks and chickens”—Mrs. James—Mr. Windsor
summoned before the Board—The mob—An alarm of 
fire—Miss Sallie Jarvis.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>THERE were two other characters among the
prisoners who deserve notice. One of them, a tearful,
complaining woman, had at one time been an
acquaintance of Booth. This fact rendering her an
object of suspicion, she was incarcerated in the Old
Capitol until her complicity with the assassination could
be ascertained. She was always grieving, poor soul,
about her ducks and her chickens. Every few moments
she would exclaim, “My ducks and my chickens! jes'
hatched out, and who will 'tend to 'em now?”</p>
          <p>The other character was a Mrs. James, who had
formerly been the cook of some gentleman in
Washington, in which capacity she had made and
saved money, investing it in a market garden,
<pb id="lenox163" n="163"/>
which she cultivated with her son's help until he joined
the Confederate army.</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">She </hi>said she was arrested for being a 
<hi rend="italics">dim</hi>ocrat, but
the accusation against her was, that on hearing the
news of the President's death she was seen to smile,
and not only that, but went home and made a flag out
of her son's Confederate gray coat, and hung it out of
the window. She says she smiled because “eggs had
riz,” and she had some for sale; and as to the flag, she
was only airing her son's clothes. Be that as it may, she
found herself safely ensconced in the Old Capitol. Her
son was at one time stationed at Manassas, and she
said, “Honey, many's the time I've taken letters from
Washington to the camp.”</p>
          <p>“But,” I said, “how did you manage it?  were you
never detected?”</p>
          <p>“Never,” she answered, “but came mighty near it
once.”</p>
          <p>“How was that?”</p>
          <p>“I used to make b'lieve, you see, honey, that I was
a market-woman, and always carried a 
<pb id="lenox164" n="164"/>
lunch-basket
on my arm. Well, I had to pass through the picket guard, 
and one of 'em stopped me and said,</p>
          <p>“ ‘I really do believe that's a secesh;’ on hearing which 
I made out I was mighty mad, and sot my arms a-kimbo, 
and looking him full in the face, said: ‘Man, does
I look like a secesh woman?’ and then I handed him my
lunch basket, and he took some and let me pass; and
honey, if you b'lieve me, my stockings was so full of
letters I could hardly walk.”</p>
          <p>Mrs. James's peculiar detestation was the tearful
woman. One morning she was weeping, as usual, over
her ducks and chickens, when Mrs. James could stand
it no longer, but turning suddenly upon her, said: “D---
your ducks and your chickens, I'm sick and tired of
hearing 'bout 'em.“</p>
          <p>Mr. Windsor, who had been in the habit of exercising 
with the other prisoners in the yard, on coming in one 
day was ordered to appear before Colonel ----, who said:</p>
          <p>“Mr. Windsor, I understand you have been 
<pb id="lenox165" n="165"/>
heard to use
most disrespectful language in reference to President 
Lincoln.”</p>
          <p>“You are mistaken, sir,” replied Mr. Windsor.</p>
          <p>“But I tell you, you <hi rend="italics">did</hi>, sir; the man who heard you 
repeated it to me.”</p>
          <p>“Where is the man?” said Mr. Windsor.</p>
          <p>“That is of no consequence,” replied Colonel -----; “but I
 tell you what, sir, I have a great mind to place you in 
solitary confinement on bread and water, and if I hear 
any more complaints about you, I will. In the mean 
time, I order you to speak to no one while exercising. 
Now, sir, you can go.”</p>
          <p>Mr. Windsor was only too glad to be forbidden
intercourse with the men in the yard; for it was well
known that there were several spies among them—<hi rend="italics">who</hi>
they were, it was impossible to determine, as all
appeared to be prisoners.</p>
          <p>An incident occurred which frightened us very much.  One 
afternoon, just before dark, Mrs. Johnson entered my cousin's 
room and exclaimed, “A mob is coming down to attack the
<pb id="lenox166" n="166"/>
prison.” Imagine our feelings! There we were, a party of
defenceless women, guarded by a company of ignorant
Dutch soldiers, many of whom could not understand
English and who, for aught we knew, were in league
with the excited rabble now threatening the prison. We
waited in breathless suspense for more than an hour,
straining both eyes and ears to catch the first sight or
sound of the assailants. Happily for us, the danger had
been averted; for, except the extra precaution taken by
the authorities, we knew nothing more of the threatened
riot. It seems the idea abroad was, that the accomplices
of Booth had been captured, and were confined in the
Old Capitol. Whether this was true or not, I could not
ascertain; certain it was, that several prisoners were
brought in at night, but a mystery always appeared to
hang over them. The populace of Washington were in a
very excited state, and it was in order to obtain
possession of these persons that they threatened to
attack the prison.</p>
          <pb id="lenox167" n="167"/>
          <p>It had even become dangerous for one just released
to walk the streets; indeed, several persons had been
stoned and severely injured, sometimes necessitating
the interference and protection of the soldiers, and
even then the mob was with difficulty restrained from
murdering a poor man, who will doubtless carry the
scars of their brutal assault to the grave. We were
almost afraid to go near the windows fronting the
street, lest something should be thrown at us. It was a
terrible ordeal, which none can realize save those by
whom it was experienced. I think none of us ever felt
safe after that fright, and we had yet another.</p>
          <p>One night some time after, my cousin noticed that
her room was unusually bright, and on looking out of
the window, she saw the wing of the building occupied
by the men, in flames. She heard the order given, 
“Secure the prisoners,” but no one came to our relief.
We were almost frantic with fright and the apprehension 
of being burned, but fortunately the fire was soon subdued, 
and
<pb id="lenox168" n="168"/>
quiet restored. It was no light matter to be locked 
up in a burning building, with no exit unless 
permitted by the guard. Our fear was, that they 
would postpone our release until too late. Most of us 
were more alarmed at the fire than at the mob. It seems 
strange, yet we gradually became accustomed to the 
daily life we had to endure; and it was not until after 
we were released, that our over-wrought systems 
succumbed, and we realized how we had been hitherto 
sustained by artificial excitement. </p>
          <p>And now another prisoner was added to the already
large number. She was a young girl from the Eastern
shore of Maryland, of about sixteen years of age. It
seems that some little boys, playing soldiers, requested
her to make them a Confederate flag, which she
innocently did, and they, in equal innocence, stuck it on
the top of a hen-coop, which served them for a
fortification. A body of Baker's valiant detectives,
passing, espied the obnoxious ensign, three inches by
six, proudly waving in the breeze.
<pb id="lenox169" n="169"/>
The opportunity for distinction was too tempting to be
resisted; picked men were immediately detailed to
undertake the hazardous task of reducing the fortress,
and capturing—if it could be done without much loss of
life—the entire garrison and its colors. The expedition was
a “perfect success,” though the enemy made a valiant
defence, worthy of a better cause. A prisoner—one of the
aforesaid garrison—was brought before General Baker,
and liberty promised if he would give the name of the
person who presented the colors. In case of refusal, the
orderly had ready a formidable weapon of birch, with
orders to inflict condign punishment on the obdurate
little rebel. Alas! the influence of the birch was not to be
resisted, and with many tears and cries, the ungallant
soldier confessed that the colors were made and
presented by one Miss “Sallie Jarvis.”</p>
          <p>In a short time this young lady's house was surrounded by 
Federal soldiers, all avenue of escape being cut off.  After 
taking every possible precaution against a rescue or surprise, 
Miss 
<pb id="lenox170" n="170"/>
Jarvis was summoned before General Baker, and 
taxed with the commission of the grave offence. She 
did not attempt to deny it; indeed, so hardened was she, 
that she even ridiculed the whole proceeding, and 
expressed perfect willingness to visit Washington under 
the protection of the chivalrous and gallant Baker, assuring
him that she had long contemplated a visit to that
renowned city, but had hitherto been prevented from
executing her intention, for want of a proper escort, and
therefore gladly availed herself of his polite and
pressing invitation. On reaching the Old Capitol she
expressed her high appreciation of the honor conferred,
as very few were considered of sufficient importance to
be the guests of the Government. She also desired
General Baker to assure the Hon. Secretary of War, that
she was neither unmindful nor ungrateful, but that
untoward circumstances alone prevented a personal
attendance on his Maj—no, his Honor—to thank him for
his condescension and kindness.</p>

            <p>Rainy Sunday—Order given to “double the guard”—Mrs. 
Surratt summoned—Our last interview—Anna's grief—H.'s 
account of Mrs. Surratt's treatment—Prison scenes.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>ANOTHER gloomy Sunday evening. Night was closing around 
the Old Capitol prison, and we, the inmates, were collected 
together, talking, as usual, when we heard the order given 
to “double the guard.” Expecting another mob, we waited in 
silence and dread; but nothing of the kind occurred; only an open
carriage, in which were two officers, drove up and stopped at 
the prison door.</p>
          <p>The officers entered the building, and as all continued quiet, 
we were soon talking again—our fears forgotten. Half an 
hour had probably passed, when Nelson appeared with a 
soldier and said,</p>
          <pb id="lenox172" n="172"/>
          <p>“Mrs. Surratt, you are wanted. You will put on your
bonnet and cloak, if you please, and follow me.”</p>
          <p>Mrs. Surratt arose silently, but trembling the while,
and going to her own room arrayed herself as directed.
She returned in a few moments, her daughter clinging
to her, and begging to be allowed to accompany her,
which request was unheeded. Mrs. Surratt kissed each
one of us, and when she came to me, she threw her
arms around my neck, and said in an agitated voice,
“Pray for me, pray for me.”</p>
          <p>Nelson then stepped forward, and gently disengaging 
the weeping girl who clung so tenaciously to her 
mother, took Mrs. Surratt by the arm and led her
down stairs, out of the door and into the carriage. The
two officers followed, and they drove rapidly away. We
never saw Mrs. Surratt again.</p>
          <p>For a while, all but Anna were silent, shocked by
the suddenness of the whole proceeding. She, poor
girl, knelt by her iron bedstead, wringing 
<pb id="lenox173" n="173"/>
her hands
 and crying, “Oh, mother, mother!”  None of us thought 
that Mrs. Surratt had been taken away to remain, and 
we sat up the entire night, watching and waiting for her 
return—Mary and myself in our room, our faces as near 
to the window as we dared, straining our eyes to see the 
entrance to the yard, hoping to catch a glimpse of Mrs. 
Surratt, should she be brought back and confined in 
another part of the prison, which we deemed likely. 
As one would become tired, the other would take her 
place, and so we watched until day dawned.</p>
          <p>Night after night did I hear the patter of Anna Surratt's 
little slippered feet, as she restlessly paced the room above 
me. I fancy I can see her now, her light hair brushed back 
from her fair face, her blue eyes turned towards heaven, her 
lips compressed as if in pain, and her delicate little white  
hands clasped tightly, as she walked up and down that room, 
hour after hour, seeming insensible to fatigue, and 
speaking to no one. Sometimes she would be quite hysterical,
<pb id="lenox174" n="174"/>
then again perfectly calm, except for the constant 
walking. We all thought she would lose her mind 
if the strain were not relieved.</p>
          <p>We could ascertain nothing in regard to Mrs.
Surratt. If Nelson knew, he would not tell us, and H. was
absent. After a week had elapsed, he returned, and we
immediately beset him with questions. He told us that
Mrs. Surratt had been taken on board of a gunboat,
lying in front of the arsenal, in the hold of which she,
and the other prisoners implicated in the assassination,
were confined in perfect darkness and solitude. Around
the neck of each prisoner was an iron collar, from which
was suspended a short chain terminated by an iron ball,
which rested on the floor, so that the head was bowed
down and retained in that position; and in <hi rend="italics">that</hi> position
the prisoners sat day and night, with a soldier guarding
each.</p>
          <p>“What are they going to do with Mrs. Surratt?” asked 
Miss Lewis.</p>
          <p>“It is not decided yet,” he replied; “but 
<pb id="lenox175" n="175"/>
there is some 
talk of taking the gunboat further into the stream and 
scuttling her, with the prisoners on board.”</p>
          <p>That was the first intimation we had, that Mrs. Surratt's 
life was endangered. We had supposed that she might 
be sentenced to the penitentiary for life, or something 
similar, but we did not realize that she was doomed to 
a violent death. She had endeared herself to all by her 
kindness and consideration, and was the last person one 
would suspect of a cold-blooded murder. Conscious of 
her innocence, she never apprehended the awful fate 
awaiting her. That her position sorely tried her, was 
apparent to all; but there was never the least 
appearance of guilt, and not for one moment did her 
faith in an All-merciful Providence waver. There was 
no pretence about it,—you felt that the woman was 
deeply and sincerely religious, yet without any 
ostentation. It is impossible to describe the state of 
wretchedness, into which this news threw Anna Surratt. 
H. told her himself—none of us 
<pb id="lenox176" n="176"/>
having the nerve
to do so. She was frantic for a time, her constant cry 
being “Mother! mother!” I believe H. would have 
withheld this from her, had she not insisted on hearing 
the truth. He told us he had begged the officer in charge 
to allow him an interview with Mrs. Surratt, but was 
refused, as she was not permitted to see or hold 
communication with any one, not even the guard.</p>
          <p>For a short time this occurrence cast a gloom over
the other prisoners, but human nature is the same
everywhere, and gradually all  recovered their
cheerfulness, and Mrs. Surratt would have been
forgotten, for the time at least, had it not been for the
poor daughter. I was often reminded of scenes I had
read of, occurring during the Revolution in France.
There was the same horror for a little while, and then the
return to former gayety, as if nothing had happened to
shock and terrify. We asked Anna Surratt what she
intended doing? She said she thought of entering a
convent, as she had no longer a home.
<pb id="lenox177" n="177"/>
She was an only daughter, and had lived with her
mother, who was a widow.  </p>
          <p>Poor Anna! I can never forget her look, or the sound 
of that restless footstep in the room above me.
The two haunt me yet, and will until my dying day. It
matters little to that poor mourner, that the whole trial
has been declared by authority unconstitutional and
illegal. <hi>That</hi> does not bring back the dead, nor lessen
the grief of the survivor, nor can it blot out the shame
and disgrace which will forever attach itself to the
nation, which suffered such flagrant abuse of power to
pass unnoticed and unrebuked.</p>

            <p>The “Contract Preacher”—His appearance—The 
sermon—Mrs. Johnson's grief—“Little Tad.”</p>
          </argument>
          <p>SATURDAY night, H. informed Mrs. Johnson that
there would be preaching in the yard the following
morning; which notice was of course duly conveyed to
the other inmates. It was not often that the prison was
thus honored, and the advent of a “contract preacher”
created quite an excitement. Let me say a few words in
explanation of the above title. It seems that “preaching
gentlemen” were commissioned by the War Department, 
to enlighten the heathen darkness of the disloyal, and 
were handsomely paid for doing so. One can well 
understand, therefore, that it was quite an easy
method of earning an honest penny. The prisoners
being aware of the above circumstance, often had
<pb id="lenox179" n="179"/>
misgivings as to whether the preachers had “Rev.”
prefixed to their names; consequently those sent by the
War Department had obtained the sobriquet of  
“contract preachers.” These men, whether clergymen or
not, too often took advantage of the opportunity, either
to deliver a political address or to speak against all that
Southerners held most dear. Influence for good was
lost in consequence, and the prisoners often turned
away disgusted, who would have listened attentively
had the discourse been indeed Christian, as it should
have been.</p>
          <p>Sunday morning dawned bright and beautiful; the
men were collected in the yard and the women at the
windows overlooking all, where they could both see
and hear. At twelve, H. appeared, conducting the
preacher. He was short and stout, with a large white
neckcloth, which seemed inclined to choke him—suggesting at once to
the beholder, that it was an
article of dress not often worn by this gentleman, but
adopted for the occasion. His hair was parted
<pb id="lenox180" n="180"/>
with scrupulous exactness, and fell rather long on the
shoulders; it was of that nondescript color—a cross
between molasses candy and mud. His eyes were large
and glassy, the color not distinguishable at the
window, but often turned up so as to exhibit the whites
to an alarming degree. His mouth and nose were large,
his face smoothly shaven, and his hands were fat and
ungainly-looking; occasionally he would wipe both
face and hands on a yellow silk handkerchief.</p>
          <p>A chair and table had been arranged for him in the yard, 
but being a short man, he preferred the top of the wood-pile, which was a
few feet higher, and up which he climbed 
with surprising agility, considering he was supposed to be 
unused to such feats. On the table below him, he had 
placed quite a large package, containing, as we afterwards 
saw, tracts and hymns for distribution. I shall omit the 
prayer with which he began the service, only noticing that 
it savored strongly of fanaticism, and was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> “devoutly
<pb id="lenox181" n="181"/>
listened to,” as the newspapers in describing such
scenes generally state. Then a hymn was sung, to the
tune of “Old Hundred,” the preacher reading two lines
at a time. Several of the prisoners had fine voices, and
sung well. That being ended, the “Rev.” gentleman
now prepared himself for the sermon, by passing the
yellow handkerchief several times across his face. Then
clearing his throat, in a nasal twang he began the
following, which is as near the original as I can
remember:</p>
          <p>“My friends, I am permitted by a kind and indulgent
Government to address you this morning. I need hardly
say that I gladly avail myself of the golden opportunity,
hoping that a word of mine may find a lodgement in the 
breast of some poor fellow-sinner, and bring forth 
abundant fruit. At this time of a nation's grief, surely there 
is no subject more appropriate than that which the occasion 
suggests, namely, reflections on the life of our illustrious 
and martyred President.” At this juncture he had 
<pb id="lenox182" n="182"/>
recourse to his handkerchief, and Mrs. Johnson, taking
out hers, wiped her eyes as if in great distress, though
the expression of her countenance denoted anything
but grief. “I may be excused, therefore,” he continued, 
“for not taking a text, and preaching a regular discourse;
but I wish for a few moments to call your attention to
the parallel which exists between our illustrious
departed and Moses, the chosen leader of the children
of Israel. You have all, doubtless, my friends, read in
the Bible the history of the Israelites; therefore I will
give but a few of the leading points, leaving you to fill
up the picture at your leisure. Moses was the child of
parents in nothing remarkable, as far as we know; and
in this Abraham Lincoln resembled him, he too being
the son of respectable but plain people. Moses was
adopted by the daughter of the King of Egypt, and raised 
to a great station. Our Abraham was also adopted by the 
people of this enlightened country, and elevated to 
a high dignity. Now you remember, the Israelites—
<pb id="lenox183" n="183"/>
Moses' brethren—were also in bondage to this very king
of Egypt, although at that time the yoke of slavery was 
comparatively light. But on the death of Pharaoh, another 
king arose who ground the Israelites to the earth. Moses 
seeing this, was continually meditating and forming plans 
for their relief and rescue; in short, he thought of nothing 
else day or night. At length the time arrived, my brethren, 
and Moses, the chosen leader, although at first rejected 
by the Israelites, as Abraham Lincoln was by the rebellious 
Southern people, yet in the end, succeeded in carrying 
them through the wilderness to the fair land of Canaan. 
Now, my friends, the points to which I wish to call your 
especial attention are the following: In the southern part 
of this great country of ours, were millions of men, 
women, and children—in fact, a nation—groaning under 
a worse servitude than that which afflicted the children of 
Israel. This slavery, tolerable as it might have been at first, 
increased in severity as time rolled on, and other masters
<pb id="lenox184" n="184"/>
took the place of those who had passed away.
Abraham Lincoln, viewing these things in his far 
off northern home, aspired to lead this enslaved 
nation to freedom and greatness. One had already 
attempted the task, and fallen a victim to 
Southern intolerance. I allude to the martyr, 
‘John Brown.’”</p>
          <p>At this mention, Mrs. Johnson sobbed violently
at the window.</p>
          <p>“John Brown endeavored to ameliorate the 
slaves' condition, and failed; but not so, my 
brethren, Abraham Lincoln; <hi rend="italics">he</hi> saw, indeed, that 
there was but one way to accomplish the holy 
purpose, and that was by overthrowing the slave 
oligarchy. And did he hesitate, because in so 
doing a great, powerful, and proud people would 
be humiliated to the dust? Indeed, no. Did 
Moses hesitate to inflict punishment on the
hardened Egyptians when they refused to hearken 
unto him? I trow not, my brethren. As the 
Israelites marched from the land of Egypt, 
laden with the spoils of their masters, so
<pb id="lenox185" n="185"/>
did the African race emerge from the darkness 
and degradation of Southern slavery. But 
Moses, my brethren, was not permitted to enter 
the land of Canaan, toward which he was leading 
the chosen people; he did but view it from afar. 
So with Abraham Lincoln; he also beheld but the 
glimmering glory of the promised land. Moses, 
we are told, died the ordinary death of 
mortals; but Abraham Lincoln, alas! fell by an 
assassin's hand.”</p>
          <p>Here he wiped his face with the yellow
handkerchief, and Mrs. Johnson was apparently 
almost overcome with grief.</p>
          <p>“And let us ask, whose was the arm raised to 
strike down the glorious patriot and statesman? 
We answer, the arm and hand of a Southerner dealt 
the murderous blow. And lo! the nation, but a 
short time since so jubilant, is plunged into 
depths of woe. A family also is rendered 
fatherless! a wife, a widow! I would now, in
conclusion, say to every Southern man and woman”
[looking up at the
windows] “before me, that on
<pb id="lenox186" n="186"/>
the head of each, mark me, each one of you, rests 
the blood of the martyr Abraham. Your very 
presence in this prison proclaims your guilt. 
Wherefore are you here? Because you have aided 
and abetted the rebellion, and every rebel, 
therefore, of either sex, is a murderer. I call 
upon you all, therefore, to repent; yea, in 
sackcloth and ashes; then, only, may you hope to
meet him, the good and great man, who has gone 
to his just reward. Let us pray.”</p>
          <p>Then followed a prayer for the hardened rebels,
during which, most of those obdurate sinners 
walked off. After the prayer, he said,</p>
          <p>“I have a little piece of poetry, a favorite 
hymn, which I desire to have sung. Any one 
wishing to retain the poetry, can do so. All 
those who can join in the singing, will please 
come forward and receive a copy of the verses. 
I have selected this piece as being most suited 
to the occasion, and expressing, in beautiful
simplicity, the mourning at the White House, 
symbolic of a nation's grief. We will sing it to 
 the
<pb id="lenox187" n="187"/>
tune of ‘Old Antwerp,’—familiar, I 
suppose, to most of you.”</p>
          <p>Many of the men now approached the table, and
received a copy of the verses, some being also 
sent to the prisoners at the windows. Contrary 
to the preacher's expectation, “Old Antwerp” did 
not appear to be a familiar tune, but that did 
not prevent the prisoners from singing, which 
they did with zest, dwelling particularly long 
on the last word of each verse. The music, if not
soul inspiring, was at least noisy, and in this 
bore a striking resemblance to the fashionable 
style of the present day. Mrs. Johnson attempted 
to sing, but the touching lines affected her too 
much. After vainly attempting the first verse, 
she desisted, sobbing violently whenever the 
refrain, “Poor little Tad,” was sung. I give the 
words of the selected piece :</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XVII.</head>
          <argument>
            <p>Mr. H.'s commentary—Mrs. Johnson's request—Her
interview with the preacher—She takes 
the oath—Father W.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>THE singing concluded the services, and the
preacher, having distributed his bundle of tracts, 
was about to depart, when H. arose and said,</p>
          <p>“My friends, before the reverend preacher leaves
us, I wish to add a few words, supplementary to 
his well-timed remarks. In drawing the parallel 
between Moses and the illustrious Abraham Lincoln, 
he failed to notice some points, one of which was, 
that Moses refused to be called the son of Pharaoh's 
daughter. Also, that Moses proved to the Israelites 
by many miracles, that he was sent to lead them, 
therefore there could be no mistake in the matter. 
With regard to ‘John Brown,’ if I am not very much 
mistaken, the Governor of Pennsylvania offered his 
<pb id="lenox190" n="190"/>
services to assist in capturing and hanging that 
man of ‘blessed memory.’ ”</p>
          <p>At this point the prisoners clapped their 
hands, and cried, “Good! Go on!” H. resumed:</p>
          <p>“The Israelites, the reverend preacher told us, 
left Egypt laden with spoils, and in <hi rend="italics">this</hi>, the 
parallel is perfect, as a visit to the North will 
convince any one.  The Israelites entered <hi rend="italics">their </hi>
land, but the Africans know theirs only as the 
promised,—and that it is likely to be, for
some time to come, in spite of citizenship, etc.; 
for you cannot make a people a great nation 
unless they are fit for it. Now, my friends, let 
me say, in conclusion, I hope you all will 
repent, as directed by the reverend preacher; 
to assist which repentance, I advise you to 
read attentively the tracts he has so kindly 
given, especially this one,” (taking it from 
the table,) “entitled, ‘Korah, Dathan, and Abiram; 
or, The Sin of Rebellion;’ this little book is 
illustrated throughout with large Roman capitals, 
thereby testifying to the magnitude of the sin set 
<pb id="lenox191" n="191"/>
forth. Here is another tract also, ‘The true story 
of James Conner, the repentant Rebel;’ and for 
those of a poetical turn, here is a nice little 
book, ‘Union Songster.’ The taste of each has been 
regarded in the selection; and, sir,” turning to 
the preacher, “allow me to thank you in the name 
of these poor misguided prisoners, for your 
appropriate discourse, and I doubt not, sir, but 
that tomorrow I shall have as much as I can attend 
to, administering the oath of allegiance to these 
poor sinners.”</p>
          <p>H. had finished, and was about to conduct the
preacher out, when one of the guards stopped up 
and said,</p>
          <p>“Mr. H., Mrs. Johnson says, can she come down
and speak to the preacher?”</p>
          <p>“Certainly,” said H.</p>
          <p>In a few moments, Mrs. Johnson appeared,
handkerchief to her eyes, and approaching the
preacher, said in a tremulous voice,</p>
          <p>“Mr. Preacher, allow me to take your hand,”—he
held it out—“and thank you for your sermon.
<pb id="lenox192" n="192"/>
Sir, before your visit here this morning, 
I was a most incorrigible rebel, as Mr. H. can 
testify.” H. nodded and said “That's so.” “But 
while listening to your discourse, my hardness 
of heart disappeared by degrees, and when you 
called us <hi rend="italics">murderers</hi>, oh!”—raising the 
handkerchief to her eyes—“I could with
difficulty control myself; and then, too, those 
beautiful touching little verses went to my very 
heart; and my intention is to have them framed, 
and hung in my room where I can always behold 
them. Mr. Preacher, I am now a loyal woman, and 
how thankful am I, that I have been so long 
confined in this gloomy prison, since it has 
been the means of my hearing your sermon, by
which my eyes have been opened, and I now see how
great and heinous my offence has been. And now, Mr.
H.,” turning to him, “I desire you to administer 
to me the oath of allegiance.”</p>
          <p>“That I cannot do to-day, Mrs. Johnson,” replied 
H., “you know it is Sunday, and therefore 
unlawful.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox193" n="193"/>
          <p>“But, Mr. H.,” persisted Mrs. Johnson, “I might 
die to-night, and if so I desire to depart a loyal 
citizen of the United States.”</p>
          <p>“I am very sorry, madam, but it cannot be done to-day,”
replied H.</p>
          <p>“Very well, then, I'll swear myself,” and raising her
right hand, she <hi rend="italics">did </hi>swear herself, but the oath of
allegiance was not probably the one H. would have
administered the following day, being nothing more 
nor less than a parody of the original.</p>
          <p>While this scene was enacting, the poor bewildered
preacher was gazing in perplexity, first at H. and 
then at Mrs. Johnson, both of whom were perfectly 
grave. The men had collected in a semicircle around 
the group, and were enjoying the fun intensely. After 
Mrs. Johnson had taken her oath, she again shook hands 
with the preacher, and ascended the stairs. H. now 
conducted him out of the prison, and we saw him no 
more. It is not at all likely that he applied for 
permission to preach <hi rend="italics">there</hi> again, nor did we
<pb id="lenox194" n="194"/>
ever have another “contract preacher.” Perhaps he
related his experience to the brethren of the same 
cloth, and they also were deterred from entering 
such an awful place. Mrs. Johnson, on arriving 
up-stairs, proceeded to burlesque the whole affair, 
which she did to perfection, being a capital mimic; 
and so ended our Sunday's <hi rend="italics">entertainment.</hi></p>
          <p>No clergyman ever approached the prison until
some time after, when the Reverend Father W. was
admitted. Poor Mrs. Surratt had been so anxious to 
see a priest, but her request was always denied; now 
that she was taken away the restriction was removed, 
and this gentleman, a kind, truly Catholic clergyman,
permitted, this once only, an interview with the 
prisoners. I hope he is aware of the consolation his 
visit afforded to the forlorn inmates of that 
gloomy building. Let me say, that each and all 
remember him with gratitude, and appreciate the 
Christian courage he manifested, in daring to request 
admission to those, whom to befriend was to render
<pb id="lenox195" n="195"/>
one's self suspected. With the exception of this
gentleman, there was but one other in that great city
who solicited the favor of visiting the prison.
Surely they had forgotten a certain text in the gospel, 
or else had not read it aright. For the time being we 
were outcasts, and felt it; even after we were released 
we were the objects of suspicion and distrust.</p>

          <argument>
            <p>An attempted escape—The discovery—“Old” Nelson—
Novel use of Quartermaster's stores—The broken door.</p>
          </argument>
          <p>ONE morning Mrs. Johnson entered my cousin's
room, and asked her if she had a spare chair which she
could lend her. My cousin had but one article of the 
kind, and that she required. I, seeing there was 
some mischief intended, said:</p>
          <p>“What are you going to do with it?”</p>
          <p>“I am trying to effect the escape of Mr. -----,” 
naming a young Confederate who visited her.</p>
          <p>“Oh,” said I, “please do not attempt it; you will
certainly be discovered, and severely punished.”</p>
          <p>“Indeed, not I,” she answered; “this is what I 
intend to do. I have ascertained that the attic 
<pb id="lenox197" n="197"/>
room in H.'s house, adjoining the one in this, is
unoccupied, and my plan is to break a hole through 
the lath and plaster partition, so that Mr. ----- 
can creep through into H.'s house. After he is 
there, he can either get on the roof and attempt to 
escape by the lightning-rod, or else he can go out 
through the front door, which I deem the better plan. 
I shall make the hole while H. is absent, so there 
will be less chance of failure. See here,” said
she, diving into her pocket, “I already have the
hammer.”</p>
          <p>“How did you obtain it?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Oh, I told old Nelson that I wanted to nail down
a loose plank in my floor, and he brought me this.”</p>
          <p>“What are you going to do with a chair?”</p>
          <p>“I cannot reach the exact place where I wish to 
hammer, so I will have to put a chair on a table. I 
have taken the table up, but was afraid the chair 
might be missed.”</p>
          <p>“Now,” said I, “if you will take my advice, you will 
not attempt it; you will certainly be discovered,
<pb id="lenox198" n="198"/>
and both yourself and the young man made to
suffer.”</p>
          <p>“There is no one sharp enough to suspect anything 
but H., and he is away,” she answered.</p>
          <p>“But likely to return,” said I, “at any moment.”</p>
          <p>“Will you keep watch, while I go up and hammer?”
she asked.</p>
          <p>“No, I cannot do that, but should I happen to hear
any one coming, I will call you.”</p>
          <p>“That is all I ask,” she returned, and wended her
way up the steps, into the room overhead, where in a
few moments we heard her hammering, and the plaster
falling on the floor with a dull sound. She had not 
been at work more than twenty minutes, when I heard 
H.'s voice in the passage below; fortunately she 
heard it also, and immediately descended the stairs, 
hammer in hand. She entered her room, took up her 
sewing, and worked most vigorously. H. went the
rounds as usual, but on coming to Mrs. Johnson's 
<pb id="lenox199" n="199"/>
room he took his seat, and entered into conversation. 
Presently his eye lighted on the hammer. </p>
          <p>“How came this here?” asked he, stooping to pick
it up.</p>
          <p>“I sent for it to nail a loose plank,” replied Mrs.
Johnson.</p>
          <p>H. made no answer, but examined the hammer attentively, 
and finding a little piece of plastering sticking on 
the end, he just looked at Mrs. Johnson, as if to say, 
“I've found you out,” and put the hammer into his coat 
pocket. He then arose and peered about her room, but 
seeing nothing suspicious there, he ascended to the 
story above, and there <hi rend="italics">did </hi>see. He brought down the 
table and chair, and returning to Mrs. Johnson's
room, stood before her for a moment in silence; 
then exclaimed,</p>
          <p>“Well, you are the d---l.”</p>
          <p>“Thank you for the compliment,” she replied, by
no means disconcerted, and continuing her sewing,
which she had not relinquished.</p>
          <pb id="lenox200" n="200"/>
          <p>He then left the prison, and Mrs. Johnson came
back to us, and said,</p>
          <p>“I am so afraid he will find out who it was I was
trying to assist, and Mr. ---- has most valuable 
papers in his boots, which he is so anxious to 
take South.”</p>
          <p>I may here remark, that I have yet to see the
Confederate prisoner, either officer or private, 
who did <hi rend="italics">not</hi> have papers of most vital importance 
concealed somewhere, which were always discovered and 
taken from him. I may therefore be allowed to doubt 
the fact of Mr. ---- having any documents at all—he had been a
prisoner for nearly a year, and had no 
way of communicating with any one outside.</p>
          <p>By some means, known only to detectives, H. did
discover the whole plot, and poor Mr. ----- who had 
proudly hoped to have gone on his way rejoicing that 
night, found himself, instead, lodged in a remote 
station-house, where he was detained for some days, 
and fed on bread and water. After he had been 
sufficiently punished, H. visited 
<pb id="lenox201" n="201"/>
him, and handed him a pardon, dated the very day of
his attempted escape, and which H. intended giving
him at the time he had discovered the plot. No
punishment was inflicted on Mrs. Johnson.</p>
          <p>There was a portion of the plastering beside her
fireplace which had been accidentally knocked away. H.
sent one of the men about the prison to repair it. His
name was Nelson, and to distinguish him from the other
Nelson Mrs. Johnson always called him “old.”</p>
          <p>“What did you do before you came to this
prison?” asked Mrs. Johnson of him one day.</p>
          <p>“I was a butcher,” he replied.</p>
          <p>“So I judged from your manner of plastering,” she
answered. “Why didn't you stick to your trade?”</p>
          <p>“I had rather come here,” he replied.</p>
          <p>“Well, you will have to go back to it soon, for this
prison is going to be broken up. The Government is
afraid we ladies will suffer in health this summer, 
and is therefore going to send us to
<pb id="lenox202" n="202"/>
Massachusetts, where the climate is cooler, paying all
expenses.”</p>
          <p>“That may be,” said Mrs. James; “but honey, you
may 'pend upon it, there's mighty little hard labor the
Massachusetts penitentiary will get out of me.”</p>
          <p>“Now, see here, old Nelson,” said Mrs. Johnson,
“you have not plastered this close; if it is not done
better, I'll escape as sure as you are born, and then 
you will certainly be hung,” and she made the man 
return and go all over the place again, which he did 
very reluctantly.</p>
          <p>The following day Mrs. Johnson said to me,</p>
          <p>“I tell you what it is, I cannot bear to see that poor
little baby suffering so for clothes, and I intend to 
make her some.”</p>
          <p>“Where are you going to get the material?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Wait and you will soon see.” She left me, and
going up-stairs, in a short time returned with her arms
full of white cotton, pieces of ticking, flannel, and
calico.</p>
          <pb id="lenox203" n="203"/>
          <p>“Where did you get them?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“Out of the Quartermaster's stores,” she replied.</p>
          <p>“But you are not going to cut them up?” I inquired.</p>
          <p>“Indeed I am, then;” and sure enough she did, and
being very expert with her needle, soon manufactured
quite a number of articles, which she carried to Mrs.
Jones, for the baby. The poor mother's eyes sparkled
when she saw the clothing, and she exclaimed,</p>
          <p>“Oh, Mrs. Johnson, where did you get these things
from?”</p>
          <p>“I found them among some articles I had packed
away,” answered Mrs. Johnson, nodding at us not to
betray her. In a short time the child was nicely 
dressed at Government expense. Nor did Mrs. Johnson's
kindness stop here, but having discovered a pile of 
new blankets in the store, she proceeded to change all 
the old ones on the beds, replacing them with new. 
Every day or two she would make a visit to the 
Quartermaster's 
<pb id="lenox204" n="204"/>
store, and return with some article 
which she did not hesitate to appropriate to her own 
use, or that of any one who needed it, cutting the 
material to suit. If H. knew of these transactions 
he kept silent, and that he did know, at least in 
part, I could hardly doubt. Perhaps he thought it 
was better <hi rend="italics">that</hi>, than planning escapes.</p>
          <p>The knob on Mrs. Johnson's door had by some means 
become out of order, so that it was impossible to
keep the door shut. She had several times requested
that the lock might be mended, but no notice was 
taken of the matter. One day, being out of patience, 
she said, “I will make them fix this door yet,” and 
entering her room I heard her shut the door and turn 
the key. In a few moments H. made his appearance in 
the passage and tried to open the door. He knocked, 
but there was no answer—Mrs. Johnson singing
Dixie, as if unconscious of H.'s summons.</p>
          <p>“Open the door,” cried H. No reply from within, save 
Dixie, which waxed louder and 
<pb id="lenox205" n="205"/>
louder as
H.'s knocks, and at length kicks, increased in
violence.</p>
          <p>
“D--- it, why don't you open the door?” and
accompanying the interrogation with a kick, the 
door flew open. Mrs. Johnson merely glanced over her
shoulder at the intruder, and continued her work, still
singing Dixie. H. strode into the room, and standing
before Mrs. Johnson, asked, “Why did you not open the
door?”</p>
          <p>“Because I was busy.”</p>
          <p>“What made you lock it?”</p>
          <p>“Because it would not stay shut; I have asked several 
times to have the lock fixed, but could not get it
done. As I was tired of having the cold wind blowing
on me, I locked the door. But was that you knocking?”</p>
          <p>“Yes; you know it was.”</p>
          <p>“Well, I<hi rend="italics"> thought</hi> I heard some one.”</p>
          <p>After that the door was mended, much to Mrs. Johnson's
satisfaction.</p>

          <p>AND now the female prisoners, on taking the oath
of allegiance, were allowed to depart, with the exception
of Mrs. Johnson, my cousins, and myself. Mary L. and
Anna Surratt were also detained as witnesses on the
trial, for which great preparations were being made.
Mary, since Mrs. Surratt's removal, was allowed to remain
up-stairs with Anna. <sic>when</sic> the trial began, those two 
also were released. Mrs. Johnson had been retained longer than
the others, in consequence of objecting to take the oath of
allegiance, she crying and declaring it was impossible
for her to swear allegiance to the Federal Government.
<pb id="lenox207" n="207"/>
But the time had come when it was either the oath or 
imprisonment for life, and she wisely decided in favor 
of the former.</p>
          <p>As H. appeared with the Bible, all her aversion to
the act returned in full vigor. An Irishman, an old
soldier, was standing beside H. when he was talking to
Mrs. Johnson about the oath. The soldier's countenance 
expressed great pity, and at length he stepped up to 
Mrs. Johnson, and laying his hand on her shoulder, said:</p>
          <p>“Now, honey, I know it goes hard wid ye's; but it
will soon be over, so dry your eyes and take it, there's
a good soul, like a darlint.”</p>
          <p>Of course the matter ended by Mrs. Johnson's becoming a 
loyal citizen, but <hi rend="italics">not</hi> like a “darlint.”</p>
          <p>As showing how strict was the espionage exercised, I 
will mention an incident that occurred. A Southern 
gentleman, a friend of Mr. Windsor's, but who was a 
stranger in Washington, asked, on his release, permission 
of H. to obtain from Mr. Windsor a letter of introduction 
to a gentleman in Washington. H. readily
<pb id="lenox208" n="208"/>
granted the favor, and Mr. Windsor wrote the desired
letter and gave it to his friend. One of the servants was
passing the door at the time and saw the whole affair.
Some time after, Mrs. Windsor incurred the woman's
displeasure, and in her anger she said: “You think I did
not see Mr. Windsor give that letter, but I did, and told
all about it to Mr. H., and I have told many things
besides, for I have watched you all the time you have
been here.”</p>
          <p>These servants were constantly passing and repassing on 
some pretext, and I doubt not that every occurrence was 
duly reported to the authorities, and in that manner H.
discovered many little plans just in time to thwart them.</p>
          <p>I had been feeling dull and badly for several days,
and had fever at night, which gradually wore off toward
morning, leaving me weak and languid. Nelson I suppose 
must have noticed at morning inspection how sick I was, 
for I remember he looked at me more earnestly than usual. 
I went to my cousin's room, but the exertion of
<pb id="lenox209" n="209"/>
ascending the steep steps fatigued me so much that I
had to lie on her bed. She saw directly that I was sick,
and Mrs. Johnson made me a nice cup of tea, after
drinking which I felt better. By night, my fever had 
increased so much that my cousin was afraid for me to 
return to my room, as I was now delirious. H. was away, 
but she sent for Nelson, and after informing him of 
my condition, asked if Mr. Windsor might be removed to 
an adjoining room and I allowed to remain with her for 
the night. Seeing that I was really ill, he consented. 
Mrs. Johnson brought down some blankets from the 
Quartermaster's store, and with them they endeavored 
to close the space intended for a window. It was 
impossible to exclude all the air, and my bed being 
just beneath, I had the wind and rain on me all night, 
which brought on a cold so violent that I could 
not speak.</p>
          <p>The next day, sick as I was, I had to sit in Mrs.
Johnson's room while the one we occupied was being
whitewashed, and then I returned to it;
<pb id="lenox210" n="210"/>
the walls were of course wet. My cousin had a fire
made in the little stove, but the room was not dry 
even at night, and a pouring rain added much to our
discomfort.</p>
          <p>I have very little recollection of the remainder of the
day, as I was delirious. After several days had 
elapsed, H. came to the door and said,</p>
          <p>“Now, miss, if you can manage to get up and come with 
me, you will be released.”</p>
          <p>Remembering poor Mrs. Surratt, I answered,</p>
          <p>“Oh, no, indeed I cannot go with you, Mr. H.; <hi rend="italics">indeed</hi> 
I cannot.”</p>
          <p>“But I tell you I am going to take you to your
friends; they are at the door now in a carriage.”</p>
          <p>“I will not go anywhere in a carriage—I'm afraid.”</p>
          <p>“You are not afraid of <hi rend="italics">me</hi>?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, I am; you are a detective, and I am afraid of
every one of them.”</p>
          <p>My cousin whispered, “For Heaven's sake, don't
seem to mistrust the man.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox211" n="211"/>
          <p>Then I asked, crying the while, “Where are you
going to take me? where you took Mrs. Surratt?”</p>
          <p>“Nonsense,” he answered; “I am going to take you
to your friends, who are waiting below.”</p>
          <p>“Well, Mr. H., if you will send away that carriage,
and promise not to leave me until I see my friends, 
I will go with you.”</p>
          <p>“Very well, then, I will attend to the carriage; and
now you hurry,” saying which he left me. With my
cousin's assistance, I was soon equipped, but not 
until H. had several times made his appearance at the 
door, urging haste. I took leave of my cousin in great 
agitation, and followed H. tremblingly down the stairs, 
through the passage into the yard, and then into the 
room where I had been recorded in the huge book. Here 
I was detained for a few moments, while some formality 
was gone through—the registering of my release, 
I suppose.</p>
          <p>Opposite to where I stood was a closet, with the door 
standing open. I looked in, and there, 
<pb id="lenox212" n="212"/>
piled upon the shelves, were cakes of all kinds and
sizes, some of them fresh-looking, and others stale, 
with the iceing covered with mould, which suggested 
a green old age. I could not refrain from sighing 
as I thought of the poor prisoners, for whom they 
had been intended, and the disappointment it would 
have been to loving friends could they have known 
how unavailing had been their kindness. I thought 
of poor Mary's basket, consigned as it probably was 
to that mouse-hole. There were also various sized 
bottles, and among them, one I had brought to my 
cousin, containing some very choice wine, which 
article happened to be on the “prohibited” list, 
yet if you asked the authorities what you were
allowed to bring the prisoners, the answer always 
was, “Oh, anything you choose.”</p>
          <p>After remaining there a short time, H. turned to me
and said, “We will have to go before the Judge
Advocate, who is in the next room; he will not keep 
you; he is only going to ask you a few questions.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox213" n="213"/>
          <p>“Please do not leave me there, Mr. H.,” I pleaded.</p>
          <p>“No, I will not,” he said.</p>
          <p>We then entered the room, at the far end of which
was the Judge Advocate, at a high desk, writing. In a
moment he turned and said,</p>
          <p>“Now about that letter?”</p>
          <p>“I cannot stand up; you must let me have a seat; I
am sick and weak.”</p>
          <p>“Oh, you need not sit down; I am not going to
keep you,” he said; nevertheless H. handed me a chair,
which I gladly accepted.</p>
          <p>The Judge Advocate then searched among the papers 
before him, and taking out a letter, began to unfold it.</p>
          <p>“You didn't write this letter, did you?” he asked,
with that same satanic leer which I so well remembered.</p>
          <p>“Is it the letter you asked me about before?” said I,
without taking, or even glancing at it.</p>
          <p>“Yes,” he answered.</p>
          <pb id="lenox214" n="214"/>
          <p>I looked him full in the face for at least half a
minute, and then said,</p>
          <p>“<hi rend="italics">You know </hi>I did not write it.”</p>
          <p>“Well, well,” he returned, “you can go.”</p>
          <p>I required no second dismissal, but followed my
guide into the room where I had first seen my cousin. 
It was filled with men now, as it was then.</p>
          <p>“Your friends are in here,” said H.</p>
          <p>I looked anxiously around,—not a familiar face 
did I behold, but a man dressed in a suit of black 
clothes, with beaver hat, yellow kid gloves, and a 
little yellow cane, came toward me and said, “Come 
with me, miss, I will take you to your friends.”</p>
          <p>I followed the stranger mechanically, being conscious 
that every one in the room was staring at me in a way 
that made me feel very uncomfortable, and from which 
scrutiny I was glad to escape.  On reaching the outer 
door the stranger remarked, “I had a carriage here 
for you, but H. told me you objected to riding.”</p>
          <pb id="lenox215" n="215"/>
          <p>“Oh, yes,” I answered, “I had much rather walk.”</p>
          <p>I had a vague idea that I could escape more
certainly if I were not shut up in a carriage, for 
the presence of the stranger did not tend in any 
degree to quiet my apprehensions.</p>
          <p>“Where are you going to take me?” I asked.</p>
          <p>“To your friends,” he replied.</p>
          <p>“Where are they?”</p>
          <p>“Waiting for you at Mr. C.'s store, on the Avenue.”</p>
          <p>“Do you remember their names?”</p>
          <p>“Yes, two gentlemen,” naming them, “and a lady,
whose name I have forgotten.”</p>
          <p>Now, not one of these names was familiar to me,
and as my fears increased, I trembled so violently 
that I could hardly walk. The man seeing that I 
was very weak, said,</p>
          <p>“Had you not better take the cars?”</p>
          <p>“No,” I answered; “I had rather walk.”</p>
          <p>“Then you must take my arm.”</p>
          <p>I did so, with an ungloved hand. I had been
<pb id="lenox216" n="216"/>
so hurried that I had no time to put on my gloves, 
and my hands were as cold as ice, though it was a 
warm day.</p>
          <p>“Let us stop here, and rest a few moments,” said
the man, “and you can put on your gloves, your hands
are so cold.”</p>
          <p>I did so, and we continued our walk down the
Avenue, every one looking at me, as I had on all my
winter wrappings.</p>
          <p>“Who are you?” I asked at length.</p>
          <p>“My name is Thomas Watkins; I am a detective,
and was employed by your friends to ascertain where
you were, and if possible to procure your release.”</p>
          <p>“How came you to go to the Old Capitol?”</p>
          <p>“I thought you might be imprisoned there, and as
H. is an old friend of mine, and a kindhearted man, 
I was sure he would tell me, though it is forbidden 
to publish the arrests.”</p>
          <p>By this time I had become very much confused,
whether it was the fresh air, or the crowd
<pb id="lenox217" n="217"/>
on the street, or the fever, or all combined, 
I know not, but I could not remember where I 
was, or where I wished to go.</p>
          <p>“How much farther have we to go?” I asked, when
we had walked half the distance to the Treasury.</p>
          <p>“Only a few more squares,” he replied.</p>
          <p>So we walked on in silence until we reached a 
store, which he entered and said,</p>
          <p>“Now here are your friends.”</p>
          <p>But there was no one there, save the proprietor, 
to whom Watkins said:</p>
          <p>“Mr. C., this is the lady for whom I was looking. 
I found her in the Old Capitol, as I thought 
I should.”</p>
          <p>Mr. C. held out his hand and said, “I congratulate
you on your release; your friends have been waiting
here several hours, but despairing of seeing you 
to-day, returned home.”</p>
          <p>
“The reason I staid so long,” said Watkins,
“was that H. was out, and I had to hunt him up.
No one can do anything there without H., and
<pb id="lenox218" n="218"/>
he's hard to find. Now, miss,” said he, turning to 
me, “I will take you anywhere you wish to go.”</p>
          <p>My only idea was to get as far as possible from the
Old Capitol, and the only street I could then remember
was Seventeenth Street. “Take me, if you please,” said
I, “to Seventeenth Street.”</p>
          <p>“Why, my dear madam,” exclaimed the man, “it is a
mile and a half from here; think of some other place.” 
I did endeavor to do so, but the only other street which
suggested itself was Louisiana Avenue.</p>
          <p>“I wish to go to Louisiana Avenue,” I said.</p>
          <p>“We are on that now,” answered the man. “Now to
which house shall I take you?”</p>
          <p>Alas! my powers of memory failed me utterly, and I
could not recall either the situation of the house
I desired to find, or the name of the friends with 
whom I had been staying. Twice we walked the length 
of the street, without my being able to remember.</p>
          <pb id="lenox219" n="219"/>
          <p>Then the man said, “Do you live in Washington?”</p>
          <p>“No,” I answered, “in Baltimore.”</p>
          <p>“Are you going back there?” he asked.</p>
          <p>“Yes,” I said, “this afternoon.”</p>
          <p>“Then I tell you what to do. I live very near the
depot—go home with me, and my wife will make 
you a nice cup of coffee, and I will put you on 
the cars at the right time.”</p>
          <p>“No,” I said; “I must find my friend's house.”</p>
          <p>I was still afraid, and since he had told me he 
was a detective, I could not rid myself of the 
latent suspicion that he intended to entrap me 
in some way. I had a mistrust of the whole genus 
to which Mr. Watkins belonged. The poor man was 
evidently as much bewildered and perplexed as I 
myself was, and in order, I suppose, to gain some 
clew as to who my friends were, he asked me the 
following questions:</p>
          <p>“Is the gentleman whose house you are trying to
find, a relation of yours?”</p>
          <pb id="lenox220" n="220"/>
          <p>“No,” I said.</p>
          <p>“Are you sure it is some one who lives in this 
city?”</p>
          <p>“Yes; I am certain.”</p>
          <p>“Does Mr. Windsor know him?”</p>
          <p>“Yes.”</p>
          <p>“Is he related to Mr. Windsor?”</p>
          <p>“Oh yes, I remember now; he is Mr. Windsor's
brother-in-law.”</p>
          <p>“Well, now,” he said, speaking more to himself
than to me, “I wonder if it can be lawyer Smith?”</p>
          <p>“The very man,” I exclaimed joyfully.</p>
          <p>“Why, I know him <hi rend="italics">well</hi>,” said Watkins; “he attends
to all my law business for me; but bless your 
heart, <hi rend="italics">he</hi> does not live in Louisiana Avenue or 
near it; his house is in Seventh Street, not very 
far from the Post Office.” </p>
          <p>“That is the place,” I replied, “ I remember it now
perfectly.”</p>
          <p>We walked to Seventh Street as soon as possible,
the idea of meeting with friends imparting
<pb id="lenox221" n="221"/>
strength to my wearied limbs. As I saw before me Mr.
Smith's house, my confidence in Watkins revived, and
if ever I was grateful to a human being, I was to him. 
I asked again his name, which I had forgotten, and 
also his residence, which be gave me written on a 
card. On taking leave, he said,</p>
          <p>“Remember, if you should get in trouble again of
this kind, send for me and I will try to help you.” </p>
          <p>I thanked him very sincerely, and he left me at my
friend's door.</p>

          <head>CHAPTER XX.</head>
          <argument>
            <p>Return to Baltimore—Subsequent illness—
The “Old Capitol.”</p>
          </argument>
          <p>I was now alone, and with a sigh of relief,
seated myself on the door-steps—too wearied
even to pull the bell-handle. I suppose I 
remained there fifteen minutes at least, my head
supported on my hand, gazing in a listless way
at the throng continually passing. After I had
thus rested, I ascended the steps, rung the door-bell, and entered the
house. My friends were
delighted to see me, but very much shocked at
my appearance, for the imprisonment had told
heavily upon me, and I looked more like a 
phantom than my former self.     </p>
          <p>I did not complain of feeling badly, for fear my
friends would prevent my returning to Baltimore, 
which I had determined to do, if possible, that 
afternoon. I rested for an hour, and then
<pb id="lenox223" n="223"/>
taking the street-cars, went to the depot. Here, 
as usual, was great commotion, which sadly confused 
my aching head. I gave my pocket-book to a man 
I had never seen before, and asked him to purchase 
me a ticket for Baltimore. Fortunately the stranger 
happened to be honest, for he not only bought the 
ticket, but returned the correct change, as I 
discovered some time afterwards. I was now possessed 
of but one idea, which was, to reach home. I took my 
place in the cars utterly exhausted, and in a short 
time arrived in Baltimore.</p>
          <p>I can neither explain nor describe the feeling that
overcame me, as I stood in the dusk of evening, 
after weary weeks of imprisonment, on the threshold of
home. I had no power for some time to open the door.
Voices in the vestibule at length aroused me, and in a
few moments I was seated in the midst of family and
friends, relating my experience.</p>
          <p>The day following I was ill, and continued so for
several weeks. The physicians attributed
<pb id="lenox224" n="224"/>
my sickness entirely to the imprisonment I had
undergone, and its consequent privations. I was
suffering from a low remittent, well known in the 
Old Capitol as the “prison fever,” and which 
generally terminated in typhoid, but in my case 
was fortunately checked before assuming that form, 
leaving me as feeble as a child.</p>
          <p>My cousins were the last remaining prisoners in the
Old Capitol. For a few weeks the range of buildings
used as a prison was open for exhibition, at the
moderate charge of twenty-five cents entrance fee.
Whether this was authorized by Government, as a
means of increasing the internal revenue, I have 
never had it in my power to ascertain.  </p>
          <p>The buildings were besieged daily by crowds,
struggling and jostling each other, in their mad 
efforts to obtain a view of the rooms where so 
many pined, suffered, and not a few died—some 
a violent death, others a gradual, but not less 
certain one, from the effects of imprisonment. This 
exhibition of the prison is at last over, and the
<pb id="lenox225" n="225"/>
buildings have passed into other hands, to be used 
for other purposes.</p>
          <p>There is to me such a fascination about the place,
that I am irresistibly attracted thither, each time 
I visit Washington; but it is hard to believe the 
past a reality, as I gaze on the changed picture. 
The windows are no longer casementless and barred 
with iron; glass sparkles in the bright sunlight, 
and where hung old faded brown blankets, in a vain 
endeavor to exclude the penetrating cold and rain, 
I now behold gay and warm curtains. No soldiers 
guard the entrance, but all are free to leave or 
stay, as they may be disposed. The whitewashed 
fence is gone, and its place supplied by a handsome 
iron enclosure, through which one can see the green 
trees, and the fields beyond. All about the
establishment is neat, bright, and cheerful, and the 
Old Capitol Prison has forever passed away.</p>
          <p>No—I retract—not passed away! It lives in 
history to disgrace a nation, boasting of its 
<pb id="lenox226" n="226"/>
civilization and enlightenment. It lives in household
memories, whose home circle it has broken forever. It
lives in the daily consciousness of individuals whose
shattered health witnesses against it.</p>
          <p>No: the Old Capitol is not a myth, but a reality, and
will be for generations. The tinkling of <hi rend="italics">that</hi> bell 
which consigned so many victims, not only to prison, 
but to death, still vibrates in the ears of survivors, 
recalling the “<sic>Bastiles</sic>” of the North American
States, 
which rivalled in cruelty and injustice those of any 
other nation.</p>
          <p>
It cannot be that the American people will forever 
tolerate tyranny and oppression; but the nation,
casting aside the trammels of party politics, will yet
arise in its might, and stand before the world the
champion of right and liberty.</p>
