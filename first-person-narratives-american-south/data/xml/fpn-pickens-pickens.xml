        <p> IT IS a common story; there were 
     more than three million slaves; 
  there are perhaps ten million heirs 
  born of the slaves since 1865. What 
  reason can there be for writing a story 
  which is so common?</p>
        <p>One reason is that some want to 
  know the story, and have asked for 
  it. These several requests have been 
  prompted, perhaps, by no expectation 
  of anything wonderful in the story, but 
  by the fact that it is common and can 
  therefore stand as the representative 
  of the class. This last reason is the one 
  that <sic>emboldens</sic> me to the task. The 
  interests of a class may justify the 
  examination and description of a typical 
  specimen.</p>
        <p>I shall therefore regard myself as
  speaking to friends. I shall not aim 
<pb id="ouckensviii" n="viii"/> 
  to evaluate the thing I say, but I shall
  simply relate the incidents and leave 
  the worth of them to the judgment of 
  the audience. If I am frank, it is only 
  to be true. Such a story could have 
  no self-glory and little expectation of 
  applause.</p>

          <head rend="bold">I. MY  PARENTAGE</head>
          <p>I WAS born on the 15th day of January, 
      1881, according to the recollection 
   of my parents. There was no 
   record of the sixth child, for the sixth 
   baby in no novelty in a family. But 
   as the historian finds the dates of old
   battles by the comets and eclipses, so
   can we approximate this event by an
   impressive happening: because of the
   martyrdom of a good President I narrowly 
   escaped the honor of being named 
   <hi rend="italics">Garfield</hi> Pickens.</p>
          <p>With natural and pardonable curiosity
   people have often asked me about 
   my parentage, and if I knew anything 
   about my ancestry. My immediate 
   parents I know, and have known something
                      <pb id="pickens4" n="4"/> of one or two of my grandparents.
    But about any ancestry more remote
    than this all that I can know is that it
    seems natural and logical to conclude by
    analogy and induction that I probably 
    had some additional forbears. 
    Most of the negroes in the United 
    States who are as many as thirty years 
    old have no reliable knowledge of ancestry 
    beyond perhaps their grandparents. 
    The family tree is just sprouting or 
    just beginning to put forth shoots. 
    How the causes of this inhered in the 
    system of slavery is well known. There 
    are good and sensible reasons for keeping 
    an ancestral record of certain breeds 
    of horses, but little reason for keeping 
    that of slaves, simply because the worth 
    of a man depends less upon the value 
    and blood of his father than does the 
    price of a horse.</p>
          <p>Three-fourths of all the negroes I
    have ever seen had other blood. Sometimes
                            <pb id="pickens5" n="5"/> times it was not visible in their faces:
    the blackest man may have a mulatto
    grandmother on his mother's side. 
    And your average brown negro  -  if all 
    the different sorts of blood in his veins
    should get at war with each other, the
    man would blow up like a stick of
    dynamite.</p>
          <p>My father in color and hair is African
    although his features are not prominently 
    African, and I knew one of his 
    sisters who was brown. My mother's
    mother, who lived long in our family 
    and “raised” all of the grandchildren, 
    was a characteristic little African woman,
    vivacious and <sic>longlived</sic>, with a 
    small head and keen eyes. She could 
    thread her own needles when she was 
    eighty years of age. She lived for 
    forty years with a broken back, the 
    upper part of her body being carried 
    in a horizontal position, at right angles 
    to her lower limbs, so that she must 
                          <pb id="pickens6" n="6"/>   support her steps with a staff if she
    walked far. This was one of the results 
    of slavery. Being a high-tempered 
    house-servant in that system she had 
    been beaten and struck across the back 
    with a stick. Even in her old age her 
    temper rose quick, but was volatile, and 
    she was a very dear and most helpful
    grandmother. My mother's father, 
    whom I never saw, and who perhaps 
    died a slave, was half Cherokee Indian, 
    his father being a Cherokee. I suppose 
    that his other half was negro, since he 
    was married in slavery to my grandmother.</p>
          <p>My mother was an average-sized
    brown woman, whose features were
    somewhat modified by her Indian strain
    and whose hair was black and of a 
    negro-Indian texture. She was simply 
    famous for the amount of hard work 
    she could do. As a cook she could get 
    a breakfast in the shortest possible 
                            <pb id="pickens7" n="7"/>    
    time; as a washerwoman she could put
    out the clothes of a large family by
    noon. And her work must have been 
    well done, for she could never supply the
    demand for her services, and she died of
    overwork at the age of about forty-five. 
    I was the sixth of her ten children.</p>
          <p>My birthplace was in Anderson
    County, South Carolina, near Pendleton,
    in a rural neighborhood called 
    “over the river,” where lies the first 
    dim, flickering memory of the humble 
    estate to which I was born. My parents 
    were farmers of the tenant or 
    day-labor class and were ever on the 
    move from cabin to cabin, with the 
    proverbial <sic>unacquisitiveness</sic> of the 
    “rolling stone.”  They were illiterate, 
    but were beginning to learn to read the 
    large-print New Testament sold by the 
    book agents. That part of the state 
    was exceedingly poor, with red hills 
                          <pb id="pickens8" n="8"/>     and antiquated agriculture. From such
    sections of the old South the immigration 
    agent of the West easily induced 
    many negroes to cross the Mississippi 
    into debt-slavery. My parents were 
    industrious but improvident, and began 
    early to talk of moving to Arkansas 
    where the soil was fertile and wages 
    high. This was possible only by allowing 
    some Western farmer to pay the 
    fares of the family through his agent, 
    and by signing a contract to work
    on that farmer's land until the debt 
    was paid according to that farmer's
    reckoning.</p>
          <p> The earliest family moving which 
    I remember was from “over the river” 
    to “Price's place,” which makes my
    memory reach back to my second year.
    At “Price's” there was our one-room
    cabin on a small hill facing the larger
    hill on which stood the “great house” 
    of the landowner. I remember the 
                         <pb id="pickens9" n="9"/> curiosity of our first clock, an “eight-day”
    specimen, which my father immediately
    took to pieces and put together 
    again; and he still boasts that 
    his clock has never been to the repair 
    shop. Here, too, I received the first 
    impression of my personal appearance. 
    I had a large head, for a certain comical 
    minded uncle would play frightened 
    whenever I came near him, and he 
    dubbed that part of my anatomy “a 
    wag'n-body.”</p>
          <p>After a year or so we moved from
    “Price's” to “Clark's place,” nearer
    Pendleton. Here I received my first
    slight acquaintance with the English
    alphabet, which I learned so readily 
    that my sisters took delight in leading 
    me to school with them, although I 
    must have been at least two years 
    under school age. It was a characteristic 
    negro schoolhouse built of logs, 
    with one door and one window, the
                <pb id="pickens10" n="10"/>  
    latter having no panes and being closed
    by a board shutter which swung on
    leather hinges outward. The house
    was not larger then a comfortable bedroom 
    and had a “fire-place” opposite
    the door. The children faced the fireplace, 
    so that the scant light fell
    through the door upon their books.
    There were no desks; the seats were
    long board benches with no backs.
    The teacher insisted that the students
    sit in statuesque postures, not moving
    a limb too often. Persuasion to study
    and good deportment consisted of a
    hickory switch, a cone-shaped paper
    “dunce cap” and a stool on which the
    offender must stand on one foot for an
    enormous length of time. Although I
    had readily learned my elements under
    sympathetic tutelage at home, about
    all I remember of this first schooling
    is the menacing words of the teacher,
    the movements of that switch and the
                             <pb id="pickens11" n="11"/>  
    astonishing balancing acts of the dunce
    cap wearers. The chief fountain of
    academic knowledge in such schools
    was the famous old “blue-back speller.”
    After leaving the nonsense syllables in
    the beginning of that book, the milestones 
    of attainment were first the
    page of dissyllables beginning with
    “baker” and secondly the page of polysyllables 
    containing “compressibility.” 
    A person interested in your advancement 
    might ask first had you “got to 
    ‘baker’ yet,” and secondly could you 
    spell “compressibility.”</p>
          <p>After a year at “Clark's place” we
    moved to Pendleton, and from that 
    time till I reached the age of eighteen 
    I can count no less than twenty 
    removals of our family.</p>
          <p>The motives that carried my mother
    and father from the country into the
    little town of Pendleton were more 
    than good; they were sacred. It was 
                           <pb id="pickens12" n="12"/>    
    a consideration for the future of their
    children. Having lived nearer town
    for a year, they learned that the houses,
    the wages and the schools of the village
    were superior to those of the country.
    The country school was poorly housed
    and still more poorly taught. Its sessions 
    lasted for only a few hot weeks of
    summer after the “laying by” of the
    crops, and for a few cold weeks of
    winter between the last of harvest and
    the time for clearing the fields. School
    interests were secondary to farm interests; 
    the raising of children must not
    interfere with the raising of cotton.
    The landowner would not tolerate a
    tenant who put his children to school
    in the farming seasons. In the town,
    my mother had cooked and washed,
    in the country she had been a field
    hand. A cook has somewhat better
    opportunities to care for small children;
    there was a story of how Mother,
                   <pb id="pickens13" n="13"/>   returning from field work to the railfence 
    where she had laid the baby to
    sleep, found a great snake crawling over
    the child. In the country my father
    worked while another man reckoned.</p>
          <p>It always took the whole of what was
    earned to pay for the scant “rations” 
    that were advanced to the family, and 
    at settlement time there would be a 
    margin of debt to keep the family perennially
    bound to a virtual owner. A 
    man in town who ran a bar and hotel, 
    and who needed help, offered to pay 
    this margin of debt and bring the whole 
    family to town if Father would be his 
    man of all work and Mother a cook. 
    Wages were small but paid promptly, 
    and there was no binding debt. 
    They went, as one instinctively moves from 
    a greater toward a lesser pain. There 
    was one certain advantage; the children 
    obtained six months instead of 
    six weeks of schooling.</p>
          <pb id="pickens14" n="14"/>
          <p>My parents were always faithful
    members of the Baptist church, and 
    even while my father was hotel man 
    and “bartender,” he was superintendent 
    of the Sunday school of his village 
    church. Had he been keeping bar for 
    himself he would have been excommunicated 
    by his brethren. An inevitable, 
    but not inalterable, dual moral system 
    has grown up in the inter-racial life of 
    the South; a negro may be tolerated 
    by his own race in doing for a white 
    man what would not meet with toleration 
    if done for himself; and a white 
    man may be excused by his own race 
    if he does to a negro what would be 
    instantaneously condemned if done to 
    a white man.</p>
          <p>Twenty odd years ago Pendleton 
    was a characteristic little town of the 
    older South. There was the central 
    public “square” on one side of which 
    stood the “calaboose” and on the 
                        <pb id="pickens15" n="15"/>   opposite side the post office. It was
    full of politics and whisky, but withal
    there was extraordinary good feeling
    between the white and the black race.
    The employer of my father was the
    head man of the village, whom the
    people called “town councilor,” a position 
    corresponding to the mayoralty in
    larger towns. This man was a boon
    companion of my father, and they ran
    the town together. Race antagonism
    seemed not to touch our world. I can
    remember many things which indicate
    that race feeling was not nearly as combustible 
    in Pendleton then as it is in
    most places now. For example, on
    Christmas Day the black folk used to
    say that “there is no law for Christmas.”
    And so the young negro men, in a good
    natured spree, would catch the lone
    policeman, who was always more a joke
    than a terror, and lock him in the calaboose 
    to stay a part of Christmas Day,
                            <pb id="pickens16" n="16"/>   while one of the black men with star and
    club would strut about the town and 
    play officer  -  an act for laughter then, 
    but which now would summon the militia
    from the four quarters of almost 
    any state and be heralded the world 
    over as ugly insurrection.</p>
          <p>For some reason at this period wages
    were steadily declining in the older
    states of the South. In 1887 the wage 
    for doing a day's work or picking a 
    hundred pounds of cotton in the fields 
    was thirty-five or forty cents. The 
    Western immigration agent was busy  
    telling of glorious opportunities beyond 
    the Mississippi, and many minds among
    black people were being turned in that
    direction. After several years of village
    life, and after engaging in various
    employments, including another year 
    of farming, we moved to Seneca, S. C.
    Father had been in turn farmer, hotel 
<pb id="pickens17" n="17"/>
    man, section hand, brakeman and
    fireman.</p>
          <p>In these awakening years, when the
    mind is supposed to receive so much, 
    I had about two short terms of schooling
    so poor that in New England it 
    would not be called schooling at all. 
    My mother's constant talk and ambition 
    was to get an opportunity “to 
    school the children.”  One of the 
    chief causes of the rapid advancement 
    of the negro race since the Civil War 
    has been the ambition of emancipated 
    black mothers for the education of 
    their children. Many an educated 
    negro owes his enlightenment to the 
    toil and sweat of a mother.</p>
          <p>But “hard times” and the immigration
    agent were fast persuading my 
    father to risk the future of his family in 
    the malarial swamp-lands of Arkansas.</p>

          <head>II. TO ARKANSAS</head>
          <p>AT last an agent representing a 
        planter in the Mississippi River 
    Valley of Arkansas induced my father to
    sign a contract to move his entire family 
    to that state. In order to appreciate the 
    persuasions which the agent used, the 
    ignorance and superstition of such families
    would have to be understood.
    Ignorant people are too quick to believe 
    tales of other places and other times. 
    Our family had a hundred “signs,” 
    mostly signs of evil. By the ruddy 
    glow of the fire at nights the children 
    were told of ghosts, of strange cats, 
    dogs, voices and sounds, of the “no-headed 
    man,” of graveyards, and the 
    weird history of the ill-famed “three-mile 
    bottom” near the village. The 
    Federal soldiers were described not as 
           <pb id="pickens22" n="22"/>common men, but as beings from a
    super-world; and with the irony of truth
    Lincoln was pictured as more than
    mortal.</p>
          <p>To such a group reports from the
    outside world come with a feeling of
    <sic>otherworldliness</sic>. The agent said that
    Arkansas was a tropical country of 
    soft and balmy air, where cocoanuts, 
    oranges, lemons and bananas grew. 
    Ordinary things like corn and cotton, 
    with little cultivation, grew an 
    enormous yield.</p>
          <p>On the 15th of January, 1888, the
    agent made all the arrangements, purchased 
    tickets, and we boarded the
    train in Seneca, S. C., bound toward
    Atlanta, Ga. Our route lay through
    Birmingham and Memphis, and at each
    change of trains there seemed to be
    some representative of the scheme to
    see us properly forwarded, like so much
    freight billed for we knew not where.
    <pb id="pickens23" n="23"/>   
    It was midwinter, but with all the
    unquestioning faith and good cheer of
    our race we expected to land at the
    other end of our journey in bright sunshine 
    and spring weather.</p>
          <p>And a comical-looking lot we must
    have been. We had no traveling cases,
    but each one bore some curious burden
      -  sacks of clothes, quilts, bags, bundles
    and baskets. When we left our home the
    weather was comparatively mild, 
    but as fate would have it, the nearer we 
    got to Arkansas, the colder it became. 
    In Memphis the snow was deep and the
    wind biting. The faith and enthusiasm 
    of the party grew less; perhaps the 
    older heads were waking up to a suspicion. 
    The further we got from our 
    South Carolina home, the dearer it 
    seemed, as is true of most things in their 
    first abandonment.</p>
          <p>When we reached a small station in
    Arkansas, like freight again we were
       <pb id="pickens24" n="24"/>  met by two double-team wagons of the
    unknown planter to whom we were consigned. 
    We were hauled many miles
    through cypress “brakes” and snow 
    and ice sufficiently thick to support the
    teams. The older people, I suppose, 
    had by this time comprehended the 
    situation, but we children were constantly 
    peering out from under our 
    quilts and coverings, trying to discover 
    a cocoanut or an orange blossom, while 
    the drivers swore at the mules for slipping 
    on the solid ice. Perhaps nothing 
    could equal this disappointment unless 
    it be the chagrin of those ignorant 
    negroes who have been induced to go to 
    Africa under the persuasion that bread 
    trees grew there right on the brink of 
    molasses ponds, and wild hogs with 
    knives and forks sticking in their backs 
    trotted around ready baked!</p>
          <p>When we reached the estate of our
    consignee, still like freight we were
              <pb id="pickens25" n="25"/>   stored away, bags, bundles, boxes and 
    all of us, in a one-room hut to await the
    breaking of winter and the beginning 
    of field work.</p>
          <p> What could we do? The planter had 
    the contract binding us hard and fast. 
    Just what we owed for transportation 
    no one knew; besides we had been 
    furnished with salt meat, meal and 
    molasses for the first weeks of enforced 
    idleness, and we were supplied with a 
    little better food, including sugar, coffee 
    and flour, when field work began. As 
    in the case of any property on which 
    one has a lease, our lessor could lay 
    out more on our maintenance in the 
    seasons  when we were bringing returns.</p>
          <p>When the first year's settlement came
    around, and a half hundred bales of
    cotton had been produced by the family
    and sold by the planter, Father came
    home with sad, far-away eyes, having
    been told that we were deeper in debt
<pb id="pickens26" n="26"/>  than on the day of our arrival. And 
    who could deny it? The white man 
    did all the reckoning. The negro did 
    all the work. The negro can be robbed 
    of everything but his humor, and in 
    the bottom lands of Arkansas he has 
    made a rhyme. He says that on settlement 
    day the landowner sits down, 
    takes up his pen and reckons thus:</p>
          <lg type="poem">
            <l>“A nought's a nought, and a figger's a figger  -  </l>
            <l>All fer de white man  -  none fer de nigger!”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>But we were not long depressed. To
    keep down debts in the ensuing winter
    Mother cooked and washed and Father
    felled trees in the icy “brakes” to make
    rails and boards. No provisions were
    drawn from the planter. The old debt
    remained, of course, and perhaps took
    advantage of this quiet period to grow
    usuriously. This low land is malarial,
    chills and fevers returning like the seasons. 
    Our medicine and physician, too, 
   <pb id="pickens27" n="27"/>   had to be secured on the feudal plan, 
    the planter paying the bills. Under 
    such a system the physician has the 
    greatest possible temptation to neglect 
    the patient; his pay is sure, and there 
    is no competition. The spring sickness 
    was miserable; we had come from 
    an elevated, healthy country, and our
    constitutions fell easy prey to the germs
    of the lowlands.</p>
          <p>For the first year the children were
    kept out of school in hope of getting 
    rid of the debt. Very small children 
    can be used to hoe and pick cotton, 
    and I have seen my older sisters drive 
    a plow. The next year we attended 
    the short midsummer and midwinter 
    sessions of the plantation school. The 
    school was dominated by the interests 
    of the planter; when the children 
    were needed in the fields he simply commanded
    the school to close. It was an 
    old-fashioned district school, where the 
<pb id="pickens28" n="28"/>  
    spelling classes stood in line with recognized 
    “head” and “foot.” Your ability
    to spell was denoted by your position 
    in the line relative to the “head” and 
    the “foot.” When your neighbor 
    toward the head missed a word and 
    you spelled it, you “turned him down” 
    with all others who had missed that 
    word in succession, that is, you took 
    your position above them. If you were 
    absent from a class, when you returned, 
    whatever had been your position in the 
    line, you had to “go foot.” I had a
    sister a year or so older than I, who 
    stood “head” about all of the time, 
    while I stood second; and we used to 
    stay home a day for the exquisite pleasure 
    of going foot and turning the whole 
    class down. This sister had a phenomenal 
    memory when a child.</p>
          <p>The second year the whole family
    plunged into work, and made a bigger
    and better crop. But at reckoning 
<pb id="pickens29" n="29"/>  time history repeated itself; there was
    still enough debt to continue the slavery.
    If the debt could not be paid in 
    fat years,  there was the constant danger 
    that lean years would come and make 
    it bigger. But there was the contract 
      -  and the law; and the law would not 
    hunt the equity, but would enforce 
    the letter of the contract. It was understood 
    that the negro was unreliable, 
    and the courts must help the poor 
    planters.</p>
          <p>There was but one recourse  -  the way 
    of escape. The attempt must be executed
    with success, or there might be 
    fine and peonage. On some pretext 
    my father excused himself and went 
    to Little Rock. A few miles out of 
    that city he found a landowner who 
    would advance the fares for the family 
    and rent to us a small farm. This 
    looks at first sight like “jumping from 
    the frying-pan into the fire,” but a
<pb id="pickens30" n="30"/>  
    rented farm with a definite loan is a
    different proposition from a state of
    debt-slavery, where the creditor sells 
    all the produce and does all the counting.
    Moreover, when a condition is 
    about as bad as it can be, there is a 
    tendency in human nature to move on 
    to another bad condition with a sort of 
    desperate venture. Human nature will 
    flee from a known condition that is very 
    bad to an unknown condition that 
    might be worse, in spite of Lord Hamlet's 
    soliloquy. And so one night the 
    young children and some goods were 
    piled into a wagon and the adults went 
    afoot. By morning we were in the 
    town of Augusta, twelve or fifteen miles 
    away, where we caught the first train.</p>
          <p>I have one very pleasant recollection
    of the place from which we had escaped.
    An aged negro, a characteristic Uncle
    Remus, would come some nights and
    relate to us quaint animal stories. The
<pb id="pickens31" n="31"/>   
    antics and cleverness of “Bre'r Rabbit
    Bre'r Bar, Bre'r Fox, Sis' Cow and 
    Bre'r Tommy Mud Turtle” did much 
    to enliven the dullness of the hours.</p>
        </div2>
        <pb id="pickens35" n="35"/>
        <div2>
          <head>III.  BEGINNING SCHOOL IN EARNEST</head>
          <p>THE desperate move to Galloway, in
        the neighborhood of Little Rock,
    was by no means an unlucky one. For
    one whole year, of course, we children
    were kept out of school to clear up the
    new debt. The debt was paid. Meanwhile 
    my mother heard that in the
    city of Little Rock and in the town
    Argenta, across the river from Little
    Rock, there were nine months' term
    of school. Think of it! Nine months
    of schooling for the children.</p>
          <p>We moved to Argenta in the winter
    of 1890-91. This move cityward was
    not prompted, as is usually charged
    in such cases, by any desire to get
    away from work, but by the high motives 
    of education and the future. The
         <pb id="pickens36" n="36"/> prospect struck me with so much force
    that I set to work and learned to write
    before I could be sent to school. I
    could not enter at once  -  work had
    to be done and means gotten so that
    we could start in the fall of 1891. All
    members of the family worked ceaselessly, 
    about the homes in the city and
    on the farms near the city. While running 
    errands and making fires at a certain 
    hotel I saw and recognized the
    face of a quack doctor, a man with long
    hair, who had once come through the
    bottom lands from which we had escaped 
    and had frightened my mother
    out of all her ready cash for his cure-all
    medicines by telling her that I had
    consumption. Mentioning the incident
    to him, “Are you the man?” asked I,
    with boyish frankness. And he, with
    quack-doctor frankness, replied, “That
    depends, my boy, upon whether the
    medicine helped or hurt you, and upon
<pb id="pickens37" n="37"/>   whether you would like to buy some
    more.”</p>
          <p>The Argenta schools opened in September. 
    We could not attend regularly
    in the weeks that preceded Christmas,
    for we were at work picking cotton
    in the neighboring fields. It took the
    energies of the whole family to get a
    start. My attendance before Christmas 
    was for only a few scattering days.
    After Christmas, however, I started in
    school not to miss another day during
    that school year  -  not to miss another
    day for the next seven years' school
    years  -  and indeed not to miss another
    unnecessary day until I had finished at
    Yale in 1904.</p>
          <p>This was my real start in school,
    and I was now nearly eleven years old.
    As a peaceful country boy I was at first
    imposed upon, but one fine day I laid
    aside my unwarlike habits and became
    sufficiently belligerent to win the respect
<pb id="pickens38" n="38"/>
    of a certain class of my fellows. I
    had to fight my way on the playground
    as well as in the classroom, and at the
    same time I had to render my accounts
    and make my peace with the stern
    government of a teacher who was a
    fine instructor and a severe disciplinarian  -  
    just the proper governor for
    such a rebellious little state as a city
    public school. I remember how at the
    end of that school year he called me
    out, with his brows lowering as if a
    storm was going to break, and sternly
    commanded me to take my seat on the
    bench in front of his desk  -  the well
    known judgment seat where many a
    little sinner had been called to a sure,
    even if a reluctant, repentance. I
    began mentally to review my day's
    record in order to anticipate the accusation, 
    when he with the same sternness
    of voice began to pronounce, “This
    boy”  -  then hesitating and transfixing
    <pb id="pickens39" n="39"/> 
    me with his terrible eye  -  “entered
    school three months late, started behind 
    everybody else, and now he's the
    leader of his class!”</p>
          <p>This teacher's name was J. S. Pleasant, 
    and although he was very strict,
    the name is not at all inapplicable to
    his general character. He was my
    teacher for the following four years.
    Very often when the teacher had passed
    a question or a problem around to all
    the rest of the class and they had failed
    to answer or to solve it, he would say,
    “Well, ‘Always Ready’ will take it”  -  
    which was a nickname he sometimes
    applied to me.</p>
          <p>In a personal history I might be
    expected to tell about my school career
    and record. In mathematics I never
    received less than 100 per cent. as a
    daily average, and only once did I
    make less than 100 per cent. on an
    examination in that subject. I state
   <pb id="pickens40" n="40"/>
    this fact because so many men and
    women of the white race have asked
    me particularly how I fared in the subject 
    of mathematics.</p>
          <p> I committed my lessons to memory.
    The lessons in physiology and history
    I learned verbatim every day, so that
    I could repeat them, just as they were
    written, with as much ease as I can say
    the Lord's Prayer. When I reached
    the high school we had a large book
    known as “Barnes's General History.”
    The lessons were from five to ten pages,
    and I had acquired the ability to commit 
    them by reading them three times
    over. This I did every day. The
    history teacher at the end of the year
    who, after having me stand and recite
    the last lesson verbatim, said, “I never
    believed that he would go through this
    whole book in that way.” For the last
    few minutes of each recitation during
    the year she had asked me to rise and
      <pb id="pickens41" n="41"/>  
    go through the whole lesson, as in
    declamation. She would then question 
    me, evidently to see if I knew the
    <hi rend="italics">parts</hi> as well as the <hi rend="italics">whole</hi>. Any question 
    in the lesson would be answered;
    I had not learned by sound merely.</p>
          <p>I was deeply in love with school and
    study. Very often I reached the schoolhouse 
    before the janitor arrived. From
    the nickels and dimes which I received 
    for errands and small jobs I
    would save sufficient money to buy
    my books. When I was attending
    the grammar school my mother endeavored 
    one day to keep me at home to
    draw water for the washing. She never
    tried it again  -  I cried and pleaded
    as if my heart would burst. The prospect 
    of missing my classes for a day
    seemed to me absolutely unbearable. It
    seemed that it would tear down all that I
    had <sic>builded</sic>. My mother seized a switch
    to <sic>chastize</sic> me, but when she listened
<pb id="pickens42" n="42"/>  
    to my words and looked into my face
    she saw that it was not rebellion, and
    with a rather satisfied laugh she said
    that I might go, if I was that “crazy”
    about school. I can see now that she
    was rather proud of the event, for
    never again did she make any arrangement 
    that would keep me out of school
    for a day. The whole family came to
    regard my attendance at school as a
    foregone conclusion. The children
    called me “old man,” because I would
    not play until after I had learned my
    lessons. These were almost invariably
    learned before sundown. At the end
    of that very year I received from the
    teacher a prize for being “never absent,
    never tardy.” It was a book entitled
    “Our Manners and Social Customs,”
    and it was the first book outside of a
    school text that I had ever read.</p>
          <p> The opportunity which a mother's
    pride created for my schooling during
<pb id="pickens43" n="43"/>    
    her life could not continue after her
    death. She died of overwork and consequent 
    broken health. She had been
    determined to keep her children in
    school and had worked from early
    morning till late at night to that end.
    We seldom waked early enough to
    catch a glimpse of her, and before her
    return at night sleep had weighed down
    the eyelids of the younger children.</p>
          <p>I had just entered upon my fourth
    year in the city school when my mother
    died in October. Imagine, if you can,
    the sorrow and confusion, amounting
    almost to dismay, that filled the heart
    and mind of a boy of thirteen, who was
    ambitious and who knew that his
    mother was the mainstay of his education 
    and his future  -  a boy who loved
    school as dearly as any other boy ever
    loved a gun or a motor-cycle. I knew
    what my mother had meant to the
    family and that without her it would
<pb id="pickens44" n="44"/>   
    be impossible for my father to keep
    all the children in school. It was her
    love and ambition, I knew, that had
    given me the high privilege of study,
    and without her I could not be certain
    of my daily bread for the school year
    on which we had just entered.</p>
          <p>But the ways of Providence are
    inscrutable, and this confusion and predicament 
    thrust upon me a blessing. I
    secured a place to earn my board by
    rising at four o'clock in the morning
    and also working after school hours
    until seven o'clock in the evening  -  and I
    got my lessons just as well, or better
    than ever before. Out of misfortune
    and a hard situation I had to pluck
    independence.</p>
          <p>In this temporary confusion one
    thought was of more permanent help
    to me than all other things. Mother
    had taught us to believe in God, and I
    reasoned that God would not cause
<pb id="pickens45" n="45"/>  
    such a good mother to begin such a
    good work and then remove that mother
    without intending that in some other
    way that work was to go on. The
    thought led me on and on to a greater
    and greater faith in my opportunities.</p>

        <div2>
          <head>IV. A SKIFF-FERRY SCHOOL BOY</head>
          <p>IN THE following year I became a
       ferryman on the Arkansas River
    to support myself during the last year
    of the grammar school. The grammar
    school at that time completed the ninth
    year, the high school adding three
    years more.</p>
          <p>The town of Argenta, which for a
    brief space bore the appellation of
    North Little Rock, is situated, as the
    latter name implies, on the left bank
    of the Arkansas River opposite the
    City of Little Rock. In the early '90's
    Argenta was famed as one of the worst
    places in the United States; debauchery, 
    blood and murder were no uncommon 
    spectacles. The incoming traveler
    shrugged his shoulders when he heard
    the name “Argenta.”</p>
          <pb id="pickens50" n="50"/>
          <p>At that time there were only two
    railroad bridges, adapted also for foot
    and wagon passage; and all <sic>passers</sic> had
    to pay toll, the foot fare per capita being
    five cents. This condition gave rise
    to another industry, carried on chiefly
    by negro men, that of a “skiff ferry.”
    These small boats in which the boatman 
    uses two oars and sits with his
    back towards the fore, were used to
    row passengers over the Arkansas to
    and from Argenta to the foot of Main
    Street in Little Rock. The fare had
    been five cents, but under the stress
    of competition it had become by this
    time five cents for the round trip.
    There were about a dozen skiffmen
    earning each from two to three dollars
    a day. I quickly mastered all this
    ferry-craft, sometimes rowing a boat
    myself and sometimes working as a
    second oarsman, assisting one of the
    men. My average wage was about
<pb id="pickens51" n="51"/>    
    forty cents a day. When I rowed a
    boat alone I received more; when I
    rowed as an assistant my pay was at
    the mercy of the principal, and he
    paid me according to his earnings or
    his fancy. I was soon as good an oarsman 
    as any man I worked with, but I
    was only a school boy, fourteen years
    of age, and no one would think of paying 
    me a man's wages even for a man's
    work. But the pittance was saving me
    my education and my future; and boy
    although I was, I looked at the present
    circumstance in the light of the future,
    and never thought that the condition
    was too hard, but only the high price
    of a valuable possession.</p>
          <p>This river work also profited me
    physically; the use of two oars is conducive 
    to symmetry of body, and there
    is no danger of the one-sided development 
    which Ben Hur dreaded from the
    one-oar method of the Roman galley.
<pb id="pickens52" n="52"/>   
    There had been some family doubts
    about the soundness of my constitution, 
    after the hard wear in the bottom
    lands of Arkansas, but this ferry work
    remade my shoulders and chest and
    lungs. During the school year I could
    row on Saturdays, and could get a boat
    by myself on Sundays and work until
    Sunday school time and afterwards.</p>
          <p>I worked again on the ferry in the
    summer of 1896, and any ferryman was
    glad to have my services, as I was an
    able oarsman and also a hustler in
    securing passengers.</p>
          <p>During the summer of 1896 a new
    problem was before me for solution in
    reference to my education. I had
    entered the Argenta school five years
    before, knowing nothing save to read
    and spell simple words and to write in
    my self-taught style. I had not missed
    a day or an hour of school since that
    first year, and I had led all of my
       <pb id="pickens53" n="53"/>
    classes all of the time. The grammar
    school course was now completed and to
    stop seemed a calamity. There was no
    high school in the district and no
    accessible private school; besides, I
    could not pay for private instruction.
    There was a High School in Little Rock
    to which students from our side of
    the river could not go except by special
    permission of the school authorities,
    and only then by paying two dollars
    and fifty cents per month. I could
    not have much hope of getting into
    this school, but against the bare possibility 
    I saved my earnings on the ferry,
    bought none of the things which would
    please a boy of fifteen years, and came
    to the end of the summer with about
    forty dollars in a savings bank, practically 
    every cent that I had earned.</p>
          <p>There was one fortunate circumstance: 
    the principal of the Argenta
    school was a boarder in the home of
    <pb id="pickens54" n="54"/>
    the principal of the Little Rock High
    School and had constantly praised me as
    a student. Some days before the opening 
    of school I was called to the home
    of the High School principal to take
    the entrance examinations. I have
    heard him say since that in each of the
    subjects of arithmetic, grammar, United 
    States history and spelling I was
    marked 100 per cent., and that especially 
    in the subject of arithmetic he had
    looked up “catch” problems to test
    the value of my former principal's
    praises. However that may be, when
    I went to register at the offices of the
    Board of Education, I was not too
    minutely questioned as to the “residence 
    of parents,” etc., the superintendent 
    taking no seeming notice of
    the fact that I was from over the river.
    And when I reached the secretary's
    desk in the line of applicants and received 
    my certificate of entrance to the
    <pb id="pickens55" n="55"/>   
    High School of Little Rock, what a
    critical moment was passed, what a
    vista was opened for me! Three more
    years of schooling were assured. I
    could work on the ferry in summer and
    at week-ends to buy necessary books
    and clothing. I plunged into that
    High School work with a zest such as I
    have seldom experienced since. My
    never-absent, never-tardy record was
    maintained, and indeed during the
    three High School years only once was
    I absent, and then because of an illness
    that took me for a day in the spring of
    my last year.</p>
          <p>When I entered the High School the
    class had had a beginners' algebra for
    one year, and were now taking up the
    more advanced book. I had never
    studied that subject, but at the end
    of the first month or so I was ranked
    first in that study. These High School
    classmates set out for my scalp, for my
     <pb id="pickens56" n="56"/>
    conquest and undoing. They seemed
    to presume, what men usually presume
    under similar circumstances, that the
    new comer is unduly ambitious, that he
    is simply “showing off” because he is
    new, and that the pace which he has
    set will not and cannot last. They
    attacked me on every side; they picked
    every possible flaw in my work and
    recitations, and in their zeal they some
    times found impossible flaws. They
    laughed; they ridiculed; they studied;
    they worked valiantly. I kept on.
    They only stimulated me; they filled
    me with a most exhilarating feeling for
    my work. They did for my education
    what no teacher in the world could
    have done; they made me study and
    learn what I had previously supposed
    I knew. They combined; they attacked
    first in one subject, then in another.
    They succored each other clandestinely. 
    But each month and term told
   <pb id="pickens57" n="57"/>      
    for me a better and better story. And
    before the end of my High School
    course I had reached that uninteresting
    point in the career of a winner where
    his rivals give up and concede him victories 
    which he does not win, and the
    teachers had often to upbraid my classmates 
    for letting errors go by unchallenged 
    simply because I had made them.
    But in conquering their admiration I
    did not lose their love. I had played
    fair, and they were not slow to appreciate 
    the fact.</p>
          <p>And how did I support myself meanwhile? 
    My father gave me what assistance 
    he could afford; wages were
    poor and there were younger children.
    And his groceryman was continually
    telling him that if he were in father's
    place he would not allow an able-bodied
    boy to go to school while he himself
    worked.</p>
          <p>And other men? Well, other men
<pb id="pickens58" n="58"/>    
    praised me; they did not assist me.
    And perhaps it is better that human
    nature is constituted so; men will
    praise a struggler when they have no
    thought of helping him. Help is very
    often a doubtful blessing, and sometimes 
    praise is too, and this reflection
    is a convenient solace to those who
    would not help. If every person who
    named me “smart” should have been
    required by law to give me a nickel
    I should have had at least no financial
    troubles.</p>
          <p>During my first year in the High
    School I continued to work on the ferry.
    But when summer came again, my
    success was threatened by a new danger; 
    the public-spirited citizens of Little
    Rock were building a “free bridge”
    across the Arkansas River from the
    foot of Main Street, and this bridge
    was to be opened on the Fourth of
    July. The famous old ferry that had
     <pb id="pickens59" n="59"/>   existed from the foundation of the city
    was then to die. The passing of the
    old ferry seemed the passing of a friend.
    I had usually carried a book on my
    oarsman's seat so that I could read or
    study while waiting for passengers;
    and as I rowed to and fro I had conjugated 
    Latin verbs to the stroke of the
    oars.</p>
          <p>In the face of a free bridge how was I
    to prepare for the Middle Year of the
    High School and pursue it during the
    term?</p>
        </div2>
        <pb id="pickens63" n="63"/>
        <div2>
          <head>V. THE STAVE FACTORY AND THE
         SAWMILL LUMBER YARD</head>
          <p>THERE was a “stave factory” and
        cooper shop in Argenta for the
    manufacture of barrels and kegs, and
    one thing that comes into the process
    of making the barrel heads is to stack
    the green boards, when they are first
    sawed from the blocks, and to construct 
    the stack so that air circulation
    will dry them. They were piled in
    polygonal hollow squares by first laying 
    a polygon of the pieces of “headin”'
    on the ground and then continuing
    round and round as the stack grew
    higher, up to fifty or more feet, or as
    high as the one on the ground who was
    “pitchin' headin',” could shoot the
    short boards up through the air to the
    one on the stack who was “layin'
    headin'.”</p>
          <pb id="pickens64" n="64"/>
          <p>Here I secured a position luckily,
    and I had an experience at “layin'
    headin'” which I shall never forget,
    and which forms as integral a part of
    my mental and moral training as any
    other thing I ever did or any book I
    ever studied. I was earning “six bits”
    or seventy-five cents a day, more
    money than I had ever received steadily 
    before in my life. When an older
    person did the work which I was doing
    he received usually one dollar a day.
    But I was a boy and schoolboy at that,
    and this fact, though otherwise and
    elsewhere exemplary, lowers one's price
    in a “stave factory.” The superintendent 
    would not pay a schoolboy one
    dollar a day, and I doubt whether he
    would have hired me at all if he had
    not supposed that like almost all others 
    I would never return to school after
    finding a position that paid four dollars 
    and fifty cents a week, for I remember
<pb id="pickens65" n="65"/>  
     how he swore when I quit at
    the end of the summer, calling me a
    young fool for throwing away the opportunity 
    of certain employment for
    the doubtful blessings of “schooling.”
    And the fact of my receiving a lower
    wage brought me into disfavor with
    some of the men who worked about
    the factory, especially with the man
    who “pitched headin'” to me.</p>
          <p>This man was at one and the same
    time, about as merry and human and
    as cruel and brutal a fellow as my brain
    has ever been able to imagine. And
    nothing that I shall record here has
    the least feeling of resentment toward
    his memory, for I regard him as one of
    my appointed teachers who, whether
    he willed it or not, gave me (somewhat
    against my will, too) a most valuable
    mental and moral discipline. If I
    should meet him today, I would shake
    his hand heartily as one of my benefactors,
   <pb id="pickens66" n="66"/>   
    albeit he tried for weeks and
    weeks to knock my brains out with
    pieces of green barrel heading. Usually 
    if a man tries constantly to hurt
    you and you constantly prevent him,
    he helps you, advances you in the
    world, the damages which nature assesses 
    in your favor for the unjust attacks 
    upon your life and character.
    This man was hard as iron in face and
    heart; stout as an ox in frame; tireless 
    as a machine in action. His wickedness 
    was simple, straightforward;
    the only good phase of his character was
    his honest disclaimer of all goodness.
    He could preach mock sermons as he
    worked, almost word for word and
    sound for sound imitations of some of
    the noisier preachers of the town. He
    would sing church songs, plantation
    songs, ribald songs, keeping time to
    the rhythm of his iron muscles as he
    sent the pieces of heading shooting into
     <pb id="pickens67" n="67"/> 
    the air. When his jokes were not coarse
    they were of a good wit and lightened
    the burdens of all who worked near
    him.</p>
          <p>This man determined to stop me
    from working at that factory by catching 
    me off my guard and dealing me a
    terrible blow with a piece of that heading 
    under the excuse of pitching it in
    the regular way. I felt his determination 
    from the very first by that defensive 
    telepathy with which Nature endues 
    the mind of hunted animals and
    especially of a hunted man. I was on
    my guard. I was equally determined
    to defeat him without ever saying a
    word to indicate that I suspected him.
    I must be alert, with my attention
    fixed from seven o'clock in the morning 
    till noon, and in the afternoon from
    one o'clock till six. For a long time he
    tried to wear me out by keeping the
    pieces of heading flying at me in such
     <pb id="pickens68" n="68"/>
    rapid succession that there was not a
    moment even to look aside. But that
    plan could not succeed, for my work
    was lighter than his and my nerve and
    muscles were good. His determination 
    grew with his defeat. He next
    tried the scheme of pitching with gentle 
    regularity for long periods of time,
    then suddenly sending up two or more
    pieces in rapid succession, the last
    coming with a force to fell an ox. But
    I was on my guard and both pieces
    would sometimes be deftly caught to
    show my skill and vex the tyrant; or
    when a particularly murderous shot
    was fired I might incline my body and
    let it pass harmlessly by and fall to
    the ground many yards beyond the
    stack. At such times he would swear
    roughly and say that he was not to
    waste his time pitching heading upon
    the ground. I would make some reasonable 
    remark, trying never to show,
<pb id="pickens69" n="69"/>   
    or rather determined never to acknowledge 
    that I understood his aim.
    He knew well that I understood. I
    have known him to walk away out of
    sight and slip back from another direction, 
    without my notice, as he
     thought, and send a piece of heavy
    heading hissing through the air. It
    was always either caught or allowed
    to pass harmlessly by. I have known
    him to purchase a water-melon from
    a passing wagon, burst it and apparently 
    sit down to eat it, when suddenly, 
    towards the top of the stack on
    which I stood, several pieces of heading 
    would be traveling in swift and
    dangerous succession. Not once did
    he catch me off my guard. I overheard 
    him remark to another man that
    I was as hard to hit as a squirrel.</p>
          <p>Ill  success never discouraged him;
    he was as persevering as the devil. All
    summer he kept up his attack; all
    <pb id="pickens70" n="70"/>   
    summer I kept up my defense. If I
    experienced any feeling like hatred in
    the beginning, it was very soon all
    lost, and I came to look upon the daily
    action as a <hi rend="italics">contest</hi> in which it was “up
    to me” to win.</p>
          <p>In September, I returned to school
    and the superintendent swore. My
    friend of the summer's battle dealt
    gently with me in the last week or so;
    perhaps with honest intentions, but
    without inducing me to take down my
    defenses. I came away with no scar
    or mark, save the blackness of my
    palms, which the green-oak sap had
    rendered blacker than the backs of my
    hands.</p>
          <p>During the following school season
    I helped myself by doing odd jobs on
    Saturdays and by running errands and
    cutting wood out of school hours. I
    learned my lessons while going errands
    or chopping wood. Many people can
<pb id="pickens71" n="71"/>
    remember seeing me go along the public 
    streets with a book open before my
    face. On a long errand I might commit 
    a whole history lesson to memory.
    When I was cutting wood I opened my
    book and propped it against a piece of
    wood at a convenient distance, with a
    chip holding the leaves apart, and
    studied by glances as I swung the ax.</p>
          <p>Later in the year I found another
    means of help. My father was fireman
    for a sawmill and secured for me the
    privilege of employing some of my
    Saturdays on the lumber yards. I was
    later given the position also of “Sunday 
    watchman” for these mill-yards.
    This kept me absolutely away from
    Sunday school and away from the day
    services of the church, but such things
    I always accepted as temporary means
    to an end. All day Sunday I camped
    alone but with my books. If it was
    cold I made a fire in the mill office and
     <pb id="pickens72" n="72"/>
    read, and wrote poems, sometimes
    satires on the members of some class
    of the High School with which my class
    was for the moment at war. If the
    weather was mild I studied or read out
    on the lumber piles. I early acquired
    the habit of getting weeks and sometimes 
    months ahead of my class in the
    text-books. If a subject was to last
    all the year, I usually finished it in
    March. When I again went over the
    work with the class I enjoyed the peculiar 
    profit which comes from review.</p>
          <p>During the summer of 1898, preparatory 
    to my senior year in the High
    School, I worked as janitor in Keys's
    Business College for white boys. I
    used to go early to my work in order to
    study the various books, practice on
    the typewriting machines and learn the
    use of certain athletic tools. Under
    such circumstances the presumption
    always lies that the janitor is ignorant;
<pb id="pickens73" n="73"/>    
    but when the boys found out that I
    could do their lessons for them and outdo 
    their feats on the punching bag and
    the horizontal bar, some of them grew
    cold and distant and others enjoyed the
    exhibitions of my intelligence much
    as one might enjoy the cleverness of a
    Simian in the Bronx Park.</p>
          <p>My senior year went on as the others
    had gone. A reporter for one of the
    daily papers visited the school that
    year and found us reading Vergil's
    “Aeneid.” The teacher had me scan
    or read metrically, and the next day
    there appeared in that newspaper a
    statement that the reporter found a
    negro boy that possessed the language
    of the Romans although he had the
    color of Erebus. In that same year
    also a prominent lawyer who held the
    office, I think, of attorney-general of the
    state visited the school and saw and
    heard some performances in mathematics
<pb id="pickens74" n="74"/>
    and Latin, and kindly invited me
    down to his office to help him convince
    his law partner that a negro could learn
    Latin. I went on my missionary journey.
    After quite an extended hearing from
    various parts of Cicero and Vergil and a
    theoretical discussion between the two
    lawyers about the relative value of
    “rote-learning,” the partner in question 
    acknowledged that he was convinced
      -  always addressing the other
    lawyer, and never addressing or noticing 
    me any more than one would
    address the machine whose qualities
    and capacities were the subject of discussion. 
    He finally said that I might
    profit somewhat by a college education
      -  and by his partner I was thanked and
    dismissed. It reminds me of certain
    great educational gatherings to discuss
    the education of the negro, where the
    negro is conspicuous by his enforced
    absence.</p>
          <pb id="pickens75" n="75"/>
          <p>In June of 1899 I was graduated as
    the valedictorian of my class. This
    valedictory was the first original address 
    I had ever made; it was forty
    minutes long. And although that
    speech was the “apple of mine eye”
    then, when I think of it now it seems
    strange to me that I should ever have
    been allowed to pour forth in that park
    such a tropical effusion in the presence
    of the school board and the assembled
    multitude.</p>
          <p>This first graduation, where most men
    stop, filled me with the greatest desire
    I have ever experienced for further
    education. How that mountain of difficulty 
    was climbed shall be related now.
    The summer immediately following my
    High School graduation wrote into the
    story of my life another of those delicious
    chapters of hard and profitable experience 
    to which I turn and read whenever
    I am tempted by discouragement.</p>
        </div2>
        <pb id="pickens79" n="79"/>
        <div2>
          <head>VI. “YOU CAN HAVE HOPE”</head>
          <p>THIS was a truly critical time in my
        career. I knew that I was not
    even half educated. I desired to go to
    college  -  but how? I thought I should
    have to work for several years
    and save the money. But I knew
    that it is not well to interrupt one's
    education; a thing that is well started
    goes more easily if it is not allowed to
    stop. But necessity is necessity, and I
    had become used to stooping to conquer 
    before her iron rod. So I took the
    state teacher's examination and secured
    a “first grade” license. I could have
    earned forty or fifty dollars a month
    at teaching.</p>
          <p>I knew that most young men of my
    acquaintance when they could earn
        <pb id="pickens80" n="80"/>   
    fifty dollars a month felt no further
    need of school. But I did not fear
    that such a feeling would ever take
    possession of me. I had come to have
    a stout faith; whatever difficulty I met,
    I believed that in some way I could
    get over it. If faith ever becomes dangerous, 
    mine had perhaps reached that
    dangerous point where I felt too literally 
    sure that “I cannot fail if I try.”
    I had kept at school for the eight years
    past because I felt sure that I could do
    so. I had never failed to solve a problem 
    in all of my lessons, and I had never
    tackled one with the feeling that I
    should fail. Always starting out penniless 
    and ever with some new difficulty
    in my path, I had earned pennies and
    pushed my way through school from
    year to year since my mother died.
    I had overcome many difficulties, never
    doubting that I should overcome.</p>
          <p>At this time I picked up a dusty,
     <pb id="pickens81" n="81"/> 
    worn book that had come into our
    family by some accident and had lain
    unopened for years, I read in it a story
    which filled me with the feeling that
    mere empty “faith” that is unaccompanied 
    by constant and <hi rend="italics">faithful</hi> “works”
    is a comical and a ludicrous phantom.
    The story ran that a British scholar
    named Moore believed in the doctrine
    of transubstantiation, that <hi rend="italics">if one believes
    it,</hi> the bread of the sacrament becomes
    the actual body and the wine the actual
    blood of Christ.  Erasmus did not
    believe that doctrine, and so journeyed
    to England to have a friendly discussion 
    with Moore. They met at table
    without being introduced, neither
    knowing who the other was. In that
    day scholars of different nationalities
    made Latin their international language. 
    A discussion began on the topic
    of transubstantiation. Moore, not
    knowing with whom he was arguing,
<pb id="pickens82" n="82"/>  
    stood up for the faith; Erasmus, not
    knowing whom he was opposing, said
    that he did not believe that faith could
    transubstantiate matter. Erasmus discovered 
    his opponent through his argument 
    and cried out: <foreign lang="lat">“Aut tu Morus es,
    aut nullus!”</foreign> (Either you are Moore,
    or nobody.) And Moore with ready
    wit replied: <foreign lang="lat">“Aut tu es Erasmus, aut
    diabolus!”</foreign> (Either you are Erasmus
    or the devil.) Then Moore claimed
    that the doctrine was true for those
    who <hi rend="italics">believed</hi> it, and that the act of faith
    made the fact. And Erasmus, outdone
    in argument, decided not to be outdone
    in demonstration, and when he was
    returning to the continent, he asked
    Moore to lend him his horse, saying
    simply that Moore would surely get
    his horse back. But when he reached
    his home in Europe, instead of sending
    back the horse, he sent to Moore the
    two following stanzas:</p>
          <pb id="pickens83" n="83"/>
          <lg type="stanza">
            <l>
              <foreign lang="lat">“Quod mihi dixisti</foreign>
            </l>
            <l>
              <foreign lang="lat">De corpore Christi:</foreign>
            </l>
            <l>
              <foreign lang="lat">‘Crede quod edas et dis’  -  </foreign>
            </l>
            <l>
              <foreign lang="lat">Sic tibi rescribo</foreign>
            </l>
            <l>
              <foreign lang="lat">De tuo palfrido:</foreign>
            </l>
            <l>
              <foreign lang="lat">Crede quod habeas et habes.”</foreign>
            </l>
          </lg>
          <p>And although I have seen neither the
    book nor the story since, I remember
    that I made the following mental rendition 
    of those stanzas into English:</p>
          <lg type="stanza">
            <l>“What you to me have said</l>
            <l>About the sacred bread</l>
            <l>‘Believe it's Christ's body and it's that’  -  </l>
            <l>So I write back to you</l>
            <l>About your palfrey too:</l>
            <l>Believe that you have it and hav't.”</l>
          </lg>
          <p>The story impressed me: how was a
    fellow to get his horse or win his spurs
    through mere faith without acts? I
    inquired of my friends if it were not
    possible for one to work his way in college. 
    The pastor of the First Congregational 
    Church of Little Rock, a
    graduate of Talladega College in Alabama,
<pb id="pickens84" n="84"/>   
    offered to write an intercessory
    letter to that institution if I could
    permit him to say how much I should
    be able to pay toward my college expenses 
    in cash  -  and that was the “rub.”
    But I told him to write for conditions
    and that I would set to work to earn
    the required cash. He gave me the
    address of the president of the school
    and I also wrote a frank letter. It was
    now July and I could wait for a reply;
    I must set to work in the hope of earning 
    an acceptable amount of cash. I
    entered again upon one of those life
    experiences which are hard enough in
    their passage, but which in their recollection 
    verify the truth of Vergil's
    line, that “perchance some day it will
    be pleasant to remember even these
    things.”</p>
          <p>The new railroad, then popularly
    known as the “Choctaw,” was being
    built through the wilderness of Arkansas,
<pb id="pickens85" n="85"/> 
    through sections where neither
    railroads nor other enginery of civilization 
    had ever gone before. My father
    was at work on the line forty miles
    up the Arkansas River, in a tangled
    jungle only accessible to river boats.
    Concrete bridges were being built over
    the streams and gorges, and cuts were
    being blasted through the hills. It was
    rough work that only the hardiest men
    could stand. There is always a chance
    to secure a position in such work; it is
    so hard that vacancies are constantly
    occurring, but the summer was wearing 
    away and I must hurry. I wrote
    my father that I was coming, and did
    not wait for his reply, for I knew he
    would think it impossible for me to do
    the work.</p>
          <p> After journeying a day and a night,
    working my way on a river steamer
    among the “roustabouts,” I reached
    the frontier-like scene of a railroad
      <pb id="pickens86" n="86"/>
    camp. The bulk of the laborers and
    camp-followers were of the scum of
    humanity, white and black; there were
    rough, coarse men and undesirable
    women. My father tried to act the
    presumption that I had come to visit
    him; he studiedly said nothing to me
    to imply that he had any idea of my
    attempting that work. I coolly told
    him of my prospects for going to college, 
    and that I had come to work. I
    shall never forget the wistful, anxious,
    half-sad look of his eyes as I took up my
    spade and wheelbarrow and went “on
    the grade” among the men. There
    were shoveling and wheeling of dirt
    and crushed stone. Concrete mixing
    machines were not then in use, and the
    mixing had to be done by the men with
    shovels  -  the heaviest, hardest work
    imaginable. On my first day at 
    concrete-mixing the men laughed and
    swore that I could not last till noon,
<pb id="pickens87" n="87"/>
    but would “white-eye.” That term
    was applied to the actions of the sufferer
    because his eyeballs rolled in a peculiar
    manner, showing the white, when he
    became overheated and fell upon the
    ground. I did last till noon; and then
    the foreman, a stocky German of the
    coarsest possible nature, who had kept
    a half amused eye on me all the morning, 
    expecting to have some fun when I
    should “white-eye,” was so touched
    by the determination with which I
    stuck till noon that he gave me lighter
    work. At nights I had only vitality
    enough left to bathe in the green waters
    of the bayou and lie down to rest in my
    tent. On Sundays I read two borrowed
    books, one of them being “Uncle Tom's
    Cabin.” Most of the men gambled
    all day Sundays and caroused till late
    at night. My better habits soon gave
    me superior strength and endurance
    and I could tire the toughest rival.
<pb id="pickens88" n="88"/>
    This seemed wonderful to the men.
    They seemed to think that I was a
    strange fellow. They did not reckon on
    the habits of life.</p>
          <p>For about a month I had received
    no word from the president of Talladega 
    College as to whether my application 
    could be accepted, when one
    day there came in the steamboat mail
    a card, bearing the Ohio postmark and
    signed “G. W. Andrews”:</p>
          <p>“Your frank and interesting letter
    has been received. I cannot say definitely 
    now, but write to say you can
    have hope.”</p>
          <p><hi rend="italics">“You can have hope.”</hi> That was
    after all a great message at the right
    time and place. It seemed to anticipate 
    a more definite reply. I worked
    all summer on that card of “hope.”
    Not another word ever came. In the
    multitude of the president's duties, and
    perhaps of similar applications, my
    <pb id="pickens89" n="89"/>   
    case had doubtless slipped from his
    memory and notes. But I hoped and
    worked, and worked and hoped. September 
    came and wore away towards
    October. No word. But there was
    “hope.” I had heard that Talladega
    College was to open on the first Tuesday 
    of October.</p>
          <p>Meanwhile my evident intelligence
    had won for me a little better position
    from the good-natured, coarse-spoken
    German, and for my last month I was
    put to assist the cook and keeper of the
    commissary boat. My father had returned 
    to the city to engage in other
    work. I did not tell the foreman that
    I was going to quit and go to school.
    I knew better, most of my pay was still
    due and it would have been all kept
    and I myself kept for a period. There
    was no law in that wilderness but the
    law of the jungle. I had seen the foreman
<pb id="pickens90" n="90"/> 
    man chasing white men with a revolver, 
    as one might chase rabbits.</p>
          <p>On the Saturday before the first Tuesday 
    in October I drew all my pay and
    got excused to go to the city, as the men
    sometimes did. The steamer was not
    in, so I had to cross the river and walk
    fifteen or twenty miles to the nearest
    railroad station. I left at daylight and
    caught the train at noon.</p>
          <p>It was an uncivilized world from
    which I had escaped, the only appearance 
    of civilization being from its
    uglier phase, leased convicts with their
    “coon-tail” stripes on a farm in a lone
    valley half a dozen miles from the railroad 
    camps. As one journeyed through
    the woods he would occasionally come
    upon a path which would lead to the
    hut of poor white people; they usually
    had no floor or chairs and slept on rude
    “bunks” or on quilts upon the bare
    ground. It has always appealed more
     <pb id="pickens91" n="91"/>    
    powerfully to my sympathies to behold
    poor, degraded white people than to
    behold the same class of my own race.
    I suppose it is because the degraded
    white man is such a contrast to the
    opportunities and attainments of his
    race, so that his position seems to be
    a real <hi rend="italics">de</hi>-gradation, and it is a less sad
    spectacle to see a man simply <hi rend="italics">down</hi> than
    to see a man <hi rend="italics">downed</hi>.</p>
          <p>On Sunday I went to see the Congregational 
    preacher, told him of the
    card of “hope,” and that I had had no
    further word. He concluded that the
    president had overlooked me, but said
    that he had heard that if a worthy
    student could deposit thirty or forty
    dollars with the treasurer he might
    be given sufficient work to meet the
    rest of his bills for the year. Examining 
    my accounts I found that I had to
    my credit about fifty dollars; my fare
    from Little Rock, Ark., to Talladega,
     <pb id="pickens92" n="92"/> 
    Ala., would be about fifteen dollars;
    so that I could spend five dollars for
    some necessary articles and go with
    the minimum of thirty dollars.</p>
          <p>I went. I was actuated by faith and
    the “hope.” It was something of a
    venture for a boy of eighteen, who had
    never before left the neighborhood of 
    home and home-folk. But how was
    one to get his horse unless to faith
    he should add deeds?</p>

        <div2>
          <head>VII. A CHRISTIAN MISSIONARY COLLEGE</head>
          <p>I REACHED Talladega at night and
        went early the next morning to
    the home of the college president, to
    try my fate again as I had tried it three
    years before with the high school
    authorities in Little Rock. He had forgotten 
    me, but remembered when I
    mentioned the “card of hope.” With
    the coolness and slowness of one who
    has prepared to look fate in the face
    I said: “Not hearing any more from
    you I decided to come and see. And” 
      -  drawing something slowly from my
    pocket  -  “and I have here <hi rend="italics">three ten</hi>
    dollar bills.” I noticed the change in
    the good man's countenance between
    the words <hi rend="italics">three</hi> and <hi rend="italics">ten</hi>; too often had
    he faced the difficulty of finding a way
    for apparently worthy students who
<pb id="pickens96" n="96"/>   
    brought less than a tenth part of their
    year's expenses. When he learned that
    I had come five hundred miles on faith,
    the smile that lit his countenance was
    auspicious. My star of “hope” had
    not misled me. He said that he would
    give the thirty dollars to the treasurer,
    and asked if I could hitch a horse, milk a
    cow and work a garden. I replied that
    I could learn to do any kind of work.</p>
          <p>My faith and adventure evidently
    made a great impression on this man.
    In his chapel talk that morning, without 
    calling names or making indications, 
    he told a story to the assembled
    students, how a young man had written
    from a distant state; how the correspondence 
    had been lost and forgotten;
    how the fellow had based his hope on
    a rather indefinite proposition, had
    worked hard all summer to earn a few
    dollars, had come many miles. He
    described the coolness with which this
     <pb id="pickens97" n="97"/>    
    young man had faced him and his own
    shifting emotions between the words
    “three” and “ten.”</p>
          <p>I had not seen a school test all summer, 
    and in my entrance examinations
    I learned what an excellent preparation 
    it is <hi rend="italics">not to prepare</hi> for an examination, 
    but to learn each daily lesson
    and then take a period of rest and not
    of cramming just before the test. And
    for the remainder of my school life I
    prepared for the examination of tomorrow 
    by retiring at eight or nine o'clock
    the night before.</p>
          <p>First the Latin teacher started in to
    test me in Cicero, which I read so
    easily that he closed it and opened Vergil's 
    “Aeneid,” asking me to scan and
    read. I announced that I could read
    the first six books, and he turned from
    book to book, forwards and backwards,
    but I always “scanned and read.”  I
    was then passed on to the teacher of
    <pb id="pickens98" n="98"/>    
    mathematics. Many white people have
    an honest opinion that the negro mind
    is characteristically unmathematical.
    The teacher asked me to draw the
    figure and demonstrate the proposition
    that the sum of three angles of a triangle 
    is equal to two right angles. He
    added that he would go about some
    desk work and that I might call his
    attention when I was ready. As a
    good-natured resentment to this last
    statement I called his attention at once,
    drawing the figure “free-hand” as I did
    so, and announced that I was “ready.”
    It is a simple and easy proposition, and
    it was so clearly demonstrated that this
    teacher, who was the college dean, gave
    me no further examinations and enrolled 
    me in the sophomore class. So
    I never was a <hi rend="italics">freshman</hi>.</p>
          <p>I noticed that I was not put to milking 
    cows and hitching teams, willing
    as I was, but was given work in the college
     <pb id="pickens99" n="99"/>  
    library. In the first of January
    came the annual week “of prayer,”
    and I joined the little Congregational
    church which is fostered in connection
    with the college. I was just about
    nineteen years old. Why had I not
    become a church member before this
    time? That is a thing worth explaining 
    in the interest of the younger generation 
    of negroes. I believed in God
    and the church, and had always been
    a most faithful worshiper, but I could
    not dream dreams and see visions.
    Without dreams and visions no one
    was allowed to join the average negro
    church of the past. The cause that
    produced many of the negro songs was
    the fact that the candidate was required 
    to bring and sing a “new song”
    to prove that he was really converted
    by God, for the doctrine was that “the
    devil can convert you, but he can't
    give you a new song.” Rather suggestive,
    <pb id="pickens100" n="100"/>                   
    this idea of the unpoeticalness
    of the devil. It would amuse more
    than it would instruct for me to relate
    some of the ridiculous stories which I
    have heard accepted in church as convert's 
    “experiences.” At last I had
    found a church which did not require
    that I visit hell, like Dante, in a dream,
    to be chased by the hounds of the devil
    and make a narrow, hair-raising escape.
    And I have been a member of this
    church since my first college year.</p>
          <p>Talladega College is a typical 
    monument of unselfishness. There is
    nothing in the annals of human history
    that outrivals the unselfishness that
    founded and has maintained these
    institutions for half a century. When
    the institution was founded in 1867
    practically the whole negro population
    was illiterate and penniless. It is on
    record that many workers gave their
    services absolutely free. The sentiment
    <pb id="pickens101" n="101"/>
    of the South was naturally opposed
    to negro education, especially at the
    hands of its late enemies. The early
    workers had to face something more
    than mere social ostracism: the Ku
    Klux Klan did not stop with that barbarity 
    of civilization, but often adopted
    real barbarities, terrifying, banishing,
    whipping and killing. It is interesting
    to note what an <hi rend="italics">evolutionary</hi> influence
    a school like Talladega has on the sentiment 
    of its neighborhood; white people
    of the town are now among its chief
    defenders whenever danger is threatened, 
    and are among its best donors
    when a new building is to be erected.</p>
          <p>And oh, the <sic>devolvements</sic> of Father
    Time! The building which has been
    the main educational hall of the institution 
    for forty years, was erected by
    slave labor in 1852-53 as a college for
    white boys. One of the slaves who
    toiled at the work has since had his
      <pb id="pickens102" n="102"/>    
    many children and grandchildren educated 
    in it.</p>
          <p>In my first winter at Talladega I won
    the college oratorical contest and several 
    other literary prizes. This suggested 
    to the president and faculty the
    idea of sending me to the North in the
    following summer with a party of four
    other students and a teacher on a campaign 
    in the financial interest of the
    college. The teacher, who has since
    become President Metcalf, presented
    the work, the aims and the needs of
    the institution, the quartet of boys
    sang and I delivered an address which
    I prepared especially for the campaign.
    That speech and that campaign proved
    to be the doorway of my future, as will
    appear.</p>
          <p>It was in the summer of 1900, and
    it was my first time north of the Ohio
    and the Potomac. We went northward 
    in the month of June through
    <pb id="pickens103" n="103"/>
    Tennessee and Kentucky into Ohio,
    thence eastward, visiting Niagara and
    the summer haunts of the rich in the
    Adirondacks and concluding our campaign 
    in the New England States in
    September.</p>
          <p>It was Commencement time when
    we reached Oberlin, and the class of
    1875 was celebrating its twenty-fifth
    anniversary. Professor Scarborough
    of Wilberforce University, the negro
    scholar who is a member of this class,
    was present at an impromptu parlor
    entertainment by the five boys of our
    party, and he so much liked a recitation 
    which I combined from Spartacus
    to the Gladiators and The Christian
    Gladiator that when we parted he gave
    me in the act of handshaking a silver
    half dollar. I noticed what he did not
    notice, that the coin bore the date of
    “1875,” the year of his class  -  and I
      <pb id="pickens104" n="104"/>
    have it now, black with age and non-use 
    in my purse.</p>
          <p>At Akron, O., an event happened on
    which hangs a chain of circumstances;
    the people requested that my speech
    be printed in pamphlets so that copies
    could be purchased. Copies were sent
    to Dr. G. W. Andrews, the head of
    Talladega College, the author of my
    “card of hope.” He marked a copy
    and sent it to Dr. A. F. Beard, the senior 
    secretary of the American Missionary 
    Association.</p>
          <p>This trip impressed me with the
    unselfish spirit of the Christian people
    of the North  -  and also showed me
    that the good people of the North had
    a very inadequate idea of the real capacity 
    of the American negro. When
    we visited the summer camp of Mr.
    Harrison, ex-president of the United
    States, members of his party expressed
    frank surprise that a party of negro
      <pb id="pickens105" n="105"/>
    college students could sing and speak
    and deport themselves so well  -  and I
    myself was scrutinized with a most
    uncomforting curiosity.</p>
          <p>Our little campaign paid expenses
    and brought back a thousand dollars
    for the college  -  a small sum of money
    but a big experience. Moreover I
    had seen Yale, had actually looked
    upon its elms, its ivies and its outer
    walls. From that day the audacious
    idea began to take me that I must push
    my educational battles into its gates.</p>

          <head>VIII. PREPARING FOR YALE IN IRONWORK</head>
          <div3 type="part">
            <p>WHEN we reached Talladega after
        our summer campaign of 1900
    I received what was then the greatest
    surprise of my life, an invitation to
    speak at the annual meeting of the
    American Missionary Association to
    be held in Springfield, Mass., in October. 
    Doctor Beard had read my summer 
    campaign speech, and I was asked
    to come more than a thousand miles to
    speak for ten minutes. This invitation 
    gave me my first direct impression
    of the lofty Christian spirit of the great
    organization of whose educational work
    I was a beneficiary. I was a boy of
    nineteen years, an almost unknown
    student, and in a position to be commanded. 
    On my way to Springfield
    I met for the first time Dr. Booker T.
     <pb id="pickens110" n="110"/>
    Washington, who was likewise invited
    to speak at the annual meeting. And
    although the incident has probably
    never recurred to the mind of that honorable 
    gentleman, I remember that
    when he learned my mission he shared
    with me his space in the Pullman car
    and treated me with such kindly consideration 
    that I was asked by passengers 
    if I was not Mr. Washington's son.</p>
          </div3>
          <div3>
            <head>AT THE SPRINGFIELD MEETING</head>
            <p>The Court Square Theater was packed,
    and there was an overflow meeting in
    the church across the street. My
    speech was lengthened from ten to
    about twenty minutes at the suggestion
    of officials who sat upon the platform,
    the suggestion being made while I
    spoke. When I crossed the street to
    speak at the overflow meeting, Doctor
    Boynton, who presided, said, “If they
    do this in the green tree, what will they
     <pb id="pickens111" n="111"/>
    do in the dry?” The subject of this
    “green tree” discourse was characteristic 
    of a boy under twenty who had
    just escaped from the sophomore class,
    Negro Evolution. But the matter was
    more practical than the title. And although 
    I have since enjoyed the enthusiasm 
    of many occasions where the
    speaker and his audience become one-hearted 
    and one-souled, I have never
    had a more thrilling experience or a
    more appreciative audience than the
    one in the Court Square Theater. Yet
    I had heard that Northern audiences
    were <hi rend="italics">cold</hi>.</p>
            <p>The summer of 1901 gave me an
    opportunity to learn more of real Black
    Belt conditions. I assisted in the summer 
    school work of a Talladega College
    graduate who founded an institution in
    a rural community more than ten miles
    from the nearest railroad station.
    There the negro population greatly 
     <pb id="pickens112" n="112"/>
    preponderates; the negro owns much of
    the land; and next to nothing is done
    by the authorities of the state for public 
    instruction. I was impressed by
    the humanity, the simplicity and the
    universal peaceableness of American
    black folk where they are left practically 
    to themselves.</p>
            <p>I finished at Talladega College in
    1902. The old problem of further education 
    returned. I refused a position
    in our High School at Little Rock because 
    I wanted to go to Yale or Harvard. 
    Doctor Andrews, who seemed to
    have a perfect confidence in my future,
    was trying to get some person of means
    to assist me at Yale. Dean Henry P.
    Wright of Yale, after reading the 
    recommendations of my former teachers,
    had written that I could enter the
    junior class. This great scholar and
    good man has been a constant friend
    since that first acquaintance.</p>
            <pb id="pickens113" n="113"/>
            <p>As in former days, I determined to
    help myself by some decisive move.
    Having relatives in Chicago, I thought
    that I might secure work in a great
    city like that; and going thither immediately 
    after my graduation I luckily 
    found an opening in Gates's Ironworks 
    on the north side of the city
    among Poles and other foreigners. I
    was a “helper,” supposed to assist the
    workmen wherever my services were
    needed. I was an apparently unwelcome 
    object to the Poles until they
    found out that I could speak German
    with them. These members of the
    Catholic faith were much entertained
    and amused at my repetitions of German
    and medieval Latin poems to the
    swinging of my iron sledge. They
    sought my company and conversation
    at noon.</p>
            <p>Nine dollars a week for about a
    dozen weeks will not pay a fellow's
               <pb id="pickens114" n="114"/>          
    bills at Yale for ten months. But I
    hoped to save enough to reach New
    Haven and support myself for a week
    or two, at the risk of finding a chance
    to earn my board and expenses. Besides, 
    this ironwork gave me superior
    physical strength, which is a good part
    of any preparation for college. At
    night I read Carlyle and Emerson,
    Latin and German, in anticipation of
    work at Yale. In the middle of the
    summer I received a word from Doctor
    Beard of the American Missionary
    Association in New York, saying, “I
    am off for Europe, and when I return
    in the fall I expect to find you at Yale.”</p>
            <p>The note of that “expectation”
    sounded like a challenge, and I redoubled 
    my determination and easily
    passed by all the huge temptations of
    a great city. On Sundays I attended
    Moody's church and the city Young
    Men's Christian Association. It appeared
             <pb id="pickens115" n="115"/>     
    strange to me that out of 40,000
    negroes I saw no other one at this
    Young Men's Christian Association
    during the whole summer.</p>
            <p>I became acquainted with Paul Laurence 
    Dunbar, the negro poet, who was
    living in Chicago. He cheered me on
    and wrote encouraging letters until I
    had finished at Yale. He said that
    a course at Harvard had always been
    the unrealized ambition of his life  -  
    and how he had earned his breakfasts
    a few years before by walking seven
    miles on the hard pavements of Chicago. 
    I was impressed with the possible 
    consequences to one who has to
    battle against the sort of social and
    economic world that is presented to a
    black boy in the average Northern city.
    It might destroy his health and injure
    his morals. There was pathos in Dunbar's 
    constant praise of the fact that I
                      <pb id="pickens116" n="116"/>
    did not touch any kind of strong drink
    nor any form of tobacco.</p>
            <p>With a faith astonishing to remember
    I left Chicago in September, settled
    my preliminary bills at Yale and was
    enrolled as a junior, with fifteen dollars
    left in my pocket and the necessity of
    finding work to earn my board and
    room. I secured work in the roof garden 
    and restaurant of the city Young
    Men's Christian Association, where I
    could assist the kitchen force in various
    sorts of work and wash the windows
    to earn my board. Board is a large
    and necessary item.</p>
            <p>A few days afterwards there came a
    letter from Mr. D. Stuart Dodge of
    New York City saying that he had
    heard from Doctor Andrews of Talladega
    College, that I was at Yale, well started,
    inclosing a check for fifty dollars, and
    adding that he had one more fifty for
    my use whenever I should advise him
                     <pb id="pickens117" n="117"/>   
    that it was needed. He spoke like a
    familiar friend, although I had never
    heard his name before. I put the
    money in the New Haven Savings Bank
    and advised the donor, with thanks,
    that I was earning my board and should
    certainly not need more money until
    the beginning of the next term, after
    Christmas, when tuition bills and new
    books might bring the need. Something 
    in my letter appealed to the favor
    of this good man. He sent a second
    fifty and promised a third fifty upon
    my request. He read my letter to his
    aged mother, Mrs. William Dodge, then
    over ninety years of age, and she insisted 
    that twenty-five dollars additional 
    be sent me on her personal check,
    with the special direction that it be
    spent for winter clothes. The thoughtful 
    and sympathetic woman heard that
    I was from the South. This friend
    whom I had never seen did even more;
                   <pb id="pickens118" n="118"/>
    he wrote to his cousin, Sec. Anson
    Phelps Stokes of Yale University and
    advised him of my presence among the
    thousands of that institution. Mr.
    Stokes pleasantly invited me to command 
    his assistance when I needed it.
    I could have created the need by stopping 
    the process of earning my board,
    but I instinctively felt that the work
    was better.</p>
            <p>By their unpatronizing spirit through
    all of this, these people lifted up and
    established my respect for mankind.
    They conferred a blessing upon me as
    if it were a joy to them, and asked to
    help me as one might request a favor.</p>
            <p>Encouraged and edified by such
    noble spirits at the start I do not now
    wonder that I reached upward with
    body and mind and entered upon two
    of the most interesting and successful
    years of all my educational career.</p>

          <head>IX. YALE  -  THE HENRY JAMES TEN EYCK
          ORATORICAL CONTEST</head>
          <p>MY FIRST year at Yale was full
        of experiences for which former
    school struggles had in a measure prepared 
    me. After the Christmas examinations, 
    when students are graded for
    the first term's work, I was classed in
    Grade A, which according to the policy
    of the Self-Help Bureau exempted me
    from payment of tuition, and I stayed
    in Grade A, never paying another dollar 
    of tuition during my years at Yale.
    Board I could earn, and other expenses
    I could manage. A room in White
    Hall was secured by the kindness of
    Dean Wright, into whose Latin class
    I had luckily fallen. After Christmas
    my Yale studentship was no longer an
<pb id="pickens122" n="122"/>      
    experiment, and I set out with confidence 
    on the run toward June.</p>
          <p>Early in the year there appeared on
    the bulletin ten subjects for the “Ten
    Eyck Prize” in oratory. Among them
    was the simple word, “Hayti.”  The
    oration is first written and passed in
    under an assumed name; there were
    over three hundred men in my class
    and about thirty-five passed in papers.
    Of these the judges chose ten to enter
    the first speaking contest. At this
    first speaking five are dropped and five
    advanced to the final contest. The
    five who are dropped receive the five
    third prizes. Of the five who are advanced 
    the successful one will receive
    the first prize and the four will receive
    the four second prizes.</p>
          <p>I decided to win the first prize. It
    is a bold thing to acknowledge, but
    such was my decision. I kept my
    work at the Young Men's Christian
                     <pb id="pickens123" n="123"/>      
    Association until I should see my name
    among the ten. Once among the ten
    I felt as sure to win the first prize as I
    had ever felt that I would master the
    difficulties of a lesson.</p>
          <p>About three weeks before the time
    for the final contest, which was to take
    place about the first of April, the “ten”
    were published and my name appeared
    with the subject Hayti.</p>
          <p>My subsequent plans and decisions
    seem as audacious to me now as they
    must to the reader of this narrative.
    I told my Young Men's Christian Association 
    friends that my name was
    among the Ten Eyck “ten,” and that
    the first prize would settle my bills
    for the rest of the year, and that I
    should win if I gave up extra work and
    devoted myself to the last three weeks
    of the contest. “If you do not win,”
    they said, kindly, “you may return.”
    I wrote Doctor Andrews of Talladega
        <pb id="pickens124" n="124"/>
    College that I was among the ten and
    that I would be among the “five” at the
    close of that week. After the preliminary 
    contest I wrote him that I was
    one of the five and that I would win
    the first prize two weeks later unless
    the gods should interfere. I learned
    later that Doctor Andrews read these
    missives in public as fast as he received
    them in the South, and they must have
    seemed utter audacity to all but him.
    On April 1 in College Street Hall I was
    awarded the first prize by the five
    judges.</p>
          <p>My ambition to win was stimulated
    by a desire to further the acquaintance
    of other peoples with my race. I had
    noticed that when I did my classwork
    among the best, more curiosity was
    awakened than when a Jew or a Japanese 
    ranked among the best. The
    surprise with which I was taken struck
    me as due to a <hi rend="italics">lack of expectation</hi> in
                    <pb id="pickens125" n="125"/>   
    my fellows, and I would succeed in
    order to cause others to expect more
    of the American negro.</p>
          <p>The negro students were less than
    one-half of one per cent. of the three
    thousand men at Yale. The negro
    might not be expected to win often.
    But judging from the press and personal
    comment that followed, it would seem
    that the whole world was a little too
    much surprised.</p>
          <p>But not all that was said and done
    was prompted by curious surprise rather
    than positive appreciation. The next
    morning I found in the Yale post office
    a check for fifty dollars with appreciation 
    from the Yale Glee, Banjo and
    Mandolin Clubs Association. For
    weeks there came daily twenty-five or
    more appreciative letters. Mrs. Corinne 
    Roosevelt Robinson, sister of
    the President, had never quite forgotten 
    me since my little summer campaign
<pb id="pickens126" n="126"/>   
    speech in 1900, and she sent
    Godspeed and a personal check. One
    of the most highly appreciated letters
    came from ex-Pres. Grover Cleveland.
    A good lady of Newport gave me my
    first and only diamond pin. There
    came through the mails from New
    York City three fifty-dollar gold certificates 
    in an anonymous letter signed
    by “An Unknown Well-wisher.” It
    contained half a dozen words, the briefest 
    and the fullest missive ever sent
    me. I remembered the text that begins
    “Unto him that hath.”</p>
          <p>So many good and sensible letters
    were bound to be offset by some others
    of more or less eccentric ideas and 
    suggestions. Some organization in 
    Kentucky, which seemed from their 
    literature to have had some designs on
    Hayti for some time, wrote me a proposal 
    that they would seize the island
    by some sort of filibustering expedition
                     <pb id="pickens127" n="127"/>   
    from the United States if I would accept 
    the presidency. Shades of Dessalines 
    and Toussaint L'Overture! I
    had no desire to add to the volcanic
    little government's already too 
    numerous chief executives.</p>
          <p>The appreciation of my classmates
    was generous. When my name was
    seen among the ten, there was a mixture 
    of amused and sympathetic interest. 
    The proportion of amusement
    was overdone only by one Jew who was
    an unsuccessful aspirant for the honor
    and who referred to me among the boys
    as “the black Demosthenes.” I told
    him it would have been more Jewlike
    for him to say black David, or black
    Jacob. When I entered the five, I was
    taken more seriously. And when I
    won the final contest there was a burst
    of generous and manly enthusiasm.</p>
          <p>I never like to describe human ugliness 
    for its own sake, but there was
                         <pb id="pickens128" n="128"/>
    one fellow who is worth describing
    because he is such a good illustration
    of a type  -  not a Yale type, but a type
    of man. Among the best and seemingly 
    sincerest of my Yale friends were
    some boys from the South, especially
    from the freedom-loving hills of the
    border states. But there was one
    fellow from the state school of my own
    state. We entered Yale together and
    he, knowing me to be a Southern negro
    fighting for my very existence, was at
    first very, very patronizing. He would
    “hello” me a block away, inquire with
    a half amused, half good-natured smile
    “how I was making it?” and make
    every effort of bland superiority. I
    uniformly and politely accepted all his
    good advances, never seeking them.
    Soon my classmates began to talk on
    the campus about my work. He became 
    less friendly  -  I had to be nearer
    to him than the distance of a block
<pb id="pickens129" n="129"/>      
    to get a “hello.” After the Christmas
    “exams” the boys had tales to tell;
    how I walked out from nearly every
    examination when most of them were
    not half through. Then he hardly
    spoke when he met me face to face;
    I tried hard to be uniform and unconscious 
    of change. Next day after the
    oratorical contest I met him squarely
    on the street, and as I was about to
    give the friendly greeting he pulled
    down his hat over his eyes and passed
    as one passes a lamp-post.</p>
          <p>People naturally ask how I fared
    during my next year, my senior year,
    at Yale. A month before my graduation 
    I was invited to address the State
    Congregational Association of Illinois,
    and when a minister of that body asked
    me that question I told the story of a
    negro woman in the south who believed
    in “voodooism.” Her husband was
    fussy and disagreeable, so she went
                          <pb id="pickens130" n="130"/>
    to the “conjure doctor” to get a remedy 
    for the old man's distemper. The
    conjurer gave her a bottle of clear
    liquid, and directed that when the
    “fuss” started in the house she must
    take a mouthful of it herself, and added
    his particular direction that it must
    not be swallowed under a quarter of an
    hour after being taken into the mouth.
    She followed directions and the vicarious 
    treatment completely cured the
    old man. Returning to the doctor
    in astonishment she asked what the
    remedy could be, and he replied: “Cold
    water  -  but it kept <hi rend="italics">your</hi> tongue still!”</p>
          <p>But there is nothing more generous
    and noble than the heart of a boy,
    and young men are but “boys grown
    tall.” During my senior year they
    acknowledged my right to a part of
    their world. They never quite got
    away from the surprise that “you do
    your lessons as well as anybody!”
                       <pb id="pickens131" n="131"/>    
    While crossing the campus at examination 
    times I was often stopped by a
    crowd of fellows who had just finished
    some examination. They would hand
    me the list of questions, and as I answered 
    them they would say, “I made
    it,” or “I failed,” according as their
    answers had agreed or disagreed with
    mine. “Pickens, you ought to be a
    lawyer!” shouted one fellow after I
    had gone through such a list of questions 
    from our five-hour law course.
    I could hardly have registered to vote
    in that fellow's state.</p>
          <p>At graduation time I was ranked in
    the “Philosophical Oration” group
    of the class who are credited with
    “honors in all studies.” I had been
    with the class two years, just the time
    required to merit a Phi Beta Kappa
    Key if one's scholarship warrants it.
    So much was printed and said about
    my admission to this society that a
                          <pb id="pickens132" n="132"/>   
    clear statement might correct some
    error. It was said that my admission
    was opposed. Well, a great university
    is much like the outside world; it
    holds many different spirits. No one
    should be surprised at differences of
    opinion in a <hi rend="italics">university</hi>. In our senior
    year a resolution was introduced in the
    Phi Beta Kappa Society that no one
    be admitted to membership that year
    except such as began as Freshmen. I
    entered Yale as a Junior; but there is
    no way of determining that this was
    a “grandfather clause” inspired by my
    presence. A few fellows tried mischievously 
    to impress me that the legislation
    was in my honor, but I consistently and
    persistently refused to acknowledge it  -  
    and somehow the resolution proved
    ineffective and I was awarded a key.
    The Phi Beta Kappa Society is based
    on scholarship, and Yale is a very
    democratic community.</p>
          <pb id="pickens133" n="133"/>
          <div3>
            <head>AFTER-WORD</head>
            <p>After Yale, what? A famous lecture
    bureau of New York City laid before
    me a tempting contract to be carted
    around over Europe and America for
    three years as a sort of lecture-curiosity.
    I had been invited to speak before
    various dignified gatherings, at Newport, 
    Hartford and at the annual banquet 
    of the Citizens' Trades Association 
    of Cambridge, Mass. But after
    seeking and finding good advice in the
    secretary of Yale University, the secretary 
    of the American Missionary Association 
    and Paul Laurence Dunbar who
    had tried the curiosity-show business,
    I decided that show-lecturing would
    be of doubtful influence on my future  -  
    although it would have given me an
    opportunity to accomplish one of the
    desires of every college man, a visit to
    the Old World.</p>
            <p>The work of education seemed to
                           <pb id="pickens134" n="134"/>
    offer a greater field of usefulness to a
    negro than any other profession. My
    own school struggles emphasized this
    thought. Back to the South was my
    inclination. That section is big with
    the destiny of the American negro, and
    therefore with the future of the negro
    race in the whole world. After considering 
    the timely offers of various
    educational authorities, including those
    of Tuskegee and the American Missionary 
    Association, I decided to begin
    work in the American Missionary
    Association College at Talladega, Ala.,
    where I have been teacher of languages
    since leaving Yale in 1904. My experience 
    of the usefulness of this institution, 
    as well as gratitude for the greatest
    of benefits, made this decision logical
    and good.</p>
            <p>On my way from New England to
    Talladega a visit to the World's Exposition 
    in St. Louis brought me by Little
                         <pb id="pickens135" n="135"/>   
    Rock, Ark., and the scenes and memories 
    of public-school days, the “skiff-ferry” 
    and the “stave factory”  -  and
    the colored citizens and a few white
    friends gave me the biggest and most
    pleasant reception of all my life.</p>
            <p>In the last six years it has been
    impossible for me to supply all the
    demands upon my energies as a lecturer
    or speaker at institutions and gatherings. 
    I have visited nearly all of the
    important negro schools of the South,
    and it has given me a good look into
    the condition and needs of my people.
    In 1906 I took up Esperanto, and after
    a correspondence with Esperantists all
    over the world, I was awarded a diploma
    by the British Esperanto Association.
    In 1908 Fisk University honored me
    with the degree of Master of Arts.</p>
            <p>In 1905 I met the most helpful and
    the most enduring good fortune of all my
    life, the traditional and the real “best
                        <pb id="pickens136" n="136"/>   
    woman in the world.”  Miss Minnie
    Cooper McAlpine who like myself was
    a product of the American Missionary
    Association work, had graduated at
    Tougaloo University in Mississippi and
    taught for three years in the American
    Missionary Association school at Meridian. 
    Since this meeting there have
    come in succession three of the brightest 
    and best joys that high heaven lends
    to earth, William, Jr., Hattie Ida and
    Ruby Annie.</p>
            <p>These latter years have a history of
    their own  -  which can be better written,
    perhaps, when they are seen through a
    perspective of years. Had I written
    of my boyhood experiences right on
    the heels of their passage, I could not
    have presented them in their truer
    light and proportion. The distance
    of years lends not merely enchantment
    but sobriety to the view.  </p>
            <p>To advance your life is but to push

    forward the front of your battle to

    Oh, the blessing of a boyhood that
    trains to endurance and struggle! To
    do the best one can, wherever placed,
    is a summary of all the rules of success.
    When I was in the public school of
    Argenta, Ark., I one day missed a word
    in the spelling class, the only word I
    missed during the five years, and a
    word that I could easily have spelled.
    The teacher took quick advantage of
    the careless trick of my brain and
    passed the word on to my neighbor
    without giving me the usual second
    trial, saying as he did so that a boy
    who had never missed a word had no
    right ever to miss a word. He wished,
    no doubt, to punish carelessness. That
    one missed word was more talked of
    among my fellows than all the hundreds 
    of words I had spelled, and I was
    taught the lesson that the man who
                        <pb id="pickens138" n="138"/>
    succeeds is never conceded the right
    to fail.</p>
            <p>I have learned that righteousness
    and popularity are not always yoke-fellows, 
    and sometimes run a contrary 
    course. From early boyhood
    I was laughed at among my fellows for
    the contemptible weakness of totally
    abstaining from strong drink and tobacco, 
    while in my manhood the best
    of my fellows commend the abstention
    as a virtue. I have learned the uplifting 
    lesson that the real heart of humanity 
    appreciates manhood above things;
    as a copperless struggler I was often
    accorded a place above the possessor
    of gold. I have been impressed, not
    that every single thought and deed in
    the world is good, but that the resultant
    line of humanity's movement is in the
    direction of righteousness, and that
    human life and the world are on the
    whole good things.</p>
