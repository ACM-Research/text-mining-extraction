        <div2 type="entry">
          <head>December 10 1860. -</head>
          <p>We came up very nicely on the 3d Mr Grimball Ella Lotty
Harry &amp; Racky, the sky terrier, a most intelligent and affectionate
little dog. When Lewis was in Liverpool, Bob Miller
gave him this puppy, &amp; he brought it home, we are all attached
to her, and she enjoys the change as much as any of us. - I am
to keep her until Lewis marries, then his wife, if fond of Dogs,
is to take her.</p>
          <p>John is as happy as a child and so much like a child that
I agree with Lewis in thinking the only change in him is that
he has grown, he enjoys a joke &amp; makes fun but - he is terribly
obstinate, which is an ascertained fact - consequently when
John says he <sic corr="won't">wont</sic> do anything I
<sic corr="don't">dont</sic> like to interfere. Lewis
has come to the conclusion that his prospects up here are not
worth anything, his practise is pretty much a family affair,
and not at all progressive, on the contrary, the life of several
old people would close it, except at home, his Grandfather and
Mrs Wayne, so he intends going to Charleston and attending
Medical Lectures, and practising there. So there is every prospect
of our having the 6 boys at home next summer. I think I shall
take a travel off somewhere, &amp; relieve myself of the Housekeeping.
I have been trying to persuade <sic corr="Berkley">Berkly</sic>
to got married, he has been
<pb id="grim2" n="2"/>
set up with 5 thousand dollars, he had saved 1 thousand himself, 
and is so saving I suppose he will soon have 10 thousand: and
I am afraid be a miser too; which is hateful.  I wish some of them
could get married and settled off.  - Elizabeth has of course to 
wait until a good offer comes, but the boys can ask.  -</p>
          <p>Mr W. Heyward has promised us a visit, and now that 
the house has got fixed, I shall be very glad for him to come.
Lewis tells me Mrs Bulo laughed a great deal about her visit up 
here, and the manner in which Mrs Manigault &amp; Mrs Grimball were
taken in by her. She is not a nice person,  I am afraid much of
the scandal retailed about her, is true. She had very little to do
with me, but was much thrown with Charlotte, riding with her on
horseback, &amp;c.  Papa paid the 4 thousand to the Factors that
Charles owed them.</p>
          <p>We came up in the cars with Major Wharley and his new
young wife, an English lady, &amp; her baby, she is much taller than
her old husband; and looks like his daughter; she was poor, or
I am sure she could never have married that blear-eyed old
creature.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="entry">
          <head><corr>December</corr> 15 <corr> 1860</corr></head>
          <p>It seems strange that we should be in the midst
of a revolution so quiet, and plentiful, &amp; corn for table 
up here. Everything goes on as usual, the planting,  the
negroes, all just the same; &amp; a great Empire tumbling to pieces
about us; and a great pressure in the money market in all parts
of the country; <hi rend="italics">we</hi>strange to say; were never so easy,  and I
<pb id="grim3" n="3"/>
hope thankful. Went yesterday to see Charlotte, Mrs Wayne, &amp;
Papa found the last at home, Charlotte had gone up to Mrs
Barings on a visit. They think of purchasing a place in Buncomb
and of Mrs B's place. Mrs Wayne begged to be excused she was
putting her garret to rights.</p>
          <p>Charles is coming up <sic corr="to-day">to day</sic> on his way
to Philadelphia
to bring Mrs Britten &amp; Elizabeth home. I have made up my mind
now for E to remain until January and do not care for her to
come before. -</p>
          <p>We pass our evenings very pleasantly with music and
reading &amp; sewing &amp; talking, the boys Lewis &amp;
John are agreeable.
L belongs to a company in this parish and seems most anxious for
a war, a restless young man: I do hope there will be no war, 
but a peaceful arrangement of our difficulties. -</p>
          <p>Mr Aiken paid us a long morning visit waiting for some
friends by the cars. Mr &amp; Mrs James baby &amp; nurse, she was a Miss
Lowndes and he a rich New York beau, a funny time they take for
their visit; but her Mother &amp; father live on Santee in winter
where he had a plantation they are all rich and high born. Mrs
Robert Lowndes was a Miss Livingston the daughter of Mrs Maturin
Livingston who was a Miss Lewis, the only child of Gen. Lewis
who left a fortune of a Million which Mrs M. L. on her death
divided equally among her 9 children giving thereby great
satisfaction,
to all of them. I recollect Mrs Robert Lowndes when she
first came to Charleston as a bride, and a most beautiful bride,
<pb id="grim4" n="4"/>
she was dressed in the highest fashion &amp; taste &amp; exceedingly
refined and elegant looking.</p>
          <p>Received a letter from Elizabeth today, she &amp; her
Aunt will leave <unclear>Norwood</unclear> the 1 week in January
it is very cold
there now every thing covered with snow. -</p>
          <p>An envelope came containing cards from Emma Watts &amp;
Lieut. Carr U.S.A.  just married. When her father died nearly
2 years since the family had each 10 thousand dollars which is
a very neat fortune and Emma although not beautiful is very sensible
and amiable. It seems to me all the world are getting
married except my children. I wish a suitable offer would come
in <sic corr="Elizabeth's">Elizabeths</sic> way &amp;
that it would please her to accept it &amp; that
Berkley could find some nice girl with a little money to get
married to. John will be obliged to resign &amp; then he must try
something else. - All this troubles me.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="entry">
          <head>29 December</head>
          <p>The Xmas passed very pleasantly with us, the
boys were all here and we had a tree fixed off in a very lively
and interesting manner with little <unclear>Canibusses</unclear>,
ships, tables,
chairs &amp; dolls dressed, and lighted by little tapers. Papa
dined with us, and we had a nice dinner and were pleasant. John
has resigned and gone to town to offer his services to the Governor,
he is very much enchanted at getting rid of a profession
his heart was <hi rend="italics">not</hi> very much interested
in, and William and
Berkley are very sorry he has given up his support. It is a
great addition to Mr <sic corr="Grimball's">Grimballs</sic>
expenses 3 hundred dollars a year. -</p>
          <pb id="grim5" n="5"/>
          <p>Mrs Wayne has been talking in her flighty style about
giving her Palmetto nephews a New <sic corr="Year's">Years</sic> party.
I said what I
could to prevent her going to this unnecessary expense for she
has not threshed her crop or sold it and has not been able give
her negroes clothes, this winter, but now the matter is at rest,
for the boys have been obliged to go to Town. Fort Moultry has
been abandoned, and the U.S.  troops commanded by Major Anderson
have been clandestinely removed to Fort <sic corr="Sumter">Sumpter</sic>,
so the troops
have been ordered off, and are marching round &amp; round, to show
their spirit and excitement.  -</p>
          <p>Daisy Barnwell dined with Lotty on Thursday &amp; I think
is a very fast little girl: she seemed wild with delight at
John &amp; Arthur flirting with her: &amp; looked very pretty, Lotty is
to dine with her <sic corr="to-day">to day</sic> if she can get there.</p>
          <p>Mr Grimball is suffering from an attack of his difficult 
breathing, last night I had to get up &amp; make the fire,
he took his remedy but it does not relieve very soon.</p>
          <p>A Plantation life is a very active one. This morning
I got up late having been disturbed in the night, hurried down
to have something arranged for breakfast, Ham, &amp; eggs, wrote a
letter to Charles in answer to one he wrote about
<sic corr="John's">Johns</sic> resigning,
disapproving of it. Had prayers, got off the boys to town. Had
work cut out, gave orders about dinner, had the horse feed fixed 
in hot water, had the box filled with cork: - went to see about 
the carpenters working at the negro houses, where there are men
mending chimneys,  white washing, &amp; these carpenters Mr Grimball
<pb id="grim6" n="6"/>
told me he wished me to see about every day, &amp; now I have to cut
out flannel jackets, and alter some work.  -</p>
          <p>Amy's leg continues very bad, I don't know when she
will get better, a most provoking thing, for it is owing to her
own stupidity.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="entry">
          <head>31 December</head>
          <p>the last day of the year, a gloomy, wet  
day, which were it not for the busy occupations of each hour
would be very trying to the spirits.  - Went to Church yesterday,
and heard an excellent sermon from Mr Dickson, a retrospect of
the past year, a very instructive train of thought. I have so
many mercies to be thankful for, and here, while numbers are 
homeless, am enjoying a most comfortable establishment and what
a poor creature I am, little deserving of any mercy.  -</p>
          <p>I was thinking over the children this morning and I
find a loving and hopeful feeling for all of them.  As people
get old they become more indifferent and are spared much annoyance
by not feeling or seeing things which when they were young
almost crazed them.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="entry">
          <head>1 January 1861 </head>
          <p>The year began with clouds &amp; rain. I
went out with Josey to Drive as Lucius was sent to the Depot
expecting Mr Hayward &amp; visited Mrs Wayne, Papa &amp; Mrs Manigault, 
Papa out, Mrs Wayne preparing for a grand party, which must have 
<sic corr="disappointed">disapointed</sic> her, as it
rained all the evening, Sent in our
excuses, the boys had already done so. Charlotte was very busy
putting up curtains and looking dirty &amp; ragged,  it was evident
she felt no superstition about the first of the year being a
<pb id="grim7" n="7"/>
pattern for all the rest. She is getting so set looking that
it spoils her appearance.  I feel very dull about the boys, 
they may all be called out to fight. John has offered his services
to the Governor for active duty,  &amp; all the others are in Military
companies and of course will have to be exposed. I sent them
down a New Year wish, &amp; if we never meet again in this world,
my last greeting to them was a sincere prayer for their salvation.
Lewis went off today to Town.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="entry">
          <head><corr>January</corr> 7th</head>
          <p>Elizabeth
arrived from the North with her Aunt,
who went on to Butlers Island, where she is to stay for some time,
a month at least. E. looks very well in health and in spirits,
and gives a pleasant account of her visit. John has been appointed
Lieutenant in the State Service, and is now at Fort Moultry,
where he is rather uncomfortable.  -</p>
          <p>William was at the Arsenal with his Company, Lewis
is in some trouble about his commission and has gone to
Town <sic corr="to-day">to
day</sic> to see the Governor about it, he, the Gov. does not seem to
be a very military chief and consequently is in rather a tight
place. Berkley has joined the Sumpter Guards, which is an elderly 
and sedate <sic corr="body">bodey</sic> of men with an elderly
and sedate Captain,
John Russel of King Street, a book seller. - Charles sent me word
by Elizabeth that Harry thought it proper for the security of
the Northern property to have it made over to himself but felt
a delicacy in proposing it. I spoke to Papa, &amp; he wrote to Harry
this morning, - &amp; sent the letter by Lewis. E. has gone to town
to see her friends &amp; brothers.</p>
        </div2>
        <div2 type="entry">
          <head><corr>January</corr>
 12th</head>
          <p>Lewis returned from Town with an uncomfortable
<pb id="grim8" n="8"/>
account of the Forts, <sic corr="Sumter">Sumpter</sic> is still
in charge of Major Anderson
and a vessel the Star of the West with men &amp; supplies on board
for the Fort, was fired into and prevented from communicating.
Major Anderson declared the Port <sic corr="blockaded">blocaded</sic>,
and that he would fire
on any boats coming in or going out. And after a spirited letter
from the Governor, requested that Lieut. Talbot be permitted to
go to Washington with letters which was granted. The Fort has to
be taken. William with his Company will be at Morris's Island,
and Arthur with him. John in Fort Moultry.  If I were to allow
myself to think of these things I should be wild; but there is
no use. Went yesterday to see Charlotte, Papa and Mrs Wayne,
found C. &amp; Mrs W at home. C's governess not come which rather
surprises her.  Mrs W. tells me Mrs Lewis's governess has left her,
Mrs L.  has a favorite maid, Emma, a very light
<sic corr="Mulatto">Mulatoe</sic> &amp; her son,
who tell her every thing which goes on in her house, and made a
great many extraordinary communications about the Governess,
which she refused to submit to and left. I do not think my cousin
Annie will ever have a Governess. Mrs Stevens has, C. says,
quite a nice one, and she takes to flirting with Mr Stevens
greatly to the disgust of Mrs S.  who flirted away most violently
with a Dr Foster, a homeopathic man, and says openly she does
not care for her husband, yet will not willingly submit to his
attentions to the Governess. I think upon the whole they are
rather trying additions to <sic corr="one's">ones</sic> family,
I am very thankful there
is no need of one with us. Mr Grimball went off to Town the day
<pb id="grim9" n="9"/>
Lewis came up, he must have gone at any rate, for he said he
wanted to see the boys. Every one feels restless &amp; excited in
these transition times, I only hope we may have a peaceful
settlement of this <sic corr="separation">sepparation</sic>.
I expect up Mr G. &amp; E. <sic corr="to-day">to day</sic>,
&amp; Mrs Wayne is to dine with us and to hear the news, &amp; Papa
is coming too. -</p>
          <p>Mr Grimball &amp; Elizabeth arrived from Town and had seen
John. Mrs. Wayne dined, Papa arrived here before we had finished
our soup and seemed altogether in a bad humor, in answer to most
news he said he did not believe a word of it: and
<sic corr="alluded">aluded</sic> in
rather a bantering tone to the fact of the raw Carolina recruits
running at, or even before the fire of the English, Elizabeth
fresh from Town and seeing her brothers, heartily earnest in the
service of the State, said anyone who says the Carolina troops
would run, should be shot. Papa was very angry, and the next day
wrote me a letter, the thing will of course drop. -</p>
          <p>We all feel very anxious about the taking of Fort
<sic corr="Sumter">Sumpter</sic>, it is in <sic corr="negotiation">negociation</sic> but that failing, must be got for
the State even at great loss of life, and in view of this I wake
in the night and pray most heartily to my Father in Heaven, and
my merciful Savior to save us or we perish.</p>
          <p>Went to see Papa on his return from Town, he had an
attack last night, and seemed very tired.</p>
          <p>Had a nice visit from Mrs Barnwell and Ann, she is
very clever.  We were talking of men,  I said the result of my
<pb id="grim10" n="10"/>
experience was to say, if asked for advice, if you want to
do so you had better do it, and if you don't  want to do so you
had better not do it, for I never found my advice was attended
to, Ann said if she ever had an offer when the man was on his
knees, she would make him promise all sorts of things; - I said
they never went on their knees, &amp; asked Margaret if Mr Barnwell
offered himself on his knees. Ann said I can never imagine Papa
the least sentimental &amp; think he must have proposed as a passing
remark between a conversation about the crops. In view of Mr
<sic corr="Barnwell's">Barnwells</sic> very stiff &amp; settled manner,
this is quite funny.</p>
          <p>In looking over my account of things I find I neglected
to notice a very handsome entertainment which Mr Lewis
gave to introduce his daughter, the boys were all invited, and
Berkley &amp; William went. They arrived at Ashapoo in time for Lunch
&amp; afterwards went out with horses, riding or driving, &amp; rowing
on the river. Had a very handsome dinner, sat down 30; and in
the evening music from Town, and a band with some outside additions,
&amp; danced until five o'clock they then went to their rooms,
and after resting 3 hours had breakfast, hot cakes,
<sic corr="omelet">omlet</sic>, sausages<corr>,</corr>
spare ribs, which B. said were not spare at all. Just our
boys, and Frank Frost &amp; Jim Fraser even slept in the same room,
Mr Lewis doing the honors, the rest sat up.  Most of the party
were to return to the City by the 1 o'clock train, our boys came
by the early train, &amp; Mr Lewis must have been making arrangements
for a long time, and succeeded. -</p>
          <p>Elizabeth <sic corr="stayed">staid</sic> while in Town with her
Aunt, they are
<pb id="grim11" n="11"/>
in a great state of excitement about the Forts, &amp; Martin &amp;
Berkly in military exposure. M. has gone to Castle Pinckney,
and as he is delicate I predict that he will either be made ill,
or a great deal better by the exposure.  -</p>
          <p>Papa has determined this winter of all times to remove
Elizabeth <sic corr="Morris'">Morris</sic> remains from the
vault at Morrisania and put it
in the Lowndes vault in Charleston &amp; also Ralph and put him
into a grave up here at the Bluff (?) Church for when the property
is sold the vault must be emptied of the remains, (Papa had to
give up this removal),  for which he has provided a sum of 5 hundred
dollars to get another vault at a Church near by.  - Mr  Whaly
says Mrs Wayne is coming to perfect poverty, but she will entertain
to the end, she has Friday for her receptions days, I like
to go, it amuses me everything is so odd, shoes under the chairs
and bags of dirty calico full of feathers on chairs for cushions. - 
She reminds me of Grandmama who always at Morrisania had her shoes,
hat and shawl in the drawing room. -</p>
          <p>The first of this week Mr Grimball sent 10 men, under
the charge of Lewis, to work at the Fort which they are putting
up at the mouth of the Edisto river to protect  the coast.  Col.
Jenkins sent 6 hands, his son Dr. Paul,  3, Col. Ashe 10,  &amp; they
all went together. Lewis had some stores,  &amp; Georgy Jenkins, who
went with his <sic corr="Father's">Fathers</sic> hands, told
Lewis not to trouble himself,
for he intended taking a whole sheep. Papa went while on one of
his visits to the City, to see the Gov. and told him during the
War of 1812, with England the Coast had been surveyed &amp; it was
<pb id="grim12" n="12"/>
judged unnecessary to build Forts as owing to the bars at
the mouth of the rivers that they were
<sic corr="inaccessible">inaccessable</sic>. The Gov.
thanked Papa for his advice but - they are putting up two
Forts, &amp; Papa says he will not give a cent, or send a hand;
so says the Miser, Ephraim Bainard, but others send, Mr
Barnwell and others.  Mr Grimball preferred sending here to Morris's
Island.</p>

          <p>Lewis returned and had a very nice time was
handsomely entertained and enjoyed the change, the negroes
seemed to like it too.  Mr John Townsand was very much interested
in the Fort  -</p>
          <p>Things seem to progress, the Southern States are
going out one after another and the border states undetermined. -</p>
          <p>We dined with Papa last week, a very handsome affair,
and the party consisted of Mrs Wayne, ourselves &amp; Miss Butler,
Charlotte's new Governess, he gave us a nice dinner. Charlotte
&amp; her little girls &amp; Governess took lunch with us on Saturday,
we had music, &amp; cake, &amp; wines, and I enjoyed Charlotte's society.
She says Miss <unclear>Butles</unclear> seems to be a very
pleasant tempered person
with rather more of the Irish accent than she expected. She
hopes she will answer her purposes for 2 years, and seems very
much concerned to have these children well educated. -</p>
          <p>Things seem to progress in a slow but certain way.
John is now in command of a Steamboat to watch the harbor, he
alternates with Pilot and I hope will get paid for his services. -</p>
          <pb id="grim13" n="13"/>
          <p>Charles has resigned, and intends offering his
services to the State of Georgia. I am sorry he will lose his
pay, but the State will pay. Lewis made a visit to the Fort at
Edisto to see if Bing Smith intended resigning his place of
Captain, for then Lewis would try for it.  -</p>
          <p>He went down in the boat and had lunch here, at 11
o'clock, and the next day returned &amp; dined here.  4 went with
him, W. Simons,  Megget, Weston, Walters,  - but Bing Smith
chooses to keep his post.  -</p>
          <p>We returned Mrs <sic corr="Barnwell's">Barnwells</sic> visit the other
day &amp;
found her at home; she expressed herself very much concerned
by the ill health of her husband. Last summer Dr <unclear>Ogiier</unclear>
said
he ought to go away &amp;  take care or himself he said he could not
leave his business, &amp; now he looks very badly has most painful
symptoms, palpitation of the heart, &amp; all that, and is afraid
of a disease of that organ. I met with an annoying accident a
few days since, in walking up the road.  I took off my glove,
a large dog skin one, and having lately worn on my little finger
my wedding ring, because it had become too small, it slipped off
and I have not been able to find it. I am going to purchase
another &amp; in the mean time wear the ring belonging to my 
eye-glasses, which had become loosened. -</p>

          <p>Lewis went to the City &amp; bought for me an
old fashioned wed. ring for $3,  a very satisfactory arrangement. -
<pb id="grim14" n="14"/>
Lewis saw all the boys in Town, John alternates with Peter
in harbor duty, and has a boy Bacot with him which gives him
4 hours sleep, he always has some man from the City Companies
with him. Berkly, who is in the Sumpter Guards, said when he went
out there were only 4 men in the <sic corr="detachment">detatchment</sic> fit for duty,
Berkly, Wilkins,  himself &amp; 2 others. The rest were horribly sea
sick, or very drunk. Oh! my country men!</p>
          <p>Lewis is now proposing to himself to apply for a
commission in the Army of the State. Poor Notty's boy, I wish
some thing might suit him.  -</p>
          <p>He had a very nice photograph of himself taken, and
gave it to me.  He is quite a good looking follow. - Charles has
resigned, and <hi rend="italics">is in</hi> the service of the State of Georgia, Lewis
met him going to Town on Public business when he came up. -
Mrs Butler still at Butler's Island. Went to see Juliet Elliott
yesterday, she is up for the Spring, she says, unless there is
a war. - She looks wonderfully, and is as usual, a gossiping,
frivolous woman - but I do not think her gifts are many, and
perhaps she does as well as she can. She told me Mrs Lucia
Lowndes was in a miserable fix with her two eldest daughters,
Lucia &amp; Emily, they had not spoken to her for several years,
and lived while they remained at Litchfield entirely apart,
and when she came back which she did last fall, refused to
accompany her. Lucia says she intends to be a Governess, &amp;
Emily says she intends to be a <sic corr="Child's">Childs</sic> nurse.  What a terrible
<pb id="grim15" n="15"/>
situation,  these unprotected girls will be in there. I told
Juliet in a case like this there must be faults on both sides.
She seemed to take the part of the Mother. -</p>
          <p>Charlotte prefers our meetings to take place in the
afternoons as the morning is altogether taken up with her
<sic corr="children's">childrens</sic> lessons. Went last
Saturday although it was an afternoon
cloudy and the day had been rainy.  We talked a little, and
had tea, and came home refreshed. Mr John Elliott has been
engaged to take charge of the Church up here and as Mrs LaRoche 
is not able to come this winter, Elizabeth has taken upon herself
to play on the organ and lead the singing. - 
Ella is to go with her, &amp;  Miss Butler, Charlotte's Governess.
Mrs. Wayne had a Lunch yesterday, to which we went. She expected
Mrs. Barnwell, &amp; her daughter, but they did not come, Mr.
<unclear>B</unclear> had
unexpectedly returned. She expected Charlotte but she did not
come on account of the girls &amp; their lessons. -</p>
          <p>Mrs. Brown and her step daughter came, she is the wife of
the Methodist Missionary, quite a good looking &amp; educated woman.
E. stopped at the Church to practise on the organ, &amp; came to
the lunch.  Mrs.  Wayne had adorned her person in her peculiar
style, a bunch of black lace in front of her head, a pink rose
on each side like two horns, and pink strings hanging down.
Her own perfect satisfaction with herself was pleasant to see;
we had sausages, lamb chops, rice, &amp; sweet meats, and she is
very hospitable. -</p>
          <p>Mr. Lewis has taken rooms at the Miles house, and Mrs.
<pb id="grim16" n="16"/>
John Vanderhorst is introducing his daughter, Julia, they
have receptions. - He seems very fond of his children, &amp; to be
trying to make Julia have a nice time. -</p>
          <p>Charlotte, her girls &amp; Governess came to tea, an
unsettled looking afternoon.  The music on Sunday was not as good

          <p>Annie H. is quite a nice girl, she has taken charge
of her little sisters since her Mother's death, and looks like
an amiable, motherly girl. She took the Sulphur Baths this

          <p>Mr Grimball went to Town to see about the
boys.  We understood they were to be ordered down to Morris's
Island &amp; he wished to give them, William &amp; Arthur, a little
money towards fixing themselves comfortably. He found they were
<hi rend="italics">not</hi> at that time ordered: so he left an order
for $50 with W.
to be used if they seem to require it.</p>
          <p>Papa went down on Monday and we went over to pay a
visit to the Aikens, found Mrs A. at home, better I think, and 
Miss A. talked away pleasantly, as usual.</p>
          <p>On Tuesday visited Mr Elliott and his wife and invited
<pb id="grim17" n="17"/>
them to dine with us the next day. Mrs Wayne<corr>,</corr> Mrs Vanderhorst
were also of the party and the dinner was quite a pleasant
one. I am very glad the thing is over, for it was to be done.

I have been reading some old letters for the last week, and they
interest me so very much, they are from my Grandmother Manigault
to my Mother, and there are also letters from some of her Sisters
to her, they commence in 1807, about which time my Mother was
married, and end in 1822 in which year, the 22 of September, she
died, being crushed in the fall of the house they lived in, on
Sulivan's Island, during the storm of that year. It is the history
of a whole family, contained in these letters, and the lesson,
the shortness of life. These letters give an insight into the
domestic life of very accomplished people, and the charm which
elegant tastes surround life with, are very perceptible. My
Grandmother's style is very fine, so simple, &amp; so clever, &amp; she
describes the events daily passing around her, in a fascinating
manner.  My Grandfather lived in South Carolina and determined
to move to Philadelphia where he died soon after the purchase of
an estate in the country, of <sic corr="Apoplexy">Apaplexy</sic>,
brought on by anxiety of
mind, &amp; worry. In 1815 Emma died of consumption, in 1817 Caroline
<pb id="grim18" n="18"/>
died, in 1818 Charlotte died, the tome of these letters, the
gradual change from full happiness to the sad desolation of
being nearly alone, just Ella &amp; I with her, is very painful,
the effort to be cheerful, the yearning for Mama's society.
She died 2 years after. It was not usual then for people to
express themselves on religious subjects as they do now, and
therefore it is not proper to judge of my Grandmother's feelings
on this subject by what she does not say.  -</p>
          <p>In the first place, her husband, who was a most devoted
one, died when they had been married 22 years. My Mother
died when she had been married 16 years. This March we have been
married 31 years, is this not a cause for thankfulness. Here is
a man cultivated, very much in love with his old wife of 51
years and, although not in robust health, getting on, more amiable
than he was, more easy in his means and my children, such
as ought to satisfy any woman, - but I wish they, the elder
ones, could be settled, married well, it is for the happiness
of a woman &amp; for that of a man. I could wish that Elizabeth was
well married and Berkley &amp; Lewis; William might wait a little
longer but if anyone very desirable should offer I would not
object. I cannot alter this, and I think it better so, than
married in an unsuitable way. -</p>
          <p>Elizabeth went to pay a visit to Mrs Vanderhorst,
we expect them back <sic corr="to-day">to day</sic>. -</p>
          <p>The pledge Lewis gave his Father the last Spring in
<pb id="grim19" n="19"/>
March he faithfully kept, and when it expired, he said he
would not take another until he found it necessary. - He seems
so unsettled, so restless, I am truly sorry for him, and I 
pray for him. -</p>

          <p>Mr Grimball wondered at my enjoyment of the old
letters, and says he does not like to hear them read, although
he did not know any of the people. I say, for that very reason
I enjoy “them”, they are no longer here but
I rejoice that such
charming, elegant people belonged to me, &amp; their memory &amp; their
lives, delight me. My Grandmother I loved, and she more than
returned the affection. Aunt Caroline we also knew. Aunt Charlotte,
Aunt Harriet, Uncle Wilcocks, Miss Mease, Mr Vaughn, Mr
Short, my Great Grandmother, Aunt Deas, Aunt George, Aunt
Balfour<corr>,</corr> 
the Smiths. Incidents in the letters bring them all to me again. -</p>
          <p>Elizabeth returned from <sic corr="Chickasee">Chicasee</sic>
with Arnoldus who
remained with us until Monday, and then went on to the City.  He
dined at <sic corr="Papa's">Papas</sic> on Saturday. In the
afternoon we had an early tea,
Mrs Barnwell, Ann, &amp; Emma Manigault were here, and it was pleasant.
Elizabeth had a nice time at Chickasee. - They all dined with
Charlotte on Monday. - We have had snow. -</p>

          <p>We found that the list of Navy Officers

rectified, or to find out why John was left out. - John says
they have not come down to him yet, and he is acting Lieutenant,
and receiving 15 hundred dollars, is in active service. -</p>
          <p>I had a very pleasant visit, the boys were affectionate
and attentive, and I had a good shopping, the children
are pleased with what I got. - Mrs Wilkins was suffering from
her eyes and Eliza was not feeling well. -</p>
          <p>Papa does his business very loosely and is now engaged
in a law suit with Simons about a canal. All the people who can
testify in his favor are dead, with but one or two exceptions,
and he has no papers to show. William has the case, and Nelson
Mitchel has been since engaged in it.  - Mrs Wayne has a Northern
woman to visit her just now, rather a second rate sort of a
person.  - Mrs Mitchel.</p>
          <p>Things are just the same in regard to the Fort,
Anderson is now to be starved out. - All this time he has been
allowed to furnish himself from the Market with fresh Provisions, -
which is carrying out Scripture “feeding our enemy, and doing
good to those who do evil to us.”</p>
          <p>Charlotte has Mrs Bulow &amp; Mrs Gummage on a visit to
her. C. did not altogether like them as visitors but she asked
them last Spring &amp; felt herself obliged to confirm it this April.
They are much talked about and therefore not desirable friends,
Mrs B. a pretty, clever, coarse woman, with a little dog &amp; a

          <p>Things seem at last to have reached the
War point. The 17th Regiment has been ordered down to Morris's
Island, and The Northern Government have sent to inform the
Southern that they intend to reinforce the Forts, and collect
the revenue. A fleet is expected off the Harbour, and every
thing is in a state of preparation. - 4 of the boys are on duty,
Berkley in the Sumpter Guards, and Arthur &amp; William in the Cadet
Riflemen. Lewis wants to volunteer in the Sumpters, I think he
ought not. John is now on constant duty, and seems actively
engaged; he wrote to us yesterday that he had been in Town for
Anchors, and found the house deserted, only Adam, covered with
White Wash. He said he was alive but he could not say kicking,
for he could hardly move one leg before the other, he was so
tired. - Mr Grimball went down to see about the boys, and found
them all gone, he will return on Saturday, and then we shall hear.
All yesterday I was in a most terrible state of anxiety and
misery, about my boys - but I know my case is not different from
others. Mrs Elliott, the Mother of William's Captain, has her
<pb id="grim22" n="22"/>
only child down there, Mrs Lowndes her only son, &amp; many others,
but mine are very fine boys, and very dear to me, still they
must do their duty to their State; and I put my trust in my
God,  &amp; their God, my Savior &amp; their Savior, - and I Pray for
them &amp; for myself. - The Government at Washington seem full of
duplicity, and in looking back to the conduct of the seceding
States, there seems to have been a truthful and noble faith,
actuating <hi rend="italics">them</hi>.</p>
          <p>Fortunately, before things came to the War, the
interest was paid on the money at the North, and I have mine now
in Charleston, six hundred and ninety seven dollars. I am very
glad of this for it will help us through the Summer. -</p>
          <p>Mrs Bulow &amp; Mrs Gammage have left Charlotte, they 
were sent for. -</p>
          <p>Went to Papa's this morning he had been to Mr Barnwell

o'clock Gen. <sic corr="Beauregard">Boregeard</sic> demanded
the surrender of the Fort from
Anderson, he <sic corr="replied">replyed</sic> he could not
with honor, and this morning

          <p>Lewis went down yesterday afternoon and returned
today by an express train, he brings us news that Fort
<sic corr="Sumter">Sumpter</sic>
is given up, after a gallant defence, when Major Anderson evacuated
it, he requested to be allowed to salute his Flag, and Gen.
<pb id="grim23" n="23"/>
<sic corr="Beauregard">Boregard</sic> said, that he had defended
his command so bravely
that he should be permitted to do so. He wrote to his wife a
letter which was sent to Gen. B. to forward, he had to open it, -
and it was said to contain these words, among others, “My
Government have shamefully abandoned me<sic>”</sic>
and I shall now fight and
die like a man”.</p>
          <p>There were none killed on either side, the Fort has
been destroyed inside, - Officer's quarters burnt. -</p>
          <p>The men looked thin &amp; smoked up with the shells
which were most of them sent by Stephen's Battery; Fort Moultry
was uninjured, 5 men wounded in the evacuated Fort.  -</p>
          <p>How thankful we are, not however as much so as we
ought to be;</p>
          <p>Yesterday after Church I stopped to see Papa, this I
always do on Sunday and these visits are very pleasant to me. He
loves us all in his way &amp; gives me some oysters which he buys
from Mr La Roche's man who brings them for sale to the Church, -
and I hear family news. During this excitement and anxiety
I do not think Charlotte has been very kind in her manners, she
I have no doubt <hi rend="italics">felt</hi>, but on
such occasions people <hi rend="italics">ought</hi> to
express themselves to be understood, I find her an excellent,
well principled woman, with a disagreeable temper, &amp; no manners:
but in this world we must be thankful for the good we find in
those who belong to us, and not judge them too harshly. -
<pb id="grim24" n="24"/>
Charlotte has on many occasions been kind to us all, and I thank
her. Mr Grimball remained in Town until tomorrow. - Mrs Butler
writes to Papa that the Overseer came to her &amp; said he had a
letter from Mr Pierce Butler saying he must send a boat to take
his to W. Simon's &amp; send Eleck. She ordered him not to send the
boat and that Eleck was waiting on her. She said she was there,
in charge of the property, &amp; would continue so, has written to
Judge Law to confirm her action she says her case is a very
hard one, and she deplores it. Richard seems to be very ill,
spits blood, &amp; coughs, and she writes very
 <sic corr="woefully">wofully</sic> of him, &amp;
says she certainly will not leave him in Georgia, he has an
Overseer, and leaves things to him. Charles also has an Overseer,
and being engaged in fixing guns in Fort Pulasky, and expecting
to be in a steamer in coast guard all summer will be able to
visit his Plantation, &amp; see about his affairs, I don't think
Richard &amp; Charles get on very nicely, - &amp; I am sure it must be
Richard's fault, for Charles is a very kind, good tempered man,
and Richard has always been very self willed &amp; passionate. -</p>
          <p>Harry during the transaction of our business together
wrote me a very nice letter, he expresses a kind interest in my
boys and I love him for it; and he hopes still for a Reconstruction.
That may be hoped for but can <hi rend="italics">never, never, be</hi>.</p>
          <p>There have been too many bitter feelings between the
two sections and it seems to me it would have been just as reasonable
for us to be rearranged as British provinces soon after the
Revolution broke out, as for us to go back to a Government with
our taunting, Fanatic, Northern brothers. - </p>

          <p>This morning we received a very pleasant visit
from Charlotte, she feels but does not know how to express herself.
Mr Aiken also came over and paid a very pleasant visit.
He told us of the early history of General Boregard, he was a
graduate of West Point &amp; the second honour man, he had become
very much attached to Virginia Scott, the daughter of Gen. Scott,
&amp; was refused by both parents but accepted by the young lady,
she wrote to him but <hi rend="italics">his</hi> letters were
repressed and hers ceased
after a time. This preyed on her health, she went into the Catholic
Convent at George Town, and there died, before her death
she sent for Gen. Boregard and saw him, he explained to her that
he had always written, the letters were kept from her. She died,
but 6 Months after he married another. “Men have died and worms
have eaten them but not for love”. - (And now has a second wife).</p>
          <p>In this days paper there is an account of the evacuating
of the Fort <sic corr="Sumter">Sumpter</sic>. Anderson has gone to the Fleet, this
is the first time the U.S. Flag has been lowered, and now to the
<sic corr="Palmetto">Palmetoe</sic> Flag. -</p>
          <p>There seems to be a determination on the part of the
Northern Government to war with us. When Major Anderson fired the
salute to his Flag, 5 of his men were wounded, &amp; 1 of them died
immediately, the other not expected to live. This is very strange.
I think my State has behaved most entirely according to the dictates 
of humanity, &amp; true courage, in the treatment of the people
in this Fort, they were fed, and beaten, &amp; honourably dismissed. -</p>
          <pb id="grim26" n="26"/>
          <p>We have done well, &amp; I this morning read a commendation
in the papers “the World”, an Abolition journal, of
the conduct of South Carolina,  “throughout this contest &amp; since
secession<sic>”</sic>. The unselfish bravery with which
she had conducted
herself”. - May God bless and keep us, is my prayer, and may
peace be restored to these States, may we each, North, &amp; South -
Governed by those who best understand our rights &amp; our wants, I
mean ourselves, be good neighbors &amp; help each other on in the
road to prosperity. -</p>
          <p>On Sunday the scene in St. Philips was very affecting.
Our Bishop Davis, now very feeble and blind was led up to the
pulpit and returned thanks to Almighty God for his protection &amp;
his mercies. He, too had a relative among the troops. - Mrs
Wayne went down to the City on Saturday and the cars being very
much crowded &amp; late in getting down.  Lewis had to charge himself
with the getting these two Mrs W. &amp;her Mitchel in a carriage.
It was 12 o'clock at night before they all got at home. Lewis

up here. Mr Elliott said he

and Harry although he
has been learning his for 6 years did not know it so said Mrs
Barnwell of her two, Richard &amp; Ella, she said she felt as if
she would be humiliated, I told Mr Elliott of Harry's
<sic corr="deficiency">deficiancy</sic>.
So last Sunday the children went up, after a most charming
sermon addressed to the parents, and said their chatecism very
well, H. had learnt his all the week, &amp; Mr Elliott gave them
some books which they either are to read &amp; keep, or return. -

          <p>Yesterday Mrs Wayne came late &amp; spent the evening. She
took tea, &amp; went away at 1/2 eleven, she gave the history of her
Mitchel. She was married at the age of 16 to a young man named
Hardenbrook, he had a large fortune, settled it seems on his
children. They were divorced, and she took her maiden name, the
children are given to the father's Mother &amp; she is allowed to
see them. 2 little boys, 1, 4, the other 7. Mr Hardenbrook this
lady says is a very abandoned man. I do not think her manners
<pb id="grim28" n="28"/>
impress favorably. - Mrs Wayne gave a very amusing account of her
ox, &amp; little blue cart getting Mrs Rosalie Mitchel's heavy
baggage to the cars, the ox several times took to the woods &amp;
swamp. This animal is large and harnessed with blinds, an old
horse fixing.  Mr Lewis has hired Russell Middleton's house on
South bay for the summer, this Mrs L. does not like the place, is
rather too public. She is shy, &amp; not always attentive to her
appearance. I am glad of her being there for I like her. - The
Governess they had early in the winter was a very mischief
making woman, she wrote notes to Mr Lewis, noticing Annie's
treatment of Julia, her step daughter, trying to excite him
against her. - Spoke in a most disorganizing way to the servants. -</p>
          <p>The last visit we paid to Mr Barnwell, Ann spoke in
great disgust of Miss Juliet Elliott's malicious style of remark,
she said several things calculated to excite them against
Charlotte &amp; Heyward. Ann, &amp; her Mother said this did not have
that effect, but disgusted them with Juliet. - Poor old woman,

reside for the summer at Grass <sic corr="Knoll">Knowl</sic>,

had arrived in Darien to take <sic corr="possession">posession</sic>
as soon as she left.
We hear that she has gone North so suddenly that she had not
time to write; if she can live there without any annoyance from
owning Southern Property, or rather being supported by it, I
think she has done best for herself. For 34 years, ever since
her marriage, she had enjoyed a degree of affluence and fashion,
there, which must have made her identify herself with the people
&amp; with the place. She is now a very stout old woman; &amp; these
comforts which she has there must be very dear to her. She has
been much separated from her own family, and is accustomed to
her luxury, &amp; her loneliness. - I hope she may enjoy the former,

as L. is friendly with <sic corr="Simons">Simonds</sic> it was not very pleasant. In this
talk Papa spoke in a very irritated way to Simons and in consequence 
of it he had forbidden any negro to pass through the canal,

not understand about business, and in not conciliating in his

Butler, she had arrived at her comfortable home and seemed very
thankful, gave the girls some pretty worked handkerchiefs, &amp;
me a lovely wooden butter tub, the top of which got broken in
the Packing. - Elizabeth wrote to her, I think she will get along
very comfortably there, her affairs seem very much involved. She
wishes Papa to let her Mortgage the Money he has given her, 19
thousand dollars, &amp; 10 thousand dollars, to Papa Lewis

and all the world to Elizabeth. E. said she had been struck
with a remark in a Novel of Thackery's she had lately read, “to
a good natured man the world is pleasant and kind, but to one 
who is misanthropic the world is very crooked and unhappy” so,
if she would feel more interest in people they would please her,
and she would be happier. -</p>
          <p>We have had a constant succession of afternoon 
visitors, and Papa has been rather struck with it. -</p>
          <p>In this dreary world where feeling, except for self,
seems no where, it is affecting to hear of such love as this. -
Papa went the other day to see Mr Alfred Huger and said he was
waiting to go to Buncomb with his daughter Charlotte. He looked
at him and his face all alive with feeling said “Morris, is
she any thing like the one she was called after.<corr>”</corr> 
He assured him
his daughter was altogether lovely and of good report. To which
Mr Huger <sic corr="replied">replyed</sic> <corr>“</corr> 
I have never for one hour had her out of my
mind, the pressure of her hand, when she parted with me I still
feel, and I would <sic corr="to-day">to day</sic>, old and
crippled as I am, walk a mile
to serve any one I thought it would please her that I
should. <corr>”</corr></p>
          <p>The history of this heart affair is this; when Mr
Huger was a young man, he addressed my Mother's sister, Charlotte
Manigault, and she loved him, but my Grandmother could not 
reconcile herself to another of her daughters being, as she said,
sacrificed at the South, so she induced Charlotte to refuse him
<pb id="grim38" n="38"/>
and I think she never got over it, her younger Sister Harriet
married, and she attended the death beds of 2 Sisters, and
died herself, a victim to consumption. So, in fact, my Grandmother
sacrificed her to the North, &amp; I have always felt as if
I had been unjustly deprived of a very charming Aunt, for I knew
her, &amp; loved her.  -And Mr Huger, who really loved her &amp; loves
her still, married a woman older than himself, a poor little,
dreary soul who had nursed a Sister of this gentleman in a lingering 
illness, in which the two were brought much in contact, and
sympathy, and so a match of propinquity took place. No children,
but now in his old age he has in his house the children of a
nephew who has lost his wife and with these young people about
him, and thinking of his lost Charlotte, life is nearly for him
ended. -</p>
          <p>I have been quite ill with a pain in my head &amp; stomach.
In the years that have passed of my married life I have
when ill dragged round after my duties with weak wretched feelings.
Many times I have knelt down and said family prayers with
a faint heart &amp; swimming head from weakness. Now my children
are grown I intend to try the other system, go to bed when I feel
badly, and be waited upon, and if I live long enough shall end
by pursuing the plan I like best. For the 12 confinements I had: -
Motives of economy induced me to only 4 times have a regular
nurse, and only twice for a whole Month, the others I had what I 
could get at home, &amp; the regular nurse here was with me 2 weeks.</p>
          <pb id="grim39" n="39"/>
          <p>I believe now this was a mistake, it was thought
that I really did not wish a nurse, and <hi rend="italics">not</hi> that I made a sacrifice
to what I considered necessary economy. - I recollect
now the feeling of nervous misery, when ill, with a baby; a
head paining, &amp; the noise of children running up &amp; down stairs,
doors slamming, &amp;c., &amp; that restraint which the presence of
a stranger in the nurse would have occasioned in my sick room,
not there; &amp; the dreary details of expenditure discussed at my
bed side. Well, I have had, &amp; now have, many blessings, but were
I to begin life again, at such times I would have a nurse &amp; I
would nurse myself. -</p>

South Carolina troops are the worst provided &amp; the North Carolina
the best. The Counties are assessed in that State &amp; the men provided 
in that way. There was a sad accident on Sulivan's Island,

the poor things do so want a ruling principle, every one does
as he or she pleases, and they all are self indulgent, and
indolent, in short badly brought up. Gov. has got himself into
a miserable trouble, <sic corr="quarreled">quareled</sic>
with his father in law, his wife,
an <hi rend="italics">adopted</hi> child and has a large and

          <p>His little daughter died at Grahamville, little Eliza,
from neglect. Adela was ill at the time. He rules at his Mother's,
is rude to his Sisters and induces Martin to be so, too, they all
had a war talk and are now better friends. In my family, the Morises,
they often <sic corr="quarreled">quareled</sic>, but they always
made up. The <sic corr="Wilkinses">Wilkins's</sic> are

          <p>Lewis arrived from Virginia and went up
that night to see about his Commission. He returned yesterday,
having been obliged to wait several days to see the Governor. He
had companions, for there were many there waiting for the same
purpose. He returned having received his Commission he is to
apply to the Surgeon General or some such person and then he
will go some where. I think upon the whole it is the best, as he
will be in the line of his profession. -</p>
          <p>He looks well and upon the whole I think it has not
<pb id="grim44" n="44"/>
injured him. He says it was the life of a hound and all the evil
selfish feelings brought out. In this Palmetoe Guard one day
Capn  Cuthbert would be very pleasant &amp; easy with the men and soon
after, like a raging lion. Many shirked duty<corr>,</corr> lied,
stole, and
others had to work all the time because they stayed in Camp and
were quiet, many of the flourishing tales we heard of
<sic corr="prowess">prowes</sic>
on the battle field were made up for home. What poor creatures
we all are!</p>
          <p>Heard from Papa he says Charles writes to him. Judge
Law wrote to Mrs Butler she must come South. P. Butler is in
Fort Lafayete New York Harbour, a prisoner. Mr Wharton her
Phila lawyer is also in prison. Julian McAllister is promoted
to be Captain in the U.S.  forces. Mrs McAllister is with her
Mother with her 2 younger children. - Ann Barnwell has an admirer
in Lionel Nowel he is a clerk, gets 15 hundred a year &amp;
is said to be a very gentlemanly man.</p>
          <p>The Troops are said to be still suffering from fevers,
&amp;c., in Virginia. The Hospitals I expect are under the charge of
inexperienced Surgeons. After the Battle we heard that the legs
and arms were sawed off and thrown out of doors &amp; windows and
many lives lost from ignorance. Lewis has brought home a Dressing
Gown taken from a Yankee's trunk a pistol a <sic corr="bowie">bowy</sic> knife a picture
of a little Yankee girl.</p>
          <p>After a great many delays Lewis got his appointment
<pb id="grim45" n="45"/>
and the next day at 7 o'clock went off to Cole's Island where
some troops are stationed. We fixed him up and now it is proposed
that Lewis should to applied for a Confederate appointment 
from Walker. - Mr Grimball is to write a letter to that
effect I suppose nothing will come of it but one can but try. -
Striving is the appointed way. - We made 4 calico shirts for
Lewis and fixed him up as well as we could. We have constant
rains now. Lewis said with regard to the Camp life that men
did there what they would be ashamed to do at home.</p>

persuaded himself that if Lewis had time to reconsider this step
he would repent. So he got the Department to allow it to remain
until Lewis could be communicated with. We have not heard from
Lewis, since. But suppose he has determined to remain the pay
is 13 hundred &amp; $20 a year. The post is very out of the way and
Lewis did write but his letter was lost by the young man with

from thence to Norfolk where she arrived with a Flag of Truce.
She left Cornelia at School at the North. She looks very well
is thinner than she was and still very handsome, expects to go
to Georgia the last of the Month to be there perhaps to the end
of the war.</p>
          <p>Things seem to go on so slowly, and are so ruinously
low and high that I suppose at the end of it we shall be in a
deplorable state. I think it was all right to <sic corr="separate">sepparate</sic> from
the North but to us as a family it was just ruin. -</p>
          <p>The Northern property was then sold, and we were about

are so difficult the boys have nothing to do now apart from the war.</p>
          <p>John is a Lieutenant, which he greatly enjoys, but
William &amp; Arthur are much in need of Commissions they belong
to Militia Companies <hi rend="italics">they</hi> do not pay except on service. The
regular companies always pay &amp; always have something to do,
such a young man as William seems to deserve all distinction,
but it is not easily got. - How dreary life is &amp; how sinful we
are. -</p>
          <p>There have been some interesting speeches in Court,
about the sequestration of property of alien enemies, Mr
Pettegrew Nelson Mitchel on our side and others against their

          <p>Mrs Butler is at the Mills House &amp; has dined here
twice &amp; spends all her evenings with us. Her daughter is at

secure her property. After spending 3 weeks here she went on to
Savannah and had her business arranged to her satisfaction.</p>
          <p>The Yankee fleet attacked Hilton Head and Bay Point
silenced the Batteries there and are now in Broad River. The
poor Beaufort people fled in every direction, leaving the Town
to be sacked by the negroes. The Batteries were abandoned it is
now thought too soon and as is always the case where there is a
failure it is considered mismanaged. Gen. Drayton, Trapier &amp;
<pb id="grim48" n="48"/>
Ripley &amp; Lee has come on from Virginia to take charge. Troops
have come from North Carolina to assist, and they are waiting
to protect the Rail Road. The Women were seized with a perfect
panic and many fled into the interior, such terror stricken
creatures disgrace their Revolutionary Ancestry. William,
Berkley &amp; Arthur are with their Company encamped at the Race
Ground every day or two they come in and I see them. John paid
us a visit and it was charming to see him he has been away all
the Summer. Berkley is not very enthusiastic about Military
affairs, and finds the camp life perfectly horrible. It is very
amusing to hear him recount his annoyances, damp hay to lie on,
&amp; such a hard bed, was in a nice mess, but did not know how to
arrange paying his share, got some tea &amp; sugar to put in and went
off rather pleased. Charles has been passing the Summer at
Savannah in the same house with Miss Emma &amp; Miss Clem Wallister
and not long since he offered himself to Miss Clem was accepted
&amp; engaged 3 days when Miss C. found out she loved another
Charley &amp; not Charley Morris so C. came here with Mrs Butler,
&amp; having business in Savannah returned there and having a 
conversation with Miss Emma again reconciled himself to Miss Clem
&amp; arrived here in a state of great beatitude was now engaged &amp;
to be married on Wednesday 20 Nov. On the 15 a telegram arrives
telling him to come to Savannah &amp; then another to come on alone
so we are all in a maze fearing Miss Clem has again pranced off
and Charles went off yesterday &amp; was in Savannah at 8 this morning.
<pb id="grim49" n="49"/>
He is so crazy to get married it is quite ridiculous. Ella
says when Clem first pranced off Charles having just recovered
from an attack of fever was terribly nervous &amp; Miss Emma &amp; 
herself had to administer <sic corr="nerviness">nervines</sic> to him and sustain his sinking
spirits &amp; on one occasion when Miss Emma left the room he said
he thought it was a pity he had not addressed Miss Emma. Last
summer Richard who is here told Ella Charles felt himself very
near dying and told R. if that happened he must give all his
effects to Mrs Nightingale which highly <sic corr="incensed">insenced</sic> Mrs B. who has
always been very kind to C. She says at any rate she would keep
the things she had in charge the Nightingales should not have
them. - Richard looks very well &amp; is very agreeable, he is
stouter &amp; improved in appearance. Papa &amp; Mr Grimball came to
Town on a visit, both looking well &amp; reporting all quiet and
going on as usual. We are to stay here for the present. Mr
Grimball will be on the Plantation keeping the negroes together
&amp; I taking care of the girls, the boys in the tented field: -</p>
          <p>The Yankees have not made much progress, a Flag of
truce came from the fleet to one of the Batteries and one of
the Officers said they had no wish to disturb quiet &amp; loyal
Citizens, the reply given by Captain 0 Barnwell was there were
no such about there. Mr Edward Barnwell has his nephew Cap W.
Barnwell, the son of the Rev. Mr Barnwell at his house desperately
wounded by accident by a pistol said to be a very
clever young man. His Mother &amp; Sisters are with him a very sad
case.  Arthur made $51 in the Medical Director's office which
<pb id="grim50" n="50"/>
enabled him to purchase with others a tent. John is in Wapoo
with his Davis. - John is now here with his Davis quite busy &amp;
happy. Charles has married Miss McAllister and brought her here,
Clementina, as she chooses to be called. A woman of the world,
of good family &amp; in peace times would have 40 thousand dollars.
Has red hair a good figure &amp; add is a sensible educated woman,
quite accustomed to society and will manage Charles &amp; take care
of his money &amp; make him very happy. Mr Grimball writes that
Pinebury is a Military Station and seems to be having an 
interesting time there entertaining the Officers. - There is a
detatchment of Cavalry on the lawn, 2, 6 pounders at the Bain
landing, a bridge of Flats <sic corr="across">accross</sic> the river.</p>
          <p>I think we are in dark &amp; trying times, and I am afraid.
The people of the Sea board so loud in their expressions of 
determination while the war is in Virginia feel very faint now that
it has come upon us. The Yankees have landed on Tybee &amp; put up
the Flag, so these two States, Georgia &amp; South Carolina have now
the Flag of the enemy floating on their coasts. In Florida they
have Brag to Fight it out on the Coast, <sic corr="Pensacola">Pensicola</sic> fortunately
for them Gen Drayton &amp; Trapier are not men to be depended on,
they have not heads to command. Gen. Lee, who was thought slow,
&amp; said to be a grand General he is superior over all.</p>
          <p>The Camp seems to be a nice place William, who has

a sash &amp; blind factory and the difficulty of getting water and
the previous drought and a very high wind which drove the flames
caused the general destruction. This fire began at Cooper River

it impossible to procure a suitable place.  Mr Kirckland, the
Methodist Missionary who resided in our neighborhood offered to
rent us his house furnished to put the negroes out to service,

Overseer's house. The plan although not a promising one was
being acted on. Mr Aiken offered his vessel to carry the negroes
to this place when Professor Porcher sent a letter round with an

work for their food and clothes. They were all brought from the

our Ruthless foes, we expect an attack and people are leaving
their houses and families<corr>,</corr> servants and furniture, crowding up
to the Rail Road. The upper districts are crowded with this
unusual population and food is not abundant or cheap. The people
in many instances take advantage of this state of things and
put a great price on their houses refusing to rent but choosing
to sell. Papa came from the country in wretched health and after
remaining with us 3 weeks went with Mrs Butler to Spartanburg

to arrange it if possible. I do not feel at all certain about it

          <p>The Town is nearly deserted by the Inhabitants,

suffer from the effects of the climate, people look forward to
a terrible summer. I feel perfectly <sic corr="despondent">dispondent</sic> at times but there
is no use in that we must bear it as well as we can. Since the
Fall of New Orleans and the Giving up of <sic corr="Norfolk">Nolfork</sic> I expect to

for the Gun boats to come here to have them take possession of

          <p>Mr Grimball moved us up here last week we hired a car for $75 and
brought some furniture and all our clothes and some bedding and
have established ourselves here, we hope only for the summer but
it may be longer.</p>
          <p>The Journey was performed comfortably and we had to
remain 2 days at the Hotel as our things were not taken out. Papa 
&amp; Mrs B. were there and our rooms were ready. We thankfully left
it on Monday for I hate a Hotel life and we are now as comfortably 
fixed as circumstances will allow. The building is not entirely
finished we have the use of 2 large rooms, up <sic corr="stairs">stayrs</sic>, and a turret
room large enough for Harry to sleep in, there are down <sic corr="stayrs">stayrs</sic>
3 rooms and one a very large one which we make by using screens
left here, a pantry, dining room, and drawing room. The supply
of articles of food <sic corr="eccentric">excentric</sic>, and as yet no appearance of
<pb id="grim59" n="59"/>
any quantity.</p>
          <p>Mr Wilkins came up with her daughters soon after us,
she declined sharing with us the college as she said the 
<sic corr="accommodation">accomodation</sic> for the servants would not answer. They have two large
kitchens, and one very large room which has the two ends cut off
for Josey &amp; Adam &amp; their wives, and Patsy &amp; Peggy &amp; the 5 
children sleep in the middle of the Hotel as Peggy calls it. Mrs
Wilkinses servants came here at first and it was very crowded,
and rather noisy. Maria, a little girl they had in the house died
here, she was very ill when she left Charleston and might have
died in the cars. Mrs W. hired some rooms for her servants, and
they have moved away. She is at the Walker House with her daughters
they find it not nice, every one complains. - Most people stay 
a few days and then locate themselves, she is trying to do so. -</p>
          <p>Mr Grimball had a  very sudden and violent attack the
other night and I sent for Dr Boyed, he sent me a powder to 
administer <sic corr="morphine">morphyne</sic>, and said he had a very sick child, and no one
to leave it with. I <sic corr="preferred">prefered</sic> he should see Mr Grimball, and sent
in a servant to take charge of the child, he after a time came 
up here and prescribed. The attack he said was gravel, he cupped
Mr Grimball and with the <sic corr="Morphine">Morphyne</sic> he was relieved. He went to
Charleston <sic corr="to-day">to day</sic>, intending to see Dr Geddings. -</p>
          <p>The boys write pleasantly from the Marions, William

          <p>Up here there are no outside shutters and we have

the white curtains I had soon after I was married, 
nailed up to

Papa and 
Mrs Butler propose coming up here and joining 
us in house keeping. 
I hope it will act pleasantly and lessen our expense.</p>
          <p>Just before we left Town Mr Rose notified me he had
received $1360 for me, it is kept in his bank until called for

          <p>Mr Grimball still in Town but expected to
day, he sent me a letter from Mary Wilcocks about Mrs  McAllister,
Mrs Butler's daughter. Her health is in such a critical state that
it was thought proper to inform her Mother. She was dreadfully
distressed, and at once said she would be glad to go on to the
North to see her daughter. - Mr Grimball will go with her to
Richmond to get her through. - if possible. This breaks up
our pleasant housekeeping, but I am very glad we are here and
able to have Papa with us, for he is very feeble, and much changed
by his troubles and his age. -</p>
          <p>Mr Wilkins is fortunate in getting a small house
containing 4 rooms for $15 per Month where she will live with
her daughters more comfortably, and she thinks more reasonably,
than boarding. -</p>
          <p>Gabriella and Charlotte were confirmed in Charleston
just before we left there and last Sunday it being Communion
Sunday I had the great comfort of having my 3 daughters with me
<pb id="grim61" n="61"/>
partaking of that Sacrament. - I pray that they may earnestly
walk in a Christian life.</p>
          <p>The Battle near Richmond is a glorious victory for
us we have met with great losses in the lives of valuable young
men but this with the signal repulse on James Island are very
telling in shortening the war. - Letters from Mr Grimball from
Richmond, Mrs Butler still there hoping to get through. The
Rail Road had been torn up and if she succeeds in getting through
she will have to ride two days in a carriage to Fredricksburg. -</p>
          <p>We are getting on here well enough I think now we
need not have left Charleston at all, but the Change will be
of great service to all of us and already has done Gabriella a
great deal of good. William has made another unsuccessful effort
to obtain a Commission that way to distinction is evidently
closed to him, and we may just as well reconcile ourselves to
it. I feel very anxious about John, he wrote to his Father asking
for money and was sent a letter containing $50<sic corr=",">.</sic> which he never
received and as he was put to inconvenience by it we are
quite annoyed. -</p>

sent me word she had just lost her Mother and was not visiting,
but would be glad to see me. I went there with Mrs Irwin and
found a very graceful educated woman. She has no children and is
very anxious to join her husband. Yesterday she wrote me a note
enclosing a telegram from her husband saying John was well. This
was the second note she has written to me about letters &amp;c
received from her husband. -</p>

cost us $24 is quite a comfort she has a calf and grazes in the

husks morning and evening. The Calf is kept up and ensures her
return. -</p>
          <p>Elizabeth teaches Lotty &amp; Harry, and through her
kindness they are not left in perfect ignorance. I am afraid it
tries her temper greatly. There is a State Institution near this
Village for the Blind &amp; Deaf &amp; Dumb. We visited it and were
pleased with the exercises. Mr Grimball is now here dull &amp;
<pb id="grim63" n="63"/>
miserable at the prospects of the family for the future when the
money we have now is spent what will become of us. I hope we
will be provided for, sufficient unto the day is the evil thereof.</p>
          <p>Elizabeth hears from Clementina she says “Our pay has
been reduced and still I put up every Month a treasure for Charles,
he says he walks up and down his room and thinks of the sums he
has squandered on trinkets<corr>”</corr> &amp;c, &amp;c. -</p>
          <p> We are 3 quarters of a mile from the Village and can
easily walk there, we go to Church on Sunday. Papa drives me
there but he is now disgusted with the Services being irregular,
and that the people the Vestry, have refused Mr Hunter the
<sic corr="privileged">priviledge</sic> of preaching, saying he is a Yankee, (which is true,) and
that he is trying to get the place from Mr  McCollock who is the
Clergyman, he is to preach one Sunday here, &amp; 1 at Union. Mr
Hunter had a Church on Santee &amp; a Planting interest which he sold
out, - and while he was allowed to preach here alternated with 
Mr McCollock. -</p>

Lieutenant in the Calhoun's Artillery, we had given up all
expectation of W's getting any thing and I am very glad for us
all and particularly for his sake. - There had been so many
applications for him and all had so entirely failed. The last
was in the Sharp Shooters his name was put down by Gen Evens
but the Major's Bing Smith was one made interest to have his name 
taken off and a friend of their own put in the place. This was
a very disagreeable thing and we all felt worried by it, but now
if his health is good in our climate there is always a terrible
risk in a change and fever seems to lurk in every place. I feel
very anxious about him &amp; John. We sent down his trunk and as in
this out of the way place there is no express<corr>.</corr> Adam was sent to
Columbia to put the trunk, and a parcel containing the sheets
and the key of the trunk in the express, it cost $5. 50 the

Arkansas they were most brilliant and the vessel did wonderfully
for the Machinery evidently was not of sufficient force to make
the vessel effective. The Majestic way in which she moved was as
fast as she could go. The end of this was naturally the destruction
of the vessel. We are now most anxious to hear from John he

sent us a drawing of the vessel and which he wishes photographed

to us, having a furlough, to get his clothes. He traveled a long
way, and it was a great comfort to see him, but he only remained
with us 2 days, he has gone through many perils, and is unhurt,
but he returns to the Battery, where he is stationed at Vicksburg, 
and is very much exposed to the climate. - I felt dreadfully 
at parting with him, but these are times of such miserable
anxiety and there are such family losses, that we have a sort
of stunned and bewildered feeling, as if we were all struggling
on some dusty tiresome road, and had at long intervals a pleasant
meeting, and then our friends passed on, more quickly, and we 
lost sight of them. The war seems to be as far from its end as 
ever, and what is to become of us, should it continue?</p>

          <p>About 3 weeks since, Heyward Manigault paid us a

He was very quiet and seemed pleased. Charlotte has written to

that he was very much pleased with his visit and found us very
comfortably fixed. He is thinking of establishing himself in 
Greenville moving his negroes and selling out at Wiltown. -</p>

John took for Mrs Stevens a large bundle for her son, such a one

much room in his trunk and he was not able to put in his blanket
and hope he did not thereby lose it. -</p>

          <p>Ripley became so Morose when he got to Virginia, that
his aids generally resigned. - We have not heard from John but
Orders have reached here for him to join the Baltic in Mobile.
I am always anxious about him. - August has passed and here is
September with no great change in our affairs. - We have no reason
to be very much discontented just now we have many comforts,
and are well, but the anxiety about absent exposed members of
the family continues all the time. William does not write in a
way to make one feel happy, he seems disappointed, and that is
not pleasant. - Arthur got his pantaloons which were sent to
him. Berkley writes in a quiet resigned spirit, which is rather
soothing, and Lewis in an affectionate way about his brothers,

in after tea to tell us of it a very kind hospitable woman quite
a register of family events in the society which surrounds her,
but although she narrates well and accurately and takes one
through the lives of those she talks of from the cradle to the
tomb the perfect ignorance about these people, except from what
she says makes one take no sort of interest in them, it is just
simply life &amp; death. - Dr Whiteford Smith who is the President
of the <sic corr="College">Colledge</sic> up here paid us a visit yesterday morning, and
made me feel pleasantly all day. A clever, good, genial man, his
only son is now with the Army, and he told us they had felt anxious 
to get warm clothes for him, and his wife a great contriver,
had taken the checked flannel out of a large cloak of his and
made some shirts for him, he bought a thick great coat, and intended
<pb id="grim70" n="70"/>
going to Virginia to see his son and give him these warm clothes.
The young man is just 18, and said he wished to take his share
in this struggle and not have it said to him when the <sic corr="independence">independance</sic>
was achieved that he was enjoying what he had not worked
for. -</p>
          <p>Dr Smith thinks the war will be a great benefit to
the country, enlargement of mind to very ignorant, contracted,
country people. The families of soldiers now take news papers,
and if they can't read themselves they get people to read to
them, and some of them have learned to read themselves. One woman
in his neighborhood whose husband, a hard working man and gone
off to the wars, had learnt to write &amp; read writing since her
husband left her, and he had, too, learned to read &amp; write that
he might write to her, she could read his letters, but no other
writing. - Dr S talked in the most charming way of Bulwer's
Novels, he prefers the Caxtons &amp; My Novel to all his other books,
and Ducroux, does not like Dickens, thinks his <sic corr="characters">caracters</sic> distorted
and <sic corr="exaggerated">exagerated</sic>, which spoils all the beauties, Thackery he has

ground Manassas,
<pb id="grim71" n="71"/>
and among those slain were Dr Smith's only son, and several other
young men graduates of this College, excellent moral characters.
What a loss to their families, and how these parents are bowed
with trouble. Miss Clem Legg, sister of the young ladies who
called on Elizabeth, was engaged to Mr Palmer, a very fine young
man, one of the killed, and her sister Mary was in the train of
an engagement with Mr Capers, also slain, and said to be a most
charming person.</p>
          <p>Mrs Walker who keeps a Hotel here went to Richmond,
after the first of the battles, in that neighborhood, to bring
home her son's body, said to be killed. She found him severely
wounded and brought him home, he is now well except a <sic corr="stiffened">stifened</sic>
arm, she says she shall all her life consider this step, against
the advice of her friends, an especial providence. - She visited
one of the Hospitals, near Richmond, which contained 4 thousand
patients, &amp; said no one who did not witness the sufferings there
could realize the horrors of the war.</p>
          <p>A lady of Richmond daily accompanied by two servants
brought, and administered herself, a quantity of fine, nutritious
chicken soup. One young man had an old negro man who sat by him
&amp; fanned off the flies. She stopped and told him she hoped he
would get well, he shook his head and said no, he could not he
was too badly wounded, the servant remained with him until he
died, and then after preparing his body for the grave, bundled
up his things, put them on his head and went off home.</p>
          <p>The Grave Yard where the Military burial takes place
<pb id="grim72" n="72"/>
has two in each grave, numbered &amp; marked so that they can be
identified. She saw the Yankee Major Biddle there, he died of his 
wounds, and had the most vindictive feelings to the last, said
it was a horrid war, and would never end.</p>
          <p>There has been so much counterfeiting of Confederate
Bank bills that all the 20<corr>,</corr> 50<corr>,</corr> &amp;

          <p>We heard from Mrs Butler, her grandchildren have
been sent to California to their father and she says she is
perfectly crushed and miserable poor dear soul how dreary life
will be to her: she perfectly idolized her daughter. -</p>
          <p>Papa called me down <sic corr="stairs">stayrs</sic> this morning to tell me
about his affairs, he has some money or Confederate bonds in
the Bank of Charleston and up here in the hands of Mr Judd 709
70¢ &amp; in his press the bill &amp; the money to pay the corn for Mr
Kirkland. - His will &amp; papers are in the hands of Mr Robertson. -</p>
          <p>We hear from Mrs Irwin and others of the distress of
Miss Legg. She seems broken hearted. She has been engaged 3
years to Mr Palmer, he is from the low Country, was handsome,
well born, rich and cultivated. The 3 young men, Whiteford Smith
Capers &amp; Palmer were in the Spartan Rifles and shot by one ball &amp;
found lying close together. It would have been a comfort to this
poor girl if she had been married to her love, and then she could
have mourned with his family and had a claim on their sympathy.

sugar for him for 4 lbs. best white, and he could not rest until
it was weighed before his eyes which was done. My Papa has a very
mean mind and is an extremely close man, he wonders at my buying

peaches for the children and thinks it a great expense, he cannot
eat them. He really lives here in the most comfortable way
at the smallest expense. He talks now of going down to the low
Country as soon as possible to see after his business and 
yesterday offered me the use of 3 rooms in his house. I would
rather Charlotte should take charge of him in winter and hope I
may not be obliged to live in his house. Now I have no home for
our Plantation is broken up, our house in Town is only a hired
one &amp; upon the whole I may consider myself at home any where my
family &amp; trunks &amp;c are. -</p>
          <p>Mr Irwin paid us a visit yesterday &amp; told us Mrs
Kenedy's family were very anxious about Clem Legg. It seems
there is a case of derangement in her family, a daughter who
lives with them and is quite out of her right senses, it came
about unexpectedly, and there is a risk of this young <sic corr="lady's">ladys</sic>
being equally afflicted, she takes her trouble in such a silent, 
stunned way. -</p>
          <p>Mr Grimball transacted his business very successfully
he saw William &amp; Lewis, this last moved from Church flatts to
Sulivans Island. Dr Lining met Mr G in the street and spoke very
well of Lewis' practise which I think was very kind as Drs do
not like to praise one another. He said Lewis has lost very few
cases. -</p>
          <p>William was not very well. There had been a duel
from the Fort, Alfred Rhett killed Ransom Calhoun a man he
particularly hated, and as the thing was not represented to the

with an old lady in black she said she had lost her only son in
one of the Battles and her daughter being very much attached to
her brother died soon after him. Her son in law was in Service
and she did not feel much interest in the war she had lost both
her children and they could not be restored. The family distress

came to see us the other evening and told us that Mrs Wilson
had left Mrs Tompson's with a half Month unpaid $47 that she
talked very freely about people &amp; would lead those she spoke to
into the belief no one was of any account except her family, the
Gibbes. I liked her very well her manners are easy but she comes
of a family not considered truthful and on that account not much
regarded. -</p>

says drank, and

in Morals I do not hear of any one being more correct than
another. Mrs I<corr>.</corr> says Mrs Legg who was a Miss Kenedy married a
man much beneath her in family and it came about in this way.
The Kenedys moved up here from Charleston for the health of Mr
K and Miss L was pleased with this Mr Legg and engaged herself
to him not knowing anything about him and after her marriage 
found he had very low relations. - Which shows the imprudence

came to see us some time since, and when we returned the visit
Miss Stone told Elizabeth the reason they visited us was they
belonged to the way side Hospital, and a German of the 1st  
Infantry came up here on furlough for recruiting and spoke so much
of Lewis's kindness to the men. He said he bought a wagon load
of chickens and gave them to the sick soldiers, and when he went
to Town to purchase medicine he paid for it himself, if he had
not money enough allowed. -</p>

older, a noisy &amp; trying child. The stately and old time politeness
which was kept up between Mr Grimball &amp; Papa is not often

soldiers are most destructive in their visits to houses left, and 
entered ours and helped themselves to what they liked. When this

the bridesmaids all in order, with groomsmen to match. A Magistrate
reading out the Episcopal Marriage service &amp; the old Col.
giving the bride away. This in the consideration of many people
was a real wedding, and Col. F. is greatly to be blamed. In the

          <p>I received this morning from Charlotte
the painful account of Papa's death, he suffered at last very
much, and passed away on the morning of the 30th September 1863,
between 5, &amp; 6 in the morning, he was very much swollen had
parozisms of difficulty of breathing which were terrible, had
been twelve weeks in bed, had bed sores on his back &amp; when the
difficult breathing came on had to be held up in bed but through
all that his faith never wavered, &amp; he has gone to that rest &amp;
that joy he so longed for, he must have been 78 years of age:
Charlotte throughout this painful illness has attended him, &amp;
comforted him, by her presence &amp; care. - Lewis was fortunately
there, ordered to take charge of some hospitals &amp; was with Papa
when he died. -</p>
          <p>I shall miss him as long as I live for he loved me,
<pb id="grim99" n="99"/>
and was always kind. - The prayer book I now use was a present
from him, being a large one so that I need not use spectacles.
His life was one of many changes. Belonging to one of the old
families in New York he married early, my Mother of
<sic corr="Huguenot">Hugenot</sic>
descent.  He was devoted to her, they had $40 thousand to begin
with, and he went in debt for a Planting interest, was not very
successful, became involved &amp; passed nearly all his life an
<sic corr="embarrassed">embarassed</sic> man with a large family.
(4 years before the war he
was more easy, &amp; after the sale of part of the Northern property
divided 30 thousand to each of his children) After 16 years my
Mother was taken from him by a violent death, being crushed to
death, the house falling in the storm on Sulivans Island, of
1822. After my <sic corr="Grandfather's">Grandfathers</sic> death,
he managed the property of
his Mother, &amp; gave great dissatisfaction to his brothers &amp;
sisters.</p>
          <p>Some years before his <sic corr="Mother's">Mothers</sic>
death they induced her
to take the charge from him, he married Miss Lowndes, 7 years
after my <sic corr="Mother's">Mothers</sic> death, who died
leaving 2 children, 1 son, &amp;
1 daughter, the son alone survives, on whom all her property settled<corr>.</corr></p>
          <p>The death of this lady was a great grief to him, she
was very pious, and sensible. He had become very much interested
in Religion just after my <sic corr="Mother's">Mothers</sic> death, and through all the
varied scenes of his long life his faith sustained him, &amp;
comforted him. - If the Country had not been torn apart by this
revolution he would have left a very handsome property to his
children, at least one hundred &amp; fifty thousand dollars apiece:
<pb id="grim100" n="100"/>
but his negroes, 2 hundred of them, have left him, &amp;  the 
Plantations are ruined: but in these times no one thinks of the
losses, the war fills all the mind. -</p>

she is a mild lady like woman and has suffered much her husband
left her constantly for Months at a time &amp; the last 2 years of

hardly any money to live on. We fortunately have Corn to last
during the summer. Mr Kirkland, the Methodist Preacher kindly
helped us to get that $4 per bushel. We paid for 100 bushels of
Corn in Barnwell &amp; we got it up here at the depot from the 
Government supply they taking that quantity below. -</p>
          <p>Mr Kirkland died about 4 weeks since of cold, got on 
his Circuit, a very good man, I feel that we have lost a friend.</p>
          <p>Mrs Tompson had her house burned down a few days since
in broad day &amp; lost nearly every thing, her store of flour &amp;
Bacon &amp; Corn &amp; much furniture &amp; clothing. She lived in this
neighborhood, we had often seen her but she did not visit us, I
am very sorry for her.</p>
          <p>Anna Frost invited the girls to come out to them on

Friday to an evening party in honor of their brother's wedding.
He married Miss Walker of the Asylum, they are to stay until

          <p>This morning received a letter from Arnoldus Vanderhorst

          <p>Mr Grimball sent Adam to Columbia to bring the
box to us. We have now opened it and find 2 pieces of beautiful
long cloth, 18 yds white cambric, 2 doz spools of white cotton,
1 do black, 6 papers pins, a large supply of needles put up in
a glass bottle, 1 piece <sic corr="linen">linnen</sic>, 4 dresses, black poplin cloth

G. shoes, high &amp; thick soled &amp; slippers 2 pair shoes for Harry,
1 pair for each of the girls, &amp; 1 for me &amp; 3 pair of slippers for
the girls. The shoes are rather tight but very much needed, and
we feel how kind and sensible this good child has been in his
selections.  I have sent 9 yds of long cloth, 3 yds. <sic corr="linen">linnen</sic>, 3 yds.
flannel, 2 papers pins<corr>,</corr> 2 spools cotton, 1 paper needles to the
Wilkinses. John said he wished them sent sent something if we could 
spare it out of the box.</p>
          <p>I gave each of the women servants a yd of long cloth
to make an apron &amp; 1 yd to Adam; to Mrs Irwin our land lady I
gave a half paper small pins do large, 2 yds long cloth<corr>,</corr> 1 yd
flannel for her baby.</p>
          <p>This long cloth costs now $8 per yd if not more,
<pb id="grim106" n="106"/>
flannel must be from $10 to 15, <sic corr="linen">linnen</sic> $25 per yard. Shoes such
as we have $75 a pair, spool cotton $2 for one. I am very thankful
as John did send us these things they got to us safe, so
many people lose their boxes. The Church has been Consecrated,
&amp; the Council has met here. John Elliott <sic corr="stayed">staid</sic> with us, a very

us and Johnston in Georgia appears to be acting on the defence
with skill, at least we hope so. He has given up some places, the

          <p>The Frosts party was quite a pleasant one, and the

          <p>Mr Grimball received a letter from William 
written from the 3d N.C. Hospital, Charlotte Street, Charleston,
telling him he was there ill, &amp; at the end of the letter said
there was such a buzzing in his head from Quinine he could hardly
write, he had received the stockings sent down, &amp; had a pair on,
was thankful for them. Arthur wrote the next day, &amp; Berkley
Wilkins, both saying William was very ill.  Arthur sent a telegram
begging his Papa to come down at once, Mr Grimball set off on
Monday, arrived in Charleston about 5 o'clock on Tuesday <unclear>25</unclear>.
William knew him but when he spoke wandered. Arthur met his
father at the cars, Berkley was at the Hospital. Mr Grimball
passed the night there &amp; at about 7 o'clock on Wednesday morning
William passed away, apparently without pain, his father closing
his eyes. He was placed in the Wilkin's vault, temporarily, on 
Thursday morning at 10 o'clock, Mr Gadsden performing the Service,
having visited and prayed for William, on Tuesday afternoon
before Mr G arrived, Ham was with him Dr Geddings attended, and
he had a room to himself, and was as comfortable as possible.</p>
          <p>It has pleased Almighty God to take from us this good,
affectionate, and gifted child, just when the promise of his
youth and care, he took with himself to train and prepare himself
for his profession might have <sic corr="yielded">yeilded</sic> some fruit. He was handsome,
elegant, &amp; cultivated in his manners &amp; so much interested
in his family, the letters I have from him always allude to them,
<pb id="grim108" n="108"/>
&amp; propose some benefit for them. I believe him among the saved
in Heaven: his fever was the consequence of the exposure on the
Coast, while attending to his duties, he was 1st Lieutenant 1st
S.C. <sic corr="Artillery">Artilery</sic>. My God give me Resignation to thy will, and lift
up my poor, sinful heart to trust, &amp; to pray always. -</p>

          <p>It is just a month since my dear William
was taken from us &amp; each day seems but to add to the sense of the
<sic corr="bereavement">berevement</sic>. God's will be done, and may he sanctify to us this
dispensation. It will certainly wean our hearts from the world,
for by him, &amp; through him we expected to be honored here. - and
he is in heaven; I have now two children in heaven, Harriet &amp;
William. - May my hard, worldly heart be lifted up from this
vain passing life to that eternal &amp; with those redeemed &amp; in
heaven. -</p>
          <p>Arthur came up with his father looking thin and
shattered, he spent his furlough satisfactorily, he was docile,
every day he read two chapters in the Bible to me, a small one
I got for him, &amp; said a Hymn, “Just as I am”. I pasted the Hymn
in the book for him, &amp; hope he will read his Bible regularly.
William was a great loss to him, he seemed like a wall of defence,
always there to help &amp; keep him up. His health seemed benefitted,
but he smokes too much. He went down yesterday. -</p>
          <p>Berkley got a furlough for a week &amp; spent it with us,
he looks well and is now to take Quinine regularly &amp; may be in
that way able to escape fever. - His father gave Arthur money to
<pb id="grim109" n="109"/>
buy quinine. We have not heard from Lewis &amp; are uneasy about
him. There are notices of William in the papers commendatory 
of him,  Charlotte writes me the notice from the Bar was very
good, we have not seen it. Lasage Elliott sent Mr Grimball a
paper drawn up at a meeting of some of his personal friends
commending his character &amp; talents, it was to have been 
published in the Guardian, we have not yet seen it. They also
requested permission to place a tablet on his grave. - All this
<sic corr="shows">shews</sic> that his life, though short, was not without its use,
his example may lead others to strive after good. -</p>

          <p>My mind is constantly dwelling on William's
life, his earnest, serious manner when a very little child, we
were all riding together &amp; the other boys made so much noise
that W. knelt down and said his prayers, which surprised them so
much they became quiet. - One day he said to me <corr>“</corr>Ma don't die for
if you die I will die too &amp; then if you die I will go to Heaven 
to look for you.<corr>”</corr> He said his <sic corr="catechism">chatechism</sic> when he was going to

college, to keep Arthur quiet. - When quite grown up he put
Harry to bed for two months as H wished it. - Miss Smith said
he had the most reverent manner in Church, I cannot think that
with such a nature Religion being long  “felt a comfort” as he
wrote to me, was lightly understood. He must have taken it lovingly,
into his soul. Mr Grimball often says he thinks he was
not treated judiciously, &amp; in that way met his death, but I try
to think it was God's will to take him from us, &amp; this passing
world. - When his papers came up there was a letter from William
to his father, the last he wrote, saying that might be the last 
of him, &amp; if it was not for the expense he wished him to come &amp;
then said come, come, it almost broke Mr Grimball's heart, but
he could not have got there sooner than he did, &amp; then he just
recognized him. - Oh my dear, dear child, how I think of you,
and all your unselfish, thoughtful ways; I believe I was always
kind to him, I know I meant to be. -</p>

          <p>We passed a sad Xmas, last year my
dear William spent 10 days with us, &amp; I felt all the time that
those hours were before me, his affectionate greeting of us, the
loving kind tones of his voice, his fine manly form, &amp; expressive
face, were ever in my mind, &amp; I mourned for my lost son. - We
had many mercies, we were well, &amp; the family at home enjoyed a
bountiful repast, on Xmas day and on New Years day. The winter
has been a very cold one, but we have had a home &amp; food. This

herself about this plan of Elizabeth's, &amp; went down with her
<sic corr="to-day">to day</sic>, to see the school begin, E is to teach French &amp; Music. -
This dear child has been the comfort and help of her parents,
and family, she has taught her sisters, &amp; Harry, and benefitted
them in every way. Lotty, owing to her care &amp; instruction is
well educated, &amp; Harry has been most unwillingly instructed, in
French, and in every way elevated, &amp; improved. - She must be
followed, wherever she goes, with a blessing; a dutiful, &amp; 
Christian child. Miss Read is keeping house, &amp; we hope E will
find it pleasant there. -</p>

          <p>I read over my journal this morning
and determined to finish it by making a note of the events
of the Summer just passed. In April Arthur came home from the
Army in North Carolina being sent to a hospital in Raleigh, and
<pb id="grim113" n="113"/>
there being no room for him in the over crowded building, he
was allowed to proceed home, to recruit, having had a severe
attack of fever. In June Berkley &amp; Harry arrived, the war being
over, both <sic corr="Armies">Armys</sic> <sic corr="Lee's">Lees</sic> &amp; <sic corr="Johnston's">Johnstons</sic> having surrendered, &amp;  the
Southern States overwhelmed, &amp; conquered.</p>
          <p>The boys found us most happy to see them, but with an
empty corn box, &amp; no money, that could be so called; we sent
about, &amp; did as others, sold dresses and ornaments, and bought
bacon, &amp; corn, the servants continued with us &amp; Patty who had
lived with me for 36 years, and always behaved with the most
<sic corr="exemplary">examplary</sic> propriety, being a skillful seamstress, tailoress,
Mantuamaker, &amp; washer &amp; ironer, proposed herself to work out;
wash &amp; iron for us &amp; support her 2 children &amp; herself, the children
waiting on us. This she did faithfully until she left us
the 10th January,  being sent for by her son &amp; Husband. When she
could she sold articles for us, going at all times, &amp; would take
nothing for her trouble. She frequently brought me grist, Molasses,
&amp; flour, which she said was my share of what she made. The old
Mauma has acted throughout with the most perfect consideration,
she was terribly mortified by Elizabeth being a teacher, &amp;
Gabriella, &amp; Charlotte keeping a little School. She said to the
Kenedys,  “You see dem going long so; but dey has plenty of gould
and silver in de bank; and dey is such an old family. -”</p>
          <p>When Patty came to take leave of me she said <corr>“</corr>My dear
Mistress, My dear Mistress<corr>”</corr>, with a great appearance of feeling, &amp;
<pb id="grim114" n="114"/>
brought a little oven in her hand, a present to the young ladies,
they had often borrowed it from her during the war to bake cakes
in their room. I asked her if she could not take it with her, she
said <corr>“</corr>Oh, yes mam, but I always termined to give it to the young
ladies when I went away,<corr>”</corr> and then she sent them a little clothes
horse to dry their muslins on. I am thankful amid the wreck of
all to have this example of affection and duty to always remember.
3 days before she went one of the servants asked her if she was
going to bake for her journey, no she said I am going to wash
my mistresses clothes, &amp; so she did leaving every thing clean, 
tubs &amp;c<corr>.</corr></p>
          <p>The old Mauma is living at Mrs Hankels her own choice,
she has behaved with uniform kindness. Always when she got any
thing nice she brought it to Lotty or Ella and they took it from
her &amp; seemed to enjoy it coming out of her pocket, wrapped in a
piece of clean cloth, or a scrap of brown paper. During the hardest 
part of the war she was living at Mrs Irwins, and as they
kept a plentiful table, &amp; fed her well for her services, she
saved some of her dinner every day for Harry, &amp; he with the <sic corr="appetite">apetite</sic>
 of a growing boy, scarcely satisfied, went every night to see her,
&amp; eat her present to him. -</p>
          <p>Lewis came home from Johnston's Army, &amp; Elizabeth had
her long vacation of 3 Months, Lewis &amp; Arthur gave us some anxiety 
from their dissipated tendencies.  Harry returned to his School,
at the College. Mr Carlise is an excellent teacher and we are most
<pb id="grim115" n="115"/>
thankful he has this opportunity of getting a good education.
Mrs <sic corr="Kenedy's">Kenedys</sic> family were very hospitable, the boys and girls were
frequently asked over there to spend the evening and Clementine
&amp; Mary established a Musical Club to meet every Tuesday evening
at the house of the different members for the enjoyment of
society, and the improvement of Music. This association was very
pleasant and continued until the end of January. -</p>
          <p>Lewis paid attention to Miss Clementina, and after a
time was accepted, &amp; is now married &amp; settled at Frog Level,
near Greenville, being the only Dr in the place &amp; having the
only Drug Store. - She is a very nice girl, educated &amp; pleasant
looking and mannered, a member of the Episcopal Church, so is
Lewis, and now through <sic corr="God's">Gods</sic> mercy he is a temperance man &amp; I
trust will succeed.</p>
          <p>The wedding was a quiet morning affair, no bridesmaids,
cake &amp; wine, at the <sic corr="Grandmother's">Grandmothers</sic>, and they set off early on
Thursday morning for their future home, in a carriage, via
Greenville, intended going the same day, 7th Feb 1866 but the
coachman said it was <hi rend="italics">a rainy day</hi>, &amp; late, &amp; he could only take
them half way to a little way side inn. -</p>
          <p>Lewis had $3000 to commence his married life on. I
gave it to him, but as the property in New York was in the law
courts, under the Confiscation act &amp; could not be used until
released Lewis Morris lent him this sum. - and he seems to be
<pb id="grim116" n="116"/>
acting wisely &amp; well with it. -</p>
          <p>Mary Legge was married in October, quite a flourishing
wedding and fixings, 9 bridesmaids &amp; groomsmen. Col. Legge,
the father of these young ladies,  is a man of intemperate habits,
and no morals, never pays any thing he owes, and does not regard
his word. That such a person should occupy positions of trust,
&amp; honor in this place is a proof of the low state of morals. I
am sorry Clementina was <hi rend="italics">so sired</hi>, her Mother's family are very
nice people. -</p>
          <p>Mr Grimball went to Charleston with Lewis early in
November. Arthur went down with 2 wagons in charge to Mr Wagner 
with articles of value &amp; importance, and got $50 for his services 
which bought him some clothes.  Berkley went by the cars. -</p>
          <p>Mr Grimball has lately got possession of his Plantations
but is very much worried by his debts on them, &amp; the accumulation
of interest. The Morris's refuse to take the places to liquidate
the debt.  - My Property in New York is by the laws of the State
not amenable to the debts of my husband during my life, and I
am permitted to make such disposition of it by deed, gift, or  will,
as I may see fit. -</p>
          <p>Should I die intestate he might be held entitled to
a life estate in the property, to which extent his creditors
might claim. I have written to request Harry to write a will for
me giving Mr Grimball a suitable portion of my property for his
life, &amp; giving it at his death to the children. The rest equally
<pb id="grim117" n="117"/>
divided among the children, all sharing alike. -</p>
          <p>My dear John has sent me a present of 2 hats, 1 a
Jockey, the other a silk, fully trimmed, and 1 doz pair of stockings,
1 doz Pocket handkerchiefs, hoop, balmoral dress shawl,
cuffs, collars, shawl, gloves. I am very much pleased at this,
mark of his attachment. The two boxes, paper ones, came through
Baltimore from a Miss Anna Wells to whom John is or was engaged
to be married. They are in Charleston with Mr Grimball. -</p>
          <p>The Wilkinses are living at their house Lamson Street
Charleston. Mr Grimball hires a room from them for $15 per Month.
Arthur has gone up Cooper River to keep a Store with Prioleau
&amp; Alston, for the negroes, he sent to Berkley for Calico of a
blue ground, with sprawling red flowers on it, as best suited
to the taste of the Customers. They are paid in Rice, &amp; A. sees
visions of great success before him. - The end of the war found
the old aristocracy reduced to many straights to get on and applying
for, &amp; gladly taking, very inferior places. Henry Manigault
and his wife are Steward &amp; Matron of the Alms House in Charleston.
Williams Middleton is renting out his rooms, James Heyward's
wife &amp; daughters &amp; W. H. Heyward's are taking in sewing. Mrs Allston
the <sic corr="Gov's">Gov'</sic> widow, keeps a boarding school. The Miss Manigaults
teach in Yorkville, - and all over the State people are making
efforts to support themselves, and adorning their reduced 
circumstances by their elegance &amp; education.</p>
          <p>Elizabeth has engaged with Miss Read for another year,
<pb id="grim118" n="118"/>
and in consequence of this I suppose we will stay here another
Summer.</p>
          <p>We have engaged a family of our own former slaves
as our hired servants, a man Josey, his wife Amy &amp; daughter
Delia for $16 per Month. The man $10, the girl &amp; woman $6,
they do so far very well. -</p>
