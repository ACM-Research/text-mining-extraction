        <p>* * * * Prof. Yates Snowden exhibited carefully prepared
copies of diaries kept by Miss Susan R. Jervey and Miss Charlotte St. J.
Ravenel at Northampton and Pooshee plantations, respectively, during the
months of February, March and April, 1865. Our women were then
unfrequently raided by roving bands of negro soldiers, mainly by the 55th
Mass. Regiment. Professor Snowden suggested that a committee be
appointed to consider the propriety and devise means for publishing these
authentic records of the sufferings and fortitude of our kinswomen during
those times, and to make a report at the next annual meeting.</p>
        <p>After an animated discussion by President T. P. Ravenel, J. St. Clair
White, H. R. Dwight and others, Capt. Sam'l G. Stoney moved that the
club proceed to publish the diaries forthwith, using such funds as were
available in the treasury, and that the members of the club subscribe
individually enough to make up the deficit.</p>
        <p>The President appointed Capt. Sam'l G. Stoney, J. St. Clair White and
Prof. Yates Snowden a committee to edit the diaries, add explanatory
foot notes, and make a suitable contract with some publishing house for
300 copies of the pamplet. * * * *</p>

        <head>EXTRACTS FROM JOURNAL, KEPT BY MISS SUSAN R.
JERVEY, AT NORTHAMPTON PLANTATION.<ref id="ref1" n="1" rend="sc" target="note1" targOrder="U">*</ref></head>
        <p>Thursday night February 16th. Such awful news came to us
that just as the table was laid and everything ready for us to enjoy
our supper Father<ref id="ref2" n="2" rend="sc" target="note2" targOrder="U">1</ref> decided not to wait, but ordered the horses to
be harnessed to the carriage, and we started on our fearful
journey from Cedar Grove,<ref id="ref3" n="3" rend="sc" target="note3" targOrder="U">2</ref> 
not even taking time to carry
anything with us; our terror on the road imagining we heard the
Yankees' guns across the swamp. We reached Northampton
about 10:00 o'clock. After a quiet night, we found many of the
terrifying rumors false. Mother spent the next day at Cedar
Grove, packing up and moving our more valuable goods here.</p>
        <p>Saturday February 18th. Nothing certain about Columbia.
Father and Rene<ref id="ref4" n="4" rend="sc" target="note4" targOrder="U">3</ref> w
ho had gone to hunt up James's<ref id="ref5" n="5" rend="sc" target="note5" targOrder="U">4</ref> 
company at
Santee, returned this morning not having found the Marion
Artillery. The dear old city (is) to be given up tonight at 12:00
o'clock; our army is falling back.</p>
        <p>Sunday February 19th. The most un-Sunday feeling Sunday I
have ever past. Father and Rene started for St. Stephens Depot
in hopes of finding James hearing his battalion was to
<note id="note1" n="1" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref1">*. Northampton. 
A St. Julien homestead, passing by marriage into the
hands of Gen'l William Moultrie, whose name belongs to the history of the
State. On this place he made the first experiment of cotton-planting on a large
scale. The substantial brick house was destroyed by fire in 1842, but the
massive walls were uninjured, and the loss done by fire restored. (From the
“Upper Beat of St. John's, Berkeley,” by Prof. F. A. Porcher.)</note>

Cedar Grove, my grandmother's old home, away from the great
thoroughfares, was our refuge during the war, but Father had promised that
Aunt Nenna (Mrs. Stevens) should not be left with her two babies all alone to
meet the Yankees—the place was Northampton, near Black Oak the center of
Yankee raiding. We kept putting off our move until the news came of the army
being at Orangeburg. S. R. J.</note>

the plantation, when they returned bringing James and Sinkler
<ref id="ref6" n="6" rend="sc" target="note6" targOrder="U">5</ref>
with them.</p>
        <p>These boys started from Huger's Bridge to walk home; got
lost and spent the whole of last night in the woods. They must
have wandered over thirty miles.</p>
        <p>Tuesday morning, 2 A. M. February—. Too busy with my
books to write last night. James and Henry Sinkler started after
dinner for their company. Startled a little while ago to hear some
noise under my window; my head being full of negroes and
Yankees roused up Mother with the cry, “the enemy is upon us”!
Just as we stood listening, a man's head appeared at the door. It
was an age of terror, altho' hardly a second before we recognized
James. Henry Sinkler and himself could not find their company,
so came back seeing a light in my window. James had tried to
attract my attention when, remembering a defective shutter, he
got in.</p>
        <p>A Lieut. LaBorde<ref id="ref7" n="7" rend="sc" target="note7" targOrder="U">2</ref>

pleasant spoken dined here yesterday, trying to get a horn. 
Charles<ref id="ref8" n="8" rend="sc" target="note8" targOrder="U">3</ref> turned over 
his riding horn to him. One squad of
Southern deserters and five Georgians passed through this
morning looking for their command.</p>
        <p>February 21st. Our news now is all rumor; no papers; no
letters. All we know is picked up from soldiers passing through.
They are all marching for St. Stephens, where the army is
concentrating to cross the bridge.</p>

        <p>James and Sinkler left after breakfast and the buggy has not
yet got back.</p>
        <p>Aunt Nenna has been busy all day moving all her provisions
into the house. * * * * The negroes seem very unwilling for the
work; some of their aside speeches very incendiary. Edward, the
old coachman is particularly sullen.</p>
        <p>Wednesday February 22nd. Anna and her father old Mr.
Cain<ref id="ref12" n="12" rend="sc" target="note12" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
spent the morning. The buggy got back this morning. A
note from James. Such a pitiful little note, on a slip of Confederate
paper sealed with pine-gum! They expect to cross today, as the
enemy have landed at Bull's Bay and are advancing rapidly. This
afternoon while very busy unpacking a box in the store room to
carry up stairs to hide grist in, the alarm was given that the
cavalry had come to burn the cotton. I dropped everything * * *
while I ran to help the work. Aunt Nenna, Mother and I helped to
roll one bale down the hill. Then Aunt Nenna was as busy as
anyone, cutting the bagging open before setting a fire. No
one can say she is not patriotic; she gave her three horses to the
government; has burnt her five bales of cotton, worth about
$7,500, and tomorrow sends off six or seven of her mules to the
army. Most of the negro men took to the swamp last night for
fear of impressment, Edward ringleader! Such heavy guns this
morning! * * * *</p>
        <p>Thursday, February 23—Uncle Peter<ref id="ref13" n="13" rend="sc" target="note13" targOrder="U">2</ref> 
and his troop crossed
Le Nud's Ferry to-day. Poor Neddie<ref id="ref14" n="14" rend="sc" target="note14" targOrder="U">3</ref> 
stopped here to-day on his
way home, not knowing that home was desolate. Mother and
home having gone, his eyes filled and his lip quivered when we
told him.</p>
        <p>Friday, February 24th. An anxious day. This morning heard
firing, nearer, much nearer than the city; also that the enemy are
fighting at Monck's Corner. Cousin Edwin,
<ref id="ref15" n="15" rend="sc" target="note15" targOrder="U">4</ref> who has been down
to reconnoitre, says the enemy have been fighting our cavalry
under Captain Campbell near the canal bridge between Biggin
and Monck's Corner on the Murray's Ferry Road. The right wing
of skirmishers passed through Mrs.

These men are said to have marched
from Bull's Bay to intercept our men at St. Stephens. We have
been so intent watching for the Yankees that we mistook a party
of our men, Georgians, for the enemy. Everything was ready.
Rene even had his blanket ready for the swamp, when we found
that they were our men, cut off from their command on their way
to join them at Nelson's Ferry. We, in the joy of our hearts, gave
them a good dinner; made them dry their wet clothes by the fire,
filled their pockets with “goobers” and I hope sent them away
content and comfortable.</p>
        <p>Saturday, February 25th. Jacob<ref id="ref17" n="17" rend="sc" target="note17" targOrder="U">2</ref> 
returned from St. Stephens;
says our pickets have been driven in; a body of artillerymen
who had been sent to meet the Yankees had returned
and everything was hastening to cross the bridge. Harry
<ref id="ref18" n="18" rend="sc" target="note18" targOrder="U">3</ref> came
down from Cedar Grove this morning; only hope he will get horse
and buggy safe home. The negroes have most terrifying stories
this morning; the enemy have marched through Pinopolis, and
were at Wampee last night, others say they heard great whooping
and yelling as if some one was driving a hundred of cattle.</p>
        <p>Sunday, February 26th. White Hall Essex
<ref id="ref19" n="19" rend="sc" target="note19" targOrder="U">4</ref> was here last
night; says a negro had come from Gippy; the Yankees had shot
all of Mrs. White's poultry; took her horses; tore up her clothes
and threw them out of the windows to the negroes; broke up her
crockery; when they could not get keys, broke up the locks. The
negro says this was only the first party. When the officers came
they stopped the work of devastation, till the rest of the army
came.</p>
        <p>Monday, February 27th. Yankees at DuBois (near Bonneau's)
yesterday noon, four or five in number; did nothing but
carry off Mr. Harvey's saddle and bridle. Before leaving they
called up the negroes and told them they were free; consequently
none would go to work this morning. Father heard this from Mr.
Harvey whom he met at Pooshee, where all the men left in the
neighborhood met to decide what to do to save

their property from Yankee spoliation. They had quite a fright; a
squad of cavalry were seen coming up the avenue, which were
taken for Yankees, but were discovered to be our own men under
Lieut. Bright of Edgefield, detached by Gen. Samuel W. Ferguson
to come down to worry the enemy and suppress disorder among
the negroes. Poor old Mr. Cain * * * started for home on the first
alarm, working his way around to stop here and let us know Father
was a prisoner! Father having come home the direct road had told us
all the news before the old man's arrival. The enemy penetrated as
far as Black Oak last night where they took prisoner one of our
poor soldiers who had stopped at the Myers' for supper. They
returned as they came through Wantoot. The negroes say the
house there very much injured. I hear Mrs. (Catherine) White
behaved very bravely, but old Mrs. Brunson, who lived with her,
said so much, the Yankees threatened to put her head through the
window and shoot it off! Mrs. White wrote and begged Mr. Lewis
Simons, who lived near, to come to her aid. He could not leave
his family, but invited General Potter <hi rend="italics">(sic)</hi> 
to dinner; told him what
his men were doing. Potter instantly sent an order for them to
desist. What I most fear is not the Yankees, but the negroes, cut
off from all help from across the river, and at their mercy, what
will become of us? Disorder has already started. Aunt Nenna's
people have all returned to their work, except Edward; the leader, I
firmly believe. Bram returned this morning, but when Aunt Nenna
sent him word to come to his weaving; his answer was, he wouldn't,
that he was cutting wood. When she sent word he must come, he
decamped and has not been heard from since.</p>
        <p>Ash Wednesday, March 1st. A gloomy, uncomfortable day; no
church to go to; in constant dread of a Yankee invasion. A
skirmish at Harbin last night; our little squad of cavalry under
Bright was there. A negro brought the Yankees from Pineville
and piloted them to where our men were camped taking them
completely by surprise, capturing Bright and killing two of his men.
Another mortally wounded, died this morning. All we can learn of
the skirmish, the Yankees fired at the back door, some of the balls
entering Cousin Jane's<ref id="ref20" n="20" rend="sc" target="note20" targOrder="U">1</ref>

room, one hitting the post of bedstead where her baby was
sleeping. She picked her up in her arms and rushed to the door
appealing to the captain. A rumor tonight Cousin Rene a
prisoner.</p>
        <p>Monday 2nd March. A most exciting day. This morning a
Pooshee negro came over. The black Yankees, four in number,
had been at Pooshee last night; had threatened to shoot old
Uncle<ref id="ref21" n="21" rend="sc" target="note21" targOrder="U">2</ref> if he didn't 
tell where the brandy was hid; took all the
meat from the smoke house. Hear they had been to Cousin
William's<ref id="ref22" n="22" rend="sc" target="note22" targOrder="U">3</ref> in morning. 
Just after dinner a squad of Yankee
cavalry rode up to ask for wine. The captain (Hartwell) was
very polite. They went off to Chelsea, but soon returned. Then,
while the officer was in the parlor talking, the men were busy at
the back of the house, going through the closets, the safe, the
dairy and the kitchen, * * * taking whatever they could find in
the way of eatables,—have literally left us nothing for supper.
One stayed behind and carried of Charles's colt “Flavella.” These
Yankees have pockets half the length of their legs and there is no
telling what they contrive to stuff into them.</p>
        <p>Friday, March 3rd. A most exciting night of horror! While I
was writing yesterday afternoon another squad of three Yankees
rode up in search of saddles and bridles. They were very rude;
said we might as well tell where things were and save their
rummaging, and then rode off. Aunt Nenna, having found some
cold waffles actually left we were quickly seated enjoying (?)
our supper thinking our trials over for the day, when we heard
many heavy steps in the entry, a rough knock at the door; a rude
voice; “how are you this evening, I say, how are you this
evening?” The open door revealed the entry full of negro
Yankees, armed to the teeth and all drunk enough to do mischief.
Mother, who is in constant dread of Rene's being seized on
account of his age, altho' so small, motioned him into the back
room. (Aunt Nenna's chamber), where the children had all run to
hide. The negro sergeant, a coal black giant of six feet,
immediately demanded what the boy was after and called him
back. Aunt Nenna,
<note id="note21" n="21" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref21">2. Dr. 
Henry Ravenel (Pooshee).</note>
<note id="note22" n="22" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref22">3. Wm. 
F. Ravenel (Woodlawn).</note>
<pb id="jerv9" n="9"/>
with much presence of mind went to the door and brought out
Charles Stevens. The sergeant was very insulting in his language.
He demanded all fire arms, which were given him; then he
wanted wine; said he had been told we had some, and would get
it out of Father. Called for a rope and ordered a squad of men to
carry him and string him up if he would not give up the liquor.
Mother threw herself on her knees pleading for Father's life. The
wretch spurned her with his foot, and told her to behave herself
like a woman and he would treat her like one. Mother was so
overcome we had to get her into Aunt Nenna's room. One of the
men came to the door and told me: “Speak to the lady and make
yourselves satisfied he wouldn't let Father be hurt”;—with this
small comfort I went to Mother. To add to our troubles Mother
remembered a phial of brandy up stairs saved for Father's use. If
the wretches found it, what would become of us? Mother could
not move; the children were clinging to her; the difficulties of the
way; a long black entry full of drunken devils; then another entry
above full of unknown horrors. We waited until most of the
Yankees had left the house. Liz
<ref id="ref23" n="23" rend="sc" target="note23" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
offered to go with me; holding
on to each other we treaded on our way, scarcely daring to think,
we reached the room safely. Rose Washington,
<ref id="ref24" n="24" rend="sc" target="note24" targOrder="U">2</ref> who had been
faithful, followed us; the guard were all around the house. We
were afraid to throw the phial out, when we got it. Rose proposed
breaking it in a bucket of water and carrying the bucket down on
her head. She did her part well, badgering the men she met and
answering their questions. I followed with Liz so grateful when
we got to Mother. I can't tell the words and doings of the Devils,
but soon after we got back, our “friend” came to the door to say
Father was all right; none of us had sense to do the right thing, but
poor little Liz who stepped up and shook the man's hand thanking
him. The men had all the meat and salt collected and brought into
the entry and the captain distributed it to the negroes. We have
some idea of Hell now; such obscene language and ribald oaths
filling our ears for the better part of the night. When at last, near
daybreak they all left

the house, they demanded sugar and coffee to make a supper at
the black overseer's (Jimmy), you may imagine there was
no sleep even then for us. We waited their return. A mattress
had been thrown down in the middle of the room for the children.
The men threatened to kill William<ref id="ref25" n="25" rend="sc" target="note25" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
if he did not tell them where
the liquor was buried. Tommie and Jacob<ref id="ref26" n="26" rend="sc" target="note26" targOrder="U">2</ref>
 were carried to
Hanover to show them where it was hid. Aunt Nenna's people,
with few exceptions, have behaved shamefully. Several, we hear,
brought the enemy from Black Oak, hid them behind an out house
until darkness and quiet reigned.</p>
        <p>Night of Friday 3rd. About midday four or five Yankees
(white) rode up; got off their horses and demanded to search the
house. They ransacked everywhere; our private drawers were
rooted up. They carried off, amongst others poor Willie's
<ref id="ref27" n="27" rend="sc" target="note27" targOrder="U">3</ref> gold
watch he prized so much. When leaving, they told us the negro
troop would come tonight! So, another night of unrest, weary
watching and waiting! We have all moved downstairs—one of
the faithful few, generally Eugenia, Aunt Nenna's faithful maid,
sleeps in the house.</p>
        <p>Saturday, March 4th. We passed a better night than we
expected from sheer weariness; but, not much real rest as we did
not undress, expecting every moment to hear the tramp of
soldiers; but the night passed, and thank God! not a Yankee, black
or white! Tonight, just before retiring one of the servants scared
us by knocking violently at the back door. The servants, I can't
say all, but many, say they are free and went off last night; one
Uncle Henry trusted most left, it is supposed, for Charleston. As a
great favor, got one of the men to carry a note to Pooshee this
morning. Cousin Ria<ref id="ref28" n="28" rend="sc" target="note28" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
wrote us an account of what they had gone
through. When the army came they were all in the piazza. The
black troopers rode up, and hurrahed for Liberty. The negroes
were called up and made to kiss and shout; even Janetta is
tainted. The night before when the five Yankees (black) were
there, the plantation negroes rushed into the store room and took
everything,

even leaving them no salt. When the army came, had to get
General Potter to send one of the soldiers to the negro houses to
get some for them. Cousin Ria sends a note from Cousin Rene,
Pineville must be worse off than we are. It seems completely
given up to the negroes. They have burnt all unoccupied houses.
The freed negroes from the neighboring plantations seem worse
than the Yankees, are destroying and burning everything around
the village. At old Col. Ferguson's,<ref id="ref29" n="29" rend="sc" target="note29" targOrder="U">2</ref>
 Dockon, the Yankees tore up
all the ladies' clothes and threw them out of the window; ripped
up the beds; took the feathers and provisions mixed them up with
the molasses—such wanton destruction!</p>
        <p>Monday, 6th March. Saturday the black troopers went to
White Hall. The negroes behaved shamefully; went into the
house; took whatever they wanted; tore down the curtains. The
black “general”<ref id="ref30" n="30" rend="sc" target="note30" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
had to go in his buggy to the negro yard and
bring some of the things back. At Ophir, I hear the negroes met
the Yankees and told them their mistress gave them so much they
did not want more, so they did not go to the house. Yesterday
they went to Cedar Spring, Harbin, &amp;c.; dined at Cedar Spring on
some turkeys they had killed at Brunswick.</p>
        <p>Tuesday, March 7th. Harrison<ref id="ref31" n="31" rend="sc" target="note31" targOrder="U">2</ref> 
has come down from Cassawda

Poor Lilla I hear has got no further on her journey than Gourdin's
Station, where she is living in a box car with no provisions. We
heard from Anna Cain to-day. Her people have behaved well, but
the Yankees treated them badly, even took the covering off Mr.
Cain's bed and demanded all his money, and took Anna's clothes to
distribute. They were rescued by her maid Rachel who offered to
part them for the officer; told him if they were thrown out of the
window there

would be no end of quarreling among the people. When the
Yankees left she restored everything to its place.</p>
        <p>From all accounts the Yankees have taken less from us than
most of the others, indeed, some of Hartwell's (the Yankee
Captain) men said the old lady (Mother) looked so pitiful and had
so many children that they could not take much from her.</p>
        <p>March 8. Wednesday. Yesterday, as we heard Pinopolis was
to be burnt, Aunt Nenna sent William to save what he could;
found her house had already been emptied by her own people.
Tonight Moorfield Henry<ref id="ref34" n="34" rend="sc" target="note34" targOrder="U">5</ref> 
stopped on his way to Pooshee to tell
us the Yankees had gone to Cedar Grove last night and again this
morning. He knows they had one barrel of wine as they had it on
the cart last night; the other he thinks they broke open and made
the people help them empty. All the men who could get horses
and mules were with the troopers. The Yankees ordered
breakfast and Daphne and the other women were busy cooking
for them. The Moorfield negroes are crazy quite; they have been
to Pinopolis, helping in the sacking of the houses. One brought off
Mr. Stevens's<ref id="ref35" n="35" rend="sc" target="note35" targOrder="U">1</ref> carriage 
and was to go back for the piano which
he (Mr. Stevens) had left at Chelsea lot for safety. Anna sent a
letter from Sallie Palmer;<ref id="ref36" n="36" rend="sc" target="note36" targOrder="U">2</ref> 
hear that the men in Columbia had to
fly so rapidly, no time for a single blow; that the enemy have
possession; blew up the new State House and burnt the old one.</p>
        <p>The Yankees have been as high up as Cherry Grove and
Poplar Hill; their gun boats have gone up the river as far as
Mexico, one threw a shell in front of the house. They went to Mr.
Warren Palmer's<ref id="ref37" n="37" rend="sc" target="note37" targOrder="U">3</ref> 
and offered him three alternatives; to take the
oath of allegiance; to give up his house and be put across the
river, or else they would give him sixty acres (mind you, his own
land! ) which he was to work with his own negroes. A poor man
near Laurel Hill gave himself up to the enemy; was carried to
Charleston and thrown into barracks

with about six hundred negroes, with nothing but cracked corn to
eat.</p>
        <p>Monday, March 12th. Plenty of rumors to chronicle tonight;
feel so much more light hearted. We are not entirely deserted. A
body of our men, scouts under young Dennis
<ref id="ref38" n="38" rend="sc" target="note38" targOrder="U">4</ref> are doing fine
work, if he only escapes Bright's fate. He and his men peppered
the black troopers at Blue Hole. * * * The story goes that the
black troopers had so “raggified” the house that the family had to
take refuge in the kitchen and barn that night. The scouts are
repressing rebellion amongst the the negroes. One negro (Old
Rose's son Harry) disappeared the other night. Rius gave his wife
(Ellen) a fearful beating because she came to wait on Aunt
Nenna. Those who are faithful suffer so much from the rebellious
ones, and we can do nothing to protect them. Poor Mrs. Hill, a
refugee from islands was living in Whiteville. The Yankees found
out, or pretended to find out that the cook had put poison in the
coffee they had demanded for breakfast, turned her out of her
home, just with the clothes she had on, distributed everything and
burnt the house.<ref id="ref39" n="39" rend="sc" target="note39" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
Mom Beck from Cedar Spring—she has clung
to Kate<ref id="ref40" n="40" rend="sc" target="note40" targOrder="U">2</ref> through 
everything—gave us an account of the Yankees
there. Anne Porcher asked the black captain what orders he had
to search so closely. He raised his gun and threatened to shoot
her; asked about John Porcher, said it was well he had not been
killed in the war as they would have wrung George's
<ref id="ref41" n="41" rend="sc" target="note41" targOrder="U">3</ref> neck. How
harrowing this to poor Kate, so recently widowed with only
George to care for! All her meat, &amp;c. was distributed, they sent
her a portion, even some of her wine, and finished off by all dining
in the house at the table, the Captain when he finished carrying
off a silver butter knife and spoon to remember the place. Quash
<ref id="ref42" n="42" rend="sc" target="note42" targOrder="U">4</ref>

        <p>He had heard wherever the Yankees go the fellows with them
are allowed to press all the animals for themselves. As soon as
he heard the troopers were coming, he mounted the boys on the
horses and mules, made them claim them and ride some way
with the troopers, then come back home. By morning every
animal was safe in the swamp.</p>
        <p>March 14th. Tuesday. James's birthday; the hardest part of
being cut off as we are is hearing nothing of those we care for
beyond the river. To our delight part of the Pooshee colony
ventured over this morning; a party of women and children
headed by Cousin Henry's<ref id="ref43" n="43" rend="sc" target="note43" targOrder="U">5</ref> 
patriarchal figure mounted on old
Uncle's little white pony. We were glad to see some friendly
white faces and have someone to talk to.</p>
        <p>Have got the true story of the Blue Hole skirmish. Charlie
Snowden had set the negroes at Cassawda to work. The troopers
were at Springplains;<ref id="ref44" n="44" rend="sc" target="note44" targOrder="U">1</ref>
 saw them, dashed over and demanded
their master. On being told where he was, set out after him at
Blue Hole. Charlie, knowing all the byways and short cuts
escaped and brought the scouts to meet them. How the fight went
we can't understand as the stories contradict each other, but the
vandals turned Mrs. Snowden<ref id="ref45" n="45" rend="sc" target="note45" targOrder="U">2</ref>
 out into the kitchen, saying that
was good enough for her. Stripped the house of everything;
distributed or destroyed all they could get hold of. The next
morning the scouts were very much mortified by Mrs. Snowden's
conduct; they returned to reinstate her in her house and get back
at least some of her things. She implored them to leave her, not to
come near her; that they brought trouble and distress wherever
they went. We heard nothing of poor Charlie.</p>
        <p>Wednesday 15th March. Kate Porcher stopped here on her
way to Black Oak. She is certainly brave, went all alone in her
sulky with only Samuel behind, Mr. Edward Mazyck was stopped
on the road and had his horse taken from him * * *
Near dark a woman rode up on a sorry looking horse,
asking shelter for the night. It was pouring rain; she seemed

Nenna are possessed with the idea that she is a man in disguise,
certainly she is masculine looking in her stride &amp;c. This is her
story; she is a Georgian, came to Charleston to see her brother in
the hospital. The railroads were cut, and her brother moved. She
got as far as Mr. Hare's, near Pinopolis. After waiting three
weeks to find some way of getting home, giving up in despair
bought an old horse and saddle and started on her lonely journey
to Orangeburg, where she has friends who will help her on her
road. She is an Atlanta refugee and has been living with a brother
in Southern Georgia. She says we don't know what trouble is as
yet. She stood with many others and saw her home burnt in
Atlanta. When the war commenced, she had property, a husband
and four brothers; all gone but two brothers, and all she owns is in
two trunks.</p>
        <p>16th March. Mother was so anxious to get letters across the
river, that, notwithstanding our suspicions she gave a kind of
diary<ref id="ref46" n="46" rend="sc" target="note46" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
letter of all we had gone through for the aunts in Walhalla,
to the woman's care when we started her off on her journey this
morning.</p>
        <p>At Monck's Corner the Yankees shot an old man, a Mr.
Maree, taking him for Mr. Denny, Col. Ferguson's overseer. The
old man opened the door when they knocked and instantly had
three balls shot through him.</p>
        <p>One poor woman, a Mrs. Weatherford—Mrs. White's
overseer's wife—the Yankees gave away everything she had to
the negroes, even the hat she had on her head.  They burnt her
house, leaving her literally nothing but the clothes she had on.</p>
        <p>Friday 17th March. Dr. Morton Waring here this morning, as
usual bringing piles of news; had seen Dr. White,
<ref id="ref47" n="47" rend="sc" target="note47" targOrder="U">2</ref> who had been
ordered down to act as surgeon to our scouts. A skirmish at
Florence, our men cutting the Yankees up; the vandals had
reached Columbia, arriving in the night, turned the people out of
their homes, put torches to the houses reducing the city to ruins.
Reputable ladies were following the army begging bread for their
little ones. At Cheraw the Yankees

got two wagon loads of specie from the banks—moved
there from Charleston.</p>
        <p>Richard Strobhart was taken up by the black troopers in
Pinopolis for Charlie Snowden and carried to Moss Grove their
headquarters; cross-questioned about our scouts &amp;c.; insisting this
was the boy who had set the scouts on them at Blue Hole. While
they were questioning him, a carriage with out-riders drove up in
great style, and with all the form and ceremony of high life, “the
General,” as he is called, handed out a black lady, very much
dressed. When she passed Strobhart, she asked about him; said
he could not be the boy they wanted as this one had come up with
her on the train a few days before. On this evidence he was
released.</p>
        <p>Saturday, March 18th. Anna Cain and her father dined here
to-day; so pleasant to have a young person to talk to once more.</p>
        <p>Mr. Lewis Simons has had their minister Mr. Olmsted and his
family living with him at Pawley. The Yankees visited the place
and did no injury at first, but picked up a letter from Mr. S. written
very bitterly. Not being able to read it, they carried it to the gun
boat, had it read; returned to the house distributing everything, not
even giving the old lady, old Mrs. Keating Simons (his mother),
time to put on her shoes and stockings; made them walk over to
the next place, over a mile across the rice field banks, in this
condition.</p>
        <p>This afternoon, for the first time, we walked out on the dam
across the swamp to Brunswick enjoying our freedom, but met a
crowd of negroes going to Indianfield. On returning to the house,
saw more, all going the same road, all armed with bags. We hear
the Yankees are there and are going to sup with us. To add to our
consternation, we heard some white soldiers were in our negro
yard. We hurried, shut up the house. Hennie and Laura, rejoicing
at their release from prison walls, were playing at the foot of the
front steps, when seeing soldiers coming, they flew in terror into
the house hiding behind the door. The men rode up calling to the
children; “We are not Yankees, but Rebs;”—some of our own
scouts under Dennis and McTureous. We were so uneasy for
fear the vandals would meet them; so anxious for their safety, we
could
<pb id="jerv17" n="17"/>
not enjoy the pleasure of seeing our own men again. They came
to the negroes, ordering they to go to work Monday,&amp;c. Young
Dennis<ref id="ref48" n="48" rend="sc" target="note48" targOrder="U">*</ref> 
is very pleasant looking and McTureous is very good
looking indeed. They left us to scout around Indianfield, to find if
the Yankee story is true. I think the negroes must have been
disappointed as they passed back soon after the scouts left us. * * *</p>
        <p>Sunday, 19th March. Mr. Mitchum stopped here; his
regiment left the army at Cheraw; all disbanded and returning
home.</p>

born Sunday; poor little
mortal, at what a troublous time it has made its entry into life!</p>
        <p>Aunt Nenna's people have behaved infamously after the
scouts went; some eight or ten have gone, it is thought, to town,
determined not to work. The faithful few are very uneasy about
it; think the “boys” have gone to bring the Yankees back. Harry,
the driver at Hanover, (I wrote about his disappearance), has
been hung by the scouts. Dennis had reason to suspect his hiding
place in the swamp had been

“Edward J. Dennis belonged to Co. F. Sixth South Carolina Cavalry, Col.
Hugh K. Aiken. * * * When just out of his teens, while in Virginia the latter part
of 1864, took fever, and as soon as he could travel was sent on sick furlough to
his home at or near Pinopolis, then in old Charleston District, now Berkeley
County. About the time that the City of Charleston was evacuated in 1865,
Dennis had recovered, and not knowing where his command was he gathered
together a squad of six men and operated on the Santee and Cooper rivers in old
Charleston District. He was a terror to the Yankee raiding parties who gave the
people of the section no end of trouble.” (From “Butler and Cavalry, 1861-
1865,” by U. R. Brooks, Columbia, S. C., 1909.)</note>

discovered by Harry. He and some of his men, disguised as
Yankees, went to his cabin and offered a bribe if he could put
them on the trail to the scouts' camp. Harry eagerly seized the
bait. When they reached the swamp they found he knew. Dennis
called up his men and they hung the traitor. Hear the oath has
been offered to the Cooper river planters. Some have taken it;
those who refused, nothing has been done to them as yet. We are
kept so distracted; rumors of all kinds,—some for and some
against us,—penetrate the heavy cloud that surrounds us. What to
believe—and what not to believe!</p>
        <p>Saturday, March 25th. Yesterday Cousin Henry and family
passed through on their wearisome journey home; they stopped
for good-bye. This has been a most exciting day. Mr. Myers,
(Uncle's overseer) passed through telling Dr. Waring, who went
out to stop him, that Willie must have slept last night at Cedar
Grove, as he was ahead of him on the road. Father went up to
Cedar Grove, but could hear nothing of him. Four of the Yankees
foraging for eggs, &amp;c. near Pinopolis were taken by our scouts;
the Yankees, in retaliation, marched up from the river to Hog
Swamp, took DeHay and the younger Dennis prisoners, spent last
night there returning through Somerset to their gun-boat this
morning.</p>
        <p>Harbin house was burned yesterday afternoon. Read a letter
from Sallie Palmer; the Pineville negroes, twenty-five in number,
fully armed, have been marauding about the neighborhood, but the
black troopers who have been plaguing this country were
captured by the white Yankees, tried and carried to town as
deserters.</p>
        <p>We all walked over to Pooshee this morning to see Mr.
Myers and hear something of Willie; gained no news; but
returning home, just as we entered Black Oak gate, saw Willie
drive in the opposite one. He had been knocking about Cedar
Grove for two days afraid to return as he had heard such accounts
of the Yankee raids. Poor child; he had nothing but the suit
of clothes he had on, having sold everything, even his blanket, for
something to eat. He walked down from Chester with some of the
men he had been staying with, a Mr. Avinger and Ray in
Wassamasaw. The scouts, we hear, are going to make a raid on
the Pineville negroes tonight. Willie
<pb id="jerv19" n="19"/>
says the whole track of Sherman's army is marked by smoking
ruins and piles of dead animals, from old —, on the State
Road, to Columbia. Everything is burnt even to the wheat fields.</p>
        <p>Monday, March 27th. The skirmish with negroes took place,
scouts successful,—nothing but the bare facts. Four houses on
Cooper river burnt because owners refused to take the oath; Ed
Lucas; Holmes; Prioleau, and Dr. Moultrie.</p>
        <p>Wednesday, 29th March. Mr. Gaillard dined here, brought
more accounts of battle which Willie had told us he had heard
confused accounts of. Press and Porcher Smith both wounded
and Henry Lesesne killed. The Marion Artillery (James's
company) not in the fight.</p>
        <p>Thursday, March 30th. Mr. Stevens called this afternoon. It
seems like old times again, his bright and cheerful view of things
has cheered us wonderfully.</p>
        <p>Friday, March 31st. We all walked over to Pooshee this
morning; it is too sweet to feel so secure again, altho' still a little
uneasy; things are falling back into their old routine.</p>
        <p>April 2, Sunday. Such a treat! Our own dear service read by
our own minister, in the old church! Such a display of mules, even
those who had saved their horses were afraid to use them. Mr.
Stevens lectured on Job's trials, truly his motto is, “Think and
Thank.”</p>
        <p>Moved upstairs tonight. We all have been camping out down
stairs since the night of the black Yankees.</p>
        <p>Wednesday, April 5th. Mother, Aunt Nenna and I with Willie
for driver rode over to Chelsea<ref id="ref54" n="54" rend="sc" target="note54" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
this afternoon in an ox-cart. The
whole family were in the piazza to receive us, quite amused at our
primitive equipage.</p>
        <p>Thursday, April 6. Willie drove me home to-day in the
buggy,—so pleasant, the woods are beautiful with a wealth of
jessamine, dog-wood and crab-apple flowers, while the air is
balmy with fragrance of thousands of blossoms. The last day of
Willie's stay here has been truly delightful. Tonight we sat late in
the piazza, everything so lovely! I forgot there was war and
bloodshed all around us.</p>
        <p>Saturday, April 8. Thank, God, Willie has gone! Father
<note id="note54" n="54" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref54">1. Chelsea, 
plantation home of Dr. Morton Waring.</note>
<pb id="jerv20" n="20"/>
and Mother spent yesterday with him at Cedar Grove, sending
him on in the afternoon to The Rocks
<ref id="ref55" n="55" rend="sc" target="note55" targOrder="U">1</ref> for the night.
Last night a squad of eight men rode up saying they were
our scouts; that the Yankees had almost surrounded them at
Somerset.<ref id="ref56" rend="sc" target="note56" targOrder="U">2</ref>
 You may guess our terror altho' Father and Aunt
Nenna were firmly persuaded they were Yankees spying out the
land. It is customary for folks to entertain the scouts, Aunt Nenna
never even offered them a drink of water. The Captain actually
got off his horse and told Father to listen and we would hear the
drums beating at Somerset. I was listening for the drum all night
(moved downstairs again); hardly closing my eyes. This morning
was grateful for one thing, Willie was safe! I could think of
little else. I don't think Father really believed the enemy were
near until at breakfast table, looking out the window we saw two
pillars of smoke rising from the direction of Somerset. It was mill
day, the engine in full blast and all our remaining stock in the way
of mules, wagons &amp;c. were assembled around the door. Father
wished to order Harry, who had just driven in from Cedar Grove
with the only horse left us, * * * to turn back, but it was too late.
From up the avenue and across the fields came two squads of
bluecoats at a mad gallop, like a very whirl wind, and before we
could think, the Yankees were on us! Riding around the house,
some to the stables, some to the mill, they scoured the place and
the house, taking all the harness except some belonging to the old
buggy. They took grist and poultry, shooting down the latter about
the yard.</p>
        <p>Richie White was with us; he was very much <sic corr="frightened">freightened</sic>. I
had gathered all the children in my room upstairs; every time I
would go near the window, he would implore me to come back.
Some of these wretches had prepared themselves for plunder,
having their pants' pockets below their knees. They carried off all
wagons, mules and carts; cleaned the store room of all hams &amp;c. we had hidden; 
knocked down all the geese they could. Our red-faced friend, 
who has been on every raid, was here again and
distinguished himself in the pilfering line; took a box with Uncle
Henry's letters. His buggy blanket
<note id="note55" n="55" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref55">1. The Rocks,
 plantation belonging to Mr. James Gaillard, Jr.</note>
<note id="note56" n="56" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref56">2. Somerset, 
plantation belonging to Mr. Wm. Cain.</note>
<pb id="jerv21" n="21"/>
was next seized, and finished off by pocketing Willie's flute,
which “would do to blow along the road,” he said. The officer
came upstairs making noise enough to scare all the children as he
had on not only his own sword and spurs, but Uncle Henry's
dragging behind him. Mother had all Father's clothes in a trunk in
the entry, but he passed that by going into Mother's room.
Noticed Father's tin box of papers; then to the press; Mother
trembled, as the silver we were using was all hidden in her
dresses, but finding no man's clothes,—with some most
contemptuous expression about “her using the poor old man so
badly, having so much more clothes,” he left, only stopping at my
room door, not coming in.</p>
        <p>One of the men rushed up before leaving and carried off the
blanket from the boys' bed.</p>
        <p>The Provost Marshal tried to make Father take the oath;
when he refused cursed him, and told Mother; “the men were all
fools,” but he “was sorry for the woman.” The wretches actually
carried off a towel that was hanging on the railing to dry.</p>
        <p>After they had gone Mother missed Laura! Such stories of
Yankees carrying off little ones, our hearts sank! We sent to the
negro yard hoping she may have strayed to <sic>Mauma's</sic> house, but
no one had seen her; ah, the sorrow for us. So helpless; nothing
to do but try and comfort Mother! Aunt Nenna's room once had a
window on the piazza. When the shed-room was added, it was
boarded up; the high bedstead with its curtains was put against it;
the brick wall being thick, the recess of the window made a
splendid hiding place for valuables from the Yankees. Mother
was sitting weeping by the fire-place, when she heard a faint
voice; “dem Yankee gone yet?” She thought at first she was
dreaming, when the question was repeated. Soon sorrow was
turned into joy. She had wandered from her haven of refuge in
my room to find Mother; failing to do so, she had crept into a
good place to hide, and worn out with terror and weeping, had
fallen asleep!</p>
        <p>Hear the Yankees are en route for Pineville, where they say
they are “going to give the people Hell.”</p>
        <p>Sunday, April 9th. Here's what the Yankees did at Pooshee.
Heard from Cousin Hennie this morning. The Yankees took
some of their silver and all of Uncle's clothes.</p>
        <pb id="jerv22" n="22"/>
        <p>Dr. Waring has just been here; Cousin William
<ref id="ref57" n="57" rend="sc" target="note57" targOrder="U">1</ref> and Cousin
Rene both prisoners, the former right sick. Edith and Mary
Waring were driving Leize Edwards home to Stewarton when
they met the Yankees, who took them prisoner, carrying them
along almost to Woodlawn; then, on Edith's persistent pleadings,
after taking their fine horse from them, they sent them off with an
old balky animal that could hardly drag them home.</p>
        <p>We find out Father was saved from taking the oath by the
testimony of one of the enemy, who had served as a clerk when
a boy in a corner shop near George St. Judy
<ref id="ref58" n="58" rend="sc" target="note58" targOrder="U">1</ref> recognized him,
brought him up and made him give testimony that he knew Father
lived in the city, and was only a refugee, as he said.</p>
        <p>Eugenia and Judy have been faithful through everything.</p>
        <p>Monday, April 10. Another anxious night of watching. A note
from Anna Cain; the Yankee army had camped in Somerset yard,
burning all fences, cutting down the beautiful shrubbery in the
gardens to build their boothes; killed every head of poultry, except
a few turkeys that escaped; took all the meat from the store room
except a few pieces; worse than all, burnt down the provision
barn with all the corn and peas &amp;c. The most of Anna's news is
that a fresh party is coming up from Lewisfield. Chance, who
brought the note says he met some blue-coats on the way but did
not know if they were “Yankees or Scouts dress up.” Dr. Waring
was telling us the night the Yankees were at Hog Swamp, they
took Mrs. DeHay out in the woods and tried to make her betray
the scouts' hiding place in the swamp. None of their threats or
bribes had any effect. They even told her if she did not tell where
Dennis and his men were, they would burn her house down. She
says her blood was up; she told them they could do what they
pleased; that Southern women would live under the green trees
rather than betray their friends.</p>
        <p>Wednesday, 26th April. The Yankees that visited us carried
desolation to some places in the upper Parish. Mexico yard was
cleaned up of everything like houses and trees, even the dwelling
house was burned. Mr. Mazyck Porcher after standing and
seeing his home destroyed was taken prisoner and

carried to town. Cousin William and Cousin Rene were released
and returned home the Wednesday after they were taken.</p>
        <p>At Walnut Grove (old Mr. James Gaillard's) everything was
destroyed or given to the negroes, even the ladies' clothes.</p>
        <p>At Blue Hole everything was thrown out of the windows.
Mr. Charles Snowden who had just returned from Aiken with his
family has started again for Camden. The Yankees camped one
night at Eutaw devastating the place, leaving Mrs. Sinkler nothing
for her next meal. On her so telling the Commissary, he had some
rice mixed with sand and given her. The Yankees returned to
town by the State Road, the scouts peppering them from the
bushes the whole way. The next Wednesday (the 12th) a band of
two hundred and fifty passed, going up to their gun-boat. The
16th was a beautiful bright Easter day. Mr. Stevens preached
here to the negroes. Aunt Nenna fixed the old brick barn (the
upper story) and the children dressed it with green and apple
blossoms. Kate and Anne Porcher joined the folks here making
the white congregation. I was too tired, could not get out; have
been sick since the last Yankee visit. Pettus and his whole band
of scouts passed through the yard after church, and Uncle Peter
<ref id="ref59" n="59" rend="sc" target="note59" targOrder="U">1</ref>
and his company supped here returning through the next morning.
Cousin Edwin<ref id="ref60" n="60" rend="sc" target="note60" targOrder="U">2</ref>
 died last Friday of typhoid fever, he never got
over the burning of his home. (Harbin.)</p>
        <p>Last Sunday, (23rd April) a most exciting day. Willie and Mr.
Tharin came in just before the folks came from church, it being
communion Sunday. (I not being well, stayed at home with the
children.) Just before dinner Uncle Peter was brought in badly
wounded, his hand very much shattered and a flesh wound in his
arm. His life was miraculously saved for both loads were aimed,
one for his head and the other for his heart. He was talking to a
man, in a friendly manner, on Cooper river, when, on riding off, he
saw the man raise his gun, and aim for his head. He threw up his
hand and received the whole load in it. The second shot glanced
off something he had in his pocket, tearing up his clothes, passed
through the

fleshy part of his arm. The Doctor has had to amputate his thumb.
Laura was so terrified at the blood when Uncle Peter was
brought in, she spent the day under my bed. Near dark a poor
worn-out foot-sore soldier from Lee's army begged for
somewhere to rest, and something to eat. The news we heard has
proved too true; for sixty hours surrounded by Grant's army with
nothing for man or horse to eat, Lee has surrendered! This
soldier was carried to Hilton Head, and is on his road home to
Sumter.</p>
        <p>On Sunday 25th April we heard the Yankees were coming.
Uncle Peter was moved to Chelsea as being more off the road
but found it was only a band of thirty men with a white flag who
went up to the river to communicate with Potter; could not get
over so returned this morning by the Congaree road.</p>
        <p>We heard last Saturday that Lincoln had been shot in the
theatre, and Seward stabbed in his bed;—this news from a
Herald Dr. Waring had.</p>
        <p>All of Uncle Peter's scouts breakfasted here. Tuesday
morning, Captain Sineath dined, and the great Lieut. Pettus was
here this afternoon, and I in my room, and saw none of them.
Uncle Peter returned home after dinner. Father and Mother spent
the morning at Cedar Grove. Between Yankees, negroes and
deserters, the house has literally been stripped of everything
portable. All books we had left thrown over the house.</p>
        <p>Cousin Henry<ref id="ref61" n="61" rend="sc" target="note61" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
came down from Aiken last week for the
girls, carrying them Monday; stopped for good-bye.</p>
        <p>Saturday, April 29th. Saw, from my window, a foot-sore,
weary looking pilgrim coming through the fields with his knapsack
on his back—Uncle Edward! (Dr. Smith). The aunts so worried
over our safety he had worked his way down from Pendleton. He
tells us Johnston's army has disbanded—Uncle E. brought letters,
one containing an extract from one of James's, the first time we
have heard since he crossed the river. Mr. Mazyck Porcher has
returned from the city, says the people are under an iron yoke;
they are not allowed to know anything outside.</p>

 was dreadfully treated on refusing

        <p>Tuesday, 2nd May. We have been enjoying an armistice of
thirty days. Pettus<ref id="ref63" n="63" rend="sc" target="note63" targOrder="U">2</ref>
 came over this afternoon to tell us and that he
and his scouts were ordered out and the armistice was over.
Uncle Peter got so nervous; sent for Dr. Waring preparatory to
moving to Cassawda, the Yankees having vowed vengeance
against him, but the Doctor carried him to Chelsea after dark.
We are anxious about Charlie (Snowden). Not knowing the
armistice was over, Uncle Peter sent Uncle Ned in his buggy as
far as Nelson's Ferry. They left just after breakfast and now near
11, no Charlie yet.</p>
        <p>We move home tomorrow, Wednesday May 3rd. Uncle
Peter lent his wagon to ride home in. Dr. Waring brought Uncle
Peter this morning to gather his belongings and move right on to
Cassawda. While we were waiting, something scared his horse;
she dashed off over the yard in a wild run, smashing the buggy
before she could be stopped.</p>

“One day Captain Pettus, the young Texan in command of our scouts,
came and told us that a raid had started from Charleston; a negro brigade with
white officers. They told us, to our horror, that they had taken prisoner two
gentlemen on their plantations in lower St. John's; one our friend Mr. Mazyck
Porcher, and Mr. William Ravenel a cousin of ours; and burned down Mr.
Porcher's house. * * * The next thing we heard was that the plantation of “old
Mr. James Gaillard, ” had been raided and the house almost destroyed. This was
because, when the troops arrived, they found two of the scouts riding away
from the house where they had been given breakfast. Mr. Gaillard was an old
man and his house was a veritable haven of refuge for women and children. One
of the granddaughters who lived with him had an infant of two or three weeks
old, and there were a number of others, old and young, homeless bereaved and
afflicted women. One of the officers ordered them all to leave the house. He
stood on the steps using frightful language, as he was in a towering rage on
account of their sheltering “bushwhackers,” as he called them. These women
were courageous enough to refuse to leave the house, knowing very well that it
would be burned down if they did. They all gathered on the piazza while the
soldiers ripped off the doors, tore off the shutters and threw furniture and china
out of the windows; even a melodeon.”

RAVENEL OF POOSHEE PLANTATION
FOR MISS META HEYWARD</head>
        <opener><dateline>Pooshee, Feb., 1865.</dateline>
<lb/>
<salute>My dear Meta:</salute></opener>
        <p>As we are cut off from each other now, I will attempt to
write for you, in journal form, an account of the trying times
through which we are passing.</p>
        <p>After the evacuation of Savannah we were very anxious to
get to Aiken, but Pa<ref id="ref67" n="67" rend="sc" target="note67" targOrder="U">1</ref>
 thought it best not to go until we were certain
of Sherman's movements. We heard from time to time that
Charleston could not be held, and yet we heard on every side that
Augusta was his destination. Several events occurred which
would have prevented our going up if it had been our intention, the
freshet then too Henry's<ref id="ref68" n="68" rend="sc" target="note68" targOrder="U">2</ref>
 illness and last of all the cutting of the
railroad, which effectually cut us off.</p>
        <p>We got newspaper accounts of Sherman's movements on
Orangeburg, and then there was a report that he was marching
down the State Road to Charleston and of course we believed it.
Every day report brought them nearer. Hennie had the silver
packed ready for interment. On Wed'y evening the 10th of Feb'y.
a note came from Aunt Ria<ref id="ref69" n="69" rend="sc" target="note69" targOrder="U">1</ref>
 saying the Yankees were not far
from Walworth, that they had burnt two houses on the river, and
that all the men and boys in the upper Parish were leaving home,
and going to a place of safety. This made us very uneasy on
Harry's account, for he was very weak. That night we got a note
from Pa who was staying at Indianfield, asking Hennie to send
for them very early the next morning, he said Uncle Rene's
<ref id="ref70" n="70" rend="sc" target="note70" targOrder="U">2</ref>
horses would be used for something else as there was no time to
be lost, and telling her to have the silver ready, we thought the
note very mysterious,

but were not at all alarmed by it, for on the 16th the next day,
Grand Pa<ref id="ref71" n="71" rend="sc" target="note71" targOrder="U">3</ref> 
sent off for salt, and sent one of the servants to town
for some things we needed.</p>
        <p>After breakfast I was quietly reading “The Queens of
England,” when we heard a horse racing up the avenue, Cousin
Henrietta<ref id="ref72" n="72" rend="sc" target="note72" targOrder="U">4</ref> 
had sent word to say that the Yankees were at
Moorfield, and asked two of us for pity sake go and stay with her.
You can never imagine our feelings when we heard it and
thought of Aunt Ria by herself, my first impulse was to burn my
letters and to put on a suit of good clothes in case the others
should be taken. By that time the carriage came from Indianfield,
and Pa came in, he was in such a hurry that he never said “Good
morning,” but told us to come and help him pack. He then went in
and told Harry that he must go right off; fright seemed to make
us all strong, for two of us nearly ran with Harry's trunk down
one flight of stairs and up another. Pa and Harry went off in the
carriage loaded with all kinds of things and Uncle Rene went on
horse back. Though it was a relief to get them off it was a very
sad parting, for we did not know when we would meet again, and
the excitement in Harry's weak state made him so nervous we
were very uneasy about him.</p>
        <p>Soon after they got off we remembered the wine up-stairs,
and though we did not know at what moment the Yankees would
be here, we made the attempt to bring it down, and then we had
time to seal the bottles and have them buried in the garden. By
that time a wagon came from Moorfield with some of Aunt Ria's
things; we were very much relieved to hear that the enemy was
not at Moorfield, but near Walworth. A carriage then came from
Indianfield, and you would have been amused to see the number
of people in it, four nurses and eight children. The house was in
confusion all day. Belle and Aunt Ria both moving over, and
Grand Pa moving provisions into the house, we all worked so
hard that we were completely worn out by night. Aunt Ria came
that evening and told us how the mistake had been made, she had
written to Sarrazins exactly what she wrote us the evening before;

the family there sent word to the driver at Brunswick that the
Yankees were near Moorfield, and he must give out the corn to
the negroes; the driver sent word to Northampton that they were
at Moorfield. As everything was so quiet Emily
<ref id="ref73" n="73" rend="sc" target="note73" targOrder="U">1</ref> and I went to
spend the night with Cousin Henrietta we had not been frightened
enough for one day, for after supper, Mr. Jervey's
<ref id="ref74" n="74" rend="sc" target="note74" targOrder="U">2</ref> entire family
came down. They had heard that the raiders had burnt Mr.
Parker's house near them; they had intended coming down the
next day, but this news brought them at once. Emily had gone to
bed with a headache, and wanted to get up and come home, but I
persuaded her they could not get there before the next day,
though I was so frightened I could scarcely stand. So much for
one day of Yankee fright!</p>
        <p>Febr'y. 17. We were quite relieved to hear that the enemy
had taken the State Road, and gone down to Summerville. They
had visited several places and taken what they pleased. On our
way home we met Belle<ref id="ref75" n="75" rend="sc" target="note75" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
and Sister<ref id="ref76" n="76" rend="sc" target="note76" targOrder="U">2</ref> who told 
us of a report that
the Yankees were at The Rocks Church and the plantation on
their way to Belle Isle. I did not believe it, but thought it better to
be prepared, so buried a few things. Aunt Ria received a note
from Cousin Edward<ref id="ref77" n="77" rend="sc" target="note77" targOrder="U">3</ref>
 saying there was no truth in the reports we
had heard, that there was not a Yankee this side of Orangeburg.
We were not left quiet for long, for that evening Capt. Guerard,
from Savannah, rode up to say that he had come to notify the
planters that all of their corn was to be impressed by our
government to feed the army on its retreat from Charleston, and
that planters would be obliged to remove their property beyond
the lines. This was the first intimation we had that the evacuation
had commenced. We then held a council of war, and decided that
we must send and let the gentlemen know what we had heard;
fortunately we had found out that they were at the Eady's. We all
felt very blue for we heard that

our army was crossing as fast as possible at St. Stephens, and
then the bridge was to be burned.</p>
        <p>Febr'y. 18th. By breakfast time, the hiding party arrived. At
first Pa said it was impossible to stay here; that we must leave, if
we had to walk, but upon deliberation he concluded we could not
go, for the railroad being cut, our only way was by Orangeburg,
which we knew had been in the hands of the enemy, and besides,
we did not know if we had a house to go to, for we had heard
nothing definite from Aiken. We had three of our soldiers to
spend the night, and they cheered us up a great deal, and said it
was best to stay at home.</p>
        <p>Feb'y. 19th. I have never spent such a Sunday, and hope I
never will spend such another; we were in confusion from the
time we got up until we went to bed. Aunt Bet
<ref id="ref78" n="78" rend="sc" target="note78" targOrder="U">4</ref> moved over, and
Mr. Gignilliat came with her to spend a few hours.</p>
        <p>I had just been hoping that some of the soldiers we knew
would stop here. That night after we had all retired, Tom
Heyward came up, his feet all blistered from marching. On the
20th. Tom Heyward, Tom Porcher Ravenel, and Samuel Ravenel
all left to join their respective commands, Tom Porcher having
joined Mr. Gignilliat's battery. We were very anxious that Harry
should go along with them, but he was by no means strong
enough.</p>
        <p>Nothing occurred of any consequence except our soldiers
coming in continually, until the 24th, when we heard that there
was fighting down at Biggin Church. Uncle Thomas,
<ref id="ref79" n="79" rend="sc" target="note79" targOrder="U">1</ref> who was at
home, hurried off, and Belle<ref id="ref80" n="80" rend="sc" target="note80" targOrder="U">2</ref>
 moved her family to Pineville to
secure a summer home. About dinner time a party of horsemen
rode up; for a time we thought them Yankees, but soon found
out they were a squad under Lieut. Miller from Colcock's cavalry.
On the 25th just at dinner time, Dr. Waring
<ref id="ref81" n="81" rend="sc" target="note81" targOrder="U">*</ref> drove up to say that
Uncle Thomas would pass through in a few moments on his way
to St. Stephens and that our pickets were retreating before the
enemy. In a very short time a number of our men passed through
the yard. We

felt as if our last friends had left us, and that we would never see
a Confederate soldier again, and to add to our discomfort Dr.
Waring told us that the Yankees had visited Gippy, taken all they
wished, and then given out everything else to the negroes. Cousin
Catherine's<ref id="ref82" n="82" rend="sc" target="note82" targOrder="U">3</ref> 
clothes were thrown out, her bed clothes, towels,
&amp;c., burnt; her person was guarded; that was all. Of course this
put us in a state of mind. That night Pennie<ref id="ref83" n="83" rend="sc" target="note83" targOrder="U">4</ref> and myself sat up until
2:00 o'clock putting away things in a mattress. We opened the
cotton and put the things between. Though the next day was
Sunday we found a hiding place in our room and put away a great
many things. That evening we heard that Mr. Harvey
<ref id="ref84" n="84" rend="sc" target="note84" targOrder="U">5</ref> had been
visited, but not very badly treated. Just as we had gone up stairs a
servant of Uncle Rene's came in to say that the Yankees were all
along the road from Fairspring to Wantoot. We all slept in our
clothes that night for we were certain they would be here before
morning. On the 27th about midday the alarm was given that “the
Yankees were coming” but we had our fright for nothing, for they
turned out to be some of our scouts under Lieut. Bright. They had
four prisoners taken near Mr. Westcoat's place with a cart full of
things. Two of our men said they wanted to kill the prisoners but
the others would not let them. They stayed that night, and the next
at Harbin, or a part of the next, for a servant betrayed and they
were taken so much by surprise that two of these men were
killed, two wounded and Bright and two of his men taken
prisoners. The Yankees fired several times into the house thinking
men were there. They then gave out everything to the negroes,
which they all brought back to Cousin Jane.
<ref id="ref85" n="85" rend="sc" target="note85" targOrder="U">1</ref></p>
        <p>The 1st of March is a day which we will never forget;
everything went on as usual until nine o'clock at night when we
heard several pistol shots in the negro yard. I ran up stairs to tell
Pennie who had gone to bed and by the time I got back we heard
a noise at the back door; our hearts sank when we heard them
talking, for they were negroes without an officer,

what we had always dreaded. They asked for the master of
the house, and when Grand Pa went out, they asked in the
most insolent manner for his horses, wagons, meat and poultry.
They then asked if there were any fire arms in the house, and
told there was none but a plantation gun. They said they
would not believe that such a house could be without a gun
and that they would have it or shed blood. They then went
off into the yard to get the things. They emptied the smoke house;
took what poultry they wanted, and then went to the
store room under the house, took a few things from there and
told the negroes to go in and take the rest;—which they did,
cleaning out the store room and meat room. There were a
great many things there for Aunt Bet had moved over her
provisions. The plantation negroes took about twenty bushels of
salt; twenty of rice; fifteen of grist, besides several jars of
lard, molasses; all of Hennie's soap, a box of Pineland crockery
and a good many other things. They left us with one quart
of salt in the house and would not bring any of it back, until
Pa stated the case to a <hi rend="italics">white Yankee</hi>, the next day and he
went around and made them bring some of it back. When
the negro soldiers first went to the store room they sent for
Grand Pa. It made our blood curdle to hear our aged relative
spoken to in the manner they did. We were all in the hall
and could hear everything that went on below. After some
very impudent language we heard a gun click. I will never
forget that moment as long as I live. The wretch had his gun
pointed at Grand Pa, and though we found out afterwards that
they did not dare to take life, we did not know it at the time.
After this they called up the negroes and told them they were
free, and if they worked for Grand Pa again they would shoot
them. They then went off with three horses, a wagon and a
buggy. They told the negroes that the army would be through
the next day to take our clothes and other things. Three of
us sat up in the hall for the rest of the night, and though the
others retired to their rooms there was rest for no one. It
must have been too mortifying to poor Grand Pa for his negroes
to behave as they did, taking the bread out of our mouths. I
thought better of them than that. I have attempted to describe
that dreadful night, but nothing can come up to the
<pb id="jerv33" n="33"/>
reality. The next morning everything looked so desolate that it
made us feel sad, most of the house servants came in crying, and
said they were willing to do for us, but were afraid. Of course we
would not put them in any danger, so sent them all off. We sat
down to breakfast to a plate of hominy and cold corn bread that
had been cooked the day before for one of our soldiers. The very
night before we had sat down to an elaborate supper;—such
are the fortunes of war! We cleaned up the house and cooked
dinner, looking all the time for our <hi rend="italics">friends</hi> for such we
considered the officers. Just as our dinner was put on the
table a party rode up; we were so glad to see them that we
all went in the piazza. The officer came forward and bowed very
politely. Pa then told him how we had been treated the night
before and asked what guarantee we would have against such
treatment in the future.</p>
        <p>Capt. Hurlbut who was in command of the party said that the
black soldiers had no authority to come without an officer and if
found, they would be punished. He said that Gen'l. Potter would
be along soon and we might get a protection from him, but
afterwards he said that he would write a paper which might do us
good, and certainly would do no harm. I do not remember the
words; but, the sense of it was, that we had very wisely remained
at home, while many had flocked to other parts of the
Confederacy. He said that everything had already been taken
from us, and he would advise that we would not be further
molested. He then spoke to the negroes, told them they were free
and could either go away or stay at home, but if they remained on
the place, they must work, for no one could live without working.
He told them they would be better off if they stayed at home.</p>
        <p>Soon after Col. Hartwell and staff arrived. They all agreed in
saying that the marauders would be punished and the Colonel
signed the paper. One of his staff got quite familiar; played with
Aunt Ria's baby, little Maria, and ended by kissing her. We laugh
and tell the baby she has caught a Yankee beau, and she always
laughs and seems to enjoy the joke. In a very short time Gen'l
Potter and his staff came up in the piazza. Then the army
commenced passing through the yard,
<pb id="jerv34" n="34"/>
about three regiments of infantry, one white and two colored
passed through, besides artillery and cavalry. Each one stopped
<hi rend="italics">(sic)</hi> and the men ran in every direction after poultry. They
marched the colored regiments right by the piazza; I suppose as
an insult to us. The negroes were collected in the yard and
cheered them on, Hennie<ref id="ref86" n="86" rend="sc" target="note86" targOrder="U">1</ref>
 and Sister<ref id="ref87" n="87" rend="sc" target="note87" targOrder="U">2</ref> 
asked the General if he
could not leave us a guard that night, but, he said there was no
use; his army did not straggle, and that he could not leave a guard
at every place he passed. The General did not make a favorable
impression on us;<ref id="ref88" n="88" rend="sc" target="note88" targOrder="U">1</ref>
 he was very short in his manner, but his staff
were very polite. One of them told us to try the General again.</p>
        <p>You must not be too surprised at our staying out in the piazza
with so many men, for there were a great many of us to keep
company, and then we had never seen such a sight in our
lives before. The last of the army had not left the yard before we
saw the General returning; he said he had determined to take up
his headquarters here that night. We were all of course, delighted
for we could not have been better guarded. They had the parlor
for their sitting room, and one chamber for the General. The
wagon train camped just in front of the house, and two regiments
in the field in front. There was a sentinel at the front and one at
the back door all

It would appear that General Potter made an even less favorable
impression at Otranto, in St. James', Goose Creek, the home of Philip
Johnstone Percher.
“As it was then near midnight we decided to go to bed, and mother said
she would go down in the morning and request that a written protection be
furnished us, as this had been suggested by the quiet-looking officer, our
protector of the afternoon before. Therefore, as early as possible she did so, but
General Potter received her very shortly, and only replied, 
‘Your husband is in
the Rebel army.’ She replied, ‘it was our desire 
that he should leave us, and I am
glad he is not here, for if he had been I suppose he would have
 been shot.’
“He replied, ‘you talk like a fool when you say that,’ and turned off;
when mother said, ‘If that is your opinion, I have the more
 need of protection’.”

night. The camp fires looked very pretty at night. Did we ever
imagine that Pooshee would be headquarters for a Yankee army?
About two hundred head of poultry and a great many sheep were
killed; the negroes' own did not escape! We recognized one of the
prisoners (that our scouts had here the first of the week) driving a
cart, and Lieut. Bright and his men were prisoners that night in
the wash room, one of them asked to be allowed to speak to
some of the girls who were at the back door; he seemed to be a
gentleman.</p>
        <p>During the course of the next day soldiers were continually
passing through. Our protection paper was of great use, for we
were not molested again and from that day to this 9th of March
we have been in comparative quiet.</p>
        <p>Wantoot<ref id="ref89" n="89" rend="sc" target="note89" targOrder="U">2</ref> 
house has been burned, also seven unoccupied
houses in Pineville. Some of the residents there were shamefully
treated, even their clothes taken from them. Uncle Rene was
among the fortunate ones; he only had a ham stolen from his
house but all of his poultry. They went into the house at
Woodboo, though a Mrs. Williams was living there to protect it,
opened every drawer and box in the house; dressed themselves in
Uncle Thomas's and the boys' new clothes, leaving their old ones
behind.</p>
        <p>At Northampton they were told by the negroes that a good
many things were hid in the house, so made a thorough search.
They actually threatened to hang Mr. Jervey, and had the rope
brought. For some time they had been told (that treasure?) had
been buried. The people about here would not have suffered near
as much if it had not been for these negroes, in every case they
have told where things have been hidden and they did most of the
stealing. The negroes here have behaved worse than any I have
heard of yet.</p>
        <p>Daddy Sandy is as faithful as ever. He is sorry that the
Yankees have been here. George still comes about the house, but
does not do much. Daddy Billy, who we all thought so much of,
has not come in since they were made free. He pretends to be
hurt because Hennie told him he could go if he wanted to.
Hennie's maid Annette has taken herself off.

        <p>We have to do our own cooking now, and you don't know
how nicely we do it. * * * * * We take it by turns to cook dinner
in the pantry, two going together every day. * * * I have not
touched my needle for a week; would you believe that? The field
negroes are in a dreadful state; they will not work, but either roam
the country, or sit in their houses. At first they all said they were
going, but have changed their minds now. Pa has a plan to
propose to them by which they are to pay Grand Pa so much for
the hire of the land and houses; but they will not come up to hear
it. I do not see how we are to live in this country without any rule
or regulation. We are afraid now to walk outside of
 the gate. * * * * *</p>
        <p>We have just heard a report that Charlie Porcher has been
taken prisoner in a fight near Aiken, and fear it is true. Do let me
tell you a smart trick of Cephas, Grand Pa's carpenter! It is
worthy of the Yankees. Before (the minds of the) Moorfield
negroes had been poisoned, he went there and told the servant
Robert that Aunt Ria had sent him for a cart, five turkeys and a
sheep. He then came here at night, took up his wife Adela and
traveled off to Charleston. One of Aunt Ria's negroes who had
always been sick got one mule from Moorfield, another mule and
carriage from some other place, went to Pinopolis and took all of
Mr. Stevens's<ref id="ref90" n="90" rend="sc" target="note90" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
books. The next day he went for the piano. He
told some of the negroes that he had been playing on it already.
The negroes are in the most lawless and demoralized state
imaginable. If this is what the Yankees intended they have made
their work complete. We have to keep everything under lock and
key, and can call nothing our own now.</p>
        <p>Grand Pa seems completely broken down, tho' he tries to
keep up. It must be too hard for one of his age to have everything 
so changed from what he has been accustomed to all of his
life.</p>
        <p>The day that the Yankees left here, George brought in an
envelope which he found in the prison (the wash-house). It was
directed to “Miss Carrie Cribbs,” Tuscaloosa, Ala. On

the back was a Confederate stamp, and inside a blank sheet of
paper folded. At first we did not think anything of it; but the idea
soon struck Aunt Bet that it was left here with an object, which
was that we should write and let the young lady know what had
become of him. We heard afterward that one of the prisoners'
name was “Cribbs,” so that settled all doubts we had on the
subject. We will send the letter off the first opportunity we hear
of, tho' I can't say when that will be, for we are entirely cut off
from the world and almost entirely from neighborhood news.</p>
        <p>March 10. We received notes from White Hall and Sarrazins
and also a letter from Alice Palmer, quite a treat. The White Hall
negroes behaved shamefully; they rushed into the house; tore
down the curtains, carried off bedding, blankets and trunks, and
are grumbling now that they have not enough. We hear that one
man asked Cousin Marianne<ref id="ref91" n="91" rend="sc" target="note91" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
to step out and take a dance, that
they were on equality now.</p>
        <p>March 11. Uncle Rene dined here to-day. It was really
refreshing to see some one out of the house. He says there is a
report that Sherman has been defeated with heavy loss, and is
going down to Georgetown. I fear it is too good to be true. Uncle
Rene also brought the news that fighting was going on at Blue
Hole, Uncle Charles Snowden's place. I suppose it can only be
a skirmish. How composedly we can be talking of fighting in our
very midst!</p>
        <p>One item of news, which I must not forget to tell you, is that
Newport has taken the cooking, and we are all ladies again.</p>
        <p>March 13th. <sic corr="Dr.">Dr</sic> Waring
<ref id="ref92" n="92" rend="sc" target="note92" targOrder="U">2</ref> came in
 to-day and told us the
particulars of the affair at Blue Hole. On Thursday four Yankee
negroes, with a good many plantation negroes, armed,. went to
Moorfield. There they found a quantity of wine. A good many men
joined them from there and Cedar Grove, mounted on anything
they could find, and in a drunken state they all rode up the Parish.
When they reached Blue Hole, Charlie Snowden, who was there
on a visit, went off and informed our scouts. They killed two or
three of the negroes,

and took several prisoners, which I do not think they kept long.
After they left, the negro soldiers made the negroes move
everything out of the house, and the family had to go into the
kitchen. The next day our scouts came up again to assist Aunt
Harrie<ref id="ref93" n="93" rend="sc" target="note93" targOrder="U">3</ref> in 
recovering her things; but, she begged them to go
away; that they had been the cause of her trouble, so they left in
not at all a good humor, and we have heard nothing more. I hope
young Charlie Snowden has succeeded in getting out of the way.
Several of the people about here have put up the white flag,
because the Yankees told them it would be a sign that they had
already been visited. Our scouts did not like it; they said it looked
as if the country had submitted, so they have all been taken down.
I am so glad we never had one up.</p>
        <p>March 14th. We all went to Northampton this morning to pay
a visit; quite an era in our own monotonous lives. Pa rode on
horse-back and we closed up the ranks on foot.</p>
        <p>March 15th. Aunt Ria left us this morning to stay a while at
Woodlawn. She went in the buggy with the baby and Maum Mary;
the two boys followed in the cart.</p>
        <p>March 16th. Dr. White<ref id="ref94" n="94" rend="sc" target="note94" targOrder="U">*</ref> 
dined here to-day; he had just
crossed the river. He had not seen a paper for some time, so, of
course, could not tell us much news. Sherman had not been
defeated and was avoiding a battle.</p>
        <p>March 17th. Drs. White and Waring paid visits here to-day. We
are not as much cut off as we expected at first. Dr. Waring told
us he heard that the oath of allegiance was to be offered to every
man in the country. This is the worst news we have heard of for
some time. Pa and Harry will try and get out of the way, but
Grand Pa will be compelled to take it.</p>
        <p>March 18th. Mr. Cain and Anna Maria were here to-day;
the old gentleman seems to feel his loss very much.</p>
        <p>March 20th. * * * * This morning Pa went to Woodlawn to
try and make arrangements for carrying us all to Aiken. He has
succeeded in hiring three mules, and the present plan is that we
are to start on Wednesday in a wagon,—Rather a novel style of
making the trip! We are all anxious now to go, but

hate so much leaving Grand Pa, and the rest of the family,

on the banks of the Santee, and coming this way in great force
which made Pa decide not to go on Wednesday. * * * * *</p>
        <p>March 22nd. We heard to-day from Nina
<ref id="ref95" n="95" rend="sc" target="note95" targOrder="U">1</ref> and Cousin James
Wilson. * * * Nina writes on the 16th of March from
Winnsboro. She had met the enemy there and had not lost much.
* * * a good many houses were burned in Winnsboro, also the
Episcopal Church, and they were kept in constant fear. Cousin
James and family lost everything by fire in Columbia—They had
to spend one night in the woods with Nana's
<ref id="ref96" n="96" rend="sc" target="note96" targOrder="U">1</ref> baby only ten days
old. How much some people have suffered. We have every
cause to be thankful, for we have suffered very little in
comparison to others.</p>
        <p>We also heard to-day of several battles in which we been
victorious; that France had recognized the Confederacy and the
United States had declared war against Mexico,—if it could
only be true! We cannot help feeling hopeful anyhow.</p>
        <p>Dr. Waring mentioned that a few Yankees had landed, but
had gone back to their gun boats, so the Aiken cavalcade is to go
off in the morning.</p>
        <p>March 23rd. The Club House<ref id="ref97" n="97" rend="sc" target="note97" targOrder="U">2</ref> 
came down with a crash this
evening, or rather the frame, for the Yankees had nearly stripped
it of boards and the negroes finished it.</p>
        <p>March 24th. The caravan started for Aiken to-day. The
negroes are behaving a great deal better now on most of
plantations; they have commenced working again, and
of them that went to town have come back, which I think
will have a very good effect on the others. Our scouts have
done a great deal of good in making the negroes afraid to go out.</p>
        <p>March 25th. Harbin house was burned yesterday about 2:00
o'clock by accident we hear. We have heard no particulars,
or what has become of the family. Mr. Myers (the overseer)
returned home to-day to join the scouts. He reports that
Sherman has been defeated in N. C. and four thousand

prisoners taken. He was perfectly surprised to see the state of
things here, so different from what they are on the river. We feel
very anxious about Henry,<ref id="ref98" n="98" rend="sc" target="note98" targOrder="U">3</ref> 
for Mr. Myers left him a week ago in
Chester quite sick. He was in a cotton house as he could not get
private lodgings. We saw a Charleston Courier of 21st of March.
The Yankees claim the victories of all the battles that have been
fought lately, and say the Rebels are nearly done up! That
remains to be proved.</p>
        <p>March 26th. This day will long be remembered by the people
of Pineville. The Regulators<ref id="ref99" n="99" rend="sc" target="note99" targOrder="U">1</ref>
 had just returned from Mt. Pleasant
with a supply of arms and ammunition—Last night they sent to
several of the gentlemen and told them they would hang them the
next day, but our scouts surprised them this morning and 27 were
killed, eleven right off, and the others in the course of the day.
One man was taken who told where their ammunition was
hidden, and then he was dispatched. Several made their escape in
the woods but the ring-leaders were killed;—15 were killed from
Capt. Gourdin's place. Our force was 56 men; that of the negroes
was not known, though supposed to be less. We hear that Col.
Ferguson<ref id="ref100" n="100" rend="sc" target="note100" targOrder="U">2</ref> 
is on his way with 1,500 men, and Major Jenkins with
six companies. They will soon put things straight again.</p>
        <p>March 30th. * * * Mr. Stevens arrived to-day. He does
not appear to think anything of the behavior of his flock;
but I know he must feel mortified and disappointed. He will
remain and preach for us as long as it is safe for him to do
so. To-day has been a regular mail day. Mr. Stevens brought
letters from Nina, Mrs. Sams and Auntie,
<ref id="ref101" n="101" rend="sc" target="note101" targOrder="U">3</ref> * * * one from
Uncle Charlie Snowden saying he had taken possession of our
farm, and also mentioning that some of Wheeler's men had
broken into the house, taken all of the carpets, blankets and
provisions. * * * This evening Hennie received a long note from
Cousin Marianne Porcher; she mentioned that Hardee had
been repulsed, but that after that Johnston had defeated Sherman
taking 4,000 prisoners.

        <p>Press Smith was wounded in both legs, and his brother
Porcher in the head; both were doing well.; Ravenel Macbeth
was wounded and a prisoner. We have heard nothing of our other
friends. Cousin Marianne says she heard from negroes that the
entire Barker family had taken the oath of allegiance and were
preparing to go to the city. We cannot blame them for we do not
know how they were situated. Dr. Motte had refused the oath up
here, but was carried to Charleston, and there he was made to
take it. Mr. Holmes refused to take it and is now a prisoner. I do
not know how true all this is, but we must take it for what it is
worth. I am very thankful that Pa has gotten away and that we
do not live on Cooper river. * * *</p>
        <p>March 31st. The Northampton people paid a visit here to-day.
Willie Jervey is at home for a short time. We heard a report
to-day that Charleston was blockaded by fifty French vessels and
that the Yankees were preparing to evacuate the place. It came
from a man about here who had gone down to the Gunboat to
take the oath of allegiance.</p>
        <p>April 1st. The negroes' freedom was brought to a close to-day.
During the morning a party of our scouts rode up and asked
if Grand Pa wished them to do anything for him. Grand Pa told
them that one of his negroes had been seen with a gun but had
said that it belonged to one of Uncle Rene's men who had gone to
town, so the scouts went off. We were very uneasy when we
saw them coming, fearing that they might be Yankees. About
dinner time another party came up, Edward Dennis, Mr.
McTureous and several others. They requested the negroes be
called up, and told them they were not free, but slaves, and would
be until they died; that the Yankees had no right to free them, and
that they were to go to work as they had always done with a
driver;<ref id="ref102" n="102" rend="sc" target="note102" targOrder="U">*</ref> 
that they would be here every two or three days to see
that they worked, and the first one caught out without a ticket
would be killed. Then they demanded guns from two of them and
said they were to be forthcoming. Poor deluded creatures! Their
friends the Yankees have done them more harm than good; this
day month their freedom was proclaimed. One report to-day is
that the
<note id="note102" n="102" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref102">1.
 A negro under overseer.</note>
<pb id="jerv42" n="42"/>
Union soldiers in Savannah united with the citizens and
massacred 4,000 blacks on account of their outrageous behavior.
Another is that the Gun Boats have left the Santee and the one
on Cooper river has gone lower down. About dark after we had
shut up the house we heard a loud rap at the front door and much
to our surprise it proved to be your father (Mr. Heyward). He
had come all the way from Aiken on horseback to carry Aunt
Bet back.</p>
        <p>April 2nd. We have been permitted the privilege of again
meeting at church to offer our thanks to God for his manifold
mercies to us during this terrible time. Nearly every one in 
the Parish succeeded in getting there, mules supplying the
places of all horses that had been taken. It was very pleasant
to meet our friends, whom we had not seen for six weeks.</p>
        <p>April 4th. Aunt Bet started to-day for Aiken with a carriage,
two wagons, one cart, one donkey cart, two cows and an
outrider,—quite a cavalcade! We heard today that two of the
ring leaders from Pineville went to the Gunboat and told how
they had been treated, whereon the officers had them put in
irons and sent to Charleston, and told them, if they had only
known it, they would have sent a company to help the white
men. We received numerous letters from Aiken this morning
by the return wagons. I am sorry to say that Wheeler's men have
done us more damage than the Yankees. I did not mind it at
first when I thought they had only taken things needed, but I do
blame them very much for their wanton destruction of property
that they ought to protect. It is a shame and they ought to be
exposed.</p>
        <p>April 6th. The scouts were here again to-day under Lieut.
Pettus.<ref id="ref103" n="103" rend="sc" target="note103" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
Charlie Snowden has joined them. Hennie got them to
go to Wampee and send her maid Anette home.

“The Confederate scouts who formed our patrol and police were 
wild and irresponsible men, although brave and honorable; their captain,
a son of Governor Pettus of Mississippi <hi rend="italics">(sic)</hi>, a youth of nineteen.
Except for them the country between us and Charleston after its fall
was at the mercy of bands of stragglers who burned and pillaged
recklessly in the lower neighborhood, but seldom came so far as our
plantations. (p. 56).
* * * * “At last the time came when our faithful band of Confederate
scouts were recalled. In fact, the war was over, and I suppose they
really had no longer any recognized position, but were only
bushwhackers; indeed, liable to be hung or shot if caught. Therefore,
it was determined to give them a farewell party at Mrs. Palmer's
house Springfield—even if there were some risk in it—and Deasey
and I were invited to spend the night. I was quite pleased with
myself in a dress I had made out of an old pair of white window
curtains. There were about thirty scouts at the party, and their
horses were picketed close to the piazza; their guns stacked in the
corners of the large bare drawing room, and they danced with
their pistols stuck in their top-boots which give them a very
dashing look.” 1P. 63). (From Mrs. E. A. Coxe's “Memories,”&amp;c.)</note></p>
        <pb id="jerv43" n="43"/>
        <p>April 8th. We have had another visit to-day from the
Yankees. Before breakfast we saw smoke in the direction of
Somerset, and the negroes told us they had heard a drum and fife
in the night. We thought it was imagination until a servant from
Wantoot told us that the Yankees had burnt Somerset house and
were coming on. Soon after we saw them coming through the
field, and in a very short time the house was full of black
Yankees. I remained in the hall to see what they would take
there, and to keep a watch on our room door. The first one that
came into the room asked for fire arms. I told him they had all
been taken. The next one asked for silver. I had no idea of
showing him, so told him I was not the lady of the house. He
made no reply but went on looking. A number then came in, and
the silver was soon found and carried off, 40 small pieces of table
silver and soup ladle; these, and one candle stick were the only
things taken from the hall. Grand Pa lost all of his clothes that he
had out. A box was broken open, some sheets and table cloths
taken, the rest flung over the floor interspersed with broken eggs.
The safe door was broken open and the ham taken. Several other
rooms were entered and things taken; but, I am thankful to say
our room was left untouched. All of the horses were taken. Gen'l
Hartwell took good care not to come up until the darkies had left.
He told his Captain to go and see if he <hi rend="italics">could</hi> 
get the silver and
one horse back, which, of course, we knew he did not <hi rend="italics">mean</hi> him
to do. The object of their visit was to catch the scouts. They said
we had brought all of this on ourselves for encouraging the
scouts.</p>
        <p>Uncle Rene and Uncle William have both been taken prisoners
and we hear, are to be carried to Charleston. They took the
latter to get information from him,—so they say, but
<pb id="jerv44" n="44"/>
we think they took him because he had entertained the scouts.
Uncle Rene had to put himself under the protection of the General
as there was a conspiracy detected among the black troops to
come back that night and kill him. The Yankees went to Mexico
this evening and I suppose will visit all the places up there.</p>
        <p>April 10th. Of course there was no service yesterday. Dr.
Waring paid a visit and told us that Mr. Stevens was still in the
Parish, but keeping close. This morning several of the negro men
came to Grand Pa and asked to be allowed to stay here and work;
they would do anything he told them. The Yankees told them to <hi rend="italics">go
with them</hi>, but they said they did not want to go. Two of the boys
from here have joined the (U. S.?) Army.</p>
        <p>April 11th. * * * * Cousin Mazyck Porcher
<ref id="ref104" n="104" rend="sc" target="note104" targOrder="U">1</ref> has been taken
prisoner. Mexico house and all the out buildings have been
burned. Last accounts of the enemy they were at Eutaw Springs.</p>
        <p>April 12th. Uncle Rene and Uncle Wm. returned home to-
day. We were too thankful to hear of their release. They were
carried as far as Eutaw, and then told to “Go Home.”</p>
        <p><hi rend="italics">Woodlawn, April 14th.</hi> Uncle Rene drove Sister home, and
I came back here to take her place. Uncle Rene and Uncle
William had a most dreadful experience on the ride from Pineville
to Mexico with the Army. At one time they were guarded by only
one black soldier, and they could hear others all around trying to
bribe their guard to give them up to be killed; but the guard,
though a darky, was above bribing.</p>

Summerton have both been burnt to the ground; of course we do
not believe either of them.</p>

        <head>REMINISCENCES OF MRS. MARY RHODES (WARING)
HENAGAN
<lb/>
<hi rend="italics">(Written in December, 1917, to be Read at a Meeting of The
Girls of the Sixties, Columbia, S. C.)</hi></head>
        <p>The evacuation of Charleston, crossing of our soldiers over
the Santee river, burning the bridge behind them, left the lower
part of the State in the power of the Yankees.</p>
        <p>My home was in this deserted region. We knew that our
enemies were all around and had visited in no kind manner many
of the neighboring plantations, but Chelsea, our plantation and
winter home, seemed to be exempted. We learned afterward that
this was due to the devotion of our slaves.</p>
        <p>At last the Yankees did come. Our home, a big old colonial
house built in 1714, was packed with refugees run from the coast
from their homes earlier in the war. My mother directed each of
us to go to my grandmother's room as soon as we saw the
Yankees coming, and meet them in a body there. My
grandmother had passed her eightieth mile-stone and was old for
her years.</p>
        <p>As day after day passed and no Yankees came we felt more
at ease. On one particular day in February, 1865, the young folks
were sitting in a room removed from the main body of the house,
one reading aloud and the others knitting, when my sister-in-law
put her head in at the door and exclaimed, “Girls, the Yankees.”
There was a rush for the house and my grandmother's room. Just
as we reached it the house was surrounded by an excited crowd
of men calling for the Confederate soldier they had seen enter the
house. There was no soldier there and they were so informed, but
they insisted there was one for they had seen him. Their officers
had some trouble in keeping them from searching the house. One
officer stood at the front door with my father, who was the
<pb id="jerv47" n="47"/>
physician of the neighborhood, Dr. Morton Waring, and the other
at the back door with my mother and her sister. Just then the
excitement was relieved by one of our young negro men walking
up with a military cap on.</p>
        <p>There was no soldier with us just then, only a boy not yet in
service.</p>
        <p>Our young horses were gone, for the negro boys had taken
them all into the swamp a half mile away as soon as the Yankees
were in sight. Some of the soldiers were anxious to take my
father's horses that he used for his practice, but this Captain
Hulbert, one of their officers, would not permit, telling his men
they might need the services of a doctor and he could not get to
them if his horses were gone.</p>
        <p>Captain Hulbert told my father that his negroes had represented
him as such a kind friend to them that the general in command
had directed him not to enter his house or permit any
outrages, only to free the negroes, as they thought they were
slaves until each plantation was visited and the negroes told they
were free.</p>
        <p>But the soldiers were not satisfied and meant to have
something if possible, so they surrounded the smoke house and
told one of our negro men to go up and throw out the meat. Of
course he obeyed. As my father and Captain Hulbert walked
quickly up one of our negroes stepped up to the captain and said,
“Please don't let your men take our meat. This belongs to us
negroes.” This was not strictly true as the meat was for us all, but
it had the desired effect. The meat was left.</p>
        <p>At this time when we were so anxious and worried our
negroes showed themselves true friends by concealing our
valuables. Different ones would come at night and offer to take
anything we would entrust to them and hide it for us. In this way
many valuables were entrusted to them which were taken care of
and returned after all was safe, in every case under cover of
night. Our silver of course was buried by members of the family.</p>
        <p>During this same period we were surprised one day by
seeing a buggy coming up with two men in it, one wrapped in a
blanket, the other, his son, driving. These were Dr. Peter
<pb id="jerv48" n="48"/>
Snowden and his son Charlie. When they drew up in front of the
house and asked for my mother she went to them at once and
was accosted by one of these gentlemen, both of whom she knew
well. He was one of the scouts and had been wounded and taken
refuge at the next plantation, but the Yankees hearing of his
hiding place were in pursuit of him, so he came to see if my father
could help him. My father was not at home, but my mother never
hesitated. She made a bed in a small room where my father had
hidden much corn and other provisions, and placed a large press
in front of the door which it entirely concealed. In this store room
our scout was cared for until he was able to go further. While
arrangements were being made for him my grandmother called
my mother to her and said, “Anne, do you know what you are
doing, you have many helpless ones in your care and this piece
of kindness may cost you your home?” My mother replied, “It is
my duty to protect him. I will do it. God will do the rest.” When
my father reached home he commended her action.</p>
        <p>If the Yankees ever knew the wounded scout was with us
they certainly made no sign indicating they possessed such
knowledge.</p>
        <p>There were skirmishes about in our neighborhood between the
northern troops passing through on their way to Columbia,
Camden and other points, and our scouts. These were men
sent back to protect the helpless ones left behind. They used a
kind of guerilla warfare, but sometimes they had a real open
skirmish. One of these was on a plantation near our home and my
father was sent for to dress the wound of one soldier, I think a
Yankee, another having been killed in the same fight. The
mistress<ref id="ref105" n="105" rend="sc" target="note105" targOrder="U">1</ref> 
of this plantation had two young nieces with her for
companionship. Her husband, of course, was away, and her
children very small. The older of these girls carried a pistol in
her pocket for protection. One day the pistol discharged its contents
into her thigh. Only a flesh wound resulted, but it alarmed the
family very much. My father was called and after making her
comfortable he persuaded her aunt to let him take her home with
him. She improved rapidly and was
<note id="note105" n="105" rend="sc" place="foot" anchored="yes" target="ref105">1. 
Mrs. Edwin DuBose (Harbin.)</note>
<pb id="jerv49" n="49"/>
soon able to walk around. Then she thought best to return to
her aunt. We had not seen or heard of any Yankees in the
neighborhood for several days so my father thought we might
venture the trip of two miles in our carriage. My sister and I went
with her. As we were crossing the Santee canal about a mile
from our house we saw some soldiers on the bridge. Tom, our
coachman, drove quietly on, but as soon as we crossed we were
halted and our carriage surrounded by blue coats who were rather
inquisitive. We had driven right up to a long line of marching
Yankees. A portion of Hartwell's army on its way to the up
country. Some of them recognized our friend, having seen her at
Harbin, the home of her aunt, so accosted her with “Halloo Leize
and Sallie. There are Leize and Sallie.” They had mistaken me
for her sister. My sister in a quiet manner and voice asked to
speak to their commanding officer. This caused them to stand
back while one went for the officer. After a while, which seemed
much longer than it really was, the officer (I believe a colonel)
rode up and asked her business. She told him we were on our
way to a neighboring plantation to make a friendly visit and return,
and asked his protection for the trip. He told her he was obliged to
detain us where we were for a time, but we should be protected.
That as he had to march on with his command he would leave us
in charge of a guard. This he did at once, so that in a very short
time our guards were the only soldiers in sight except one that
was sent back with a dispatch to the Major of the fifty-fifth.
While he was waiting for the major and his men to come up he sat
at the root of a large pine and played beautiful music on a very
sweet flute that he had stolen from one of the plantations. I had
heard that flute so often, it belonged to Rene Jervey. As we were
circumstanced it was better to assume a friendliness of manner
with our guard who was a very polite Canadian named Alfred
Brett. He said he was only fighting for his pay, that he did not
care which side whipped.</p>
        <p>After listening to his yarns for some hours my sister asked
him why he was detaining us and how long he meant to keep us
there. He replied “I must keep you until General Hartwell's
division passes. He has many regiments of colored troops and if
you should meet them I could not answer for the consequences,
<pb id="jerv50" n="50"/>
they are coming by the same road you are going.” My
sister said “But if you will allow us, we will return straight home
by the same road we came.” He agreed to this and told Tom to
hitch up, which Tom did with the sorry horse he gave in place of
our beautiful one he stole. He did not wish the other so let us
keep him. This certainly gave us a pair of wretchedly matched
horses, one large gray and the other a small red hack that loped
all the time in harness that was so large it could scarcely be kept
on.</p>
        <p>While guarding us Mr. Brett had an eye to self. He asked Tom
very particularly about one of my father's sulky horses, a very
fine iron gray named “Beauregard,” where he was kept
and so on, and said he wanted him. Tom suspecting mischief
consulted with our foreman as soon as we reached home and
between them they determined to save the horse, and lost no time
about it. They took my father into their confidence.</p>
        <p>Not long after we reached home and before the excitement
caused by our story had subsided my father came driving slowly
home behind an old frame of bones in a much bruised horse hide.
They had met him at Woodlawn plantation where he had gone
professionally and taken his horse. Zeleka would not stand
haltered, so we hoped she would come home. Sure enough that
night after she had eaten her oats and all was quiet she slipped
her halter and started homeward. She had gone quite a long way
when one of our scouts caught her. He used her and took care of
her until the troubles were over, then returned her to my father.</p>
        <p>Early the morning after our capture the whole plantation was
thrown into wild excitement. During the night the stable door was
unhinged and Beauregard taken, the news spreading through the
neighborhood. The doctor could not visit his patients, both of his
horses having been taken. Other persons lost their horses too, so
he could only go as best he could to the urgent cases. Then the
weary weeks of waiting, we could hear nothing of my brother. All
we knew was he was with General Young's brigade wherever that
was. Some of the men from St. John's Parish had gotten home
but none had seen or heard of him. The war was over. The army
disbanded, and we were still waiting. One memorable day about
the middle
<pb id="jerv51" n="51"/>
of April we were gathered in the parlor trying to be cheerful and
busying ourselves with mending when our butler stepped into the
room and said in a most joyous voice “Mars John.” O, such a rush
for the front door where my mother ahead of the rest had her
soldier boy in her arms. It was a happy house-hold that night that
gathered around the family altar. Some time after this we were
again gathered in the parlor. This time chattering of how we were
going to make our little serve for a great deal, when we were
attracted by the neighing of a horse at the fence near by and
looking up saw Beauregard. What a welcome he received. Tom
thought it safe for him to come home so released him from his
hiding place in the swamp.</p>

        <p>Captain: The following is respectfully submitted as the report of
the expedition to the Santee River under my command:</p>
        <p>In pursuance of orders received from Brig. Gen. John P. Hatch, I
caused, on the 5th of April, the Fifty-fourth New York Veteran
Volunteers and Fifty-fifth Massachusetts Volunteers to cross
from James Island and assemble with a section of the Third New
York Artillery at the Four Mile Tavern on the State Road. Starting
early on the morning of the 6th inst., I reached Goose Creek at
nightfall, and went into bivouac eighteen miles from this city. From
this point I sent back for the surplus ammunition. On information
from a contraband that there were from thirty to forty Rebel
cavalry at a place called Dean Hall I sent, at 5:00 P. M. two
companies to attempt to surprise this party. During the night I was
notified that these two companies had been misled by the guide,
and were awaiting orders near the Twenty-Five Mile House on the
State Road. April 7 at 7:00 A. M. I started to Mr. Cain's, near
Black Oak, Santee Canal, some twenty-two miles, sending a
detachment to Biggin's Bridge, who rejoined the column at night,
together with the two companies from the Twenty-Five Mile
House. Thirty cavalry were in my front having gone from Dean
Hall around my flank. I sent two companies to deploy and
surround the house in which they were reported to be, and surprise
them. The enemy, however, got notice of our approach in season
to escape, leaving several blankets and guns, and their supper
ready cooked. Mr. Cain had several sons in the Rebel army; he
had entertained those who had just gone, and had recently given
them a grand dinner; his barn accidentally, or by some unknown
incendiary, was burned.</p>
        <pb id="jerv53" n="53"/>
        <p>Marched at 7:00 A. M. on the 8th of April, and halted at
noon in Pineville for dinner. Reached Mexico at nightfall, and
went into bivouac there. Distance marched, about twenty miles.</p>
        <p>The people in Pineville implored our protection from the
negroes, who were arming themselves and threatening the lives
of their masters. Mr. Reno <hi rend="italics">(sic)</hi> Ravenel requested me to take
him with me to save his life. The negroes flocked in from all
sides.</p>
        <p>At Mexico I found that Mr. Mazyck Porcher had made he
house the headquarters of the Rebels in the vicinity. While I was
on his grounds his property was protected, but was burned to the
ground immediately on my leaving, I think, by his field hands.</p>
        <p>April 9, started for Eutaw Creek, thirteen miles distant. Some
skirmishing occurred; but dispersed the enemy with a few shells.</p>
        <p>From Eutaw Creek I sent two companies to Nelson's Ferry,
who sent me word at night that General Potter had gone up the
Santee in transports the day before, and that they had burned
forty or fifty bales of cotton that night on the opposite shore.
During the night a contraband reported to me that General Potter
had encountered the enemy at Manningsville, and had had a
skirmish there. He was advancing, however, to Sumterville. A
certain Lieutenant Pettus, commanding some Rebel cavalry in our
vicinity, came in on a flag of truce at my request. I told this officer
that he would not quarter in or near house or fire from houses, if
he cared to save them from destruction. I also sent by this officer
a note to General Ferguson, suggesting the propriety of his
recalling his scouts from attempting to coerce the slaves to labor.</p>
        <p>April 10. Sent parties to Vance's Ferry and vicinity to gather
corn and rice together to feed the contrabands which had
congregated together on the march. Marched at 5:00 P. M.,
taking the cross-road to the State Road. At about 10.00 P. M. we
encountered twenty-five or thirty Rebel cavalry. shots were
exchanged and they disappeared, leaving a gun, some blankets,
and hats, &amp;c.; bivouacked fifteen miles from starting point at
midnight.</p>
        <p>April 11. Marched at daylight down the State Road; found
<pb id="jerv54" n="54"/>
that the bridges over Cypress Swamp were in bad condition, and
was delayed by the falling through of a limber and chest. From
this delay, and my column being encumbered by the train of
refugees, I did not take the Ridgeville Road, which was reported
very heavy, but marched to the Twenty-Five Mile House, and
there bivouacked.</p>
        <p>April 12, marched to Goose Creek, leaving there two
companies and the train of refugees. The rest of my command I
marched to the Four Mile Tavern, where they still remain. The
companies left at Goose Creek have since rejoined them there.</p>

        <p>April 7. The march was continued until the head of the
column arrived within a short distance of Monck's Corner,
when it turned to the left, on the south side of the Santee Canal,
and moved toward Pinopolis, a village of summer residences
similar to Pineville, though smaller. Few families or articles
contraband of war were found there. A detachment

sent from Monck's Corner to the canal and creek bridges on the
Biggin-Church Road, reported no sign of the enemy in that
direction. After marching until after dark, the command
bivouacked, in line of battle, near the house of Mr. Cain, the
artillery in position, and the men sleeping at the foot of their gun
stacks. Squads of cavalry were reported in front and rear, and a
mounted party, in advance of the infantry, were fired on just as
the line for bivouac was formed. The cavalry seen, however, did
not number over twenty-five or thirty; and the report of troops in
line of battle in the front proved to be an error. Mr. Cain's house
and plantation were very fine. He claimed to have made an
agreement with his former slaves, with which they were satisfied.
Whether they were or not, few of them left him at that time.
Many of the trees and fences around the yard were cut to
strengthen the position, but the house and grounds were not
otherwise injured.</p>
        <p>April 8. The line of march was resumed in the early morning,
in a drizzling rain, through the plantations to the Black-Oak Road,
to Pineville, where a halt for dinner was made; thence to Mexico,
to the plantation of W. M. Porcher. As the troops left Cain's
Plantation, the carriage-barn was fired, whether by accident or
design is not known. The fire did not, however, spread to other
buildings.</p>
        <p>At Pineville, all sorts of rumors were current of the cruelties
practiced by the guerilla cavalry, who were said to have shot and
hung many of the negroes in that vicinity. The men of the
Regiment were greatly excited, and effort was necessary to
preserve discipline. It was difficult to trace most of the reports to
their source, but it is to be feared that some of them had too good
foundation. One thing was certain, that a company of negroes had
a fight at Pineville, with a squad of Rebel scouts, under Lieut.
Pettus, in which the latter had been at first defeated, and only
effected their purpose after the arrival of reinforcements.
Alarmed by these stories and events, an exodus of the freed
people commenced at this point, which continued during the
remainder of the expedition, until the refugee-train was far larger
than the rest of the column.</p>
        <p>The Porcher homestead was the most elegant which the
expedition had seen. The house was filled with articles of
<pb id="jerv56" n="56"/>
convenience and luxury, with treasures of art and family relics. It
was situated in a large park, shaded by magnificent trees. The
position was good; and the line was formed for bivouac, the right
at the mansion house, the left beyond that of the overseer, the
out-buildings, over which guards were placed, being in the rear. There
was slight picket-firing during the night, probably, however, at
cattle and hogs. The march was resumed soon after daylight.</p>
        <p>Mr. Porcher was known to have been an original and most
decided Rebel, and he was taken to Charleston as a prisoner; but
his property would not have been destroyed as it was, had he not
in reply to the question of the provost-marshal, “If he had any
wine in his cellars” merely stated that he had not, omitting to say
that he had a large amount in the garret. During the night a quantity
of this liquor reached the mounted men of the escort, and
probably some of the refugees; and by one or the other, while in
liquor, the house and all the outbuildings, except the dwelling of
the overseer which was saved by the exertions of Chaplain
Bowles, who had spent the night there, were set fire to and
destroyed as soon as the guards were withdrawn and the troops
upon the march. As soon as the existence of the wine was
ascertained by the provost-marshal, Capt. Torrey, he destroyed
what remained of it.</p>
